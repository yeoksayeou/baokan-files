### Emergency Measures for Land Transportation: Japanese Government Decides to Implement, Aims for Complete Preparation for Mainland Decisive Battle

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – In response to the inevitable battlefield situation on the mainland, the Japanese Ministry of Transportation, in the cabinet meeting on the 29th of last month, decided on "Emergency Measures for Transportation in Case of Domestic Battlefield," aiming to complete the transportation of food and specific weapons in the short term. At the same time, it will actively promote the evacuation of factories, aiming for complete preparation for the mainland decisive battle. It has now decided on the specific plan for the army, "Implementation Guidelines for Mainland Decisive Battle Transportation," to be vigorously implemented in the next two months regarding national railways, local railways, transportation, and all other aspects of land transportation. Furthermore, to promote implementation and coordination, it was decided to establish a Promotion Headquarters in the ministry and Promotion Branches in each railway bureau. At the same time, a Promotion Team organized by experts from the ministry will be dispatched to each area to promote the work. Given that the success or failure of these implementation guidelines has a significant impact on Japan's mainland decisive battle capability, the Ministry of Transportation hopes for the utmost cooperation from all army employees and related parties.

### 800 Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft Attack Kanto Region; Kinki and Shikoku Also Raided

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 10th: Carrier-based aircraft departing from enemy mobile units this morning have attacked various Japanese air bases in the Kanto region multiple times. As of 1:00 PM, the total number of enemy aircraft that attacked is estimated to be 800.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The American mobile unit suffered a major blow in the Okinawa campaign, losing half of its basic naval strength of aircraft carriers. Recently, it has been actively reorganized and has roughly restored its original state. On the morning of the 10th, it again attacked the Kanto region with carrier-based aircraft. From around 5:10 AM to 1:00 PM, a total of approximately 800 enemy carrier-based aircraft bombed Japanese air bases in the Kanto region multiple times, and some even strafed urban areas. Judging from the enemy's sortie situation this time, the enemy's aircraft carriers probably include those that were damaged in the battles of the Philippines and Okinawa and have been repaired, as well as several mobilized commissioned aircraft carriers. Its strength is roughly a mobile unit based on more than ten aircraft carriers. Therefore, it is expected that carrier-based fighters will continue to come in the air in the next few days.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – A United Press report from Guam states: The powerful aircraft carrier mobile unit of Halsey's Third Fleet has now been deployed in the Pacific, under the command of Lieutenant General Marc Mitscher.

Osaka, 10th (Central News Agency)

Approximately 100 P-51 enemy aircraft from a southern base attacked the Kinki region in three groups from around 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM on the 10th, attacking military facilities and ships near Osaka and Kobe. Details of damage inflicted are omitted.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Approximately 70 enemy B-29 aircraft attacked Sendai City with incendiary bombs at midnight today, continuing for two hours. Consequently, fires broke out in various parts of the city. However, thanks to the enthusiastic rescue efforts of the citizens, they were completely extinguished by around 5:00 AM.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – 280 enemy B-29 aircraft from a southern base, formed into five groups from 9:00 PM on the 9th, dispersed and invaded mainland Japan, attacking Wakayama City, Sakai City, the southern part of Osaka City, and Kochi City with incendiary bombs for as long as five hours. Consequently, fires broke out in Wakayama City and Sakai City, but they were soon extinguished. According to the Central Military District Headquarters, which announced at 10:00 AM on the 10th, the Japanese side had confirmed the results of the battle up to 4:00 AM that morning, accounting for the destruction of seven enemy aircraft and severe damage to thirty-five aircraft. It is hoped that this result will increase.

Nagoya, 10th (Central News Agency) – At around 9:30 PM on the 9th, approximately 120 B-29 aircraft invaded the mainland in formations of about twenty aircraft each. Among them, forty aircraft attacked the vicinity of Yokkaichi, and the main force of seventy aircraft attacked the Gifu City area with incendiary bombs. The remaining enemy aircraft dropped naval mines near Toyama. All enemy aircraft escaped south around 0:00 AM on the 10th. Consequently, fires broke out in Gifu City and Yokkaichi, but they were all extinguished by around 5:00 AM on the same morning.

### Prince Takamatsu Inspects War-Damaged Areas

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since assuming the presidency of the War Disaster Relief Association, His Highness Prince Takamatsu has been enthusiastically handling affairs and is extremely concerned about war victims. At 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, he left the palace with his princess and related personnel to inspect the war disaster relief situation in various parts of Tokyo and the conditions of war-damaged vegetable gardens, and to encourage the war victims.

Japanese Soldiers and Civilians' Hardworking Spirit

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Tokoku, a war correspondent who recently returned from the front lines, stated in his published impressions: His first impression upon returning to his home country was that the war damage and disaster in Japan were not as severe as he had imagined while abroad. The morale of the people was a hundred times higher, with no signs of depression. In particular, the domestic transportation system, despite enemy indiscriminate bombing of cities, was still operating very smoothly, which was beyond his expectations. Currently, there are no problems with land transportation. After the enemy's treacherous attacks on the six major cities, they have recently changed to bombing small and medium-sized cities, with B-29 aircraft carrying out dense incendiary bombing every day. However, it seems that the extent of damage has not yet reached the point of disrupting transportation lines. Because of the recent attacks, the cities along the Sanyo and Tokaido railway lines have been subjected to the enemy's bombing. From the train windows, the devastation in cities such as Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, and the Kyoto area (between Tokyo and Yokohama) is a definite fact. However, in cities such as Tokyo, which have suffered from war disasters, the general public has been able to maintain their positions and continue their original work without delay. The urban population has not decreased by a large amount, and reconstruction work is gradually underway. It is heard that victims of disasters in the cities are allowed to use transportation facilities for free, and unnecessary citizens have already been evacuated. Residents who remain are provided with more food rations by the authorities than usual. The enemy has never seen confusion arising from war disasters. The signs of bombing are extremely severe, and the number of people who have lost their homes must be very large, but they do not engage in sentimentality and are extremely optimistic, as if sacrifice is not to be feared. On the train from Shimonoseki to Tokyo, not a single passenger spoke about the war situation or the pain of war disasters. Their faces were very tense, but they never revealed a sense of defeat. They probably believe in their hearts that idle war talk is of no practical use, and that each person should fulfill their responsibilities. What can be done today should be completed, for only in this way can we move towards victory. It is said that in Tokyo, even in the ruins of disasters, sweet potatoes are being planted with the goal of a large harvest. Vegetable gardens are now visible everywhere in the city. All guidance and planning are moving away from empty talk on paper and going to the ground to work. Anything is being done tirelessly. This is the attitude of a people who consider their homeland as a battlefield.

### US Military Generals in Okinawa Discuss Operational Plans

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Okinawa Island, US Far East Air Force Commander General Kenney and Deputy Commander Byers of the New Unified Pacific Strategic Air Force held two operational meetings in Okinawa with Tenth Army Commander Stilwell and the US Navy leaders in that area.

Editorial

### Observations on the Chongqing-Soviet Problem

Regarding the inside story of Song Ziwen's visit to Moscow, this newspaper has pointed out his three tasks, namely: 1. Adjustment of Chongqing-Soviet relations; 2. Mediation of Chongqing-Yan'an relations; 3. Exchange of opinions on the Sino-Japanese problem. We have also specifically pointed out that one particularly noteworthy point of Song's trip is that his visit to the Soviet Union before the Berlin Three-Power Conference is not only a new diplomatic activity on the part of Chongqing, but also has the implied intention of Britain and the United States behind it. However, the complexity of these issues cannot be easily achieved. Now that Song has been in Moscow for eleven days and has met with Stalin three times, and has also had variable contacts with Molotov and other parties, based on the news that can be seen so far, in addition to proving that our above observations are not far off from the facts, we believe that there are several points worth studying.

First, the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can be said to be the pain of modern Chinese political issues. This was the case in the past twenty years, and it will be difficult to have a miraculous cure in the future. To seek a solution to this problem from the Soviet Union, perhaps some politicians who like to play clever tricks think it is a fundamental solution, the so-called "he who tied the bell must untie it," but the problem still lies in the fact that the Communist Party is dissatisfied with the current situation of the Chongqing government. If the Chongqing government does not meet the demands of the Communist Party and hopes that the Soviet Union will put pressure on Yan'an, this is a ridiculous fantasy. The Soviet Union can grandly say that this is your country's internal affair. One's own problems must be solved by oneself. Perhaps the visit to Yan'an by Mr. Huang Yanpei and others is for this purpose?

Second, regarding Chongqing-Soviet relations, after the Chongqing Sixth Plenary Session passed a resolution to strengthen its diplomatic policy towards the Soviet Union, the Chinese Kuomintang Soviet Union visit group, which had not been successfully organized for many years, was reported to have departed, and the second step was Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union. But to be honest, Chongqing's foreign policy is only a part of American foreign policy. A part of the powerful faction below Chiang Kai-shek has never wanted to gain an independent position between the Soviet Union and the United States in the future. Britain obviously does not want Chongqing to be a buffer between the United States and the Soviet Union, but hopes to treat Chongqing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a branch of its own State Department. Under this contradiction, it actually gives the Soviet Union an opportunity to take advantage of. Therefore, this time the attitude towards Song can be said to be a bit arrogant. Speaking of the issue of the border, he staged a diplomatic drama to welcome the Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, and the ceremony and banquet were the same as for Song's entourage, which can be simply said to be a demonstration to Song. Speaking of the Xinjiang issue, it is related to Chongqing's entire Northwest Development Plan, but would the Soviet Union be willing to provide free services to Britain and the United States under the meaning of improving Soviet-Chongqing relations? In the past, it made concessions on Xinjiang because the war in the West was tight, but this time the situation is different.

Third, speaking of the entire Far East issue, what Chongqing is foolishly dreaming of is nothing more than the Soviet Union coming out to intervene in the Sino-Japanese War. The Soviet Union exerts pressure on Japan. On the other hand, Britain and the United States also have a strategy of dragging the Soviet Union into the front line, right? It is true that exaggerating the contradictions between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing today is a mistake, but at the same time, saying that the Soviet Union will immediately take action in the Far East because there is no war on the Western Front is also groundless. Therefore, what price can Britain, the United States, and Chongqing pay to make the Soviet Union change its current attitude? Recognition of the spheres of influence in Xinjiang, Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea, and Alaska, and the establishment of a Chinese coalition government – can Britain, the United States, and Chongqing accomplish all of this today?

Song Ziwen is lightly setting out on an expedition for Chongqing-Soviet relations with such complex relationships. It is impossible to know how many gifts he can bring back. Perhaps, in helplessness, he is still planning to wait for the final resolution of the Three-Power Conference? Therefore, we can speculate that Song's meeting with Stalin may only be limited to exchanging opinions, and the greatest result may only be an opportunity to make suggestions to the Three-Power Conference. However, the holding of the Three-Power Conference is imminent, and the mystery will be revealed immediately.

### Japanese Army Constructs Strong Defenses in Eastern Burma; Secures the Taungoo-Mawchi Road Line

Burma Front Base, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since the rainy season began in the Burma war, the Japanese army has been constructing strong defenses near Taungoo, along the road between Taungoo and Mawchi. With the arrival of new troops, morale is extremely high, causing great damage to enemy forces equipped with tanks and heavy weapons that come to attack, and bravely repelling enemy pressure. The Japanese army on the Sittang River front does not give way to the enemy forces that continue to reinforce and resupply, and even crosses the river from the mouth of the Sittang River, attempting to destroy the enemy's plan. The remaining Japanese troops are still securing the Taungoo-Mawchi Road, and are securing the eastern half of Burma from the battle lines connecting the north and south of the Sittang River. In addition, the Japanese army unit guarding the western side of this ancient city is repeatedly daring to launch close combat attacks on the enemy transportation units that rely on the road between Kanna and Kalewa for supplies, hindering the enemy's rear transportation. In addition, the Japanese army stationed near Yangon is constantly launching close combat attacks on enemy positions near Yangon, and as a result, the achievements of the Japanese army's close combat attacks are gradually increasing. From late May to late June, the cumulative combat results achieved by the Japanese army in various places are as follows: 2,879 enemy troops killed or wounded, 2 aircraft captured, 4 shot down, 24 tanks and armored vehicles destroyed, 6 artillery pieces captured or destroyed, 25 vehicles, 69 camps burned, and many other heavy and light machine guns and ammunition captured.

### Enemy Aircraft Conduct Strategic Bombing of Mainland China

Mainland China Base, 10th (Central News Agency) – Enemy aircraft have repeatedly and persistently attacked the Central China area for several days. Since January of this year, when enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Hong Kong and Guangzhou areas, there have been large-scale attacks by 50 or 60 B-29 aircraft in mid-December of last year, and other continuous bombing by single aircraft or small groups of aircraft. The recent characteristics of enemy aircraft activity are as follows: 1. The bombing targets are not fixed; 2. They attack on a regular basis and follow different routes; 3. The bases from which they operate are almost all in the Philippine Islands; 4. They distribute leaflets to soldiers on the front lines; 5. They conduct long-term low-altitude circling at night. Judging from these circumstances, it seems that the enemy is observing the weather and training skilled personnel, using psychological warfare tactics to attack the Japanese army, and proclaiming their consistent strategic bombing, which is the characteristic of recent enemy aircraft bombing of the mainland.

### Japanese Army Firmly Defends Positions in Bougainville

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army is still firmly defending its positions on Bougainville Island and many Pacific islands, deploying strong defenses and waiting for the enemy to attack. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 7th, after a long period of preparation, the Australian army began a new attack on the Japanese army in the southern part of Bougainville Island, but encountered fierce counterattacks from the Japanese army on the island.

### Italian Ships Will Participate in the Pacific War

Zurich, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from a Geneva journalist, the Italian authorities have declared that Italy may declare war on Japan and participate in the Pacific War. Although the Italian fleet sailing in the Pacific is not engaged in combat, in order to improve its international standing and to be on par with the Allied nations, it has no choice but to participate in the Pacific War.

### Stalin and Song Ziwen Hold Long Talks

Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a Moscow dispatch yesterday, Soviet Chairman Stalin has held a third meeting with Song Ziwen. It is reported that the meeting lasted until midnight. Also, Song Ziwen met with US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, over the weekend to discuss countermeasures.

### Ministry of Industry Reviews Company Capital Reduction

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that companies in various places have not been able to fully develop their businesses due to a lack of raw materials and restrictions on electricity and water, are actively reducing capital to alleviate the burden on the company. The Ministry of Industry, in order to prevent companies from using capital reduction to affect the rights of small and medium-sized shareholders or for other purposes, seeks greater details in the review procedures. Companies must provide detailed reasons and methods for capital reduction in the application, and prepare the required clauses and submit them according to law. In order to facilitate the review, the ministry has ordered the competent authorities in various places to continue the review of company registration cases and submit them promptly. The following are the required clauses: Articles of Association registration items, shareholder list, capital reduction business budget, property inventory, balance sheet, minutes of the shareholders' meeting, company newspaper (for more than three months), original registration certificate fee of 25 yuan, stamp tax of 40 yuan.

### Central China Water, Electricity, and Railways - No Price Increases for Now

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency): Recently, there have been widespread rumors that Central China Water and Electricity and Central China Railways would increase rates for passenger and freight transport and utilities. A reporter specifically inquired with the Ministry of Construction about this, and was informed that after discussions among the companies, it was deemed that water, electricity, and transportation are closely related to the lives of the people. Any further price increases would inevitably stimulate inflation. Therefore, it was decided that water, electricity, and train ticket prices would not be increased in the short term.

Station Personnel Must Wear Badges

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency): At stations along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line operated by Central China Railways, ticket scalping and unreasonable behavior are still rampant, severely impacting legitimate passenger traffic. The Ministry of Construction issued instructions to China Railways to strictly correct this, but with little effect. The Ministry is...

A Glimpse into the Internal Preparations for the Chongqing General Counteroffensive

Continental Base, 10th (Central News Agency): After suffering a deadly blow in the Japanese army's Henan operation last spring, the Chongqing army established the Tenth War Zone in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu. At the same time, it has been working hard to build up each war zone, attempting to launch a counteroffensive against Japan and actively equipping its troops with American-style equipment. Meanwhile, the Yan'an forces took advantage of the gaps created by the Japanese army's mainland operations to expand their territory and began moving south. Furthermore, the transport capacity of the Stilwell Road, Chongqing's only supply line, has remained insufficient despite Chongqing's active efforts. Thus, its general counteroffensive posture has not yet emerged from the preparatory period. Regarding this point, He Yingqin, the Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Army and Air Force, frankly admitted that it would not be easy for the Chongqing side to confront the Japanese army on the mainland with its military strength, directly acknowledging the strength of the Japanese forces. He also stated that the Chongqing army must actively enhance its military equipment and requires considerable time before it can launch a general counteroffensive with certainty. Although we must have a deep understanding of the Chongqing side's war-making capabilities, the Chongqing side, since losing the Liuzhou-Guilin area, has re-employed Tang Enbo, who was unsuccessful in the Henan operation, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Guizhou-Guangxi-Hunan Border Region. Last autumn, it established a headquarters in Guiyang with 30 divisions of troops and set up the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army and Air Force in Kunming, with He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief, commanding the Burma Expeditionary Force, the Guizhou-Guangxi-Hunan Border Region Army, and the Vietnamese Border Region Army, among other strong forces. From these facts, we can see that the focus of the Chongqing side's general counteroffensive against Japan is clearly in southwestern China. However, despite the Chongqing side's efforts, the shortage of supplies to Chongqing has greatly affected the preparations for the general counteroffensive. Currently, the US supply route to Chongqing relies on air transport over the Himalayas, land transport via the Stilwell Road, and pipelines from India, but the total is only about 75,000 tons per month. Half of this is used by the US military stationed in Chongqing. Therefore, although the Chongqing side has declared a general counteroffensive in the southwest, it has not yet launched on a large scale, and this is one of the reasons. Another main reason can be attributed to the southward advance of the Yan'an forces. According to reports, Yan'an has been under pressure for a long time since it left Ruijin and is now heading south with Ruijin as its target. The Chongqing side cannot ignore this, so it has to deal with Yan'an with some of its forces. This situation has now spread to Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Fujian, leading to armed conflicts between Chongqing and Yan'an forces. On June 23, a Reuters report from Los Angeles cited an editorial in the Heilongjiang Daily, strongly urging the prevention of armed conflict between Chongqing and Yan'an. However, the Yan'an army has gathered 15,000 troops near Pingjiang in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, and the First and Second Columns of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Military Region have expanded from the Yangtze River Delta to Fujian Province. Furthermore, the East River Column and the Pearl River Detachment in Guangdong Province are advancing northeast and southwest along the coast, leading to direct clashes with the Chongqing army in various places. Therefore, the Chongqing side's general counteroffensive against Japan requires first expelling the Yan'an forces and addressing the dominance of the US military in Chongqing. In the Political Consultative Conference on July 7, Chiang Kai-shek officially stated, "If we want to defeat the Japanese army in the Chinese theater of war, we must do it ourselves." This statement is worth pondering deeply.

### Truman Embarks for Europe by Sea; Many Military and Political Officials Accompany Him

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency): According to confirmed reports from Washington, US President Truman left the United States on the weekend to travel to Europe by ship. He is accompanied by the new Secretary of State Burns, as well as many military and political advisors, with whom he will hold last-minute meetings on board before the Three-Headed Conference. It is reported that the ship used by Mr. Truman can directly communicate with the White House via encrypted wireless radio. The news of the US President's departure for Europe was widely rumored in Washington over the weekend, but the White House requested that the news not be released in accordance with inspection instructions. Later, it was revealed by the well-known American news commentary expert Peter Johnson in a radio broadcast on Saturday night. However, there is no news yet about the route Mr. Truman is taking or when he will arrive in Europe. Authoritative sources say that the Three-Headed Conference has been decided to be held in the region of Chesham southwest of Berlin.

### Lieutenant General Sultan Appointed US Army Inspector General

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency): According to a report from Washington, US President Truman has formally appointed Lieutenant General Sultan as the Inspector General of the US Army. It is reported that Mr. Sultan served as the Commander-in-Chief of the US forces on the India-Burma front in mid-August 1944, and recently served as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief under General Stilwell.

### Chen Cheng Addresses Inquiries at the Chongqing Political Consultative Conference

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency): According to a broadcast from Chongqing Central News Agency on the 9th, Chen Cheng, the Minister of Military Affairs of the Chongqing government, made a military report at the National Political Consultative Conference on the 7th, informing all attendees of the strength and strategic trends of the Japanese army on the mainland, and also spoke about the issue of adjusting military and political agencies, emphasizing the need for a thorough reform of the Chongqing military and political system. Members of the Political Consultative Conference also raised issues such as improving the treatment of soldiers, handling assistance to families, and student soldiers, questioning the fundamental policies of the authorities, and expressing various opinions. In conclusion, Chen Cheng replied to the questions from the members of the Political Consultative Conference, "If we do not improve the lax morale within the Ministry of Military Affairs, it will be difficult to strengthen our important mission."

### Huang Yanpei and Others Return to Chongqing from Yan'an

Central News Agency, Shanghai: According to news from this city, the Chongqing National Political Consultative Conference originally planned to send seven representatives, including Chu Tsin-nien, Xi Yupeng, Huang Yanpei, Zuo Shunsheng, Leng Yu, Wang Yunwu, and Zhang Bojun, to visit Yan'an. Later, Wang Yunwu was unable to go due to illness, so only six people went. They arrived in Yan'an on the 2nd of this month and returned to Chongqing on the 5th, staying in Yan'an for only three days. They received a warm reception from the Communist Party. The delegation made it clear that their purpose was not authorized by the Chongqing National Government, but rather to discuss the current situation with the Communist Party and to hope that the country could unite. The Communist Party expressed its support for national unity, but put forward conditions for cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, urging the Kuomintang to realize the need to abandon one-party dictatorship, convene a conference of all parties and factions, organize a coalition government, and implement democratic politics. The two sides exchanged opinions, but no concrete decisions were made. It is said that the purpose of the representatives of the National Political Consultative Conference going to Yan'an this time was to act on Chiang Kai-shek's opinions, hoping that the Communist Party would send representatives to attend the Political Consultative Conference held in Chongqing on July 7. As a result, due to differing views, no compromise could be reached, so this trip by the representatives can be said to have achieved nothing. When the representatives arrived in Yan'an, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai of the Communist Party expressed a warm welcome on the surface. However, as a result, on July 7, the Communist Party issued slogans opposing the Kuomintang's oppression of the Mongolian and Hui peoples, demanding that the Kuomintang abolish economic controls, and establish a coalition government.

### French Cabinet Discusses Political Reform

Paris, 10th (Central News Agency): According to reports from Paris, France will adopt a "national referendum" system to elect a National Assembly, and the National Assembly will submit the new constitution it drafts for review. This news was released yesterday after the conclusion of a special cabinet meeting that discussed the political reforms proposed by De Gaulle. The meeting lasted six hours, the longest meeting in the French cabinet. The Resistance faction and the Left-wing parties advocated the establishment of a "unicameral" parliament, while the Radical Party advocated a "bicameral" system. It is said that De Gaulle agreed with the Radical Party's proposal, but according to news from the newspaper Le Monde, De Gaulle is close to supporting the "unicameral" proposal. The Radical Party is now strongly insisting on "revising the existing constitution," while the Left-wing parties and the Resistance faction advocate "drafting a new constitution."

### Social Restrictions Between British and German Civilians Relaxed

Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency): According to a report from a Reuters correspondent in Kiel, the "no fraternization" ban between British and German military personnel and civilians is gradually being relaxed, or may be lifted altogether. In the Guildford area, coffee shops on Sunday evenings are full of British soldiers and German men and women. Sometimes, British soldiers sit next to German women, offering them drinks and cigarettes in a very friendly manner. Even when British military police enter, they do not interfere.

### Central Reserve Bank Intensifies Inspections of Banks and Firms; Must Comply with New Regulations Set by Authorities

In order to stabilize the financial situation and correct malpractices by financial institutions, the Central Reserve Bank has cancelled the issuance of appropriation orders across the board from the 3rd of this month. Payments to customers by banks and firms must be made with cash or crossed immediate promissory notes. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank stipulates that cash withdrawals by banks and firms are based on the total amount of their deposits, with the supply ratio increased. The cash obtained by each bank and firm must be used to pay customers as much as possible and must not be retained. It is learned that the Central Reserve Bank Inspection Department has been ordered to intensify inspections of banks and firms to determine whether they are complying with the new regulations set by the authorities and whether they have other illegal operations.

Issue of Time for Receiving and Paying Bills

Banks and money houses in this city accept bills from depositors for same-day clearing. Businesses in the central district can account for bills received before a certain time on the same day. However, recently, some businesses account for crossed bills or bills received by banks from money houses or vice versa, even if they are received before the time limit, on the next day, which is very disadvantageous for commercial enterprises. A reporter inquired about this matter with financial circles and learned that accounting for bills on the same day is possible with manpower. Accounting for them on the next day is a last resort for banks and money houses. The main reason is purely that businesses receive and pay too many bills, and the procedures and time are insufficient. Before the system of bill exchange and payment can be completely satisfactory, customers can only hope for understanding regarding whether their bills are accounted for on the same day or the next day.

Four Civil Servants Indicted for Dereliction of Duty and Corruption; Yesterday Remanded to Special Court; Two Policemen and Two Bureau of Finance Employees

The Municipal Police Bureau has strictly investigated and reported on illegal civil servants guilty of dereliction of duty and corruption, and has already transferred several cases to the Shanghai branch of the Special Court for handling in accordance with the law. It is learned that Cai Zhongkui, officer No. 7274 of the Dongchang Road Branch, and Huang Keguang, officer No. 1210 of the Yulin Road Branch, were again charged with dereliction of duty, and Chang Zhaoxiang and Jin Rui, employees of the Treasury Section of the Bureau of Finance, were charged with fraud and forgery of valuable securities and embezzlement of seals.

### Methods of Raising Funds for Scholarships; Hoping for Enthusiastic People

Any undertaking, in order to advance smoothly and achieve complete success, must first have a purpose, a plan, a goal, and a belief, and proceed step by step. There is no reason why things cannot be accomplished. The goal of our organization's ninth scholarship fund has been set at 30,000 yuan. Although the number seems large, it is still not enough for the thousands of children who need it. Moreover, raising this amount of money is indeed not easy! The method of fundraising is, one, to ask powerful people to generously donate; two, to hope that enthusiastic people, assisted graduates, assisted students, and non-assisted students will jointly promote and consistently fundraise, which will always be effective.

It is hoped that enthusiastic people will, with the same spirit as in the past, contribute effort and money to our newspaper's scholarship fundraising efforts. Some may not be able to recognize a team due to limited resources. In that case, our newspaper has a "Collective Recognition Team Form" (available at the Social Service Office of this newspaper), which can be used to gather five or six or more like-minded people to jointly recognize a team. Only one person needs to be responsible for collecting donations and deciding on the team name, which can still be published in the next issue of this newspaper. There is also a "Team Recognition Notice," which only needs to be filled out and sent in, and it will be published the next day, and a date will be set for collecting the money. Because some busy people forget to donate, as the saying goes, "important people are forgetful." In this case, we hope that familiar people will promote it at any time, and if the notice is filled out and sent in or a phone call is made, our office will immediately send someone to discuss it, which is a very simple method.

Baizhi Scholarship Donates Large Sum

Dr. Chen Cunren of the Guoyi Clinic at No. 2 Weihaiwei Road has spared no effort in sponsoring our newspaper's scholarship fund in the past. His Baizhi Scholarship, which he runs, has helped 20 university students each year. In addition to those who have already graduated, there are still more than a dozen students. Mr. Chen, noting that tuition fees will increase again next year, and that poor students may drop out of school, generously donated 500,000 yuan yesterday, which he named the "Baizhi Scholarship Team." Mr. Chen specializes in internal medicine and has a deep understanding of medicine. He has also written many books. He focuses on education and benefits the poor, making him a benevolent and admirable person!

Regular Teams

Team 20: Baizhi Scholarship Team, 500,000 yuan

Team 21: Xia Huanxin Team (donation from Chengde Girls' Middle School trustee for military expenses), 100,000 yuan, Total raised to date: 5,399,000 yuan

Scholarship funds received yesterday: Continued donation from the Silk and Satin Bureau, 50,000 yuan; Hua Shouyu, Zhong Xiutangfang, Cao Shixin, and Gu Yi, 10,000 yuan; Shi Quan, 5,000 yuan. Total received: 85,000 yuan.

Application Procedures for New and Returning Students for the Ninth Scholarship

Application for Returning Students: Returning students should bring their school registration certificate to the hall to obtain an application form, fill it out, and submit it to their original school for a letter of recommendation. The school will then send it to the office. The time for obtaining the application form is limited to 8:00 AM to 10:30 AM every day. Someone can be entrusted to obtain it on behalf of the student, but they must bring the student's school registration certificate with them. The "application period" is scheduled as follows. I hope everyone will pay attention:

July 12: Grades 1 and 2 of Senior Elementary School and Junior High School

July 13: Grade 2 of Junior High School and Grade 3 of Junior High School

July 14: All grades of Senior High School, University, and Vocational School

(The above grades refer to the grade the student was enrolled in the previous semester)

Application for New Students: This year, new students will be recruited at the same time. Application forms can be obtained from various schools by the schools starting on July 16. Students can apply to the schools starting on July 17. Applications will only be accepted if recommended by the school. If new students come directly to the hall to obtain an application form, it will not be issued.

All new and returning students this year must undergo strict screening before they can be approved.

Travel Communications

### General Overview of Zhoupu

— Lan Yu

On Shangnan Road

On the morning of June 29th, your reporter drove to the South Wharf and bought a boat to cross the river. The boat was small, accommodating six or seven people. First, I bought a support pole at Litou for 1,000 yuan. By the time I arrived at Zhoujiadu, it was 9:00 AM. At the Shangnan Railway Station, the passengers waiting for military transport were lined up like a long snake. Upon boarding, due to the scarcity of trains and the abundance of passengers, there were no seats available, and even standing room was scarce. The crowded situation was no less severe than on the Beijing-Shanghai train. I arrived at Zhoupu at 11:15 AM. Zhoupu is the terminus of Shangnan Road, passing through Xinma Road, Yangsi Bridge, Sanlintang, Tianhua Temple, Bai , and arriving at Zhoupu, totaling seven stations. The journey took about an hour. I heard that several years ago, the trains were much faster, but now, due to the old and worn-out machinery and uneven tracks, the bumps are quite severe, making the journey slower than before.

A Glimpse of Transportation

Zhoupu is the leading town in Nanhui, and even in the entire Pudong area, it is one of the top towns. The entire area is about three or four *li* in circumference, with streets crisscrossing and houses lined up in rows. However, the streets are narrow, making it difficult for rickshaws to pass. There are vegetable and seed markets in the early morning and at noon. According to a survey by the local town office, the population is distributed among 63 *bao* (units), 248 *jia* (sub-units), 2,696 households, totaling 11,650 men and women. However, according to your reporter's observation, it is likely more than this number. When inquiring with local elders, they also said it is at least double that.

Regarding transportation, besides Shangnan Road, there are highways connecting to Nanhui and Datuan. Usually, there are public buses running between them. However, due to poor security in the rural areas, with frequent bandit and guerilla troop appearances, these buses were stopped a while ago. Now, there is only a truck similar to a public bus, which can accommodate a dozen people. The schedule is irregular, roughly two trips a day, departing as soon as it's full, costing 15,000 yuan per person. In addition, there are cars from the East Asia Company available for private charter. The fare to Nanhui is 140,000 yuan, recently increased to 200,000 yuan, which, when split among seven or eight people, amounts to about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per person. Departing from Zhoupu, it takes only forty minutes to arrive if no delays occur along the way. For water transport, there are two shipping companies sailing to Nanhui and Datuan, one trip each afternoon. The departure times of the two ships are similar, with a fare of 6,000 yuan to Nanhui, which is cheaper than taking a car, but takes more than four hours. Also, safety is not guaranteed en route. I heard that these two ships have been inspected by guerilla troops several times in the past two months. Fortunately, they were not encountered by bandits, otherwise both people and property would have been lost.

Rice Market Conditions

The local four rural districts produce very little rice, but due to developed land and water transportation and its location as a necessary thoroughfare, the town is a distribution center for rice, forming the commercial center of the entire city. Most of the rice comes from Lüxian, Jinshan, Songjiang, and other places. During the rice control period, rice merchants, seeking security along the way, often used small boats to transport rice to the town through small ports. Then, small vendors buy it in small quantities and resell it to households. Women carry one or two *dou* (unit of measure) at a time, while men use bicycles, which can carry more than one *dan* (unit of measure). On Shangnan Road, one can see bicycles carrying rice everywhere, continuously along the way. Once past the Dragon King Temple blockade line, it is equivalent to passing all three checkpoints. Without any obstacles or minor expenses, one can safely transport the rice to Shanghai. During the period when rice was not allowed to be freely transported, if one could pass through the entire route, the profit was extremely high, so many people came here to buy in small quantities for resale.

After Liberalization

When rice prices in Shanghai rose from tens of thousands to nearly one million, the local rice prices were consistently 200,000 to 300,000 yuan lower than those in Shanghai. For example, when rice prices in Shanghai reached 900,000 yuan, they were 600,000 yuan in Zhoupu. Because of this, rice traders were even more enthusiastic. However, because of the scarcity of rice in the producing areas and some rice merchants hoping to profit from hoarding as prices rose day and night, they collected rice, resulting in a sudden decrease in the amount transported to the town. To maintain its own local interests, the local administrative authorities, on the one hand, restricted rice from leaving the area, and on the other hand, moderately increased rice prices to ensure a smooth supply. Since the implementation of emergency rice measures, the authorities, in accordance with central laws, have allowed free passage. However, because rice merchants were hoarding for speculation, and rice was allowed to be transported directly from Jinshan and Songjiang to Shanghai without having to pass through Zhoupu, the rice available in the town has been decreasing day by day. Some small vendors with more capital, seeing that the rice price in the town was equal to that in Shanghai and there was no profit to be made, went directly to the producing areas to purchase and transport rice directly to Shanghai. Regarding the situation along the way, your reporter interviewed several rice vendors. Besides paying a 0.5% security and police subsidy fee in the town, there were no other expenses in the places they passed through. There were some occasional small extortions, but the amounts were small. As for the security and police subsidy fee, it was newly established within the past half month and set up at key points along the road, with dedicated personnel collecting the fees. All food and daily necessities passing through are subject to the fee, with food being 0.5%. Given that the local rice price is 600,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan is collected per *dan*, plus a handling fee of 600 yuan. Daily necessities are charged at 1%, calculated based on the invoice of the goods.

Reasons for Closure

In Zhoupu, there were originally more than 130 rice shops, but within June, over 40 of them have closed down. Your reporter asked an old rice shop owner about the reasons for the closure. He said that the supply fee was too heavy, and an average rice shop needed to have a capital of over a million yuan. However, according to your reporter's investigation, half of the closed 40 rice shops are still doing business behind closed doors, using closure as an excuse to avoid paying various taxes, and finding some influential people to support them, engaging in hoarding and waiting for prices to rise. Only a few rice shops with insufficient capital, having sold rice at a time of crazy price increases but not being able to buy it back at a similar price, and suffering from high supply fees, had no choice but to close down.

Cash Panic

Shanghai is surrounded by cash panic, with the malpractice of bank draft notes. The same situation exists in Zhoupu, and it is even more severe than in Shanghai. There are more than 30 banks and money shops, regardless of the size of their capital, all issuing bank draft notes, and the number of notes issued even exceeds the capital amount by several times. These speculative financial businesses, on one hand, absorb cash and secretly divert it, and on the other hand, arbitrarily issue bank draft notes, widely collecting rice and daily necessities. As a result, bank draft notes flood the market, and even things worth thousands of yuan are traded with bank draft notes. Bank draft notes from Shanghai are not valid in Zhoupu because counterfeit notes have been discovered, causing a loss of credibility. In reality, the local bank draft notes have no credibility at all. They are truly a major enemy that promotes economic collapse, disrupts finance, and is the main cause of soaring prices.

Education and Hygiene

Teachers receive relatively good treatment, not just a salary of several thousand yuan, but a monthly allocation of five *dou* of rice. This rice is obtained through donations from all sectors of society to the district office. There is one county-run Second Middle School, one private Yaguang Middle School, and five public and private elementary schools. The principal of the county-run middle school is also the district head. In terms of hygiene, the two most notable achievements are the clinic established by the friendly army and the free clinic and medicine dispensing service provided by Chunyang Temple. There is also a medical clinic named Fushan, which often goes out to raise donations with donation books, but it is no longer as good as its name suggests, and its medical expenses are often higher than those of private medical clinics.
