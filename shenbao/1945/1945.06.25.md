### Exert All Strength to Adapt to the Urgent War Situation: Japan Prepares Necessary Posture; National Volunteer Soldier Service Law Promulgated and Implemented

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – To adapt to the urgency of the war situation, the Japanese government is mobilizing all its national strength to accelerate the preparation of military and necessary facilities, aiming to ensure the integrity of its national territory. The Special Military Measures Law, implemented on May 5th in parts of the Empire where the situation was urgent, is now, in light of the imminent local decisive battle, being applied to the entire territory of the Empire starting from the 19th of this month. This was announced by the Information Bureau on the 23rd. The expansion of the law’s application to the entire territory is a necessary implementation of emergency wartime measures, with the significant aim of preparing for the decisive battle on the mainland and necessary domestic capabilities.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Volunteer Soldier Service Law, established by the 87th Japanese Diet, has been approved by His Majesty the Emperor, announced on the 22nd, and implemented immediately. Consequently, the National Volunteer Corps to respond to the mainland decisive battle has been established. The National Volunteer Soldiers, at the request of the state and under the sacred mission of protecting the Imperial Nation, will engage in railway, communication, and production work, or participate in combat alongside the Japanese army. When the law was promulgated, Minister of the Army Anami respectfully submitted a memorial to the throne and broadcast it nationwide via radio on the night of the 23rd, so that all citizens would be aware.

### Japanese Army Dispatch to China Completes Defense Array: The United States Tries to Avoid Mainland Decisive Battle

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Despite the repeated valiant fighting of the Japanese garrison in the Battle of Okinawa, the difficult situation continues to intensify. The insatiable aggressive intentions of the enemy United States are becoming increasingly blatant. The congestion of transport ships at the Kerama anchorage and the appearance of mobile units near Miyako Island all indicate preparations for the next operation. The Japanese Army Dispatch to China, responsible for defending the Chinese mainland, has completed an impenetrable defense array against enemy US landing operations. If the US military dares to invade the Chinese mainland, the Japanese army is prepared to inflict a severe blow. Since this spring, the Japanese army in mainland China has been seeking comprehensive measures against US landing operations, and launching preemptive strikes against the Chongqing regime, which frequently calls for a counteroffensive against Japan. First, the North China Dispatch Army inflicted fatal blows on the First and Fifth War Zone armies operating in Henan and Hubei provinces, reducing the US forward bases at Laohekou, Neixiang, and Nanyang. The South China Japanese army also began operations in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, defeating the Seventh War Zone armies entrenched in the Longnan, Dingnan, and Xunnan areas, unleashing the power of their night combat troops without restraint, causing them to collapse, and paying close attention to the outcome of the Battle of Okinawa. The Chongqing Military General Headquarters in Kunming, facing the impregnable Japanese defensive array, is preparing a counteroffensive posture with Americanized units under its command. He Yingqin is even employing Long Yun as deputy commander-in-chief, hoping to achieve his self-sacrificing strategy. Here, the enemy US is directly aiming its next operational target at the Japanese mainland, while actively disseminating false propaganda, trying to avoid the mainland decisive battle, with the goal of cutting off the Japanese mainland operations and allowing the Japanese army in mainland China to self-destruct. Recent Chongqing newspaper editorials even claim that the next operational target will not be mainland China, but French Indochina, followed by Jeju Island. By annihilating the Japanese army in mainland China and cutting off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the South Seas, they believe their objective can be achieved. Furthermore, when MacArthur was rehearsing mainland landing operations, he made no mention of the expected landing problems in the Pearl River, Hangzhou Bay, and Shandong Peninsula. However, a certain military commentator stated: "Okinawa, including the Ryukyu Islands, is too narrow as a base for attacking the Japanese mainland, and suffers from the disadvantage of being too far away. From this perspective, mainland China is an excellent springboard." Military observers unanimously acknowledge that this base in mainland China is an undeniable threat to the enemy camp. The enemy US, deeply aware of the heavy losses incurred on Iwo Jima and Okinawa, knows that directly implementing operations on the Japanese mainland will face even greater threats. Therefore, their attempt to use Chongqing's manpower and resources to achieve their ambitions is undoubtedly certain. The future actions of the US military may be carried out in any region, but no matter what offensive the Chongqing army attempts in coordination, the mainland fortress will not be moved even slightly, thanks to the abundant fighting spirit of the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese Dispatch Army to China is quietly awaiting the enemy US mainland landing.

### US Military Establishes Tactical Command in Chongqing

Guangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Chongqing, the US military stationed in Chongqing will establish a US Military Tactical Command in Chongqing, abolishing the previous US Military Command in Kunming (Commander General Mark Clark). The new command will be headed by General Alexander Patch. The Chongqing side is currently making strenuous efforts to promote the imminent general counteroffensive against Japan, but the Americanized Chongqing army and its strategic capabilities remain significantly weak. For example, in the formation and equipment of the Americanized Chongqing army, mortars are still the main artillery, with only some field guns deployed. Compared to the artillery equipment of a formal US division, which mainly consists of 105mm and 155mm howitzers, and regiments equipped with 75mm and 85mm field guns, the name may be Americanized, but in reality, it is inferior to even a third-rate US division. Regarding its operational methods, smooth logistics are an absolute requirement. However, the Chongqing army relies on the Chongqing-India airlift and the Burma Road, which ultimately suffer from incomplete supply lines and difficult material and ammunition storage, making it impossible to engage in prolonged combat. Therefore, cultivating the combat power of 30 divisions requires a considerable preparation period. Furthermore, Chongqing's attempt to form ten or more Americanized divisions of youth student soldiers has also yielded no results. As a result, the backbone of the Americanized Chongqing army is the First and Second Divisions and the New Sixth Army, which were transferred from Burma, but their combat deployment is also inconsistent. From this, it can be seen that the gap between the propaganda and the reality of Chongqing's counteroffensive against Japan in support of the US mainland landing operations is still large. Pre-Day Air Raid on Balikpapan

### Fierce Fighting Near Ruden, Balikpapan Air Raid Yesterday

Southern Frontline Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – After landing in Balikpapan Bay, the enemy deployed more than a dozen large warships to patrol the seas off Miri, south of Borneo, conducting shelling and mine sweeping reconnaissance. On the 20th, using four transport ships, ten large boats, and thirty landing craft, they began landing near Ruden, 20 kilometers north of Miri. The local Japanese garrison is currently engaged in fierce fighting with them. Since the 18th, Japanese units in the Uisston area on the east coast of Balikpapan Bay have been boldly engaging in close combat with the enemy landing forces, inflicting significant damage.

Southwest Pacific Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – Twenty enemy small aircraft, including P-38 and P-47 types, attacked Balikpapan on the 23rd. The local Japanese units shot down two of them and engaged with enemy ships approaching the island, repelling them.

Mines Dropped in Hakata Bay

Fukuoka, 24th (Central News Agency) – More than ten enemy B-29 aircraft intruded from the sea south of Kagoshima Prefecture from around midnight to 2:40 AM on the 24th. After dropping mines in Hakata Bay, they fled via southern Oita Prefecture.

Editorial

### Upholding the National Policy and the Organs of Public Opinion

Chairman Chen Dai of the National Government, recognizing the tense situation as being as precarious as a thread hanging by a hair, personally inspected local military and political facilities in Anhui, Huai, and Henan provinces, giving instructions on everything to meet the needs of the current situation and to demonstrate the central government's policies to achieve unity from top to bottom. We feel that this inspection has three significant meanings.

First, we can understand more deeply and clearly the central government's policies under the current situation.

Second, we can recognize the central government's spirit of responsibility for the national situation and the people in all regions.

Third, we can recognize that the coordinated unity of the central and local military and political facilities is sufficient to cope with any environment and implement the central government's national policy.

Through Chairman Chen Dai's inspection of Anhui, Huai, and Henan provinces, the central government's sincere concern for local authorities and staff in all departments will stimulate local officials and people to support the implementation of the central government's national policy and generate a more favorable centripetal effect, which is sufficient to promote political innovation in the peaceful areas and is a major prerequisite for the reconstruction of the whole country.

In his address during the inspection of the troops in Anhui, Huai, and Henan, Chairman Chen Dai clearly stated: "The central government's policy will not change, no matter how urgent the situation is." "What is the central government's policy? Simply put, it is peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction." This is an extremely simple and clear statement!

At this stage, the central government is implementing the national policy of "peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction." Chairman Chen Dai also clearly pointed out three points: First, "For the freedom and independence of China and the liberation of East Asia, we must adhere to the original intention of participating in the war, strengthen cooperation, and complete the war." Second, "The anti-communist policy of the National Government has always been, is, and will always be the case." Third, "We must start with internal unity, expand and enrich it to achieve national unity. Only unity can give us strength, and only strength can shoulder greater tasks." These three major policies for implementing the national policy have completely eliminated the various rumors circulating recently. At the same time, they pointed out the great path for officials and civilians to strive together. We must unite our strength and move forward towards our common great goal.

We support the central government's national policy and implementation guidelines. However, we believe that there is a basic prerequisite for rapidly realizing this major policy, which is to first obtain the genuine support of the broad masses of the people, so that the people can fully understand the government's policies and have the opportunity to express and provide opinions on the government's policies. Therefore, establishing organs of public opinion is a necessity that must be realized as soon as possible. Taking Shanghai as an example, since the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, although it cannot be said to be a genuine organ of public opinion and there are still many areas where it has not been able to fully exert the mission of an organ of public opinion, in practice, it has made considerable achievements in cooperating with the municipal government's policy implementation and in providing suggestions for alleviating the people's hardships.

The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee was facilitated by Chairman Chen Dai during his tenure as Mayor of Shanghai, which further demonstrates Chairman Chen Dai's emphasis on organs of public opinion. Now that Chairman Chen Dai is in charge of central government affairs, we hope even more that central organs of public opinion can be established as soon as possible. At the same time, local organs of public opinion at all levels can also be established simultaneously. It is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Government is actively preparing to establish a public consultation mechanism, and it is hoped that other provinces will follow suit.

### Casual Chats from the Veranda

— Yoshida Toyosuke

The Soviet Union and the Chinese Revolution

Q: But if the Soviet Union does not participate in the Pacific War and the Pacific War is declared over, will the position established by the CCP in this war not also be eliminated? As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan ends, Chongqing will immediately prepare to launch a civil war in order to unify the country. The CCP also made this a major issue to discuss at the Seventh National Congress. Mao Zedong once stated in Dagongbao: "After the Chongqing Kuomintang government relies on American power to defeat Japan, it will repeat the same ugly drama of the Greek government-in-exile borrowing the strength of the country to eliminate the Greek guerrillas, slaughtering our compatriots." If the Soviet Union were to send troops to China to save the CCP from this misfortune, would not Soviet participation in the Pacific War itself be the most likely way to reduce friction between the Kuomintang and the Communists?

A: Of course, the Soviet Union hopes that the like-minded CCP will become the master of China. However, the Soviet Union also knows that the currently recognized government of China is Chongqing, not Yan'an. No matter how the CCP says that the Chongqing government is a bad government that has been abandoned by the people, as long as Chongqing has the recognition of the people as its government, Soviet aid to Yan'an and hostility towards Chongqing will be regarded as interfering in China's internal affairs. Therefore, no matter how concerned the Soviet Union is about the Chinese revolution, Stalin has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries by force. The Chinese revolution, viewed from any perspective, is unanimously recognized as the most dominant factor in the liberation of Asia. The Chinese revolution is closely and inseparably related to the independence and liberation of India. As long as the Chinese revolution succeeds, India will naturally get rid of the shackles of Britain. If the British Empire loses India, it will actually be equivalent to the aristocracy losing their hereditary fiefdom and becoming paupers. Therefore, when the Soviet Union was still under the influence of Trotsky's "permanent revolution theory," it regarded the Chinese revolution as the most important issue in the Soviet Union's world revolution policy. Since Stalin negated Trotsky's "permanent revolution theory" and raised the banner of "building socialism in one country," the Chinese revolution has been removed from the Soviet Union's main concern. However, it goes without saying that the Chinese revolution is still one of the Soviet Union's most important issues. No matter how much Stalin cares about the revolutions of small countries, he believes that the responsibility for the Chinese revolution still lies with the Chinese people themselves. If, as the Chinese Communist Party says, the Chongqing government is a coalition government of landlords, warlords, and capitalists and must be overthrown, then the execution of this task lies with the broad masses of the Chinese people themselves. For example, someone declares "not to recognize Chiang Kai-shek," but as long as Chiang Kai-shek is in fact supported by the Chinese people, then Chiang Kai-shek's regime is still the government of China. Therefore, the position taken by the Soviet Union is that the Chinese revolution should be carried out by the Chinese people themselves according to their own needs. Communism can certainly be said to be the doctrine that has transformed previously defeated Russia into today's victorious Soviet Union, but it is absolutely impossible to allow China to accept this communism without any changes. Although there is a faction of communism in China with the same name, it must be specifically adapted to China's objective economic conditions and developed and promoted by the Chinese themselves. Historically, it can be seen that even progressive and outstanding political ideas, when forcibly imported into a country where economic conditions are not yet fully developed, are not accepted by the people of that country, but are instead desperately resisted. Napoleon's occupation of Spain is one example. After Napoleon destroyed the old political system of Spain, he wanted to implement the new system of the French Revolution in Spain. However, the Spanish people regarded Napoleon, who called himself a "liberator," as an invader of another race, and armed uprisings broke out everywhere. As a result, the modern army of France, which was then considered the world's best, was driven out of the country by the guerrillas of the Spanish people. Later, this war method became more and more noticeable to the world. Today, guerrilla warfare is called "Guerilla warfare," which actually comes from the French word "Cuerilus." The initial meaning of the word referred to the war in Spain at that time. This is straying too far from the topic. To return to the topic, Stalin is probably unlikely to imitate Napoleon and repeat the Spanish historical drama in China!

Is a Compromise Possible Between Japan and Chongqing?

Q: But you also admit that since the Soviet Union hopes that the CCP will control China, it will naturally oppose the conclusion of a comprehensive peace between Chongqing and Japan. Therefore, when Chongqing wants to compromise with Japan, the Soviet Union will definitely use some means to prevent and disrupt it. Based on this point, when a comprehensive peace between Chongqing and Japan seems likely, perhaps the Soviet Union will use participation in the war to prevent it from being realized!

A: At present, the Soviet Union believes that a comprehensive peace between the Chongqing regime and Japan is impossible. Because, first of all, according to the current situation, it is impossible for Chongqing and Japan to make peace separately, while the United States and Japan are still at war. Second, the Soviet Union knows that there is no room for compromise between the current war leaders of the United States and the leaders of Japan. We will explore the first issue in more detail.

In general, people believe that the Chongqing government's foreign policy has long been following Washington's lead for the past two or three years. I do not deny the burgeoning nationalist forces in China by saying this. Even if two or three leaders in Chongqing are bought by the United States and the policies of Chongqing are controlled by them, if such a national policy endangers China's independence and autonomy, the Chinese people will never stop there, and at the same time, the Chongqing government will not be able to extinguish all the elements of domestic dissatisfaction. Even if Chongqing's diplomacy formally seems to be following Washington's decision, it can only be implemented without hindrance when it is beneficial to China's independence and autonomy. If it deviates from this line, it will inevitably cause fierce criticism from intellectuals, causing it to return to its original line. This is a depiction of the current situation in Chongqing. On this point, Chongqing's diplomacy can still be said to be determined by Chongqing itself. Someone will definitely think that the Sino-Japanese separate peace may be possible as long as China’s diplomatic policies are determined by Chongqing itself and not by Washington. But my view is just the opposite. Precisely because Chongqing's diplomacy is not determined by Washington, a negative conclusion is reached, that is, under the current situation, a separate peace is more impossible. It is true that some people in Chongqing can imagine that after Japan is destroyed, the United States will take off its mask of hypocrisy towards China in the past and reveal its original ferocious face. These people also believe that it is tantamount to an ant trying to stop a cart if they rely solely on the strength of Chongqing to deal with the United States in the future. So, they want to prepare for a rainy day and seek a compromise with Japan first (in this case, they think that Japan is an anti-aggressor). However, under the current circumstances, Japan only wants to fight to the death with the United States, then Chongqing has no room to consider a compromise. Even if there are still such compromisers in the Chongqing authorities to some extent now, it is impossible to make China's national policy move in this direction.

Is a Compromise Possible Between Japan and the US?

Now, let's talk about the second question. Then, is there any possibility of a compromise between the United States and Japan? Some people place this hope in the contradiction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States in solving European problems, and in the development of the Yalta Conference’s contradictions. Of course, no one can deny that there are contradictions between the policies of the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. Some parts of the British and American ruling class are extremely afraid of the rise of the Soviet Union in their hearts. This is a fact. These people feel that after the Soviet Union becomes strong, it will affect the gradual disintegration of their own territory. In contrast, Britain and the United States have actually had their markets taken away by Japan: Shanghai, Hong Kong, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and even India. In the eyes of British and American rulers, the threat from the Soviet Union is a matter of tomorrow, while the threat from Japan is a matter of today. Their contradictions with the Soviet Union can only be put on the agenda after their contradictions with Japan have been resolved. However, their contradictions with Japan cannot be said to be able to be solved at a leisurely pace. So, no matter how big their contradictions with the Soviet Union are, they have to erupt, but they have to end after the anti-Japanese war. This point has already been clearly explained in the anti-German war. Hitler fell into a point of no return because he overestimated Churchill's anti-communist tendencies. Hitler sent Hess to Britain to propose an anti-Soviet united front to Churchill. Churchill immediately promised to let Germany move north to oppose the Soviet Union. On the other hand, he informed Stalin of Germany's conspiracy. Hitler, who was less direct than Churchill, always overestimated the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, even at the last moment before his demise, he only offered unconditional surrender to the United States and Britain. Its tragic outcome has already been told to people all over the world. Although I firmly believe that the contradictions between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain will only increase day by day, the contradictions between Japan and the war leaders of Britain and the United States, who are determined to win, are greater. Therefore, since the Pacific War has reached the final decisive stage, Japan and Britain and the United States will never conclude a compromise because of the future threat of the Soviet Union. Since the compromise between Japan and the United States and Chongqing is impossible, naturally the question of whether the Soviet Union is preventing the compromise will not arise at all.

### Javanese Marquis Granted Japanese Medal

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – His Majesty the Emperor of Japan has granted the Second Class Order of the Sacred Treasure on June 1 to a Javanese marquis for his cooperation with the Japanese military administration. The award was announced by the Decoration Bureau on the 23rd.

### US House Passes New Army Budget

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – The US House Budget Committee formally passed the Army Department's proposed new fiscal year budget of $28.527 billion on the 22nd. During the meeting, US Chief of Staff Marshall stated that reorganizing the Army forces for the war against Japan is an urgent task. To save manpower and war materials and to live up to the trust of the American people, we must actively launch a strong offensive against Japan. The current Army Department authorities are planning to significantly increase troop strength.

### American Military Operations - Damage Statistics

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's casualties in the Okinawa operations are increasing daily, leading to widespread debate within their ranks regarding responsibility for the operations. Furthermore, the successive deaths of high-ranking enemy commanders are on the rise, causing exceptional distress to the enemy. Even according to the enemy's false and reduced figures, as of the end of the previous year, the Gilbert Islands operation, which lasted about a month, resulted in the loss of 115,000 American soldiers on both the European and Asian fronts. The increase in casualties on the European front during the following year was roughly twice as high. From the beginning of last year to June 5th, with the commencement of the Biak Island landing operation and the second European front, the increase was only 108,000 in half a year. However, from the Hollandia landing and the Tinian Island landing operations, and with the intensification of the enemy's Pacific offensive, the total reached 207,000 by July 7th. By August 6th, it further increased to 253,000, and by October 6th, it reached 385,000. In this period of less than three months, the enemy's losses more than tripled. After the landing on Leyte Island on October 20th, in about half a month, by November 7th, the figure was already 454,000, and by December 14th, it reached 540,000. This year, the heavy casualties suffered during the Iwo Jima landing operation, according to the enemy's figures, amounted to 809,587 by the end of March. On April 1st, the landing operation on Okinawa Island began, and the enemy's losses reached 1,017,090 by June 15th. Furthermore, with 232,147 deaths as of June 1st, the enemy's total losses during its Pacific offensive, which began with the Saipan landing last June, aimed at the "mainland," increased tenfold in one year, with the number of deaths increasing roughly eightfold. This is more than twice the total losses from February of the previous year to June of last year, covering approximately one year. From this, it is clear that the enemy's losses have been rapidly increasing in the past year. As the enemy army approaches the Japanese mainland, the bloodshed will continue to increase. Therefore, their calls for a landing on the Japanese mainland and their forceful, indiscriminate bombing tactics are merely attempts to conceal the painful lesson of such immense bloodshed from their own camp.

### Actual Situation of the Youth Army in Chongqing

Central News Agency Dispatch: The Chongqing authorities, recognizing that achieving the goals of resisting Japan and saving the nation depends on the rise of patriotic youth, began recruiting a Youth Army last year. To date, six divisions, including the 202nd, 204th, 207th, 208th, and 209th Divisions, totaling approximately 100,000 troops, have been formed and deployed to various locations, including Ganzhou, Hanzhong, Bin County, and Kunming. However, the actual situation of this Youth Army remains a question. Recently, the Huaxi Daily, published in Xi'an, revealed some information, which was also severely criticized by the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency. A summary of the main points is as follows: In October of last year, the Chongqing Kuomintang, seeking to bolster the strength of its party army, used the slogans of resisting Japan and loving the country to attract young people, convincing them that China could not achieve new life and independence unless young people joined the military. They mobilized all party organs and propaganda groups to carry out large-scale activities. By the end of the year, the number of recruits still did not reach half of the projected quota. They quickly changed their original policy, and even those who were overage or physically unqualified were given lenient acceptance, and the deadline was extended. The qualifications for joining the military were lowered to a junior high school education. Rumors were spread that schools would be closed. Still feeling that it was not enough, they resorted to forced lottery and assignment methods to form an army of 100,000 soldiers. Consequently, there were many 15-year-old elementary school students, and even children's platoons were formed. In recent years, forced recruitment has continued in various places. The preferential conditions habitually used by Chongqing for recruitment were: All treatment is the same as that of the US military stationed in Chongqing, with supplies of butter, bread, and American cigarettes. Free admission to American movies. A temporary allowance of ten thousand yuan is given to the family upon enlistment. Priority for future study in the United States. For young people in professional fields who are willing to join the military, their original salary is paid monthly by their former employer. The names of those who join the military are engraved on steles and preserved in their hometown. Guarantees are provided by the military authorities, etc. These are all empty promises and empty reputations. Chiang Kai-shek himself expressed that he regarded this Youth Army as his own children, protecting them as his own hands and feet, to encourage them. But in reality, the family allowances and preferential treatment for this recruited Youth Army placed a huge burden on the general population. For example, Shaanxi Province was assigned a quota of 400 million yuan, with each household having to bear 20,000 yuan. Moreover, Youth Army soldiers had their money illegally deducted by local military authorities when receiving payments, preventing them from receiving the full amount stipulated by the central government. Travel expenses and family allowances were originally set at 55,000 yuan, but suddenly reduced to only 30,000 yuan upon departure. This was apparently due to cadres collecting "handling fees" and enriching themselves. Various places held consolation and send-off rallies for the youth who enlisted in the military, but the funds raised by the county governments for these rallies all vanished, with less than one-tenth of the funds being used for their original purpose. Family allowances were also difficult to obtain. As a result, most soldiers strongly protested and sent letters to non-Chongqing-affiliated newspapers to protest to the government. Once enlisted, young people were forcibly made to join the Chongqing Kuomintang en masse. If they refused to join the party, they would be punished on the grounds of "bad character," and even assassinated. Such incidents have been exposed in several places. Chongqing relies on assassination to urgently "supplement the army," but the truly righteous Chinese youth cannot be deceived. This is a desperate trick by Chongqing to prevent youth from rebelling, but the effect is just the opposite. Whether the Youth Army is qualified for front-line service is still questionable, and it only has propaganda value. From this, one can see the anguish of Chongqing.

### Belgian Political Leaders Meet with the King

A New Phase of the Political Situation Will Unfold

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to reports received here, the problem of forming a new Belgian government, which has been in a stalemate for a week, may be resolved within days. Seven important political party leaders from Belgium were summoned to Salzburg, Austria, to discuss various serious issues with King Leopold. Now, various sectors in Brussels are eagerly awaiting the return of the seven political leaders, while speculating on the information they will bring back after their discussions with Leopold. There are three possibilities: They will bring back the news of King Leopold's decision to abdicate. Leopold may ask the current Prime Minister, Agan, to continue holding all powers until the election, and then decide on various measures according to public opinion. King Leopold will refuse to abdicate and demand that the Catholic political party maintain its current power and form a provisional government until after the election, and then make a decision.

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to the Brussels Gazette, Belgian Ambassador to London, Lord Makin, has just proceeded to meet with King Leopold in Salzburg for talks. It is generally believed that this move will help to ease the tense situation in Belgium's cabinet formation.

### Delineation of French Occupation Zone

Bern, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to news received here, the French occupation zone in Germany was delineated some time ago, including the lower part of the Rhineland, Saarland, most of the Baden region, Rhineland-Palatinate, a corridor in Huldenberg and Bavaria, and the entire Vorarlberg region of Austria. The delineation of this occupation zone will result in the withdrawal of French troops from Bavaria and part of Huldenberg to make way for American troops.

### Britain's Near East Policy - France Expresses Doubt - Lebanese Youth Demonstrate Against France

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent yesterday, although the British government issued a statement on Friday, stating that "although the British troops stationed in Lebanon intervened in the French-Syrian dispute, there was no intention to squeeze out the French troops," the French authorities inevitably remain suspicious of the British government's attitude, especially during the recent discussions in the French Parliament regarding the issue of Lebanon, where all officials doubted the British government's position. A journalist from the French "Compeed" newspaper criticized his government, saying, "Currently, the British government is working day and night to try to infiltrate Lebanon, and this insidious policy is continuing to be implemented, but London is insincerely and repeatedly guaranteeing its legitimate position." Therefore, Paris is currently ignoring the British government's proposal for a joint meeting.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Beirut: On Thursday night, the first anti-French demonstration took place in Lebanon, at Ras Baalbek, north of the historical site of Baalbek. It is said that late that night, more than a dozen Lebanese youths rushed to the posts of a small number of French troops to demonstrate. As a result, one flag was broken, but otherwise there was no damage. Afterwards, the demonstrators were dispersed by the local military police.

### Second Security Conference

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a British journalist, news was received from authoritative sources in San Francisco that the second "United Nations Security Conference" will be held in London in mid-August.

The National Government's Reform of Grain Policy Achieves Good Results - Four Suggestions for the Purchase Policy

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the National Government authorities, in order to facilitate smooth grain transportation and stabilize the people's food supply, decisively abolished the restrictions on grain movement from the 16th of this month, and stopped the purchase work of the Rice Management Committee and all state-owned entities, the source of grain in Nanjing and Shanghai has become more abundant than before, and the black market price has also stopped rising and started to fall. The situation is generally good, and people's hearts are also stabilized. At the same time, the people are deeply concerned about the government's future grain administration. Because this measure is a temporary emergency countermeasure, the authorities have not announced what kind of policies will be adopted when the new grain comes on the market, but the people hope that Changju can understand the advantages and disadvantages of the past and reform them. The fact that such effects can be obtained after the implementation of the emergency measures for grain this time proves the abnormality of the previous policies. Therefore, after the new grain comes on the market, it is hoped that the rich bureaus, in addition to blockading the enemy areas, will be able to relax the degree of unified restriction in the peaceful areas. At the same time, the following suggestions are made to the authorities for future purchase policies: The purchase mechanisms must be unified and concentrated, and unified collection and distribution must be implemented by a unified institution. Military grain needs must be reduced to the minimum extent, and it should also be bought, sold, collected and distributed by a unified institution. The purchase price must take into account the cost of farmers, and it should be possible to carry out material exchange as much as possible, and not purchase with a large amount of currency, so as not to cause vicious inflation. In the autumn when the new grain comes on the market, it should be purchased in time, and avoid procrastination and wait-and-see.

### What I Saw and Heard in Changshu

— Xiang Su

Changshu is located north of the Yangtze River, facing Nantong, and adjacent to the counties of Su, Xi, Cheng, and Kun. The Xi-Hu Highway runs horizontally across it. Changshu is a vital communication hub for both river and land transportation. It has long been known as a land of culture, a land of fish and rice, and a rich area. Furthermore, it has a superior geographical environment, so the current population of the entire territory is concentrated to over 900,000 people.

Since the war, there have been no major military actions. Also, because external transportation is not very developed, modern civilization has not been popularized. This county has always been a famous cultural place, a former home of string music. Therefore, thoughts are feudal, habits are leisurely, and after work, people sip tea in tea gardens. Every festival, there are often scholars and poets who feast and write in harmony beside the beautiful scenery.

Scenery and Historical Sites

There are many famous scenic spots and historical sites, such as the tombs of Yanzi and Zhongyong, which are the burial places of the ancient sages Ziyou and Zhongyong, located on the northern side of Yushan, at Xiaosantai, which have pavilions for rest. Yushan is located one mile northwest of the city, in the center of the entire territory. It is named after Zhongyong, who lived here in ancient times. It is a famous scenic spot for tourism in Jiangnan. Jilue said: "This mountain is steep and towering, and its jagged state is fully displayed in the west. The seclusion of deep cliffs and valleys is unique in the north. To the west, a mountain pond surrounds it, and Shang Lake is like a belt, and tourists mostly enjoy the sight of boats full of books. To the north, there are slender bamboos and clear springs, and long forests and secluded valleys, and tourists mostly imagine old-age retreats." This statement captures the essence of Yushan. On top of Yushan, there is the Sanfeng Temple, named after the third peak of Yushan. It is an ancient temple from the Tang Dynasty, also known as Qingliang Temple. The Weimo Temple is known for its height. A local resident named Qu Zizhu renovated the Wanghai Tower to watch the sunrise at dawn. It is one of the eighteen views of Yushan." In addition, there are also Jianmen, Shang Lake, and Xiaoyao Bi, which are all historical sites.

Today, the northern foot of Yushan has been developed into Beixin Park, and the eastern foot has been developed into Yushan Park. The layout is elegant and the scenery is pleasant. From morning to night, tourists gather. Some wealthy families spend the whole day in the park's tea rooms, and the warriors who are fighting for the country in the war-torn field are long forgotten.

A Glimpse of the Market

The city is about nine li in circumference, with seven gates. The northwest side crosses Mount Lu. The areas in the city in front of the Temple, in front of the New County, and in front of the County are the most prosperous. Banks, hotels, restaurants, and tea gardens are clustered here. The Peibian Jicui Garden is a relatively good hotel. Every week on their days off, most people gather here to gamble and have fun. The cloth merchants gather in the east of the city. The storefronts of general cloth shops are decorated in various colors, like movie theaters. The rice merchants gather in the south of the city. Residents like to sip tea, and tea gardens such as Lake Garden and Wangshanxuan are always full of customers. Most of the transport docks are in the southwest two gates.

Mocheng is located west of Kuncheng Lake. It is the place where Mo Qi and Zhu Zhao were cast. Fushan is thirty-six li away from the swamp. Changfu Shantangren Jiang's mouth is a gathering place for boats and ships, and the population is dense. Whenever there is fish news, there are even more merchants.

Education and Public Opinion

Changshu's culture has always been well-developed, and the current elementary education is also quite remarkable. However, judging from the total number of school-age children in the county, the number of children who are out of school accounts for about eight-tenths. In the past, there was only one county-run junior high school for secondary education. Since 1942, when Changshu began to reform the education system, secondary education has been reorganized many times and has become slightly typical. The school education and sports in Yi County rank second among the three provinces of Su, Xi, and Chang.

In recent months, due to economic difficulties, unstable environment, and parents being confused by rumors, the family management of children has also been poor, resulting in deep absenteeism and low levels of academic performance among students in various schools. Although the school authorities have repeatedly taken precautions, the effect has been minimal.

The salaries of teachers are generally meager, with a maximum of 17,000 to 18,000 per month, plus three dou of salary rice, but the distribution is indefinite. At present, teachers are generally divided into three categories: one is those who teach for education, who are generally from good families and do not care about the amount of salary; one is those who teach for a living, who must be exacting about their salary and must be paid on time every month; and another is those who are highly educated and must be hired by the school with a large sum of money.

"Freedom of speech in Changshu is quite restricted. Recently, a gentleman published a language in the Changshu Daily, which recognized illegal behavior. The person was dissatisfied, and was subsequently detained. As a result, the matter was settled with a fine and an apology. In short, the "pen" is not as hard as the "gun."

### The Financial Market in the City was Stable Last Week. Rice Prices Rose Again After Falling.

The financial market in Shanghai, in the past week, under the emergency management of the authorities and the continued issuance of the fourth phase of gold securities by the Central Reserve, and the payment of the second phase of gold was imminent, the previous storm was suppressed, and speculators began to withdraw. Therefore, the private market was changed from rising to leveling off, and moved towards stability. Although it rebounded on Saturday, it was still smaller than the opening on Monday. Silver did not rise as much as it had in the past. The fluctuations of public bonds were very different, and buying and selling transactions gradually narrowed, because speculators were afraid of danger. Hua shares showed mixed gains and losses. Because the silver money industry handled the settlement at the end of June, the money supply was tight, and both long and short sales showed a wait-and-see attitude. Retail transactions also did not dare to move arbitrarily. From Monday to Wednesday, they were all hovering. After a general rise on Thursday, they fell again on Friday, and the closing on Saturday showed a slight rise. The Stock Exchange of the China Merchants Bureau attached great importance to the short selling transactions of brokers, and wanted to correct the illegal buying and selling in the stock market to achieve a sound investment path. In the recent week, the industrial and commercial sectors seem to be turning for the better. After the National Government took emergency measures on rice and abolished the restrictions on rice movement, and at the same time, the Allied forces stopped buying military rice, rice prices immediately turned around. The self-rice that exceeded the 100 mark once fell sharply to the 60 mark. On Friday and Saturday, it rose again to within the 80 mark. If the rice dealers were not secretly selling and hoarding, it seems that the rice would not rise again. After the grain and flour industry groups held public sales at parity prices and the extra household powder allocation began, the prices of miscellaneous grains and flour also fell. Although the price of oil has fallen slightly, the prices of daily necessities have not fallen with the price of rice, but have risen in disguise. The door sale price tags of various companies and shops are still often changed to increase prices. This is indeed a law to suppress and equalize the prices of goods by the authorities. It is hoped that the municipal economic authorities will pay close attention and strictly investigate and deal with it, especially the general illegal merchants, who take the opportunity to issue cash-out orders that are difficult to obtain cash, and secretly add premiums one after another, and the citizens are invisibly damaged.

### Money Industry Revises Check Return Time

The check return time of the silver money industry in this city was determined in the spring of this year to resume the previous method from Monday to Friday, until 7:00 PM, and until 5:00 PM on Saturday. Now, the industry association, because the business hours of the members of the industry have been changed to 1:00 PM from Monday to Saturday since the 18th of this month, which is two hours earlier than before, and the check return time of the industry has also been advanced to 5:00 PM, but the association believes that the check return time is too late, and it is inevitable to wait for a long time. If it is raised too early, it is inconvenient for the industry. Therefore, it was decided that from the 21st of this month, the check return time of the industry will be changed to 6:00 PM from Monday to Saturday, and all members have been notified to comply.

### News from Changshu

(Continued from the first page) Rich in Products

Rich in Products

The county has a total of more than 1.7 million mu of arable land, of which 1.1 million mu are paddy fields. Therefore, agricultural products have always been the main products, with an annual output of more than 2.2 million dan. The sandy land in the northeast is rich in cotton, with more than 45,000 mu of cotton fields, with an annual output of more than 80,000 dan. The best is produced in Changyinsha. There are slight sericulture benefits in the western township, with an annual output of about 400,000 catties. The river near the Yangtze River is often flooded, so aquatic products are extremely rich. Many people rely on fishing nets for their livelihoods. Yangcheng Lake crabs and Huangyidang water caltrops are special products. Watermelons produced in Meili Xitang are the most famous. There are also those who pound osmanthus into mud and form pills, which are carved with extremely fine details, called osmanthus fragrant beads, which are precious items.

Other products, such as the villagers in the southeast township, weave bamboo into hats, which are necessary for farmers in various counties, and are sold widely. Green-haired turtles and Ziyang are both special products of Chushan, with low yields. The green-haired turtles raised in the Camellia Garden on Hanbei Men Street have hairs that are an inch long, like green moss. The best ones are worth 50,000 to 60,000 yuan each, and they are said to be used as gifts, but there are many fakes sold.

People's Suffering

There is a police station in Shanqian. The monthly salary of the policeman is only a few hundred yuan, and there is no rice allowance. Therefore, they move around and set up checkpoints, making things difficult for travelers and merchants. Hupu, Fushan, and Liuhe are their main crossings. During the period when fish are listed, there are more checkpoints. All fishing boats passing through the card, whether full or empty, officially licensed or smuggled, must lean on the boat to pass, otherwise they will make excuses to make things difficult. If there is any defense, they will use fists and feet. In addition, after the harvest, farmers are often arbitrarily seized of their hard-earned income in the name of collecting donations, regardless of the future life of the farmers. Such behavior is common.

Some military and police officers use their position to smuggle rice and grain in rural areas, reaching 500,000 to 600,000 dan per month, which is a huge amount, affecting the purchase of military rice. When farmers cannot pay enough for the purchase amount, they buy it from other places and pay it. Therefore, the price of rice in the rice-producing area is often slightly higher than in the urban area, which is also an abnormal phenomenon.

Sand Field Disputes

Due to the relationship between the water flow of the Yangtze River. Every year, about 100 mu of arable land is generated. Several thousand mu of sand beaches grow along the Yangtze River in Changshu every year. The soil of the beach is fertile and can be planted without fertilizer for five years, so it is most suitable for growing cotton, and rice can be produced after three years. After the sand beach grows, it must be built with earth dikes before it can be cultivated. At present, there are three major companies, namely, Welfare, Houde, and Feng, that operate sand fields, and there are many other small companies. They have obtained business licenses from the Ministry of Finance. The value of each mu of sand field is about eight dan of soybeans, and the average is four or five dan.

After the beach grows, those who are tricky can get the enclosed field without any effort, that is, they apply for a license from the Ministry of Finance on one hand, and exchange the enclosed field project with the farmers in the name of the right to cultivate. When the ministry's license is issued, the field is also enclosed. Generally, when the mountain will be enclosed but the license has not been issued, the ministry's license is sold to the farmers. After that, the license is applied to the Ministry of Finance again in the name of replacing the field. It is said that the right to this field still belongs to him, and he must pay for the license again, so disputes arise one after another and continue throughout the year.

If the Land Bureau actively rectifies it, this is indeed a new way to increase agricultural production.

### How to Eliminate the Evil Practice of Discounting: Tighten Currency While Increasing Cash Issuance

— Mu Gong

Shanghai is now in a contradictory financial state. For example, due to the high price increase, it is necessary to tighten the currency, but on the other hand, due to the lack of cash, it is necessary to increase the issuance of tokens. In such a contradictory environment, it is indeed difficult to cope with.

Here, let us first study the types of currency or tokens. Currency in a broad sense does not only refer to cash. It includes all instruments such as checks, drafts, and promissory notes, and the currently popular allocation is also a similar type. Therefore, the so-called currency includes cash, checks, drafts, promissory notes, and allocation orders. According to this statement, the financial situation described in the first section is not very contradictory, because what is required to be tightened refers to all currencies, and what is required to be increased is one of the currencies - cash. With this explanation, it may be possible to find a two-pronged countermeasure: that is, tighten other currencies and increase cash issuance.

With the skyrocketing prices, people already feel overwhelmed, and encountering a lack of cash and being exploited by discounts is really breathless. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will absolutely prohibit discounting in order to reduce a part of the malicious cash hoarding and most of the well-intentioned hoarding (malicious hoarding refers to seeking profits through discounting, and well-intentioned hoarding is to avoid suffering losses from discounting). At the same time, please issue a large amount of new banknotes. In order to facilitate even the immediate issuance of 10,000 yuan banknotes, the Executive Yuan has already approved it.

The issuance of cash is to increase the amount of currency, and tightening the currency is relative. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to remedy other currencies. This remedy can be said to be simple, that is, please tighten the lending of the Central Bank. This method has been implemented several times and has been very effective. However, the tightening is loosened again, so that the effect is seen and then disappears.

Among the above-mentioned instruments, there is a newly discovered and very popular allocation order, and its position is quite questionable. The so-called allocation order is a bill for the Yin Qian industry to allocate funds to the Central Bank or the public association, which is specially used to adjust the difference between the same industry. However, now various banks and money houses actually use it instead of cash as a customer's payment, which is beyond its essence, not only violating the bill law (the bill law has no name for allocation order), but also encroaching on the status of the legal currency, so it is hoped that it will be corrected and stopped, and its circulation in the hands of outsiders will be banned. In terms of the frequent occurrence of allocation order disputes recently, it can be seen that its malpractices are numerous. It is impossible to immediately prohibit it.

### Ways to Eliminate Discounting

— Yun

Reading the newspaper, the city's economic police recently dispatched all of them, and have successively arrested dozens of criminals who illegally discounted, all of whom have been detained pending strict handling. In addition, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Bank, in order to stabilize the financial situation, has found the true evidence of illegal discounting in a certain financial institution, and immediately presented it to the ministry for strict handling. The general public must be very happy to hear this news, and the practice of discounting may be slightly reduced in the future, but the phenomenon of cash shortage may be difficult to eliminate for a while. How to solve the current crisis, I think the authorities already have considerable specific methods and a continuous determination to severely crack down on discounting. As a member of the public, the reader is sincerely looking forward to the Bureau to take emergency arrangements for cracking down on discounting, in order to achieve further results. Here are a few points to provide to the authorities for reference:

Thoroughly investigate the cash deposits of each bank and village and the actual number of daily payments: if any private hoarding of cash and illegal discounting are found, they should be severely punished according to law to warn others.

Adjust the amount of cash received by each bank and village: the Central Bank should plan in a holistic manner according to the actual needs of each bank and village and the market conditions. The cash supply to each bank and village should be as lenient as possible to make reasonable adjustments, so that the cash guide code of each bank and village is sufficient to pay the minimum amount of deposits and withdrawals of depositors.

Specify the minimum limit for depositors to withdraw cash from each bank and village: At present, the limit for depositors to withdraw cash from each bank and village is generally 5,000 yuan per day, that is, at most 30,000 yuan per week, which is too low. In my opinion, the minimum amount per household must be widened to more than 100,000 yuan per week, and 30,000 to 50,000 yuan can be withdrawn each time. In this way, there can be a reasonable supply for the cash needs of small depositors, and financial institutions have clearly defined limits, and there will no longer be arbitrary restrictions on withdrawals and the abuse of allocation orders.

Strictly restrict the development of allocation orders: The issuance of allocation orders was originally intended to facilitate the payment of huge amounts of funds between banks and villages, but generally financial institutions have changed to paying allocation orders for depositors' withdrawals due to the lack of cash. This is actually a temporary measure, but unexpectedly, some financial operators took the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, deliberately concealing cash, and operating discounting transactions with high interest rates above 20%. On the one hand, they restricted deposits and withdrawals and abused allocation orders, which led to the current situation. For the present plan, the authorities should re-investigate the content and business conditions of each bank and village, and strictly define the qualifications for issuing allocation orders. Those who are suspected of disturbing the financial situation should have their qualifications for issuing allocation orders cancelled. Secondly, the amount of allocation orders issued should also be restricted. Each bank and village issues at most a certain amount of money per day, and the face value of each allocation order should also be restricted accordingly, stipulating that only allocation orders above 10,000 yuan or 50,000 yuan are allowed to be issued. Such small-amount allocation orders can be reduced, so that there will no longer be 3,000 to 5,000 yuan allocation orders circulating in the market. For payments below 10,000 yuan, each bank and village will have to pay in cash, which is also an effective measure to eliminate discounting.

The above is just my personal opinion. As for how to implement the emergency arrangements specifically, I sincerely hope that the wise authorities will implement them effectively with the means of cutting the Gordian knot, so that the entire financial institution can be restored to stability, and the lives of ordinary people can be spared from further threats. I can't help but look forward to it.

### China Child Welfare Association Appeals to All Sectors for Donations

The Shanghai China Child Welfare Association, in order to promote the work of rescuing refugee children, will launch this year's expanded fundraising campaign starting today. The target is set at 50 million yuan, for a period of one month, from the 25th of this month to the 24th of July. During the fundraising period, in addition to the association (1231 Daxing Road) directly receiving donations, Jin Cheng Bank and Xinhua also receive donations. The association currently maintains two places, the Shanghai Child Welfare Training Institute and the Upstream Refugee Child Training Institute, with a total of more than 300 orphans. At a time when prices are soaring and expenses are extremely difficult, it is really difficult to continue. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will generously donate, so that the association's training work can continue to advance, then benefiting children is really not insignificant.

### Hope to Find a Way to Dispose of Garbage Accumulation

Recently, many garbage trucks have been carrying garbage from all over the place and accumulating it on Shandong Road Ningbo Road. During this summer, listening to the sun and rain, the odor is overflowing, and mosquitoes and flies are breeding, which is harmful to the health of citizens. I hope that the municipal health authorities will find a way to dispose of it as soon as possible, then the citizens will be very fortunate. (Huang Jiaxu)
