### Marshall Departs Shanghai for Nanjing Yesterday, Chairman and Madame Chiang Welcome Him at the Airport

[Central News Agency, This City] Marshal Marshall, who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon, flew to Nanjing with General Wedemeyer at 2:00 PM yesterday to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. Several hours before leaving Shanghai, Marshall held an important meeting with top US military officials at the US military headquarters in the Construction Building. Marshall's stay in Shanghai totaled 24 hours. Before his departure, strict security was temporarily enforced from Sichuan Road to Jiangwan Road, as well as within four to five miles of Jiangwan Airport, guarded by Chinese and American military police. After Marshall's arrival in Shanghai, the US military here placed great hopes on him. One US military officer wished: "May China be safe and well, and may America be safe and well."

[This Newspaper] Mayor Qian Dajun, accompanied by US Ambassador to China General Marshall and Chief of Staff General He Yingqin, flew to Nanjing yesterday afternoon to meet Chairman Chiang and discuss everything. Mayor Kai is scheduled to return to Shanghai within days.

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang and US Special Envoy to China, Five-Star General Marshall, shook hands and exchanged greetings at the dusty Nanjing Airport at 3:15 PM today, marking the prelude to their initial historic talks. After their first meeting, Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall, together with Madame Chiang, drove to a tea party. Many believed that Chairman Chiang would, according to official custom, await the special envoy at his official residence in the city. However, Special Envoy Marshall, after a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Shanghai, stepped out of the gleaming C-54 aircraft. Just two minutes later, a large black sedan drove into the airport, and Chairman Chiang appeared, wearing a long, grassy-green military hat, leaving a deep impression. Marshall, in military uniform and wearing his five stars, saw Chairman Chiang. Both smiled and stepped forward, exchanging greetings and shaking hands warmly. Special Envoy Marshall said to Chairman Chiang's Chief of Staff and acting interpreter, General Shang Zhen, "Please tell His Excellency the Chairman that I am deeply honored." Chairman Chiang replied, "Welcome to Nanjing." This was the first meeting between Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall since the Cairo Conference. Madame Chiang, wearing an elegant brown otter fur coat, remained in the back seat of the car for about five minutes. Then, Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall, along with General Wedemeyer, the commander of the US military in China who had arrived on the same flight, walked to the car. Both Marshall and Wedemeyer shook hands with Madame Chiang. Madame Chiang sat between Chairman Chiang and the Special Envoy, and the car drove to the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, surrounded by red walls, where talks began.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman and Madame Chiang quietly arrived in a black sedan just as the plane carrying Special Envoy Marshall landed at the airport. They sat in the car while the welcoming party and photographers focused on the hatch of Marshal Marshall's plane. As he disembarked, shook hands with the welcoming party, and was surrounded by reporters, Chief of Staff Shang Zhen suddenly announced loudly, "Chairman Chiang has arrived!" Marshal Marshall was greatly excited upon hearing this and quickly walked towards the Chairman's car. Approaching the car, the Chairman alighted and shook hands with Marshal Marshall, repeatedly saying "Good, good, good" in Chinese. Marshal Marshall expressed his deep gratitude for the Chairman's hospitality and offered his best wishes. The airport security was provided by four truckloads of guards. Before Marshal Marshall's plane arrived, the US Air Force had been monitoring intelligence from the observation tower, appearing quite tense. After the plane arrived, everyone was happy and relaxed.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Special Envoy Marshall may go to Chongqing tomorrow with Chairman Chiang. It is reported that Marshall's office in Chongqing will be located in the US Embassy, and his residence will be No. 14 Jialing New Village, the former residence of General Wedemeyer. These two locations are very close to each other, both situated on a hillside, overlooking the Jialing River, with beautiful scenery.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang's headquarters held a tea party this afternoon, lasting 50 minutes. The hosts, Chairman and Madame Chiang, and distinguished guests Marshal Marshall, General Wedemeyer, and Acting Charg√© d'Affaires Robertson, were joined by Commander-in-Chief He, Minister Wang, Chief of Staff Shang, and Advisor Zhang Pingqun, among others. Chairman Chiang first expressed his welcome to Marshal Marshall, saying that he had hoped Marshall could visit China after the war before the end of the war. Now that he had come, it was a wish come true. Marshal Marshall then responded with words of thanks and reiterated the friendship between China and the United States.

### Important Talks Held in Shanghai, May Go to Chongqing with the Chairman Today

[This Newspaper] Before leaving Shanghai yesterday, Special Envoy Marshall went to the US military headquarters at around 9:00 AM to hold an important meeting, receiving a report from US military officer Gu. The meeting adjourned at noon. The night before, Special Envoy Marshall and General Wedemeyer had a separate meeting lasting more than two hours.

[United Press, Shanghai, 21st] US Special Envoy to China General Marshall arrived in Shanghai yesterday and, without resting, flew to Nanjing this morning to meet Chairman Chiang and carry out his mission to promote comprehensive peace in China. All of China, and most of the people in the East, are eagerly expecting this famous American wartime general to bring about an end to the disputes between factions, and together lead the largest nation in the Far East onto the path of revival, unity, prosperity, and strength. After Marshall's departure, about thirty foreign reporters and photographers traveled in the tail of his plane. Upon arriving in Nanjing, Chairman and Madame Chiang, who had arrived from the troubled heart of Beiping, waited to meet Marshall. The welcoming mood in Shanghai for this five-star general still lingered. Marshall was deeply moved by the crowds in Shanghai welcoming him on the streets, but seemed experienced in bearing the heavy responsibilities he carried. At a reception in the Cathay Hotel, he chatted happily with leaders from military, political, business, academic, and media circles for three hours without tiring. After resting for a night, he was full of energy this morning, but did not want to reveal his aspirations, only saying, "There is nothing to say at the moment." Looking at the quiet battlefield in North China, and the National Army's slow entry into Shenyang, it is said that at least part of this is related to Marshall's trip. This is because the conflicting parties are all "marking time," watching to see what contributions Marshall's trip will bring. At this time, General Wedemeyer, the commander of the US military in China, made a special broadcast to his subordinates, saying that the US military's stay in China would be longer than expected. Whether this coincidence with Marshall's arrival in Shanghai is related is unknown, but it is certain that all parties attach importance to it. At the same time, the reaction among the US military was, "We have to wait here until the war is over. The only person who won't send Marshall is to arrange for us to go home."

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] Amid frequent reports of renewed and intensified conflicts between the Nationalists and Communists in North China, the historic meeting between Chairman Chiang and General Marshall opened here tonight. Both China and the United States are looking forward to the outcome of this consultation in order to find a solution to China's internal disputes. In addition, the number and duration of US troops remaining in China, and the extent to which the National Government can obtain military and economic assistance from the United States, are all issues that remain to be resolved. It is generally believed that the primary issue that China wants to discuss with General Marshall is the transportation of more troops to the north.

### Chen Shaokuan Discusses Naval Construction

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Admiral Chen Shaokuan, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, in response to reporters' requests today, explained the Navy's contributions during the war of resistance and answered the following questions: Regarding China's naval construction, Chen said: Before the war, our navy had 600,000 tons. In the future, doubling this, or even more, may not be enough. We are already listed as one of the four great powers, and the total tonnage of our navy in the future should naturally bear a quarter of the responsibility of the world's navies. To maintain coastal security, cruisers and destroyers will be needed in the initial stage. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States built more tonnage in two or three years, four times that of the United Kingdom. In view of the United States' experience, future shipbuilding and talent training will be fast. The United States helped us during the war, and we will certainly welcome their assistance in the future. Regarding naval education, Chen said: The naval academy is currently in Chongqing, with more than 200 students. It is currently exam time, and the water level in the Sichuan River is low, so it has not yet moved east. The school site is being surveyed in Nanjing and Shanghai. Naval students graduate in five years and must undergo two years of shipboard training. In the future, the naval academy should be expanded in line with our navy. In addition, 1,000 people from our country have been sent to the United States to study naval affairs, 200 have gone to the United Kingdom to receive ships, and another 800 are preparing to go. Chen also explained that only dozens of people were included in this time's reception and reorganization of the puppet navy. As for the intercepting of naval officers and soldiers, there are only 30,000 at present, and there are no British or American advisors among them. Chen hopes to build ships on our own, but still hopes that the allies will provide more assistance, and pointed out that modern navies must have aircraft carriers. He expressed optimism about naval construction, and when asked about the time frame, Chen replied: If there is a determination to build a navy, two years is enough.

### More Than 10,000 of Our Laborers Return to Tianjin from Japan to Their Homes

[Associated Press, Beiping, 20th] After Japan's surrender, a total of 18,000 Chinese laborers who had been engaged in hard labor in Japan, in 14 batches, have returned to their homes via Tianjin.

### Increase Reconstruction and National Income, Five Unified Taxes Will Be Levied Next Year, Inspection Fees Will Also Be Collected for Exported Goods

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] It is reported that in order to increase revenue for reconstruction, the tax authorities plan to introduce unified taxes on the following items in the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946]: (1) Flour, (2) Tea, (3) Cement, (4) Furs, (5) Tin foil and superstitious paper. The budget figures are said to have been included in next year's budget, and implementation plans are currently being drafted.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] It is reported that when exporting goods, they must first be inspected by the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and a small inspection fee will be charged. The fees are as follows: Based on a quintal [100 kg] unit, raw silk is 7,200 yuan per quintal, pig bristles are 600 yuan per quintal, tung oil is 165 yuan per quintal, and pig casings are 126 yuan per quintal.

### Following Talks with Marshall, Wedemeyer Decides to Retain US Troops in China to Assist in Transporting National Army to Recovered Areas

[This Newspaper] General Wedemeyer announced yesterday on a Shanghai radio station that, in view of President Truman's statement on China policy, the return of US troops from the China theater will be delayed. It is said that after talks with Marshal Marshall, it has been decided to retain US troops to assist the Chinese government in transporting Japanese nationals back to their country, transporting the National Army to recovered areas, protecting US property, and organizing a US volunteer military advisory group.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 20th] According to sources close to Chairman Chiang, the Chairman does not seem willing to accept any direct US assistance to deal with the Communists, believing that this would provoke war with the Soviet Union. They believe that the National Government can deal with the Communists without external force. It is said that Chairman Chiang is prepared to accept the Communist Party's demands, except for the issue of unified army management, because the Chairman insists that China has only one army, and the Communist Party is unwilling to give up control of its army. Neutral observers praised President Truman's message on China policy, and pointed out that the recent US statement is the culmination of advice to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to end their disputes, but the stubborn attitude of the Communist Party has prevented a peaceful resolution of the differences between the two sides.

### Chairman Chiang's Detailed Instructions on What to Build and What to Reform in Beiping, Auctioning off Japanese and Puppet Assets to Develop the City

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] After arriving in Beiping, Chairman Chiang gave instructions on general reception and reconstruction work, especially regarding the resumption of enemy and puppet factories. He personally ordered the municipal government to draft a plan within three days and actively prepare for resumption. It is reported that the municipal government's Public Works Bureau has drafted this plan, dividing the received factories into those that can be resumed immediately based on their equipment, raw materials, and capital requirements, those that are too damaged and need to be priced and sold, and those that have no value for resumption, and has made a form to submit to the Enemy and Puppet Industry Administration for approval.

[Another Telegram] During his visit to Beiping, in addition to listening to reports and giving instructions on military and political affairs in North China, Chairman Chiang personally visited various agencies and important scenic areas for detailed inspections. For all matters that need to be built or reformed, whether major issues such as urban construction or minor issues such as street cleaning, he gave timely instructions to the responsible departments to pay attention based on his observations. On the morning of the 12th, he went to Zhongnanhai Beiping Military Camp for inspection and climbed Jingshan for sightseeing. On the morning of the 13th, he visited the Forbidden City, inspected the Forbidden City Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, and had lunch in the Jiangxuexuan Palace. On the morning of the 14th, he went to Biyun Temple in Xishan to pay respects to Premier Sun Yat-sen's clothing and burial mound. At noon, he inspected the Headquarters of the 11th War Zone, and in the afternoon he inspected the Municipal Government. On the morning of the 18th, he inspected the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters and the Youth Corps.

Regarding urban construction, the Chairman listened to reports from Director Li and Mayor Xiong that construction could not be carried out due to lack of funds. The Chairman personally ordered the special commissioners to allocate 20% of the proceeds from the auction of received and seized Japanese and puppet assets to the municipal government specifically for construction purposes. In the future, any enemy and puppet materials discovered will also be handed over to the municipal government to develop the city.

Regarding transportation, the Chairman ordered the Wartime Transportation Bureau to allocate more than 100 vehicles to the municipal government to be converted into public buses to facilitate citizen transportation. Regarding the livelihood of public educators, the Chairman, noting that the salaries of municipal public educators and police officers were meager and their lives were difficult, ordered the municipal government and food authorities to continue allocating food rations until February of next year. After inspecting scenic temples, the Chairman gave instructions to reorganize and reform them. For example, in temples that display ancient Chinese musical instruments, the Chairman, fearing that they would be lost due to age, ordered the responsible authorities to assign young people to assist in their management. In Zhongnanhai, there were employee residences or rented houses of a few citizens. The Chairman, noting that they were unsightly and difficult to keep clean, ordered them to be moved out separately. Various public recreation areas and scenic historical sites had tea seats for tourists to rest, but they were simple and unclean. The Chairman ordered the responsible authorities to renovate them.

Regarding city appearance, the Chairman personally ordered the municipal government to remove shantytowns in various streets, vendors on pedestrian walkways, and merchants in the city gate barbicans within a time limit, as they obstructed traffic and were unsightly. The standard clocks on important streets were originally intended to facilitate citizens. Those that can be repaired should be repaired quickly, and those that cannot be repaired should be removed immediately. During his eight days in Beiping, the Chairman was concerned about all aspects of the city, leaving no detail unattended. The entire North China region, which had been controlled, oppressed, exploited, and ravaged by the enemy for more than a decade, was already lethargic and lifeless. The ancient saying "Yan and Zhao are full of generous and tragic singers" was rarely encountered in contacts with people from all walks of life in Beiping in the past three months. The phenomenon of bowing and obeying was everywhere.

The Chairman's visit was undoubtedly a stimulant for the people of North China in spirit, restoring their self-confidence. In all aspects, there was a thriving atmosphere. The harvest was so great that it cannot be described in words or statistically measured.

### New French Ambassador Arrives in Cairo and Will Proceed to Chongqing to Take Office

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] The new French Ambassador, Mr. Meyrier, arrived in Cairo on the 16th and, after a brief stay, flew to China. It is heard that Sino-French negotiations will enter a decisive stage as soon as Ambassador Meyrier arrives in China. The reason why negotiations between the two sides have not made significant progress in the past is that the various agreements signed between Vichy France and Japan during the Japanese invasion of China have added to Japan's responsibility for aggression, resulting in considerable disputes over the compensation for the significant political, economic, and military losses suffered by China. As for other issues such as France opening the coastal defense as a free port and the joint management of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, France has long made clear statements.

### Part of the Received Enemy and Puppet Factories Allocated to Private Operation, Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Priority Measures

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] It is reported that in order to reward and support factories that engaged in production work in the rear during the War of Resistance and achieved results, the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to allocate some of the received enemy and puppet factories to private operation, except for those designated to be operated by the state. This principle has been drafted and submitted for approval. The content is roughly as follows: All factories that moved inland, engaged in production work during the War of Resistance, made significant contributions to the War of Resistance, and suffered war losses, have the right to request priority allocation.

### McNutt Returns to the Philippines Tomorrow, Gave a Speech to Reporters in Shanghai Yesterday, Advocating Economic Ties between China and the Philippines

[This Newspaper] US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt plans to leave Shanghai for the Philippines tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon, McNutt emphasized at a reception for reporters: The relationship between China and the Philippines in commerce and economy should have further connections. I came to Shanghai this time to take this opportunity to discuss various issues regarding China-Philippines commerce and economy with Chinese social leaders. Before the war, the industrial, commercial, and financial circles of Shanghai invested heavily in the Philippines. I very much hope that this investment can continue. I also hope that the Philippines can become a central point of exchange for Sino-US commerce. People in the Philippines are very interested in China. There are more than 100,000 overseas Chinese doing business in the Philippines. Eight or nine out of ten retail businesses are run by overseas Chinese. The Chinese residents in the Philippines are frugal and hardworking. In the past, Filipinos discriminated against overseas Chinese businessmen, and political leaders criticized the so-called "influence of the Chinese" in many ways. I want to declare that I am very opposed to this kind of racial concept. Under the Principle of People's Livelihood, the claim that "the Philippines should belong to Filipinos" should not exist. China and the Philippines suffered significant sacrifices in the war. In the future, they should strive for economic ties as allies. McNutt also said that he had important discussions with General MacArthur in Tokyo and plans to discuss military issues with General Wedemeyer, Commander of US Forces in the China Theater.

[Central News Agency, This City] US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt said yesterday: The Philippines has suffered great damage and cannot be restored in a short time. He also said: The Americans hope to make the Filipinos officially independent on July 14, 1946. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has allocated US$2 million as a fund for the restoration of the Philippines. As for the Filipinos who cooperated with the Japanese during the Japanese occupation, they have been formally tried.

### Government and Communist Party to Negotiate Next Week, Political Consultative Conference Agricultural Circles Will Participate

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] Negotiations between the government and the Communist Party will be extended to next week because the Communist Party representatives are not yet ready for the content of the negotiations. The date of the Political Consultative Conference is difficult to announce until negotiations between the government and the Communist Party have reached another level. Most of the representatives to the Political Consultative Conference have already been internally determined. It is heard that there is a lack of agricultural figures among the social elites, and requests are being made to the authorities to send representatives to participate.

### Shao Lizi and Lei Zhen Host Banquet for Communist Party Representatives

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Participation Council, and Lei Zhen, Deputy Secretary-General (Wang Shijie of the Presidium was absent due to matters), hosted a banquet this afternoon for Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Deng Yingchao, Lu Dingyi, and their entourage. Councillors Chu Zhuanzheng, Huang Yanpei, and Zuo Shunsheng, who had previously visited Yan'an, were invited to participate, and Li Huang, Jiang Yong, and Wang Yunwu of the Presidium were invited to accompany them.

### Coastal Strongholds and Railways: Communist Forces Forced to Retreat; Demanding a Truce is a Tactic to Buy Time

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco Radio on the 20th reports: Communist representative Zhou Enlai recently proposed to the Chinese government that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party immediately cease hostilities unconditionally to facilitate the convening of a political consultative conference.

[Reuter's Chongqing Dispatch, 21st] On the day Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Shanghai, a Communist spokesperson proposed an unconditional cessation of hostilities. The government criticized this proposal as diplomatic rhetoric. The Communist spokesperson reiterated today that this proposal would be issued in writing.

[United Press, Beijing Dispatch, 21st] It is believed here that the Communist army's proposal for an unconditional truce is a symbol of the weakening of the Communist position in North and Northeast China. A month or two ago, Yan'an refused to consider truce proposals. At that time, the Communist army was advancing rapidly into Inner Mongolia, had entered Zhangjiakou, and controlled railway and highway traffic in North China and southern Manchuria. The Communist army's position is no longer as favorable as it was then. The area of recovered railway and highway traffic in North China is also gradually expanding. National Army reinforcements have arrived in the Tianjin area to organize and advance along the railways. Advised by the Soviet Union, the Communist army in the Northeast has withdrawn from several locations. The National Army is moving towards Jiyang and has occupied Huludao. Foreign observers here believe that the evolution of the situation seems to favor the central government and say that the strength of the Communist army must have been overestimated. The Communist army is being forced to retreat from coastal strongholds and railways in an orderly manner. According to the opinion of foreign observers here, this attempt to demand a truce is actually a tactic to buy time. Foreign observers suspect that the Communist army's demand for a truce is aimed at Marshal Marshall. Regardless of how good the Communist army's guerrilla warfare skills may be, they can hardly hope to confront the regular National Army on the battlefield. The Communist Party is at a disadvantage both politically and militarily. Chairman Chiang's visit here has dealt the Communist Party a political blow. The Chairman has clearly won popular support among the people from all walks of life, and the public support he received for dealing with the issue of officials' oppression has dealt a serious setback to the Communist Party's position here.

### A Glimmer of Dawn Gradually Appears in the White Mountains and Black Waters; Administrative Takeover to Begin; Mayors of Dalian and Other Cities Depart for Their Posts

[Our Newspaper, Beijing Dispatch, 20th] The work of taking over industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast has begun with the entry of the National Army into the Northeast. Hu Ankai and 18 other personnel from the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs have arrived in Jinzhou in three batches. Hu's initial report has arrived here. According to the report, there are power plants, synthetic fuel plants, pulp mills, machine factories, spinning mills, etc., near Jinzhou, and they are quite large in scale. During the period of Soviet military occupation, the equipment of each factory was not moved. Before the Communist army withdrew, it was unable to destroy these huge factories. Only a few machines were penetrated by their rifle bullets, but they did not cause substantial damage. The takeover work will begin within days. Two of the spinning mills will be taken over and put into operation by the Ministry of Military Affairs to rush to make clothing and bedding for the National Army. The thousand technical personnel for the takeover of industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast, whom Sun Yueqi had recruited in Chongqing, were prevented by transportation difficulties. It was decided to first select 400 people, who are scheduled to depart from Chongqing by special ship to Shanghai on the 21st, and then go north. The industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast are vast and extensive, and these few technical personnel alone cannot take over them. Therefore, the Chairman instructed that Japanese technical personnel be retained. However, the problem that may arise is whether the workers who have suffered under Japanese oppression will still be willing to work under the command of high-ranking Japanese personnel. Sun Yueqi, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Northeast, passed through the north previously. Because he was unable to immediately go to the Northeast to take over, he was ordered to concurrently head the Bureau for the Disposition of Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Pingjin area to sort out the chaotic mess of the past three months. When the Chairman visited Beijing, he was distressed that the takeover had stalled. He immediately ordered Sun to prepare a plan for the resumption of work in the factories of Pingjin within three days. The plan has now been submitted to the Chairman for review. The start of work should not be far off. However, it will be impossible for some factories to resume full production because their future products have no outlet or they lack raw materials.

[Our Newspaper, Beijing Dispatch, 20th] Our reporter recently learned from authoritative sources that there are no diplomatic issues regarding the takeover of the Northeast. The reason why the National Army has not yet airlifted to Changchun and Harbin is that the National Army in the north must maintain law and order in its original location. It is costly to transport the National Army in South China to the distant and cold Northeast, and it will take considerable time and preparation, such as the preparation of cold-weather clothing. Currently, administrative takeover work will precede the air transport of the National Army. Shenyang and Harbin will be the first cities we take over from the Soviet army. Dong Wenqi, the mayor of Shenyang, will fly with Zhang Jia'ao to Changchun on the 21st and then transfer to Shenyang to take over. Yang Chuo'an, the mayor of Harbin, and Shen Yi, the mayor of Dalian, will lead their municipal government personnel on the 22nd to fly to Changchun and then transfer to Harbin to go to their respective posts. Regarding the long-publicized issue of industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast, it is understood that the Soviet government has not made any suggestions to us. Marshal Malinovsky did mention the issue of war booty while in Changchun. Our side agreed that the Soviet side could transport its war booty back to its own country, and the two sides have not discussed this issue since then. As for the US statement that the US military can assist the National Army in entering the Northeast if necessary, a powerful figure said: "This is presumably a diplomatic posture of the US at the current stage. In fact, we have not made any requests to the US side." Looking out at the White Mountains and Black Waters, the fish-belly white of dawn is already visible. The long night of fourteen years is about to break.

[Our Newspaper, Beijing Dispatch, 20th] Zhang Jia'ao flew from Beijing to Beijing at 2:00 PM on the 20th. Chiang Ching-kuo did not come along. Zhang will fly to Changchun via Jinzhou on the 21st with Dong Wenqi, the mayor of Shenyang, and personnel from the Changchun Railway and the Central Bank. Also, the Changchun branch of the Central Bank is scheduled to open on the 22nd. A large batch of newly printed ten-yuan, fifty-yuan, and hundred-yuan circulating notes will be brought there by the Central Bank personnel tomorrow. The Jinzhou branch of the Central Bank may also open soon. The financial situation there is quite chaotic, and merchants and residents feel very inconvenienced. The establishment of a branch is very urgent.

### MacArthur Assists the Japanese People in Building a Democratic and Free Government; Removes All Obstacles in Accordance with the Potsdam Declaration; MacArthur Flatly Denies Rumors of His Retirement

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Special Dispatch, 21st] General MacArthur's headquarters recently ordered the abolition of all obstacles related to Japanese Shintoism in accordance with the Potsdam Conference Declaration. The purpose of MacArthur's move is to achieve the goals of the occupation forces as soon as possible and to assist Japan in forming a democratic government based on the free will of the people. The Allied Headquarters believes that all the regulations of Shintoism are the main factors that caused the Japanese people to become an aggressive country. The main points of the outline are education and guidance. The Japanese people, who used to live under the sword, now need assistance and leadership to achieve freedom. The current lack of leaders has prevented the Allied occupation from achieving full development. Educators and leaders with free thought have never been able to survive and develop in Japan. Almost all officials are people trained by the Bushido and the Black Dragon Society. They are full of feudal ideas and hold thorough aggressive views, which have made Japan an aggressive country. Currently, most of them have been imprisoned, allowing competitive Japanese political parties to rise and propose many plans to reform Japan. MacArthur has been working to give the Japanese people the principles of constitutional reform and the establishment of a new system of government as stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration and is striving to achieve them as soon as possible.

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] General MacArthur today flatly denied rumors that he would retire or resign. It is said that the purpose of his coming to Japan is to complete the tasks assigned to him by the Allied Conference, but not to hinder the implementation of American policies. Whether the Soviet Union will send troops to occupy Japan is not within his purview and should be left to the instructions of the Allied nations. However, the Soviet Union has never submitted a request to MacArthur's headquarters to send troops to Japan. It is understood that MacArthur insisted on a dissenting opinion regarding the Soviet Union's proposal to send troops to occupy Hokkaido alone. It is rumored that MacArthur has presented his personal opinion to the State Department, opposing Soviet participation in the control of Japan. Truman and the spokesman for the US State Department have denied the rumors that MacArthur threatened to resign because he did not want Soviet troops to participate in the occupation of Japan.

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] According to a report from the Tokyo correspondent of the American Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Tai, General MacArthur had discussed the issues of the occupation army and policies with the Soviet authorities. Today, when asked about this matter, MacArthur immediately and firmly denied it. He said, "This report is completely unfounded. I have denied the rumors twice this week. The previous rumor even said that I was planning to resign immediately. My task is to implement the policies of the US government. If Mr. Tai has indeed spread this rumor, then he has obviously been fooled by the street rumors in Tokyo."

Truman Expresses: He Has Not Heard of Marshal MacArthur Opposing Soviet Participation in Joint Control

[Reuter's Washington Dispatch, 21st] President Truman told the press yesterday that he was unaware of Marshal MacArthur's opposition to Soviet participation in the control of Japan. Tokyo Radio said that MacArthur had telegraphed the State Department that if the Soviet Union was allowed to participate in the occupation of Japan, he would resign. He had not heard anything about this.

[Central News Agency, Washington Special Dispatch, 20th] The spokesman for the US State Department today denied the rumors that MacArthur did not want Soviet troops to participate in the occupation of Japan and would threaten to resign. The spokesman said that the State Department had not received any documents from MacArthur mentioning disagreements between the US and the Soviet Union. It is rumored that the disagreement between the US and the Soviet Union is on the number of Soviet troops participating in the occupation of Japan and the scope of the occupied areas. At the same time, US official sources said that the Soviet Union has not yet responded to the US proposal to invite the Soviet Union to send troops to Japan to jointly occupy Japan. The US proposal was contained in a note from the US to the Soviet Union, which stated that the US gave Australia the opportunity to send troops to occupy Japan alone and would be willing to allow Soviet troops to participate in joint occupation on the same basis.

[United Press, Washington Dispatch, 20th] Tiege of the American Broadcasting Corporation broadcast from Tokyo that the Soviet Union will not send troops to Japan due to the disagreement between the Soviet Union and the Supreme Commander. Tiege said that the dispute between MacArthur and the Soviet Union is focused on which island the Soviet Union wants to occupy.

Japanese Military Equipment Still Concealed

[Reuter's Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] Today, the US Sixth Army announced that a patrol team of the US 24th Division on Shikoku Island discovered several unreported reinforced concrete fortifications along the coast and a large number of military supplies hidden in storage. Many rifles, cannons, and other equipment were found in a small school, which shows that despite repeated requests for reports, Japanese military equipment is still concealed. At the same time, the Sixth Army announced that on Shikoku Island, 1,000 Japanese men and women attacked a camp that was about to be abandoned. US guards fired shots to stop them, knocking down one person.

[Reuter's Tokyo Dispatch, 20th] Before his suicide, Fumimaro Konoe submitted a draft amendment to the Japanese Constitution to the Emperor on November 22 and then resigned from his position as Acting Minister of the Imperial Household. According to the Mainichi Shimbun, the original draft was very long, and it proposed to continue to retain the Emperor's political power, but to slightly reduce its scope. The original Japanese Constitution stated that the Emperor had the power to rule Japan. This clause was retained, but a sentence was added stating that the Emperor should exercise his powers with the assistance of all his subjects. Although the Emperor has the power to declare war, make peace, and conclude treaties with other countries, he must first obtain the approval of the parliament. This is the most important amendment in the draft. The draft also proposed to establish a committee in the parliament to pass various emergency decrees issued by Japan. According to custom, if these decrees are not rejected by the next parliament, they will become law. During the military period, various emergency decrees were often abused. The draft also advocated reforming the Japanese House of Peers, placing the army and navy under the management of the government, and allowing the Japanese parliament to convene or dissolve itself. Until now, only the Emperor had the power to convene or dissolve the parliament. It is understood that after reading the draft, the Emperor gave it to the cabinet and instructed the Japanese government to consider amending the constitution based on this plan. There is still no notification from the Soviet Union.

Japanese Military Police General, Amakasu, Commits Suicide

[Central News Agency, Tokyo Special Dispatch, 20th] Amakasu, the former Japanese military police general who shot and killed the famous Japanese anarchist Osugi Sakae after the Great Kanto Earthquake in Yokohama in 1923, is said to have committed suicide in our country's Northeast. Since the Mukden Incident, he had been working in the special service agency established by the Japanese army there. Recently, according to retired Japanese military officers returning from the Northeast, after Japan surrendered, Amakasu committed suicide with a pistol in front of a large group of employees of the Manchuria Film Corporation.

Japan's Food Problem Can Be Solved Without Great Concern

[Reuter's Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] Summers, Director of the Public Health and Welfare Group of the Supreme Command of the United Nations, today criticized Japanese government officials for making dangerous statements about Japan's food problem in order to obtain American assistance. The food obtained by the Japanese this winter will be more than that of the defeated European countries, and there is no danger of starvation. Although the food situation is obviously tight in winter, food shortages in urban areas may be unavoidable, but the amount of rice rationed by the Supreme Command of the United Nations shows that there is sufficient food to provide each person with 1,500 calories of energy per day. This ration can continue until April and May of next year. According to previous estimates by the Japanese, they could get at most 1,375 calories and 41 centimeters of protein per day.

### Surplus American Merchant Ships Should Be Supplied to China

American Congressman Judd's Advocacy

[Reuter's Washington Dispatch, 20th] Congressman Judd, who served as a medical advisor in China, urged the US today to quickly supply China with surplus merchant ships, saying that this is "an important step in solving China's political and economic difficulties. The lack of transportation makes it impossible to promote post-war reconstruction and makes it impossible for Chairman Chiang to establish a broadly based coalition government. This is what we are working hard to urge. Railways, highways, and shipping have been paralyzed by the destruction of the war. The US has now supplied Britain with 400 surplus cargo ships and the Soviet Union with 150 ships, while China has only received three ships, and another five are still under construction."

### Japanese Embassies and Consulates in the United States Have Been Taken Over by the US Government

### After Several Exploratory Talks, the Suspicions of the Three Powers Can Be Eliminated; The Soviet Union Demands the Return of Lost Territory of Georgia

[United Press, Moscow Dispatch, 21st] Well-informed sources here announced today that after the exploratory talks held by the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the unity of the three countries is even greater than before the meeting. It is hoped that some doubts will disappear. The sixth day of the meeting was the 66th birthday of Marshal Stalin. Based on reports from foreign countries, the situation is analyzed as follows: (1) There is now a strong feeling that the meeting will have some results, or even better than originally hoped, but it seems that every dispute among the three powers cannot be resolved in the meeting. (2) US Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin do not want to exaggerate the hopes of the British and American people. (3) The three foreign ministers have no intention of controlling the United Nations organization, but the three powers cooperated closely during the war, and they can continue to do their best through this cooperation in the future. (4) If the United Nations organization can be expected to handle all matters, then there is no need for each country to have ambassadors and ministers. (5) The Five Foreign Ministers Committee, including the three foreign ministers and the foreign ministers of China and France, has no intention of dissolving it. However, the United Nations organization should immediately begin to take over some of the work of the committee.

[Reuter's Moscow Dispatch, 21st] The attention of the Moscow Conference seems to have shifted from Iran to Turkey. Yesterday, most Soviet newspapers published a letter from two Georgian scholars to a newspaper in Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Republic, demanding that Turkey return the land seized from the Georgian Republic. The Georgian Republic is Stalin's hometown. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes began studying this request yesterday. The letter stated that "the current Turkish authorities are changing the place names of Georgia, demolishing historical monuments, and forcing residents to move to distant places. During the war against Germany, Turkey invaded Georgian territory by helping the German Empire. Today, it must be returned to the Georgian people." Moscow diplomatic circles are paying close attention to this move. On Wednesday night, when Stalin met with Bevin and Byrnes, it was said that he discussed issues of "mutual concern," but this was only a draft proposal of a diplomatic nature. After this meeting, the issue of Georgia immediately attracted attention from all sides. Regarding the situation of the Moscow Conference, the official side remains silent, but it is understood that the atmosphere is still very friendly and that work has been intensified.

[United Press, Moscow Dispatch, 20th] Soviet official newspapers clearly stated today that the Soviet Union is demanding that Turkey cede 55,000 square miles of land on its Black Sea coast adjacent to the Soviet port of Batumi. The land demanded for cession includes the Turkish port of Trabzon and part of the coast 50 miles deep and 110 miles south of the Soviet-Turkish border.

[Reuter's Moscow Dispatch, 21st] The Three Foreign Ministers Conference held its fifth meeting yesterday, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. The meeting lasted for two hours and twenty minutes, and there was no communique afterwards. Molotov hosted a banquet for Bevin and Byrnes after the meeting.

### Chinese in Hong Kong Hope for Hong Kong's Return to China

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 20th] Hong Kong has been under British rule for a century. As people in Southeast Asia rise up against white rule, this small island is the only place without rebellion. There are neither independence battles nor mass rallies shouting for the expulsion of foreigners. Order prevails everywhere. Queen's Road is as peaceful as Piccadilly Circus in London and as crowded as Times Square in New York. The Chinese often set off firecrackers, saying they have the power to ward off evil, but there is no sound of guns. In fact, most Chinese in Hong Kong would like the British to leave and return the island to China. A Chinese person who received higher education said: "In our hearts, everyone hopes that Hong Kong will return to China, because we are all Chinese people. Currently, we would rather maintain the status quo for the time being." The British obviously have no intention of giving up Hong Kong, but the fact that they can govern Hong Kong so peacefully is due to the silent assistance of most Chinese.

Songjiang

The County Arbitrarily Issues a Huge Amount of Currency

The newly appointed Magistrate of Songjiang County, Huang Chaoren, recently printed 250 million yuan of currency at the Cheng Zhang Printing House, with denominations of 1,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan, and 4,000 yuan. All of the currency will be used to purchase military provisions. The currency will be signed and stamped by the County Magistrate, the Director of the Military Provisions Purchasing Office, and the Chairman of the Rice Industry Association (the Chairman is currently recuperating in Shanghai). The currency will be used interchangeably with legal tender until February 15th, 1946, when it can be exchanged for legal tender. The public is horrified. During the Anti-Japanese War, Songjiang suffered severely due to being on the front lines. It has yet to recover. How can it bear this heavy burden? Various Songjiang hometown associations in Shanghai, as well as Zhang Shutong, Zhou Xuewen, and others, have sent telegrams to the provincial authorities and the Commissioner's Office, ordering them to stop the action to alleviate the people's suffering and avoid disrupting the currency system.

### Dian River Flows Backwards, Ripples on Emerald Lake: Recent Developments in Kunming

‚Äî Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhang Jun

Winter Solstice is approaching, but the climate in Kunming is still like autumn. Autumn in Kunming is not only eventful but also colorful, especially busy for newspaper reporters. Don't say the autumn scenery is good, and write about the sounds of autumn coming and going, leaving what traces, what changes, repercussions, and consequences on Wuhua Mountain, on Emerald Lake Road, and outside the Great Western Gate.

The Yunnan Provincial Government has undergone two major reorganizations, with five provincial committee members and four department heads replaced. The Kunming Municipal Government has undergone one reorganization, with three bureau chiefs replaced. Personnel changes in various counties are also routine events in officialdom.

In this short autumn, several large-scale military organizations were abolished, and a large number of unemployed soldiers were added. Commander Du Yuming completed the reorganization of the Yunnan Provincial Government in Kunming in mid-autumn and has since been doing well outside Shanhaiguan, leading people to say that Du is "lucky." Commander Guan, after taking office in Kunming, was also colorful for only 39 days before "taking responsibility" and leaving due to the student protests. Recently in Kunming,

There are open robberies in the downtown area. Gunshots are often heard at night, and people are panicked. The reception center for scattered soldiers and vagrants announced that it is overcrowded. The "international routes" have lost their patrons and are like wandering gulls. Factories and guest houses are successively being downsized and closed. Factory owners are running around calling for help, and a large number of employees are wandering the streets. In this "city that never sleeps," with its 280,000 people, various audible and silent changes are taking place rapidly. If you are willing to accept the stimulation of these sounds on an autumn night, you will feel excitement, tension, silence, hidden worries, sadness, and the feeling of not knowing whether to laugh or cry. The expression of this autumn is particularly significant. These events and changes are inevitably produced after the war. However, we cannot ignore the impact of personnel matters. Here, I will describe the outline of a few shots taken by the reporter.

Wuhua Mountain: One Welcome, One Farewell

Former Chairman of Yunnan Province, Long Yun, served in Yunnan for eighteen years. On October 3rd, the gunfire caused by the reorganization of the provincial government was "rarely seen by the general public" in Kunming (quoting Chairman Lu). The reaction produced by the strangeness stabilized after a period of time. Former Chairman Long flew to Chongqing by special plane. On the day Deputy Chairman Li arrived at the provincial government to take office, national flags were flying in the urban area, and security was tight from Wuhua Mountain to the airfield. Dozens of small chartered vehicles "farewelling the old" sped through the city, and no one thought of setting off firecrackers to welcome the new. On December 1st, Chairman Lu arrived at the provincial government to take office, and national flags were flying in the city again. However, when Deputy Chairman Li was sent down the mountain (Wuhua Mountain) by the provincial government band, firecrackers were set off everywhere in the city, costing more than ten million yuan. These are the two recent intermezzos.

Pastoral City, Oriental Switzerland

During this period of welcoming the new and sending off the old, many colorful materials were added to the newspapers in Kunming, which may be "rarely seen" by some people. However, based on these materials, we can see what traces were left in this changing process, what style was expressed, and what consequences occurred. At the beginning of his tenure, Deputy Chairman Li announced the three principles and six guidelines of governing in a tea party at the Provincial Party Headquarters. On December 1st, when Li welcomed Chairman Lu to take office for the last time as Deputy Chairman, he said in his speech: "I was ordered to return to Yunnan in a hurry and serve as Deputy Chairman. For the past two months, I have been working diligently day and night, never daring to slack off." This is a fact.

It is said that since the day he took office as Deputy Chairman, he worked 16 hours a day. From design to execution to assessment, the entire three-link system required him to do everything himself. During his 55 days in Wuhua Mountain, he drafted a draft of the Yunnan Governance Program, attended more than 30 gatherings or meetings, and delivered a 30,000-word speech (according to a reporter's estimate). In his speech, after advocating vigor, he continued to advocate integrity, promote work competitions, and ban smoking, gambling, and prostitution to complete local autonomy. For Kunming, he hoped to "turn Kunming into the Oriental Switzerland and a pastoral city" (October 27th speech). For the party, government, military, and people, he advocated the integration of the four. Regarding the Wuhua he resided in, he said: "Wuhua Mountain is the seat of the provincial government and is owned by the people, not by any individual or any government. The world belongs to the people of the world, and only the virtuous can live in it" (October 22nd speech). In order to "diligently seek public opinion," he placed opinion boxes at the gates of Kunming. In order to "try democracy," he implemented public elections for the head of the general affairs section in the Department of Civil Affairs. In order to respect the elders, he served rice to the elders at the Kunming County Council meeting. These facts are enough to show that he "never dared to slack off." At the same time, the voices of all sectors of society were playing out in the background.

On December 1st, Chairman Lu took office. In his inaugural speech, we can see another style of Lu: (1) He advocated that "governing does not require much talk." "If one is not careful in one's words, it is easy to lose the government's credibility, not only making individuals despised by the people, but also making the people despise the government." (2) Regarding the "past righteous governance" during former Chairman Long's tenure, "we should follow the old ways." (3) Currently, "the most important task is to maintain local security and strive for social stability." Chairman Lu's inauguration ceremony was completed at 10:20 a.m. on the 1st. The Southwest Associated University had a grenade incident at 11:00 a.m. Lu issued a letter to the students of various schools on the 10th, saying: "Unfortunately, on the day of my inauguration, the Kunming student protests turned into a tragic case." Lu took office at the turn of autumn and winter, first welcoming this more complex and difficult problem. What caused the problem? Some say: "The gift of autumn."

Emerald Lake Road: Guan Leaves, Huo Comes

On November 18th, a grand banquet was held on Wuhua Mountain to bid farewell to Du Yuming as he went to the Northeast and welcome Guan Linwei to Kunming. Deputy Chairman Li said in his speech: "The waters of Yunnan flow backwards. Foreign military and government officials in Yunnan often leave and return." This refers to the exchange of positions between Guan and Du. Guan had been stationed in southern Yunnan for many years, and the central government had initially appointed Guan as the security commander of the nine provinces in the Northeast. Therefore, most of his subordinates had already gathered in Chongqing to await orders. Later, Guan was announced as the commander of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison, and he rushed back to Kunming to actively prepare for the establishment of the headquarters. Initially, they did not even have cooks. In just half a month, the headquarters was officially established on Emerald Lake on November 1st. Before Guan was sworn in, there were 11 robbery cases in the city within half a month. People were robbed of their property and then killed. The people were angry and panicked. However, within 20 days, all the cases were solved. This achievement established some faith in the headquarters. From November 1st, Guan actively promoted his plan to maintain security, including checking household registrations, registering self-defense firearms, controlling public and private vehicles, cracking down on scattered soldiers and vagrants, and implementing district-based garrison. On November 24th, the headquarters issued Announcement No. 6, stating that "Kunming's security has been stabilized." However, on the night of November 25th, the garrison suddenly released a news release stating that "A bandit alarm occurred near Baini Slope outside the West Gate of the city at around 7:00 p.m. on the 25th. The local garrison rushed to catch them after receiving the report. The bandits fired their guns and fled into the darkness." The reporter was also outside the West Gate at the time and heard the sound of hand grenades and machine guns, indicating that the bandits were not weak.

School Security Suddenly Becomes Unstable

From November 1st to the 24th, the security of the city was peaceful, but from the 26th, the security of the school suddenly became unstable. On December 1st, a hand grenade case occurred at the Associated University, killing and injuring more than 20 people. Guan personally went to the scene of the incident that afternoon to investigate and console the injured students. Chief of Staff Wu of the Garrison Headquarters gave a speech on the 4th, reporting on Guan's visit, stating: "At that time, my colleagues were afraid of accidents and repeatedly stopped him from going, but our Commander-in-Chief was motivated by a sense of responsibility and compassion and insisted on going. When he returned to the headquarters, his colleagues saw that his expression was depressed, which had not been seen in the fierce battles of the past." On December 7th, Guan telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting punishment, saying that the occurrence of this tragic case was all due to his responsibility for security and his failure to take precautions beforehand. He was willing to "bear all the punishment himself." Guan flew to Chongqing on the 9th, and the central government announced on the 10th that Guan would be dismissed and await further action. The position of Commander of the Garrison was assigned to Huo Kuizhang as an acting commander.

Acting Commander Huo arrived in Kunming from Chongqing on the 7th. As of the 15th, although he had not yet gone to the Emerald Lake headquarters to formally take office, in reality, he had taken on the garrison responsibilities of Guan. Huo was a strong general in the counter-offensive in western Yunnan and had been stationed in Yunnan for many years. He had also served as the acting Director of the Youth Army and Commander of the Sixth Army in Chongqing. Now that he is back in Kunming, the reporter cannot help but think of the phrase "the waters of Yunnan flow backwards."

Outside the Great Western Gate: A Combination of Sound and Color

At the turn of autumn and winter, there was a combination of sound and color outside the Great Western Gate. This incident occurred on the evening of November 25th and has not subsided to this day. In the past three weeks, the reporter has often heard students' shouts, debates, protests, scoldings, and speeches. He has also heard professors' exhortations, protests, "rioters'" shouts, sounds of bullets, condolences from people in society, and the cries of young men and women. In the past three weeks, the reporter has often seen colorful slogans, catchphrases, leaflets, cartoons, and various printed, lithographed, mimeographed, and handwritten propaganda materials distributed in schools, in the city, on blackboards, on walls, on buses, and in the hearts of many people. Various sounds interacted and stimulated, and various colors interacted and influenced, which ended the scene of sound and color combined. (Sent from Kunming on December 17, 1945)

### The Birth of the Buddhist Reorganization Committee

(Chongqing Air Dispatch) The Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Buddhist Association is scheduled to be established in Chongqing on the 22nd of this month. Master Taixu has specially written an article elaborating on its significance. The original text is as follows: "Since the outbreak of the full-scale Anti-Japanese War, Beijing and Shanghai fell in quick succession, and the Chinese Buddhist Association was suspended. The regions of the eastern, southern, northern, and western provinces and counties were gradually blocked and inaccessible. Buddhist temples, monks, and believers, like the general populace, suffered under the enemy and puppet regimes, with deep pain unspoken. The Buddhist monks and disciples in the western, southern, and northwestern rear areas, due to the lack of leadership from a national Buddhist organization, though each went its own way forming monk rescue teams, Buddhist wounded soldierÊÖ∞Âãû teams, and engaging in nursing, propaganda, fundraising, donations, and responding to the call for educated youth to join the army, participate in guerrilla warfare, and aid refugees, these actions serving the nation and the people failed to become a universal and systematic organization, receiving sufficient attention and assistance from the central government and the provincial and regional governments and society. Instead, temples were seen as docile and easily bullied, suffering endless exploitation, oppression, and extortion from local tyrants, evil gentry, corrupt officials, falsely claiming military service contributions and various illegal and tyrannical demands. Despite the central government's repeated grand decrees of protection, the suffering of those below could not reach the ears of those above, and the benevolent virtue from above could not reach those below, accumulating into a tragic resentment between the government and the people. In provinces and counties with Buddhist associations, each made local rescues, but their own organizations were often not sound, and lacking a central national church to advocate and guide them, they suffered even more than the average person. Now, fortunately, the nation's war of resistance is victorious and the nation's reconstruction begins. The Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Interior Affairs have presented to the Executive Yuan the establishment of the 'Chinese Buddhist Association Reorganization Committee,' aiming to convene a national Buddhist representative conference within half a year or a year, to strengthen and improve the organization of the 'Chinese Buddhist Association' and the 'Buddhist branch associations of various provinces and counties,' adapting to the needs of the new China, which has leaped to become one of the four major powers in the international arena, so that Buddhism may also become the new Buddhism of the new China. (Omission) Buddhist comrades throughout the country should abandon grievances and cultivate friendship, forming a sincere gathering, a harmonious union, and swiftly seize the opportune moment to spread the Dharma throughout the country and the world! It is hoped that virtuous people throughout the country and in the government and the public, and those in the world who revere truth and promote goodness, will all support and guide us!"

A Spectacle of Water Towers

The United States and the Soviet Union are known in the world for constructing large water gates, and in the United States, it is particularly fitting to recognize this as one of the world's great spectacles.

Electricity is generated there, to power the nearby water towers.

### The Council of Foreign Ministers and the Far Eastern Situation

The Council of Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union has been convened in Moscow for nearly a week. During this week, the representatives of the three countries have been in frequent contact. Marshal Stalin has also returned from convalescing in the Black Sea region of southern Russia and has met with the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and the United States in Moscow. The meeting seems to be entering an important phase. Although the details of the meeting are kept strictly confidential, making it impossible to know the general agenda, it is certainly believable that the meeting, once convened, will discuss various issues of common interest to the three countries, especially the situation in the Far East. According to news from Moscow, Soviet newspapers have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the situation in Japan, China, and Vietnam. This suggests that the situation in the Far East is indeed one of the main topics of discussion for the three countries. While this may be speculation, it is not without reason.

Looking at the world situation, the Far East is currently filled with many dangerous elements, and the content of the problems is very complex. How the Far Eastern situation develops is not only related to the countries of the Far East but also affects the peace of the entire world. China is the first major country in the Far East to resist aggression and undoubtedly should have a voice in the handling of Far Eastern issues. However, today, as we watch the Council of Foreign Ministers convene in Moscow, and as the China issue may even be included in the agenda, our ambassador to the Soviet Union can only obtain some information from separate visits with the British and American foreign ministers. We really should feel ashamed and blame ourselves! Just think, in the current so-called Far Eastern situation, such as the issue of governing defeated Japan, the issue of handling the Korean situation, and the so-called national self-determination movements related to China, Vietnam, and even South Asia, which of these issues should not be of concern to China, and which of these issues can China ignore? At the time of the convening of the Council of Foreign Ministers, it was heard that issues related to other major powers would not be discussed, but since attention is now being paid to the Far Eastern situation, we, from the standpoint of the Chinese people, cannot help but say a few words.

The key to the Far Eastern situation lies not in how to govern defeated Japan or how to support the post-war reconstruction of China, but in how the major Allied nations take coordinated steps. Regarding the issue of post-war control of Japan, although the Soviet Union has refused to participate in the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, its principle of Allied joint control of Japan should be accepted by the Allied nations. The problem is not a difference of opinion in principle but a technical detail in execution. According to a Reuters report from Tokyo, General MacArthur, in view of the disagreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue of controlling Japan, has telegraphed the U.S. State Department that if he does not have full authority, he will resign. This so-called disagreement is not a matter of principle but a matter of execution. It is said that "the Soviet Union requested to send troops to Japan, but MacArthur only allowed the Soviet side to send one division; the Soviet Union wanted to occupy Hokkaido, but MacArthur rejected this request but allowed Soviet troops to be stationed in Kyushu." It can be seen that the United States and the Soviet Union do not have a dispute in principle regarding joint control of Japan, but rather in the aspect of execution. Now that the foreign ministers of the three countries are gathered in Moscow and are in frequent contact, it is possible to eliminate some misunderstandings and find an appropriate solution.

Secondly, regarding the Korean issue, the Korean Peninsula is originally mountainous and barren. Now the occupation zones of the US and Soviet armies have divided Korea into two, cutting the Korean people in half. These two occupation zones do not communicate with each other, which truly aggravates the suffering of the Korean people. Helping the Korean people to become independent and autonomous should be the common will of the US and the Soviet Union. It is believed that the current situation can be improved through sincere coordination.

The situation contrary to that in Korea is developing vigorously in various parts of South Asia. In Indonesia, there is the so-called Indonesian national independence movement, which often clashes with the occupying Allied forces. The same situation is also appearing in Vietnam. Regarding the Indonesian independence movement, it is said that there is manipulation by the Japanese within it, and their weapons are also obtained from the Japanese. To some extent, this movement seems to have been poisoned by the so-called "Greater East Asia" propaganda. Regardless of whether these rumors are reliable, in South Asia, the component that may have been poisoned by "Greater East Asia" is very high. In the past, the Japanese incited people under colonial rule. Although the Japanese have surrendered, there will inevitably be some remnants of their poison left behind, which is also possible. Therefore, the United Nations' attitude toward handling Asian national issues really should not adhere to the old imperialist conventions but should re-establish a new style. Otherwise, it will be impossible to justify itself with the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Declaration.

In China, since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, China has automatically added some restrictions to the exercise of its sovereignty. This is nothing more than expressing our hope for close international cooperation, hence the willingness to make self-sacrifices. However, since the signing of the treaty, all developments have not necessarily been as ideal as expected. To this day, our national army has not been able to enter Shenyang and Changchun very happily, and the news of these past few days has been particularly depressing. If China is allowed to handle the Communist issue internally, it is believed that a reasonable solution can be found through peaceful means. External interference can sometimes increase the factors of disputes. Now that President Truman has announced a clear policy, hoping that China will be peacefully unified under the leadership of the National Government and does not want any interference, and the foreign ministers of the three countries are gathering in Moscow, we believe that the situation in China will become clearer.

World War II originated from the Far Eastern issue. We must not allow a third world war to brew in the Far East again. The United Nations fought shoulder to shoulder against the enemy in the past. Today, as the enemy surrenders, they should unite to establish peace. The crux of the Far Eastern issue is not the difference in goals but the difficulty in execution. These difficulties are not insurmountable. How to overcome these difficulties depends on the close cooperation of all countries. The convening of the Council of Foreign Ministers in Moscow is sufficient to show that the three countries have a common demand for close cooperation, and the major countries other than the three should also have the opportunity to exchange opinions frankly and achieve consistency. Only in this way can all problems be easily solved.

### Public Bond Giants Emerge at High Prices, Foreign Shares Continue to Rise, Chinese Shares Initially Weak But Later Firm

Public bonds opened with yesterday's report that the capital in Chongqing was still being drawn by lottery for repayment, leading to slight disappointment among some people. Type C fell from 800 yuan to 715 yuan. Northern dealers absorbed at low prices, and dealers took advantage of the situation to drive up prices. Chinese and foreign stocks were unusually popular, boosting buying interest significantly, and prices rose back to a high of 840 yuan. Zheng dealers saw the difference between miscellaneous brands widen, so they emerged at high prices. Dealers saw that the situation was difficult to sustain and scattered, leading to a lack of support. At the midday close, prices fell again to below 750 yuan. As a result, prices fell by 5 yuan to 65 yuan. Miscellaneous brands, with fewer floating accounts, saw the slightest decline, and the price difference narrowed.

Chinese shares were initially slightly sluggish, but banks and securities dealers continued to buy strongly. Large bondholders also came to buy old shares, and buying interest continued to spread, becoming weak but later firm. Yong Yarn rose to over 660 yuan, American Zhang to over 530 yuan, New Light rose to 43 yuan, Jingfu to 36 yuan, and Qinxing to 31 yuan. At midday, floating accounts closed, leading to a slight decline, but the underlying support remained firm. As a result, large shares closed higher by more than 30 yuan, and small shares closed higher by 3 yuan to 4 yuan.

Foreign shares continued to advance, and investor sentiment remained good. Various parties held unlimited hopes for foreign shares, and holders were unwilling to easily sell. As a result, the demand for stocks dried up under the search of securities and money dealers. Under the various hopes of buyers, market prices soared. At midday, prices closed at a higher price again. As a result, prices rose by another 10% to 20%. British Chamber of Commerce Weaving and Dyeing Factory resumed operations today. In the future, foreign factories will inevitably resume work one after another, and the prospects for foreign shares are very bright.

Gold and Currency Calm

Spot gold was extremely stable yesterday. News from Chongqing was low. The opening was slightly sluggish, gradually narrowing to around 720,000 yuan. Later, as securities rose and investor sentiment improved, prices once recovered to 740,000 yuan. However, large accounts did not show enthusiasm, and market prices were difficult to sustain. Retail investors also sold gold for shares, with the supply of gold greater than shares. At midday, prices still hovered within 730,000 yuan. The afternoon remained calm, with current prices fluctuating slightly around 730,000 yuan. Transactions were few and far between. As a result, prices fell slightly by 4,000 yuan compared to before the close. With the end of the year approaching, large accounts did not want to be too active, and the overall trend may be a longer period of consolidation. Jewelry stores quoted gold ornaments at 79,000 yuan, refined silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars hovered around 450 yuan, with unofficial discounts mediocre, ranging from about 7% to 10%.

US currency continued to be calm, slightly rippling with the gold market. The overall trend always fluctuated within 1,210 yuan. The afternoon was the same. As a result, prices fell by 20 yuan compared to before the close. The trend was extremely sluggish, and transactions were not lively. Hong Kong currency was absorbed by Guangdong dealers at low prices, and shipping dealers also absorbed it, sweeping away the air of worry. New goods recovered by more than 10 yuan from around 45 yuan. Investors both within and outside the industry generally sought quick profits, so old goods were mediocre and unremarkable. As a result, old goods closed flat, while new goods recovered by 5 yuan.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Fair-Price Oil Already on Sale

Yesterday, rice prices rose due to continued price increases in the interior. Both japonica and indica rice increased by 200 to 300 yuan. White Yuan Qingdao rice had a slightly better outlet, rising another 500 yuan. Flour was still exportable, but the local market remained sluggish. The oil market was tight in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Fair-price oil has already been distributed by the guild to various oil stores for retail sale at a price of 14,000 yuan, with the store also having a legitimate profit, totaling 8,000 dan. The first batch of 2,000 dan has been distributed, followed by further distribution. Soybeans were stable, and soybean cakes were being handled in Taiwan, making the market active and seeing a rise of 100 yuan.

### Pricing of Textile Machines

[Special Report] Foreign orders for ordinary textile machines have already been quoted in Chongqing. (A large American foreign firm) Each machine's iron material weighs 1,200 pounds, with a quoted price of US$741, equivalent to more than 900,000 legal currency, but freight, insurance, loading and unloading fees, etc., are not included. Major textile factories in this city have inquired by telegraph to the US and are planning a pre-order plan. (Wu)

### Asphalt Arrives Intermittently

The asphalt price fell sharply and then rose slightly, a fleeting moment, and then became weak again. Although the production price is still firm, the arrival of goods in Shanghai is constant due to the opening of north and south roads. Yesterday, Jia and guests came to Shanghai to sell Kai He Ben oil for tens of items at 18,000 yuan, He Jiao, and North Road oil at 12,000 yuan. The quality of goods varied, nominally from Macheng but actually from mixed routes, even inferior to Lan oil. Therefore, merchants raised the price to 14,000 to 5,000 yuan, and He Ben oil was sold for 21,000 yuan.

### White Coal Rises and Then Returns to Level

White coal screened blocks initially continued the previous trend and continued to rise sharply, once reaching the 300,000 yuan mark. Later, sellers frequently sold at high prices, causing the market to lack the strength to rise, so it returned to level. However, it was still higher than before. The trade in anthracite dross was sluggish, and the underlying support softened.

### Unified Bonds Can Pay Interest in this City, Customs Revenue Reaches 30 Million Yuan in the First Ten Days of the Month

Starting today, interest on all types of unified bonds that have matured can be collected in Shanghai. The principal of the bonds that have been drawn will be paid after the customs revenue has accumulated. It is reported that as import and export trade in Shanghai is gradually booming, the revenue of the Jianghai Customs is also increasing accordingly. The total tax revenue from the 1st to the 10th of this month reached 302,400,895 yuan, including 257,501,578 yuan of import tax and 15,110,145 yuan of export tax. The tax revenue for the same period last month was only 17,158,513 yuan, including 15,003,586 yuan of import tax and no export tax.

### Longan Production Price Upside Down

Recently, the arrival of Longan has increased, but sales have not been smooth. Therefore, the market continues to trend downwards. For example, mixed-route goods have fallen by another 10%, and even Xinghua Longan has continued to ease by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Longan meat has become weaker, with top-grade goods at 75,000 yuan and second-grade goods at 40,000 yuan. However, the production price has risen instead, forming an upside-down situation.

### Yarn Market Stands Out

Guest Dealers Compete to Search for Purchases

Yesterday, the yarn market prospered, and investor sentiment was extremely outstanding. Guest dealers from all routes gathered, and the demand for spot goods increased greatly. The price of each brand rose by 30,000 to 40,000, with 20-count yarn being particularly profitable. Dealers from Sichuan and Hubei inquired about large factory goods first, and customers from Beijing and Hangzhou searched for small factory yarn later. The market price showed a straight upward trend.

### Bananas, Sugar Cane, and Everlasting Wheel Arrive in Large Quantities

Bananas, sugar cane, honey oranges, Xinhui oranges, and other fruits are all produced in South China, Guangdong, Shantou, and other places. Since the Japanese invasion of South China, the Shanghai-Guangdong shipping route has been interrupted. Except for a small number of sugar cane smuggled to Shanghai, other fruits have long disappeared. Most of the goods sold in the market are inferior goods from Korea and Taiwan. Yihua Company's Everlasting Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, carrying a large number of medicinal materials, etc. In addition, there were many fruits, all of which were bananas and sugar cane, with very few oranges. The ship is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong next Monday (24th) at noon. There are more than 11,000 bags of relief flour, which were shipped from the United States. The quantity is doubled compared to ordinary flour, with each bag weighing 100 pounds.

Letter

### The Problem of Invalid Import Tax Bills After June 1938

Since taking over the Jianghai Customs, officials have stipulated that all tax receipts held for imported foreign goods that have been taxed in Shanghai after June 1938 are invalid. When transshipping to other ports, import tax must be paid (the tax rate is mostly 30% to 40% to 70% to 80%). This matter was published in the commercial news column of this newspaper on the 19th. At the same time, the author is a merchant from another port. Due to the restrictions of the aforementioned regulations of the Jianghai Customs, the dozens of goods purchased earlier, unless import tax is paid, (most of my purchases are industrial raw materials to promote production, and the import tax rate and surcharges need to be 39%) cannot be transported to other ports for sale. Because this measure of the Jianghai Customs directly stimulates commodity prices in other ports, and Shanghai loses a reasonable level, indirectly creating small-scale trafficking, causing congestion of cars and boats. Normal stores in other ports, such as complying with the regulations to pay huge amounts of import tax and legally transport goods, are difficult to compete with traffickers, resulting in the operation of normal stores that comply with the law being in an unfavorable state. Moreover, for eight years, stores in the occupied areas have paid taxes to the enemy and puppets. If this measure of the Customs is extended to other legitimate tax revenues of the country, such as income tax and business tax, all taxes that the government has not been able to collect in the past eight years will be collected from merchants one by one. If so, merchants in the occupied areas will have no way to survive. Furthermore, the administration of the Jianghai Customs after June 1938 was actually still under the jurisdiction of our government until the Pearl Harbor Incident on December 8, 1941, when the Jianghai Customs was completely controlled by the enemy and puppets. Now even the tax revenue during the period under the government's jurisdiction is not recognized. Judging from the circumstances, it does not seem to be fair. Although the Customs authorities also have a reason, it is that after June 1938, due to the unilateral agreement between Britain and Japan, the Customs revenue was deposited in the Zhengjin Bank from that period, and could not be transferred to the national treasury. However, this point should be blamed on the improper measures of the British government and the British tax commissioner. Now the government can negotiate with the United Kingdom to settle accounts with the enemy and recover the Customs duties deposited in the Zhengjin Bank after that period. It should not collect supplementary taxes from the people, especially not when transshipping to other ports, and collect supplementary taxes from merchants in other ports, making consumers outside Shanghai enjoy unequal treatment with consumers in Shanghai. I hope the authorities can reconsider. December 20

However, let's take a look at our educational national defense?

Taking Shanghai, the heart of our country's culture, as an example, although no experts have done accurate statistics in this regard, everyone must know its fate due to what they have seen and heard.

Many school-age children are unable to attend school because they cannot afford it. Some work as beggars in the streets, or scavenge in the alleys. Many are driven to the market to be vendors, or to the factory to be workers. There are also many promising young people who are rejected outside the school gates due to the hardship of life. Some have to enter society, and some stand at the crossroads in despair because they cannot find a job.

Let's take a look at the situation of those who are responsible for teaching and training these future masters. Almost all teachers and professors in Shanghai have been struggling on the edge of the famine line since the beginning of the War of Resistance. Many who can no longer endure the whipping of life have gradually jumped out of this poor educational circle and sought other ways out. As for those who have no way to go and have a special interest in education, although their income is even less than that of a rickshaw puller on the street, they are still gritting their teeth and struggling. However, it is very worrying to what extent and when they can struggle.

"Seeing these tragic situations, we cannot just think that this is a sign of the bankruptcy of education in Shanghai, this is a major crisis in society, nor can we think that this is only the result of the irresponsibility of our national or local government. We must know that since the victory of the War of Resistance, the national and local governments have had thousands of things to do and cannot concentrate all their efforts on this work. At the same time, we don't have to be disheartened. Since education in Shanghai has fallen into this predicament, and the citizens of Shanghai have faced this crisis, every citizen cannot stand idly by. We must take the responsibility of learning from and remedying the situation. We cannot completely push this responsibility onto the shoulders of the central and local governments. We should try our best to automatically rise up to plan rescue methods, so we organized the Shanghai Educational Loan Committee.

The history of Shanghai has told us this: Since the establishment of the Republic of China, all large-scale patriotic movements, cultural movements, and relief movements have been vigorously promoted by the citizens of the city, and Shanghai has been able to achieve the most superior and glorious success. Of course, our educational loan movement this time is no exception. We hope that people from all walks of life can understand and support it. The bright future of the country and society is entirely tied to the nationals of our next generation. We must irrigate and cultivate this tender bud in the wind and rain. We must contribute our efforts and money and enthusiastically support it so that it can grow strong and bloom with gorgeous flowers.

In short, we are all convinced that the people of Shanghai will not disappoint us in this profoundly meaningful loan movement!

### Chinese and Foreign Members Cooperate Sincerely - Municipal Advisory Council Established - Mayor Qian Hopes to Assist in Municipal Reform

The Municipal Advisory Council held its inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Municipal Government. Members present included Yan Huiqing, Guo Linshuang, Pan Xulun, Xi Yushu, Ge Jieshen, Liu Hongsheng, foreign members Douclai Stof (France), Liddell (England), Erlite (America), Marshall (England), Bowynden (America), and Hopkin (America). Deputy Mayor He Dequi, Secretary-General Shen Shihua, and Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhao Zengjue were also present. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Yan Huiqing, who discussed important municipal facilities in detail and made many suggestions. Foreign members Marshall, Hopkin, and Douclai Stof also spoke successively, expressing their willingness to cooperate.

Mayor Qian's Speech

Mayor Qian said in his speech: The post-war reconstruction of this city is complex and cannot be undertaken by one person. It requires the efforts of everyone to succeed. As the Mayor of Shanghai, I sincerely hope that all members will cooperate with me and the Municipal Government to provide valuable insights at any time. Shanghai has many problems to solve. We have encountered all kinds of problems that large cities and commercial ports have. I was ordered to be the Mayor of this city and feel a heavy responsibility. However, since I took office, I have been trying to alleviate the suffering of the citizens and promote the revitalization of this city, and plan for the future development of this city, so that all residents of the city, regardless of race, religion, or nationality, can live and work in peace. In order to gather opinions and benefit from each other, the Municipal Government has established the Municipal Advisory Council. I am convinced that from now on, we will be able to obtain insightful guidance from Chinese and foreign leaders on all issues related to the city's municipal administration.

Three Tasks

As you all know, the functions of the Advisory Council are threefold. First, it is to review the municipal events submitted by me for deliberation. Second, it is to make suggestions on municipal issues. Third, it is to provide opinions to the Provisional Municipal Council. We hope that the hopes and opinions of Chinese and foreign residents of this city can be conveyed to the municipal authorities through the advisory committee, so that the policies of the municipal government can meet the needs of the citizens. Everyone, the task of the Advisory Council is not passive. The members are not limited to reviewing the events submitted by me for deliberation. You are all welcome to raise opinions and suggestions on your own initiative. The suggestions provided by the Advisory Council can be submitted to the Provisional Municipal Council, which will be established soon, for discussion when necessary. If it is passed in the Municipal Council, then this proposal will have full legal force and will be even more important. There are many foreigners in this city. This Advisory Council, which is jointly composed of Chinese and foreign residents' leaders, naturally occupies a very important position in the city's civic groups. Although the proportion of foreigners is not large compared with our Chinese residents, we still feel that it is necessary to invite foreign leaders to participate in this Advisory Council. Therefore, I am convinced that the establishment of the Advisory Council can promote Chinese and foreign understanding and cooperation.

Accept Proposals

You have all served this city for many years, are enthusiastic about public welfare, and have rich experience. You are leaders who are unanimously respected by the residents. I place complete trust and unwavering faith in you and hope that you can assist me in promoting municipal reform. What you see and hear is what I see and hear. In many ways, I will rely on you to obtain correct knowledge and appropriate proposals so that Shanghai can not only become the main city in the Far East, but also continue to stand in the ranks of the world's major cities. I hope that you can provide opinions on municipal administration from time to time. As for myself, I will cooperate with you sincerely and accept your opinions and proposals to the best of my ability.

Brief commentary

### New Initiatives in Shanghai Municipal Administration

The Shanghai Municipal Government has established the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, inviting leading figures from China, Britain, the United States, and France as members, with Mr. Yan Huiqing serving as the chairman, which was announced a few days ago. Mayor Qian Dajun said at the establishment of the committee: "The post-war reconstruction of the city is complex and cannot be undertaken by one person. It requires the collective efforts of everyone to succeed." This is enough to show the mayor's humility, and also illustrates the government's eagerness to see success. Under the unequal treaties, Shanghai originally had separate administrations in the concessions. Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, the concession administrations have also disappeared. However, Shanghai is China's premier commercial port, and the percentage of foreigners residing there in the city's population is not large, but the number is not small. Some have extensive experience in municipal facilities, and others have specialized knowledge, all of which can assist the municipal authorities. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Standing Bureau invites them to be members and organizes the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee. It is believed that they will contribute greatly to municipal administration.

Shanghai is an international city, and post-war reconstruction is indeed complex, as Mayor Qian said. This requires the sincere cooperation of Chinese and foreign citizens. The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee shows how willing the municipal authorities are to humbly accept the support of foreign residents and leaders from all walks of life in our country, and how dedicated they are to promoting understanding and cooperation between China and foreign countries. We hope that this new municipal organization can fulfill its mission and set an example for Sino-foreign cooperation!

‚Äî S Ming

Since the US Air Force established a Flying Fortress base in Chengdu last year, it has dealt a major fatal blow to the Japanese army in the East Asian theater. The B29 type has since frequently gone to Japan to bomb, causing the enemy to panic. They desperately tried to find out the US Air Force base, and finally determined that it was Chengdu Airport. So they risked bombing it, but the defense there was tight. After the daylight air raids by the Japanese failed, they implemented night bombing. At that time, the US Air Force supplied Europe and sent four night fighters named "Black Widow" to Chengdu. The manufacturing was very clever and mysterious, specially suitable for night fighting. The aircraft is a single-engine twin-boom type, and there is only one aviator, who is both the pilot and the small cannon gunner. The aircraft is painted with stealth paint, which absorbs light instead of reflecting it, so it is not easy to see it at night, which is one of its features.

As for the inside of the fuselage, all the organs are indicated by ultraviolet rays that cannot be seen with the naked eye. The pilot is equipped with special instruments and can still see everything, so it is not easy for the enemy to find her location, which is her second feature.

The third feature is that the aircraft is equipped with a secret instrument like a compass, using wireless waves to control a fairly large space. If an enemy aircraft flies into this wave range, the compass needle will rotate by itself, indicating the direction of the enemy aircraft. The pilot can clearly see the direction and attack the target. According to the US Air Force, this mysterious compass was invented based on the method of catching insects by a black spider in Africa. Because when a spider catches insects, it often sits alone in the center of the web, waiting for food. Once an insect hits the web, spider silk will pull the spider, and the spider will immediately follow the direction and catch the insect. This clever method aroused the interest of scientists, who imitated it and invented the compass, which is used in night fighters. That kind of spider is called "Black Widow", so this night fighter is also called "Black Widow".

When there is an air raid alarm at night, all the other fighters on the ground hide to avoid misunderstandings. The "Black Widow" immediately takes off to fight. It flies very high, patrolling everywhere, waiting for the enemy aircraft. When its compass finds a target, it quickly flies in the direction to attack. The enemy aircraft has not yet discovered it, and it has already flown over the enemy aircraft. Suddenly, two strong searchlights are turned on in its abdomen, directly forcing the target, making the enemy aircraft pilot dizzy and helpless. At this critical moment, the "Black Widow" fired a small steel cannon from its abdomen, and with a bang, immediately sent the enemy aircraft to its death! Once the mission is completed, she will rise to the sky again to search for enemy aircraft. This terrible raid simply made the enemy unable to cope.

One night in March this year, more than a dozen Japanese aircraft attacked the Chengdu base. Our side dispatched four "Black Widows" and shot down all the Japanese aircraft, without any survivors, establishing a great achievement, making the Japanese army confused and greatly shocked. Since then, they have never dared to bomb again. Since the amazing news of that secret aircraft came out, the people in the rear have praised the "Black Widow" in unison, but many people still do not know the details, and mistakenly believe that the "Black Widow" that shot down more than a dozen enemy aircraft that time was a famous female air force pilot in the United States!

### A Brief Discussion on Keeping to the Right

‚Äî Yifei

Starting from New Year's Day next year, people in Shanghai will walk on the right instead of the left, keeping up with the world trend and improving.

In my opinion, if this movement is to be implemented, it must be universal. Not only must large cities do so, but also remote rural areas should implement it, so that the whole country is consistent and facilitates traffic. Otherwise, if the systems in various places are different, one with left-hand traffic and one with right-hand traffic, people will find it difficult to avoid accidents when traveling?

I think that before implementation, various places should conduct popular training in advance so that every person can have this common sense of right-hand traffic. The methods can be divided into three points:

(1) Schools ‚Äî Schools are institutions for knowledge transmission. The principals and standing bureaus of each school can be designated to teach students the implementation methods so that ordinary families can understand.

(2) Baojia ‚Äî Baojia is an administrative management organization. Once an order is issued, everyone will abide by it. The Baojia chiefs can be ordered to give more advice to the people in their jurisdiction to make it easier to universalize.

(3) Broadcasting ‚Äî If the aforementioned two methods cannot make all the people understand, the time can be set to broadcast lectures so that people of all classes can deeply understand this policy and implement it fully.

Random Thoughts

### Sexual Issues

‚Äî Cui Jingtai

On Wednesday, I went to a bookstore to browse newspapers and books. The store had several newly published books, about ten copies of each displayed on the counter for people to pick up and read. There were many people looking at books. In that row of new books, there was a gap. I saw that only one book remained in the gap. It was the Chinese translation of Ellis's *Psychology of Sex*. Several young men were holding it and reading it with great interest. I picked up the last copy of *Psychology of Sex*. Just looking at the price, it was quite expensive, costing more than 100,000 in counterfeit currency! I had to choose what I wanted to know and read that first. After reading for a while, I noticed someone behind me was looking at what I was reading. I felt a little embarrassed. My mind wandered, and I couldn't concentrate on the content of the book anymore. I flipped through it randomly and put it back. Someone immediately took it. I happened to see a line of small characters on the cover of the book on that person's back: "Researching the most serious problem in life."

The day before, Mr. Zhang Yaoxiang, who teaches social psychology, was talking about several innate human impulses. He said, "The greatest impulses in human life are, first, hunger, and second, sexual desire. The most interesting thing about this World War is probably Hitler marrying his lover in the bomb-shattered Berlin camp. This terrifying and hateful demon king, on the day before he saw his demise and had to commit suicide, actually completed the most unfathomable event of his life amidst such inexplicable turmoil; the Duke of Windsor giving up the throne for Mrs. Simpson has also become a very humane anecdote. The noble and virtuous Su Wu, living among the Xiongnu, swallowing felt and drinking snow, married and had children with a Xiongnu princess during nineteen years of hardship. Edgar Snow, the author of *Red Star Over China*, wrote in the book that when he interviewed Mr. Mao Zedong, he asked Mr. Mao what he thought of women. Mr. Mao replied that he was not interested. However, not long after, Mr. Mao married Ms. Lan Ping, a film star from Shanghai. On his deathbed, Napoleon of France frequently called out the name of his wife, as if he had forgotten everything worldly. Without the love affairs of the protagonists, how could those great historical films like *Cleopatra* succeed as touching films?"

Professor Yu Rixuan once spoke to a group of young people about self-cultivation, also mentioning that when he was studying in middle school, he heard many classmates liked to talk about sex. He found it disgusting and told his teacher. The teacher said to him, "Very good that you don't like to talk about sex, but do you think about it in your heart?" He blushed at the teacher's question, lowered his head, and admitted: "I do."

Who doesn't think about sex? The problem lies in this "thinking"!

Sex is like a raging fire in human life. It can nourish people, but it can also easily destroy them.

Humanity has made many contributions in natural science and society, but we are still very ignorant about ourselves. When will our generation have enlightened and correct views on sexuality?

### The Annoying Fog of Chongqing

‚Äî Mei Youyun

The long-awaited clear sky finally arrived. The winter sun comforted the mountain city, and the cold wind and rain disappeared. People's moods warmed up again. However, that annoying fog still surrounds Chongqing, obstructing people's vision!

Personnel returning to the capital are leaving one after another. Some have serious problems with blankets after arriving in Nanjing because their families cannot leave. Some, because they are old and weak, fear they will die on the plane, and are writing their wills first. Compatriots in the recovered areas! Not all "Chongqing people" are so hateful. After these people returning to the capital arrive in Nanjing, they will bring the spirit of "poorly working" and "hard working" that Chongqing people have maintained for eight years.

Special Envoy Marshall has taken off with an important mission to China. We welcome this friendly guest.

The Political Consultative Conference has been delayed for so long because of waiting for the Yan'an representatives. Now the thirty-odd Yan'an representatives have arrived. Many people are placing their sincere hope for peace on the Political Consultative Conference. These thirty-odd Yan'an representatives are busy with "visits" and "exchanges of views". Will they be able to dispel this annoying fog of sorrow?

### The Difficulty of Seal Carving

‚Äî Wen Quan

Is it easier to carve "white seals" or "red seals"? Every person who wants to learn seal carving often asks people this question. Someone with seal carving experience will definitely tell him to start learning from "white seals" first, and then learn "red seals." Indeed, for beginners, carving "white seals" is easier to learn than "red seals."

Or you may think otherwise, because after you learn "red seals" in the second step and become quite skilled, when you go back to carve "white seals," you will feel that "white seals" are difficult to carve, and it seems that "red seals" are easier. If you go through another period of time, and then you carve "red seals" again, then you will similarly feel that "red seals" are more difficult to carve than "white seals." Thus, in this way, one difficulty and one ease, one ease and one difficulty, repeatedly switch.

In fact, this is not a question of whether it is difficult or easy to carve "white seals" and "red seals." The actual issue lies in your relationship between familiarity and unfamiliarity with carving "white seals" and "red seals." After carving "red seals" for a while, because of familiarity, you feel it is easy, while "white seals," because of a period of unfamiliarity, then feel difficult. Similarly, after carving "white seals" for a while, and then carving "red seals," you will also have a feeling of difficulty and ease.

Seal carving is like this, and so is learning and doing things!

Writing

### The Issue of Horizontal Writing of Chinese Characters

‚Äî Wang Shuliang

I remember that someone abroad once asked: "When you Chinese write horizontally, is it from left to right or from right to left?" For ambiguous Chinese people, it was really impossible to answer. Now, I'm afraid some people will still ask the same question! The Municipal Education Bureau issued a special circular on November 24 to all primary and secondary schools and social education institutions, stipulating that "when Chinese is written horizontally, whether on charts, plaques, road signs, and all other documents, advertisements, etc., it should be from right to left."

In fact, writing Chinese characters from right to left horizontally is our country's traditional habit, but later a part of the text was changed to horizontal from left to right. It also has its unavoidable difficulties. The first is many articles mixed with Arabic numerals, such as those discussing arithmetic, accounting, etc. The second is scientific and engineering articles, which often mix formulas and numbers, and also add academic names in Roman letters. And in the present era of increasingly close world cultural exchanges, many articles also need to add the original names in Roman letters and attach Western texts. In addition, there are Chinese lyrics in musical staves. ‚Ä¶ When writing these horizontally, if you change to right to left, it will be inconvenient or even impossible!

Especially when writing with a pen, because ordinary people write with their right hand, horizontally from left to right; if from top to bottom, it can be written very well, and each character can be compared neatly with the many characters that have already been written; finally, write to the lower right of the paper, and the right hand returns to its original position near the body, which is also very natural. But, if you write horizontally from right to left? Then it is not easy to write well. Because when you write with your right hand, you will cover up all the characters already written on the right. On the one hand, it is impossible to compare neatly, and on the other hand, it is easy to smudge the newly written words. Why is there no problem when writing Chinese vertically from right to left? This is because when writing from top to bottom, each character can be compared neatly with the characters above, and when changing to write a new line, you only need to align the position of the first character, and the following characters can be connected and written.

The direction of horizontal writing is closely related to the direction of bookbinding. A book, assuming it is bound on the right side, and the horizontal writing is from left to right, looks unpleasant. The opposite is also true. And now, the books, newspapers, and documents in our country seem to have the following trends: (1) Books bound on the right side, horizontal writing from right to left; books bound on the left side, horizontal writing from left to right. (2) In vertical text from right to left, horizontal text can be mixed in or beside it, and horizontal text from right to left. (If the characters are arranged horizontally and turned into a vertical direction, then from left to right). (3) Plaques and signs, with the traditional habit not easy to break, are still mostly from right to left. But lengthy horizontal texts from right to left are no longer commonly seen.

In short, when writing Chinese horizontally, it is sometimes inconvenient or impossible to write from right to left. But almost no horizontal writing from right to left cannot be changed to from left to right. And horizontal writing from left to right conforms to internationalization and has unignorable advantages for promoting science and engineering. The current director and deputy director of the Municipal Education Bureau are both veterans of engineering education, and they should have the same feeling about this. So, please withdraw the order!

Rare News

### The Origin of the Cocktail

‚Äî Mu Ye

Recently, newspapers often publish news of "cocktail parties" being held. I heard that it costs about one million in legal currency to host one, which shows a glimpse of its luxury.

Cocktail is a literal translation of the word "Cocktail." It tastes sweet and sour and has a fragrant aroma, because it is made by mixing whiskey, brandy, and other liquors with sugar, spices, and bitters (vinegar). This famous wine is mostly produced in the United States and began to become popular about a hundred years ago.

It is said that the person who invented this precious drink was a Mexican nobleman. This nobleman had a beautiful daughter named Xochitt. One day, he brewed this wine and ordered his daughter to present it to the king in person. Unexpectedly, as soon as the king saw her, he fell in love and drank the wine in one gulp, and then used her fragrant name to name the wine. Later, Xochitt was transformed into Cocktail, which is the current cocktail.

### Quickly Issue Rewards for Secretly Reported Enemy Property - Reader Requests Reply

A letter from Mr. Tang Shengming, a reader of this newspaper, states: I previously secretly reported a piece of enemy property to the Third Front Army Headquarters, which has been sealed up by the headquarters. I have inquired several times about when the reward will be issued, but there has been no definite answer. When the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau was established, it was announced that all cases of enemy and puppet property would be handled by the processing bureau. I have submitted inquiries several times, but have not received any instructions. From the sealing up to now, it has been two and a half months. In terms of time, it cannot be considered short. The processing bureau and the headquarters handle many cases, but the enemy property I reported was sealed up two months ago, and I have recently heard that the valuation has been completed, and the reward should be issued first. Now, it is delayed, which really makes me not know why. If there are any difficulties in it, I am willing to comply. I now request the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau and the Third Front Army Headquarters to quickly issue the reward to maintain the credibility of the government. I earnestly request the editor to revise this letter and publish it in your newspaper. I am extremely grateful. (Note) The person who secretly reported has fulfilled his responsibility of secretly reporting, and the authorities should contact him, and inform the date of reward, so as to put his heart at ease. It is inappropriate to ignore him.

### Winter Relief Urgently Needed

These few days of this year, the weather has suddenly turned cold, and the north wind is whistling. The general poor compatriots and unemployed workers are feeling a serious threat. Because of the high prices of goods, they "have no clothes" and "have no rice," and are suffering greatly. As for the "Winter Relief Movement" initiated by the authorities and enthusiastic people, the intention is good, and the methods should strive for practical benefits. I think that the number of poor compatriots who need winter relief this year is more than in previous years (because clothing is very expensive). I hope that the authorities and people from all walks of life will quickly promote a large-scale and widespread winter relief movement, so that the compatriots in distress can get through this difficult winter, and the country and society will benefit from it. Also, winter relief has a major relationship to social security. Please everyone urgently handle winter relief! (Should)

Tuberculosis Prevention Lecture

### Theory of No Worry for Lung Disease (5)

(9) To Eliminate Infection, Isolation and Recuperation Are Necessary

All general open pulmonary tuberculosis patients, that is, those whose sputum contains tuberculosis bacteria, are the source of spreading pulmonary tuberculosis seeds, and can be called dangerous elements in society. The transmission routes are either due to the patient's spitting anywhere, and drying up, spreading with the air, or because of eating at the same table, and the utensils are not distinguished, and are transmitted by saliva from the sick person. The spread of lung disease, this is the biggest factor, and the harm to social health is no greater than this. Therefore, in order to eliminate infection, the examination of the patient's sputum is very important. If the examination result shows that tuberculosis bacteria are already present in the sputum, they should be immediately hospitalized for treatment and completely isolated from the outside world. This measure is not only of great concern to social health, but also provides the individual patient with suitable conditions for recuperation due to hospitalization, such as sufficient air and sunlight, appropriate nutrition, and absolute quiet, so as to improve their own resistance and embark on the path of early recovery to health.

(10) Eradicate Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Revive the Nation. Pulmonary tuberculosis must be treated for a long period of time. The loss of time and economy suffered by patients is far greater than that of general diseases, and it also hinders production and has a major impact. In our country, public health and tuberculosis prevention facilities have not been popularized, and the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis is alarming. Poor countries and poor people, this is especially true! It is a major obstacle to the revival of the nation. Therefore, eradicating pulmonary tuberculosis is not only an urgent task to improve people's health, but also an important requirement for improving life. However, in order to achieve results, the public must generally recognize the importance of early diagnosis, and then popularize X-ray examination work, so as to produce the following effects: (A) Enable early detection of lung disease, without losing the opportunity for early radical treatment. (B) Due to early radical treatment, early recovery to health, saving both time and economy. (C) Due to early recovery to health, early recovery of production capacity, individuals, families, and society will benefit. (D) Because one person's early cure prevents multiple people from being infected, countless losses to society are avoided invisibly. The various effects arising from the above-mentioned early diagnosis are already considerable from the individual's point of view. When calculating millions of people together, the losses reduced and the increase in productivity are countless, which is an important factor in stabilizing society and increasing national strength. It is deeply hoped that social elites will vigorously promote early diagnosis, so as to jointly eradicate this pulmonary tuberculosis that endangers the nation's health, achieve practical results, and lay a solid foundation for the revival of the nation. (End)
