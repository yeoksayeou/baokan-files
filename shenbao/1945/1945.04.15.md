### Japanese Counterattack in Southern Okinawa; Fierce Fighting North of Nago Bay; Japanese Air Force Sinks or Destroys Twelve Enemy Ships

Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM on the 14th: The land battle situation on Okinawa Island is as follows: Japanese infantry and artillery in the southern area, in close coordination, have been counterattacking the enemy in front of their lines since the evening of the 12th, thwarting the enemy's offensive attempts and are currently expanding their gains. Japanese forces in the eastern peninsula region north of Nago Bay are currently engaged in battle with approximately one division of attacking enemy forces, causing an explosion at the northern airfield with a diameter of 1,000 meters and a height of 3,000 meters. Japanese special attack aircraft squadrons continue to fiercely attack enemy ships around the island. As of dawn on the 12th, the confirmed results are as follows: Sunk one cruiser, one transport ship, and five ships of unidentified type; destroyed one cruiser, one destroyer, one transport ship, and one ship of unidentified type.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces in the southern Okinawa area launched a full-scale counterattack on the 12th, and with the aid of artillery support, gradually pushed the enemy back to the north. By noon on the 13th, they had advanced to a line including Heights 1032 and 1052, Ginowan, and Oyama. Other powerful Japanese units have also penetrated deep into enemy territory, shattering their positions and throwing them into confusion.

Central Pacific Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese air units, on the morning of the 12th, launched a surprise attack with fighters and bombers on the northern and central airfields of Okinawa Island, with all bombs hitting the airfields, causing complete destruction. Japanese aircraft also ambushed enemy ships east of the Amami Islands, destroying one destroyer after a fierce attack. Subsequently, they launched another surprise attack on enemy ship groups off Cape Zanpa on Okinawa Island, destroying one destroyer.

### Second Japanese Total Special Attack; Okinawa Situation Reaches Peak

Front Line Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese army and navy bases simultaneously began a second total special attack on enemy mobile forces around Okinawa at daylight on the 11th. Following the first total attack on the 6th and 7th, fierce fighting between Japanese and American forces on Okinawa Island has reached an unprecedented climax. This is the most serious situation since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese army and navy are resolved to reverse the situation with the second total attack, hoping that there will be no need for a third attack after the second one. If a third attack is necessary, it will inevitably involve attacking the collapsing enemy forces, meaning that all reserve air power must be deployed with full force. The second total attack that has now begun is a decisive battle within a decisive battle that will determine the nation's fate. However, the factors that have led the battle situation to its current state depend on the success of the first total attack. Due to poor weather conditions, there was a gap of two or three days between the first and second attacks, but this was not merely a passage of time. Extremely large changes in the battle situation occurred between these two total attacks.

Enemy Casualties Exceed Expectations

In the first total attack, the enemy suffered damage to nearly one hundred ships. After suffering this blow, the enemy's unmistakable wavering has become evident in recent days. Enemy casualties are gradually exceeding the enemy command's expectations. The enemy's mobile forces are now relying on the British fleet. Even if it doesn't reach this point, or this is only a temporary weakening of combat power, judging from the facts before our eyes, the enemy's efforts to resupply after the first total attack, as well as the deep enticement of all their forces into the Ryukyu waters, are all due to the success of the first total attack. The Japanese army is seizing this opportunity to launch the second attack. At this current stage of the decisive battle for Okinawa, its importance lies in the enemy's long supply lines and the ability of Japanese air bases to deploy land and naval fighters. In other words, the spirit of the Japanese forces launching the total attack can permanently wear down the enemy's material warfare tactics.

Japanese Fighters' Successful Sorties

Central Pacific Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese new-type fighter squadrons ambushed sixty giant enemy aircraft over Kikai Island on the afternoon of the 12th, shooting down twenty-three. That night, they launched a surprise attack on enemy ship groups in the waters east of the Okinawa Islands, destroying and setting fire to at least one enemy ship of unidentified type. They also attacked enemy transport convoys off the main island, sinking one small transport ship and destroying one medium-sized transport ship, causing a fire. On the 12th, enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked Okinawa Island, totaling approximately five hundred and several dozen aircraft.

### Food Shortage Grips British Indian Forces in Burma

Burma Front, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces in central Burma carried out skillful operations on the 12th, organizing the capture of enemy motor vehicle units and specifically targeting enemy vehicles, resulting in the destruction of five trucks, the disabling of forty-five trucks, and the damaging of ten other vehicles.

Burma Front, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After enemy infantry units entered Meiktila, they were surrounded by Japanese forces. Lord Mountbatten, Commander-in-Chief of Southeast Asia Command, went to Mandalay to hold a military parade to boost morale, but in reality, the enemy army has declared a food shortage. This time, the enemy is forcibly requisitioning military rice, causing complete panic in rural villages. Situations where British or Indian soldiers on the front lines seize rice sacks carried by fallen soldiers and flee are visible everywhere, demonstrating how severe their food shortage is. Furthermore, the general population has extremely strong anti-British sentiments. The village chief of a certain village in Meiktila, seeing British forces invading the Pwama area, informed five Japanese soldiers and helped them disguise themselves as civilians, rescuing them from the encirclement and sending them to the main Japanese forces.

Vice President Iinuma Vows Revenge

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Iinuma, Vice President of the Shrine Board, visited Meiji Shrine, reported unwavering fighting spirit, vowed revenge, and issued the following statement: The bombing by enemy American air force has surpassed the barbaric and reckless attack of indiscriminate bombing, having previously violated the sacred grounds of Ise Grand Shrine, and then used incendiary bombs to destroy Atsuta Shrine, Kitano Shrine, Zama Shrine, Abeno Shrine, and Minatogawa Shrine. Now they have bombed the main hall and worship hall of Meiji Shrine, revered by 100 million people, causing unspeakable fear. Although the shrine buildings have been burned down, the sacred objects are safe and unharmed. I report to the gods that 100 million citizens are determined to take revenge.

Minister Matsushima Issues Statement

Central News Agency Report - When enemy American aircraft raided Tokyo on the night of the 13th, they disregarded the rules of war and carried out indiscriminate bombing of the Japanese capital, even dropping incendiary bombs on the Meiji Shrine, revered by the Japanese people, causing a fire. Colonel Matsushima, reporting minister of the fleet of a friendly nation stationed in China, issued the following views on this matter: In the past three weeks of fighting in the Okinawa area, the enemy American army and navy have suffered significant damage, especially the Pacific Fleet, which has been left badly battered. At the same time, the sudden death of President Roosevelt has dealt a major blow to the enemy's morale. In order to conceal these dire circumstances at home and abroad, the enemy is attacking Japan's non-military facilities and innocent civilians, regardless of everything. It is evident. In other words, the enemy's use of such vile means demonstrates the immense losses they have suffered recently. Recently, the powerful base of the American Air Force stationed in China, Laohekou, was seized by the Japanese army, so before dawn on the 14th, they carried out guerrilla-style air raids on the Shanghai area, their methods were equally vile. All of us in East Asia should do our best to work together and fight to eliminate our common enemy.

### Imperial Palace and Meiji Shrine Bombed; All Japanese People Exceptionally Outraged; Prime Minister Suzuki Offered Apologies to the Imperial Palace Yesterday Morning

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Prime Minister Suzuki of Japan was deeply fearful of the reckless bombing of the Imperial Palace and Meiji Shrine by American aircraft. He visited the Imperial Palace at 10:30 AM on the 14th to apologize, and then issued a statement at 5:30 PM saying: The enemy aircraft that raided Tokyo on the night of the 13th dropped bombs on the Imperial Palace's Omiya Palace and Akasaka Detached Palace, and also destroyed the main hall and worship hall of the Meiji Shrine. However, the three halls within the Imperial Palace are safe and unharmed. Furthermore, the spirit of Meiji Shrine has been respectfully moved. As a subject, I am deeply fearful of this kind of situation. This morning, I especially visited the Imperial Palace and visited Meiji Shrine to respectfully offer my apologies. The enemy aircraft committed a similar act of disrespect and recklessness against Ise Grand Shrine before, and now they have committed the same reckless act against the Imperial Palace and Meiji Shrine, which is truly hateful. All of us are deeply outraged by this. I hereby further strengthen my determination to complete the war, work together with 100 million citizens to thoroughly crush the arrogant enemy that Heaven will not tolerate, and to ease His Majesty's mind.

### Forty-One Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Night Raid on Tokyo; Approximately Eighty Others Damaged

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 14th: From 11:00 PM on the 13th, for approximately four hours, about 170 B-29 enemy aircraft, most of which raided Tokyo, dropped bombs and incendiary bombs, indiscriminately bombing urban areas. Two buildings within the Omiya Palace and Akasaka Detached Palace of the Imperial Palace also caught fire as a result, but were quickly extinguished.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - One hundred seventy B-29 bombers from the Mariana Islands base carried out a night bombing raid on the Tokyo area at 11:00 PM on the 13th. Initially, a group of enemy aircraft moved north along the Ogasawara Islands and Izu Islands, and from 11:00 PM, the main force approached Tokyo from the Boso Peninsula area, while another part approached from the Hiratsuka area, dividing into small teams or entering Tokyo alone. They carried out wave attacks from an altitude of 3,000 or 4,000 meters, dropping bombs and incendiary bombs in various parts of the city.

Air Raids on Canton and Hong Kong

Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy aircraft invaded the urban area of this city at 2:25 PM on the 14th, and fearing the threat of anti-aircraft fire, did not dare to fly in place.

Travel Correspondence

### Record of a Trip to Huaihai: Scenery of Xuzhou

— Yifei

On the Beijing Road

On the first of the month, the reporter accompanied a group of Northern delegates to the National People's Congress from the capital. As dusk gathered, we crossed the Yangtze River by ferry and arrived at Pukou. Due to the chaotic order at the station, we were delayed for a long time, and only entered the station at 9:30 PM. Most of the carriages that the so-called Congress reception group had reserved for the delegates had already been occupied by others, and many delegates had no seats. The train departed an hour late from the scheduled time, only leaving the station at 11:00 PM. The carriages were small and crowded with passengers, and because the windows were broken, none of them could be opened, resulting in polluted air and abnormal stuffiness. Passengers complained bitterly.

At 12:10 PM on the next day, the train arrived at Fuliji Station. During the stop, the sound of an air raid alarm in the village suddenly rang, and passengers got off the train to take shelter in the nearby poorly equipped air raid shelter. These trench-style air raid shelters, with no cover and only a short distance from the train, are of no use. The railway bureau does not think about passenger safety and should improve them. The reporter and some of the passengers stayed on the train, quietly waiting for fate to unfold. After about five minutes, enemy aircraft arrived at our location. The reporter witnessed three silver P-51 enemy aircraft flying low overhead. The alarm was lifted two hours later. The train continued its journey. At 7:00 PM, the train arrived in Xuzhou.

Changing Weather

On the day of arriving in Xuzhou, the climate here was like midsummer in Jiangnan, extraordinarily hot and stuffy. But the next evening, a strong wind gathered, and it became abnormally cold, no less than severe winter. Furthermore, it even snowed heavily on the 4th. Such sudden changes in the climate in the space of a few days were truly unexpected. According to local farmers, this spring snow will have a significant impact on crops.

Difficult to Find Lodging

The lodging problem is truly serious in Xuzhou. All of the large and small hotels in the city are full. The reason for this is that Xuzhou City is currently the seat of the Huaihai provincial government, and government officials and soldiers travel back and forth frequently. In addition, the population has increased sharply in recent years (the current city population is about 250,000), but there are too few residential houses to accommodate them, so many of these people rent rooms in hotels for long periods, rarely moving, making it difficult for newcomers to find accommodation. The reporter wandered all night, at a loss for what to do. Finally, after negotiating with the innkeeper, he agreed to set up a temporary bed in his accounting room, which finally solved the problem.

Glimpse of the City

The current city of Xuzhou is like a flower in the desert. Although the inherent environmental conditions are poor, many great buildings have been gradually completed through the cooperative efforts of officials and the people. The promotion of road administration is also being carried out with tireless efforts.

The bustling areas of Xuzhou are concentrated in Gongming Street, Pinglu Main Street, and other places. There are many shops selling miscellaneous grains and southern goods, Western goods, etc. The streets are also wider than in other urban and rural areas. As for the market, there is the "Dawn Market" (also known as Small Market) outside the South Gate, at the foot of Yunlong Mountain Square, which is very prosperous. Among them, cloth stalls are the most numerous, followed by daily necessities. Merchants and residents set up tents and mats, gathering here like hedgehogs.

Prices and Food

Huaihai produces a large amount of wheat, so the price of flour here is only 100 yuan per catty, which is the main food for the people. The general living standard of farmers here is relatively well-off, but they mainly eat miscellaneous grains. Very little rice is produced, all relying on Jiangzhe and Anhui provinces. Currently, due to inconvenient transportation, it relies only on Bengbu, Wuhu, and other places in Anhui, but without large-scale transportation, it relies only on small vendors' sporadic imports to meet the needs of people from other places. The price recently is 42,000 yuan per dan. The prices of other major food and daily necessities are listed as follows: meat 400 yuan per catty, cabbage 150 yuan, spinach 180 yuan, raw oil 300 yuan per catty, eggs 25 yuan each.

Police Defense Corps Members

Xuzhou currently has a Chinese-Japanese joint police defense corps, with more than 10,000 members, of whom Chinese account for six tenths. All wear neat black uniforms and carry white rattan canes with long iron hooks on them, which is quite solemn. They practice diligently every day, often parading in the streets in formation. Their most important task is to provide services during air raids. After the alarm is issued, they deploy along the streets quickly and serve conscientiously.

Weekly Commentary

### The Impact of Roosevelt's Death on the Anti-Axis Powers

— Chen Binhe

—Broadcast Speech on Shanghai Radio on April 14th

The news of the death of American President Roosevelt is undoubtedly a devastating blow to the anti-Axis powers. What we want to study now is what kind of impact his death will have on the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing.

From the perspective of the impact on the United States, it is of course very serious. Although the United States is known as a democratic country, presidents with great ambition can acquire a disguised dictatorial position. Roosevelt is one example. He was elected president four times, breaking the precedent, and had long established a dictatorial position for himself in politics, economics, and military affairs. The United States' only parliament that can restrict the president's power according to the constitution has been constantly at odds with him recently, centered on the Conscription Act, but he is good at using tactics, using domestic and foreign public opinion to manipulate the parliament, strengthening his dictatorial power, and controlling the country's military and political power. Therefore, his death has a serious shock to the United States, both politically, economically, and militarily.

From the perspective of the impact on the anti-Axis powers, it can be studied from three aspects:

First, the one that has suffered the most is undoubtedly Great Britain. We should remember that when France surrendered to Germany in June 1940, Great Britain was already in imminent danger. The German army could step on the British Isles at any time. At that time, it became a turning point in the war situation. It was Roosevelt who caused Germany to open up the war against the Soviet Union and save the British crisis. Originally, Roosevelt's policy of standing by and watching the European situation had lost a France. If Germany wins in the future, the United States will not be able to sleep peacefully. So he changed his policy, started preparing for war and expanding armaments. On one hand, he secretly supported Great Britain. In August of the same year, the United States and Great Britain reached an agreement, in which the United States exchanged 50 destroyers for bases in British territories. Later, it developed into the Lend-Lease Act for British military supplies, which boosted the defeated British army. Roosevelt, who insisted on British-American cooperation to restore the capitalist imperialist world order in this way, now died halfway. Great Britain is worried about being alone in military affairs in the future, and is also at a disadvantage in diplomacy with the Soviet Union. No wonder Churchill was shocked and at a loss when he heard the news of his death.

Second, Chongqing will certainly suffer a major blow due to Roosevelt's death. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Chongqing's so-called "Allies" have not improved due to the relationship with the Soviet Union. Great Britain was also unable to take care of itself, resulting in non-friendly acts such as the blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road in 1940. Only the United States under Roosevelt's leadership was regarded as a savior by Chongqing. Now, just before the opening of the San Francisco Conference, when they wanted to rely on Roosevelt's help to realize their illusions, Roosevelt suddenly died. No wonder Chongqing was as shocked and at a loss as London.

Third, although the Soviet Union was not greatly affected, Roosevelt was the initiator of the British-American-Soviet tripartite conference, the initiator of the Cairo, Tehran, and Crimea conferences, and the mediator of the contradictions between the Soviet Union and Great Britain. After his death, the contradictions and oppositions between the anti-Axis countries will inevitably become acute due to the loss of the mediator, which will also be a blow to the Soviet Union. At the same time, Roosevelt was also the only person who could fairly restrain the Soviet Union. After his death, no one in the anti-Axis countries was able to make the Soviet Union yield. In the future, the Soviet Union's activities in Europe will be the main factor in promoting new conflicts between Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

Finally, when it comes to the impact on the East Asian war situation, we cannot make an overestimation. However, Roosevelt was the promoter of the Greater East Asia War. As early as 1940-41, he had a plan to economically blockade Japan. Later, he forced and advocated the so-called ABCD anti-Japanese blockade line through diplomatic and military activities, forcing Japan to declare war on the United States for self-defense and self-preservation. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he has always been the proponent and implementer of launching a general counteroffensive against Japan and an offensive strategy against the Japanese mainland. Now that he is dead, the United States' strategy may have disagreements in command and tactics.

Now, the one who succeeded Roosevelt as the leader of the United States is a so-called "ordinary old man who rose from the darkness." Whether in politics, economics, or even diplomacy, his qualifications and strength are not comparable to Roosevelt. It is questionable whether he can shoulder the heavy responsibilities in the final stage of the internal and external difficulties. Standing in the position of the Greater East Asia participating countries, we feel that the weakening of the enemy camp naturally also benefits us, but we cannot be too optimistic and must be deeply vigilant and strive unremittingly.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Washington: US President Truman declared on the 13th that he will not attend the San Francisco Conference.

### Japanese Military Authorities' Statement: Japan-US War Will Continue

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding the death of US President Roosevelt, the Japanese military authorities stated that the death of Roosevelt, the supreme commander of the US military, will undoubtedly greatly affect future US war guidance. However, to suddenly predict that the American will to fight will decline is a baseless fallacy. The gist of their statement is as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Roosevelt was the primary person responsible. Now that he has suddenly passed away, the ambition of the US imperialism he represents has not diminished in the slightest. The Japan-US war is unrelated to his life or death. Therefore, Japan's war against US imperialism will continue. Regarding Roosevelt personally being a great politician, we must admit this. Roosevelt's death has caused the United States to lose an important leader.

### New US President Truman Takes Office, Holds Meetings with Military and Political Officials

Before the establishment of the Baojia in Shanghai, everyone had doubts about the Baojia organization. Now, the facts are before our eyes. Not only do we have a sound Baojia organization, but we also have self-defense corps members. All of you young comrades have received considerable military training. The doubts of the past have been completely dispelled today. I am confident that we can transform Shanghai and build Shanghai, and we can increase our confidence and courage. We can say that the spirit of transforming Shanghai and the spirit of building Shanghai is fully expressed in the Baojia system.

Today's pre-inspection shows that, objectively speaking, the spirit is high; however, there is still room for improvement in training, and the uniforms are not uniform. In the future, we should gradually reform. To achieve national unity, we must have unity of the people, unity of purpose, and then we can have a unified country. Since the Baojia Self-Defense Corps has military training, it must be unified in military affairs. In the future, we hope to have a rational plan, from formal unity to spiritual unity, from small aspects to large aspects, so that we can contribute to the nation and the people.

The time for our inspections is limited, and the purpose is to improve training. After this first inspection, I hope that you will all be more motivated, increase your courage, and enthusiastically participate in taking on more important tasks. This is the sincere expectation of the Baojia work comrades. I am confident that you will all have even more enthusiasm tomorrow, which is what I hope for."

### Director Li Reports on Police Bureau's Judicial Administration, Answers Various Questions at Press Conference

The Municipal Propaganda Office held its twelfth regular press conference yesterday morning (the 14th) at the Municipal [illegible] Building. Over ten reporters from various newspapers attended. Li Shiyu, Director of the Third Division of the Police Bureau, attended to answer various questions. Details are as follows:

### Reform of the Third Division's Structure

1. What is the recent progress of the Third Division's work? (Answer) The Third Division was originally the Judicial Division. The Police Bureau has now renamed it the Third Division as part of its organizational reform, but it still manages all judicial affairs, and there have been no changes in its business. In terms of organization, the original five sections and one office have been reduced to three sections and one office: the Crime Prevention Section, the Investigation Section, the Narcotics Investigation Section, and the Detention Center. In terms of personnel, adjustments have also been made. The original total of over 800 people has been reduced to 179 within the division and over 500 judicial police officers in various sub-bureaus. In terms of business, we strive for speed, accuracy, and simplicity to alleviate the suffering of the people and protect their rights. Previously, judicial cases from various sub-bureaus had to be sent to the General Affairs Office for collection and distribution before being transferred to the Third Division, which was cumbersome and time-consuming. This has now been improved, with the various sub-bureaus sending cases directly to the office of the Director of the Third Division. Furthermore, judicial cases were previously reviewed by the Investigation Section, but now they are reviewed directly by the Director's Office. After approval and stamping by the Director, the cases are returned to the sub-bureaus for transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution on the same day or, at the latest, the next morning. Similarly, cases for which assistance is requested by other agencies are handled with speed, completely eliminating unnecessary procedures. The Investigation Section specializes in handling cases detected and investigated by the bureau, as well as cases assigned by the Municipal Government or the concurrent Director. The Crime Prevention Section and the Identification Section have been merged because identification and crime prevention are closely related. This is another measure to simplify procedures and strengthen crime prevention efforts.

### Investigation Procedures for Confidential Cases

2. What are the procedures for investigating cases and conducting confidential inquiries at your division and various sub-bureaus? Are there regulations regarding the number of days of detention? Are there uniform methods and ranges for handling bail cases, and how are special cases handled? (Answer) This bureau adheres to the Code of Criminal Procedure for the investigation of cases and confidential inquiries. Suspects are transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office within 24 hours whenever possible. Depending on the severity of the case, we request detention dates and assist prosecutors in investigating the case to ensure accuracy. As for bail procedures, we follow the law to allow bail for suspects whose maximum sentence is less than three years. However, some cases have special circumstances, such as repeat offenders of theft, who are not granted bail. We expedite the handling of the case and transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. For special cases involving collusion or hoarding for profiteering, endangering the Republic, etc., which require confidential inquiries by special tribunals, we report to the Director and then to the Mayor, in addition to cases assigned by the Mayor. If the Mayor deems the case important, it is reported to the Chairman of the National Government for approval before being transferred to a special tribunal for confidential handling.

### Handling of Corruption Cases

3. There have been several cases of corruption in this city. How many cases have been transferred to the courts, and how many are still under investigation? (Answer) The authorities have been paying close attention to corruption cases and strictly investigating them. In addition to the two cases of municipal government officials stealing and selling coal and public property, which have been reported to Acting Chairman Chen for transfer to the Capital Special Tribunal for investigation and prosecution, and other cases that have been investigated and reported to the Mayor for verification, there are several other cases currently under confidential investigation. As for the details of the cases, it is not convenient to disclose them publicly.

### Countermeasures for Bizarre Murder Cases

4. Recently, there have been many bizarre murder cases. What are the countermeasures, and what is the impact on crime prevention work? (Answer) The more complex the social environment, the more bizarre the crimes that occur. The countermeasures include vigorously promoting crime prevention work and improving mental health. As for newspaper reporting on these kinds of news, it should not be mere description of events, but rather distinguish right from wrong, explain the advantages and disadvantages, and rigorously criticize the occurrence of the case. The authorities should strictly handle the cases according to law, make clear examples, and deter others from doing the same. However, crime prevention work is only just beginning to be promoted and has not yet reached its full potential. We hope for the cooperation of all sectors of society.

### Police Extortion in Remote Areas

5. Your division has the determination to eliminate the extortion behavior of unscrupulous police officers, but how will you punish or remedy the extortion by patrol police and traffic police in remote roads? (Answer) Since Director Zhou concurrently took office, he has made the greatest determination to rectify police discipline. Police officers who violate the law will be severely punished. Director Zhou concurrently, in his capacity as Deputy President of the Executive Yuan, has spoken with judicial officials, emphasizing that corrupt officials must be severely punished according to law and should not be easily released on bail. Serious cases should be transferred to a special tribunal for investigation and prosecution. As for the extortion cases by police officers in remote areas, the Inspection Office will strengthen its inspection work and conduct spot checks to eliminate bad practices.

### Pork Retailers Suspend Business Yesterday

Pork suddenly disappeared from this city's market yesterday. According to reporter investigations, this was due to pork retailers being limited by fixed prices and unwilling to purchase goods from wholesalers at high prices, leading them to suspend business collectively. It is reported that the Pork Retailers Association is not only reporting to the relevant authorities for immediate relief, but also advising its members to find ways to resume business.

### Price Evaluation Committee Held Meeting Yesterday

The Municipal Price Evaluation Committee held its sixteenth committee meeting yesterday afternoon at the Economic Bureau. Committee members Xu Jiang, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Deyan, Yang Shi, Man Qiwei, Qin Tinggui, Yuan Ruichang, Liu Xingchen, Chen Guoquan, Luo Naqi, Liu Feng, Yang Heqing, and Tao Wenqi attended. Director of the Economic Bureau, Xu Jiang, presided over the meeting, which began with a report and discussion. The meeting concluded in the evening. It is reported that the meeting had very detailed discussions on the evaluation of over ten major commodities. As a result of the meeting, most of the evaluations have been notified, and a small number are still under consideration before a decision can be made. It is expected that the evaluations of over ten major commodities will be officially announced soon.

### Construction Bureau Merges and Adjusts Subsidiary Offices

The Municipal Construction Bureau has received approval from the Municipal Government to merge and adjust the various subsidiary offices of the former Public Works Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau. The Nanshi Office of the former Public Works Bureau, the Nanshi Vehicle Registration Office of the Public Utilities Bureau, and the Nanshi Registration Office will be merged into the Nanshi Office, with four groups: General Affairs, Public Works, Affairs, and Shipping, to centralize the handling of business. The Beishi Office of the former Public Works Bureau and the Vehicle Registration Office and Ship Registration Office of the Public Utilities Bureau will be merged into the Beishi Office, with the same organization as the Nanshi Office. In Pudong, the Vehicle Registration Office of the Public Utilities Bureau and the office of the Public Works Bureau will be merged into the Pudong Office, and the original Xishi Vehicle Registration Office will be expanded into the Xishi Office. The existing offices in the city center will continue to operate as usual.

### Method of Conveying Alarms Using Gongs and Other Metal Sounding Instruments

The Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters has stipulated that in the future, in addition to sounding alarm sirens, gongs and other metal sounding instruments will be used as auxiliary signals to convey air raid alarms. The methods of sounding the alarms are specified as follows:

Signal | Method of Sounding Gong, Rail, etc. | Remarks
------- | -------- | --------
Precautionary Alarm Issuance | Strike three times repeatedly | Simultaneously announce verbally
Air Raid Alarm Order | Strike continuously | Simultaneously announce verbally
Precautionary Alarm Cancellation | Strike two times repeatedly | Simultaneously announce verbally

To avoid confusion with the above signals, all gongs, bells, rails, and other metal sounding instruments must not be used in methods similar to those specified above.

### Economic Authorities Strictly Investigate the Trading of Enemy Currency

The municipal economic authorities have observed the rampant establishment of [illegible] in this city recently, as well as suspected illegal trading of enemy currency.

### A Few Enemy Aircraft Attacked the Shanghai Area Three Times Yesterday Morning, Dropping Several Bombs Without Causing Damage on the Ground

The Shanghai Japanese Army Press Office announced at 6:00 AM on the 14th: From 0:10 AM on the 14th, a few enemy aircraft attacked the Shanghai area three times in waves, dropping several bombs. A small civilian ship caught fire, which was extinguished in about twenty minutes. There was no other damage on the ground.

### Municipal Construction Bureau Registers Well Owners

The Municipal Construction Bureau notes that due to restrictions on the use of tap water, many residents have spontaneously drilled artesian wells for occasional use. However, most of these wells are drilled using unscientific methods, or the water quality is poor due to poor soil quality, which is detrimental to public health. In order to unify management and provide guidance, well owners are requested to register their wells. The Municipal Government has been requested to announce temporary registration procedures.

### Exemption from Business Tax for Candles

The Municipal Government has approved the Ministry of Finance's consultation that, according to Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Candle Tax (after the implementation of this tax, ordinary business tax will no longer be levied on candle merchants), since the candle and incense industries have already paid candle tax and [illegible] registration tax, the candle business tax should be exempted. The Finance Bureau has been instructed accordingly.

### Finance Bureau Does Not Approve Tax Exemption for Oil Merchants

Fifteen oil merchants in this city, including Shen Da, have submitted a request through their association to the Municipal Finance Bureau to reduce the business tax on credit oil, arguing that the market is currently depressed, profits are meager, and the statutory profit is less than 2%. It has been learned that the Finance Bureau has rejected the request.

### Captain Matsumoto Elucidates Recent War Situation, Construction Youth Team Holds Symposium

The China Construction Youth Team held a current affairs symposium at 2:00 PM on the 15th on the third floor of the Nanjing Road (Sullivan) building. Representatives from various public organizations in this city attended, and Captain Matsumoto of the Japanese Fleet Press Office was invited to speak. In addition to Captain Matsumoto and the team's consultants and secretaries, public organizations such as the China Hongmen General Association, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association, and the China Anti-Communist Alliance also sent representatives to attend. Captain Matsumoto spoke first, elucidating in detail the Pacific War situation, the war situation on the Chinese mainland, and the impact of US President Roosevelt's death on the world political situation. The representatives of various organizations then exchanged views on the current situation.

### Pacific War Situation

Key points of Captain Matsumoto's speech: 1. The Okinawa Island strategy is like the Battle of Tsushima in the Russo-Japanese War, luring the enemy deep before launching a decisive attack. 2. The enemy's exaggerated propaganda claims that 1,400 ships are attacking Okinawa Island, but only over 600 are actually involved in the operation, including over 100 landing craft. After removing transport ships, only over 100 ships are participating in the battle on the front lines. In total, there are only over 300 ships around Okinawa, and the Japanese army has already inflicted heavy losses on them in recent days. 3. MacArthur's base warfare strategy requires considerable time and cannot achieve the goal of a quick victory. Nimitz's island-hopping strategy, taking advantage of weaknesses and advancing by leaps and bounds, assumes that securing sea and air control will overcome all challenges. However, it must be known that the islands of Palau and Rabaul are still in the hands of the Japanese army. Nimitz's strategy is due to the domestic situation in the United States. His strategy will encounter obstacles in the Battle of Okinawa, affecting the entire Pacific War situation.

### Mainland Operations

1. The Chongqing forces concentrated their forces in an attempt to recapture Handan. The Japanese army repelled them with clever tactics, and then fought in Zhuozhou. 2. In the past, the US Air Force in Chongqing heavily bombed the [illegible] Han line. Their base was Laohokou. The Japanese army occupied this area in early April, and small-scale operations are still taking place in its [illegible] area. This will be resolved soon. 3. Laohokou used to be an important base for controlling Central China, North China, and the East Sea. Now, it has become a powerful base for the Japanese army's heavy units.

### Roosevelt's Death

1. The US Vice President can only handle routine matters, and it is questionable whether he can cope with military production and various powerful figures. From an international perspective, it is also doubtful whether Truman can manipulate Churchill and Stalin. 2. Regarding the policy towards China, Roosevelt personally controlled the allocation of military supplies and loans in the past. It is questionable whether this can continue.
