### The National Government's Resolve Remains Unwavering Regardless of War's Progression: Chairman Chen's Remarks to Japanese Correspondents

Nanjing, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – At 4:30 PM on July 28th, Acting Chairman Chen met with Japanese correspondents from the capital at his official residence. Secretary-General Zhou of the Executive Yuan and Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department were also present. Chairman Chen provided detailed answers to the questions raised by the reporters as follows:

(Question) The Greater East Asia War has reached its final stage. What are the National Government's resolve and policies?

(Answer) The National Government has repeatedly declared its resolve regarding the Greater East Asia War. Our determination will not waver due to the progression of the war or the urgency of the situation. We still adhere to our original intention, which need not be reiterated. All measures are naturally focused on the war effort.

(Question) How will the National Government respond if the United States engages in combat along the mainland coast?

(Answer) Protecting China's territory is the National Government's inherent responsibility. As early as April of last year, the Military Affairs Commission began preparing for new military deployments. When American troops land along the coast, we will cooperate fully with the Japanese army to respond.

### Promoting the Realization of Comprehensive Peace

(Question) How will the National Government promote the national salvation and unification movement? Is comprehensive peace still possible today? Has this been considered?

(Answer) National unification and salvation are the National Government's constant aspirations. The government has already expressed its views at the recent People's Representative Assembly, striving for its realization, and continues to work towards this goal. We further hope and desire that to achieve China's unification, we must first achieve the political, military, and economic unification under the National Government's rule. Otherwise, empty talk will not be of practical help. As for comprehensive peace, its meaning today seems broader than it was at the time of the return to the capital. Since its meaning is broader, the methods of pursuing it will also be different. We must constantly adapt to the changing general situation. The National Government is considering the timing and methods, but our hope for complete peace remains unwavering.

(Question) General observation sees that the current National Government lacks the enthusiasm of the Chairman Wang's return to the capital era, what are the chairman's thoughts?

(Answer) The late Chairman Wang was a prominent leader in Chinese politics. After his death, the National Government lost its highest mentor. Therefore, my feelings are the same as everyone else. However, the current situation is tense, and the people's attitude has gradually changed to a steadfast response, which is different from the time of the return to the capital. Furthermore, at the time of the return to the capital, the people's hopes were too high. The people held higher hopes than the National Government. Excessive hope leads to great disappointment. The people underestimated the fact that the war still exists, and we should encourage and assist the relevant authorities in this regard.

### The Anti-Communist National Reconstruction Policy Remains Unchanged

(Question) What are your observations on the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and what is the National Government's attitude towards the Yan'an regime?

(Answer) The National Government's policy is to build the nation through peace and anti-communism. This was the case when we returned to the capital, and it remains so today. Unless the Communist Party lays down its arms and ceases its political struggles, it cannot be regarded as an ordinary political party in a constitutional government. The Kuomintang has been established for over fifty years, and the Chinese people support the Kuomintang. From the perspective of constitutional politics, the Kuomintang cannot be overthrown. Because of the Kuomintang, constitutional politics is a group supported by the Chinese people. Those who oppose it are regarded as criminals by the government and the people and will be punished. The relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can be judged from this.

(Question) The Chongqing Convention is implementing constitutional government, and Yan'an has also decided to convene a constitutional implementation committee. What are the National Government's policies for promoting public opinion and people's participation in politics?

(Answer) The National Government established the Constitutional Implementation Committee at the time of the return to the capital, intending to implement constitutional government first. However, given the development of the situation, the National Government engaged in the Greater East Asia War, and thus constitutional government has not yet been implemented. The true implementation of constitutional government will be after China is unified. Yan'an is completely opposed to Chongqing, and the National Government is calmly observing its development.

(Question) The current economic situation is extremely worrying. What are the government's economic adjustment and people's livelihood stabilization policies?

(Answer) Economic difficulties during wartime are a common phenomenon in all countries. The government's policy is to adjust to economic difficulties. The National Government is currently studying this in detail and is making improvements. There are two urgent measures: First, military supplies and civilian supplies are purchased in the same way; second, gold prices are suppressed. Although these two points are not fundamental economic problems, they are sufficient to alleviate the immediate crisis. The worrying thing is not today but the future.

### Expressing Views on the World Situation

(Question) What are the Chairman's views on the world situation?

(Answer) In Europe, the war is only a temporary rest and has not ended. There are three possibilities: First, capitalists adopt some socialist methods, and socialists adopt some capitalist methods, to seek reconciliation between the two. Second, capitalism and socialism immediately clash. Third, the revival of Nazism. Regarding the first point, the possibility is very small. After the destruction of Germany, Britain and the United States believed that capitalism had triumphed, but the Soviet Union's view was the opposite. The second point is also unlikely. Britain and the United States have built an anti-communist front in western France, but we cannot say that war will break out because there is a defense. The Soviet Union intends to use American capital and technology to restore its national power. Regarding the third point, there is a possibility. Although it is not possible to predict when and where, the resurgence of Nazism is very possible. Military struggles have just ended, and political struggles have already begun. In short, the current situation in Europe can be regarded as the cessation of military struggles and the beginning of political struggles. In the future, there will not only be political struggles but also military actions, which is very clear. The Pacific will also directly receive its impact. The aim of Britain and the United States is to restore their colonies. In the management of the colonies, there will be a struggle between capitalism and socialism. Therefore, it is not easy to stop the world war, and it cannot be solved by the San Francisco Conference, etc. We in East Asia should pay close attention and work hard ourselves.

### Truman and Chiang Kai-shek issue a joint declaration, but the Soviet Union maintains its original position.

Stockholm, Sweden, July 28th (Central News Agency dispatch from Potsdam): U.S. President Truman, British Prime Minister Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek jointly issued a declaration advising Japan to surrender unconditionally. The Soviet government, in view of its neutrality treaty with the Japanese government, despite repeated requests from Truman, still maintains its original position.

Tokyo, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Truman, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek jointly issued a declaration to Japan on the 25th signed at Potsdam. Churchill, one of the signatories, abdicated on the 26th due to his general election defeat. Also, it is heard that Chiang Kai-shek's signature was given after the fact via telephone agreement. In fact, this declaration is a solo performance by the United States. Recall the Cairo Conference in November of the 32nd year, which issued a so-called unconditional surrender to Germany. Now, the three countries of the United States, Britain, and Chongqing, whether in political or strategic terms, have reached a critical juncture. Having no other option, they imitate the past and issue a so-called final declaration. However, after the Cairo Declaration was issued, it aroused the German people's determination to fight to the end. In the decisive battles of Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, the enemy suffered heavy losses, and the Japanese army's will to fight was greatly enhanced. Therefore, the so-called unconditional surrender will naturally be ignored by Japan, as expected by the U.S. government. Due to the slow progress of the war within the United States, there is no lack of anxiety. The people, observing the heavy loss of manpower, harshly criticize the military's failures in combat. At the same time, seeing the Soviet Union leave the front line to engage in post-war reconstruction and world management, they feel even more impatient. Under this situation, the U.S. government clearly stated the conditions for Japan, seeking the people's understanding in order to boost their war spirit.

### Eight Items in the Joint Declaration

Note: The contents of the joint declaration by Truman, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek are as follows: To permanently eliminate the influence and power that caused the attempt to conquer the world, eradicate militarism; To ensure the realization of our goals, the Allied forces will occupy designated locations on Japanese territory; The complete disarmament of Japan; Severely punish war criminals, the Japanese government should remove obstacles to restore domestic democratic tendencies; Respect basic human rights, establish freedom of religion and thought; Support the Japanese economy and allow Japan to possess industries sufficient to cope with legitimate material resources and not re-arm. Japan is allowed to conditionally surrender, otherwise Japan will be rapidly and completely destroyed.

### Tokyo Newspapers Issue Various Comments

Tokyo, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The newspapers here today commented on the joint declaration to Japan by Truman, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek. The main points are as follows:

Mainichi Shimbun: "The joint declaration of the three countries of Truman, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek is unbearable, demanding that the empire disarm its troops, completely abolish its military industry, and cede territory. The purpose of our country in carrying out the Greater East Asia War is to maintain the existence and self-defense of the empire and to liberate the peoples of Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States. The United States, recently complacent due to the smooth progress of the war, underestimates Japan's war power and falsely believes that the war is about to end, and thus issued this joint declaration of the three countries. However, for the future of the war, we have absolute confidence in the decisive battle on the mainland. At that time, we will definitely be able to thoroughly annihilate the American army, as the military authorities have repeatedly stated. The entire nation has also expressed full trust in this and will devote all its efforts to complete the war. Therefore, the so-called joint declaration of the three countries has no value whatsoever. We can only carry through to the end and make the enemy give up the will to fight. As for the government's embracing the same view, it goes without saying."

Asahi Shimbun: "Observing the joint declaration of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing, it can be seen that the United States intends the following: Because its own country is eager for peace, it deliberately put forward a declaration so that the people know that Japan still does not accept such conditions, then there is no other way but to continue fighting. Therefore, its purpose is nothing more than to boost the people's will to fight. Because it forced Germany to surrender unconditionally, it suffered heavy sacrifices, and people at home have criticized it. Therefore, this time, it told the people some conditions, seeking the people's understanding of the difficulties of continuing the war. In the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, the United States suffered heavy losses. Therefore, this time, it specifically announced conditions. If Japan does not accept them, then there is no other way but to continue fighting, seeking the people to continue fighting. To exaggerate the magnitude of the US military force, give publicity to achieve the effect, and attempt to alienate the feelings between countries in the Greater East Asia. According to the traditional policy of world domination, forced Japan to accept one-sided conditions, in order to achieve a deterrent effect. To sow discord among the Japanese military and the people."

### Chongqing's harsh demand to Yan'an

Shanghai Central News Agency Information from the place of arrival confirmed, Chiang Kai-shek sent an harsh demand reply to Yan'an in the name of Chen Cheng, as follows:
    To unify China, uniting all parties is the most urgent important task, Yan'an should be sent rapidly representatives to be added to the recent calling of the Congress, and to all Congress of a relation with continents, Ying Chi Tuo Xie bear degrees, and should give up convening liberation of areas People's Congress as a program. The center now, although fully approved the Eighteenth Army Group's anti-Japanese line of fire, however, Southern China and Central China's Yan'an army should under the direction of the Chongqing army, cooperate with the military movements of the US and Chongqing military

### Japanese Air Force Bombs Okinawa Island and Sinks/Destroys Three Enemy Warships

Tokyo, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The Japanese Air Force bombed enemy airfields and warship groups on Okinawa on the night of July 27th, sinking one enemy warship and destroying two others.

Osaka, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Fourteen B-29 type aircraft, at approximately 10:40 PM on July 27th, circled and dropped naval mines in the Kanmon Straits, the Suo Sea, the Hiroshima Sea, and the sea south of Okayama. Also, from 10:50 PM to around 11:40 PM, fifteen B-29 type aircraft dropped naval mines in Wakasa Bay and fled.

### Air Raids Across Japan Yesterday

Tokyo, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): 250 enemy P-57 type aircraft from the Iwo Jima base attacked the Kanto area in three batches from around 9:30 AM to 1:00 PM on July 28th, attacking Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Saitama, Gunma, and Yokosuka. Each squadron was guided by B-29 type aircraft, bombing Japanese military facilities, airfields, and other urban areas and factories, and carrying out machine gun strafing. Also, on the same morning, a cumulative total of approximately 700 enemy carrier-based aircraft, divided into several squadrons, attacked Shiga, Gifu, Osaka, Kagawa, Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, etc., from the southeast of Shikoku. The enemy aircraft mainly attacked Japanese military facilities, factories, and seagoing ships. Japanese damage was extremely minor.

### General MacArthur Reportedly to Retire

Zurich, July 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): According to a London dispatch: A Washington dispatch from the news agency recently received here states that the replacement of the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command is imminent, as the various issues within the Pacific Command are extremely complex, especially the political issues, which are well known to the world. General MacArthur, who achieved success in planning operations in Europe and is currently the commander-in-chief, is the complete opposite in personality to Chief of Staff Marshall. During the initial operations in the Pacific, there was already discord over the issue of U.S. military supplies, and MacArthur fiercely criticized Marshall's "Germany first" policy. This antagonism still exists today. Due to these facts, many people observe that MacArthur will likely retire at the earliest opportunity.

### New British Cabinet Formed; Bevin as Foreign Secretary, Dalton as Chancellor

Stockholm, Sweden, July 28th (Dispatch from London): Ernest Bevin has been formally appointed as Foreign Secretary. The list of ministers for other departments that have been announced are as follows:

At the same time, Morrison will be appointed as Leader of the House of Commons. The list of ministers for other departments will also be announced within days.

Attlee held discussions with his Labour Party colleagues for a long time yesterday, so it is speculated that Attlee had made arrangements in advance on how to organize the new cabinet. At the same time, Attlee's desire to go to Potsdam early and Churchill's not accompanying him was expected.

### Seeking a Proper Solution to the India Problem

Stockholm, Sweden, July 28th (News received here): The newly appointed British Foreign Secretary Bevin, issued a declaration to the Indian people yesterday, stating briefly, "Our Labour Party will never give up seeking a proper solution to the Indian problem after the failure of the Simla Conference.

### My Unshakable Belief in Victory (1)

— Yoshida Toyosuke

Question: In your essay "Reflections on Japan" at the end of the year before last, you said:

"Because Japan was the first to become strong among the nations of Asia, it has shouldered such a historical destiny that it has no choice but to confront head-on the fact that American financial capital tends to dominate the world, especially Asia. If Japan suffers a crushing defeat in this war related to the destiny of Asia, then China will also be dominated by American financial capital. At that time, some of the people in China resisting Japan will naturally realize that the fate of Asia is tied to their own country, and will insist on starting a war with American financial capital."

A year and a half ago, you expressed this statement under the assumption of "what if Japan loses the war." Only now do I feel that I understand its meaning a little. Under those circumstances at the time, you had no choice but to avoid developing that conclusion more thoroughly, which caused a lot of misunderstandings in various aspects.

Answer: I also know this fact. At the time, a reporter candidly said to me in a private letter: "It is true, as you say, that American financial capital may want to monopolize the entire Asian market. And Japan is fighting against it, that may also be a fact. But for the Chinese, the issue is not about this, but whether Japan wants to destroy China. Why is Japan waging war in China? Did Japan initiate the Manchurian Incident to uphold China's autonomy and independence? Unless you make this clear, I am afraid none of us Chinese will believe you." I could not answer his sincere question in the concise form that reporters demand. However, I believe that in all the articles I have written, I have revealed the answer to this question in a form that harmonizes with my own instincts. Not only myself, but all researchers of Sino-Japanese issues who have spoken the truth to date, only talk about China when discussing Sino-Japanese issues, and remain silent about Japan's own past actions. According to the Chinese perspective, Japanese people never say a word about Japan's actions, but only talk about abstract things like sincerity or lack thereof. This attitude of the Japanese reveals their "hypocrisy." Many Chinese people now no longer mention how Japan sought the development of capitalist ends in China in the past. They believe that the past is the past, but they seem to demand a thorough answer from Japan about what attitude Japan will hold towards China in the future. However, the Japanese, up to now, have been expounding "super-theories" that even they themselves do not understand, and starting with shouting about "Japan's sincerity" without ever giving a substantive answer. In contrast, the Japanese should reflect on the fact that the answers they have given in the past would infuriate serious Chinese people. A famous Japanese politician—I won't reveal his name—has held several positions, and it has been clearly demonstrated in all the major issues of building our country. The Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the recent Manchurian Incident are nothing more than examples of the Japanese people's desire to maintain peace and security in East Asia." If the Manchurian Incident is an expression of the Japanese people's desire for peace and security in East Asia, is it not natural for the Chinese to hesitate to accept such peace and security?

Question: However, in such a small land as Japan, with such an increasing population as Japan's, is it not natural for it to develop overseas, especially in Manchuria, which has a sparse population? Japan's arable land is only 16% of its national land. The average population per square mile of arable land is 2,750 people. This is the world's largest population density. And Japan averages four births per minute. It is said that if this continues, by 1960, the population of Japan's mainland alone will reach 90 million. In this situation, would not permanently closing Japan in that small island be equivalent to the suicide of the Japanese nation?

Answer: What you say is exactly what many Japanese people are worried about. Koyama Eizo, who is famous for studying the problems of the Japanese nation, also said in his book "The Theory of Nation and Population": "Japan also developed due to the opportunities since the Meiji Restoration, as a result of the organic development of production and capital. Production has increased rapidly enough to absorb the increase in population that occurred with it. However, in recent years, due to foreign trade raising barriers and refusing Japanese people to enter and exit overseas, the situation of absorbing population in the country cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the development of industry is slow or stagnant. Therefore, besides reducing the level of production with population pressure, there is no way to alleviate its saturation. In this situation, there is only one way to break this deadlock. That is to find outlets overseas with inevitable military force."

Not only Japanese scholars, but also Thompson, the author of "Dangerous Areas of World Population," pointed out that on the one hand, there are nations whose populations have stopped increasing and do not need colonies, dominating vast economic resources, and on the other hand, there is the fact that there are nations whose population increase requires colonies and said, "The demand for markets and resources contradicts the demand for new colonies... this contradiction is the cause of political and economic struggles." Based on this theory, it can be said that national development has not stopped, and the demand for colonies will never cease, so there has never been a time when wars have stopped in the world. If Japan is guided by this population theory, then the realization of comprehensive Sino-Japanese peace will absolutely not be possible. Because the phenomenon of overpopulation exists not only in Japan, but China also has an excessive population. According to Dittmer's statistics, the population per square mile of arable land in China is 1,500 to 2,500 people, that is, the average population per square mile is 2,000 people. China's population density seems to be a little smaller than Japan's, but if we consider the difference in agricultural productivity between China and Japan, we can know how the population density in China is being oppressed. From the population density table per square mile of arable land that Cressay made in 1915, if we extract the places with abundant land productivity, we can find astonishing numbers. That is, 2,244 people in the Jiangnan Hills, 2,684 people in the Southeast Coastal Area, 3,495 people in the Liangguang Hills, and 4,819 people in the Southwest Plateau.

China not only has such a population density, but also has an astonishing population growth rate. According to Professor Buck's survey of representative farmhouses in eight counties and eleven districts, including 22,169 people, the birth rate per thousand people is 20.3 to 70.5 people, and the average birth rate is 42.2 people. This is probably the world's largest birth rate. Therefore, just in terms of the population problem, the conclusion will be reached that not only Japan, but China itself must demand colonies. Therefore, if Japan has the right to claim entry into China for the development of its nation, then China also has the right to claim entry into Japan for the development of its nation. It is doubtful whether China can peacefully maintain peace with Japan if Japan constantly repeats the kind of argument you mentioned.

Question: What you say makes sense, but I think that in reality, a small island country like Japan cannot sustain itself unless it exchanges the benefits obtained from the overseas development of its nation for food to be imported into the country. Therefore, Japan once attempted to develop into Australia and the United States in a peaceful atmosphere. However, this peaceful development was hindered by the egoism of the white race, so Japan began to develop towards Manchuria. This matter stimulated Chinese nationalism and became the cause of the Sino-Japanese war.

Answer: If you insist on your position, it will become the "Theory of Permanent Sino-Japanese War" considered by Westerners. Regardless of the form in which the war between China and Japan is settled, since the development of both the Chinese and Japanese nations is necessary, there will definitely be a time in the future when the development of both nations will conflict again. If this theory is pushed forward, the structure of world peace cannot be realized. So-called peace is a state in which the development of one nation suppresses the development of other nations. Therefore, peace is not true peace, it must be armed peace. In such a world, weak nations are always trembling with worry about being destroyed by other nations. This is the position of the Chinese nation, which was once the world's largest weak nation. Therefore, to make the peaceful relationship between China and Japan last forever, and to make the world peace organization exist forever, there should be a strong guarantee that mutual national development can be adjusted. Therefore, Japan proposed the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" theory in the middle of the Sino-Japanese War. This includes the meaning of adjusting the conflicts between the development of the various ethnic groups in East Asia. However, because some of the people who promoted the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" theory failed to eliminate ideas such as "Germany is above all" regarding the Japanese nation, the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" theory cannot be seriously accepted by the Chinese. Many Chinese people believe that the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" theory is a political tool for the Japanese nation to achieve its political goals.

Question: Listening to your words, I feel as if you are advocating sacrificing the development of the Japanese nation for the sake of Sino-Japanese peace. Are you advocating that the Japanese nation should just die on a small island in Japan?

Answer: Your words express in the most candid form the thoughts that deeply permeate the minds of Japanese people.

These words contain the assertion of national egoism that "if there is no way to adjust the contradiction between the development of the Chinese nation and the development of the Japanese nation, then the development of the Chinese nation should be sacrificed." If I were in your position, the conclusion I would reach is: for the development of the Japanese nation, if there is no other way, the Chinese nation should be sacrificed. And if the Japanese nation has further development, then the whole world should be sacrificed.

A few days ago, a Chinese friend showed me a so-called "Tanaka Memorial." Willoughby, the author of "The Sino-Japanese Incident and Japan," also said that this is not a real thing. However, assuming that Prime Minister Tanaka considered such things, it can be said that this is the most concrete expression of the ideal of narrow nationalists. Not only Germany, but every nationalist hopes in his heart that his own nation is the most outstanding nation in the world, and that this nation is best filled with the whole world. Especially the Anglo-Saxons hold this idea even more strongly. When such nationalists think about the continuous increase in population and the limited area of their country, they naturally consider that they should expand the area where their compatriots can move freely. If the world's powerful countries are dominated by this kind of nationalist thought, weak nations will never have true peace. When Japan launched the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the weak nations of Asia felt a kind of emotion that could not be fully understood. This is also because Japan has not yet completely cleared the theory of racial nationalism. Question: Then are you going to deny Malthus's population theory?

Answer: Yes, I think that among many theories, there is no theory like Malthus's population theory and its sub-streams that move imperialists so deeply. Moreover, for the sake of establishing the concept of a true East Asian Co-Prosperity State, it is necessary to point out the errors of that theory. It is said that Fei Yaqiu's population equation explains Malthus's population theory in a modern form. Now let me criticize his equation.

Fei Yaqiu's so-called Malthus's population theory goes a step further. In addition to the products of the land (represented by the letter L), he also considers the products of economic culture (EC), and believes that the ratio of the total number of these two products to the population (P) determines the population. And the following mathematical equation expresses the fact that the more the population increases, the lower the standard of living (SL) becomes.

SL (Standard of Living) = L (Land Production) x EC (Economic Culture Production) / P (Population)

P (Population) = L (Land Production) x EC (Economic Culture Production) / SL (Standard of Living)

To put it simply, this equation means:

The more humans increase, the less products each person gets allocated, so the standard of living declines. Also, if the standard of living rises, if there is no increase in products, the population will decrease. If the products increase, and the standard of living remains the same, then the population will increase. In short, he said that there is a proportional relationship between population, products, and standard of living, which is expressed by this equation. Not only this population equation, but also Malthus's population theory, its fundamental error lies in considering only the natural birth rate when mentioning the human birth rate. In the human world, there is actually no natural birth rate like animals. Humans are social animals from birth. The human birth rate is the social birth rate determined by various social regulations. For example, animals in the natural world begin to reproduce when they reach the reproductive period. However, human reproductive behavior itself is also restricted by social regulations (that is, marriage). Therefore, as a common phenomenon, after reaching the reproductive period, it takes a considerable amount of time before reproductive behavior begins. Therefore, in the population phenomenon, it is not the natural things that determine the social things (standard of living), but the social things (production and standard of living) that determine the natural things (production). According to Fei Yaqiu's equation, the total number of land production (L) plus economic culture production (EC) determines the standard of living (SL), and thus further determines the increase in population (P). The reason why the birth rates in Japan and China are high and the standard of living is low is not because the natural reproductive power of the Japanese and Chinese people is particularly strong. The social conditions determined by the production relations in Japan and China (represented by LEC) support high production rates and low standards of living. To be more specific, China and Japan still preserve a large amount of feudal remnants in their production relations. Therefore, although life is difficult, they still support the feudal social customs of high fertility that remain. Therefore, the birth rate of people living in urban areas and people living in rural areas differs greatly in the same population problem. Let me give you an example. According to a survey in Japan in the 40th year of Meiji, the birth rate in urban areas was 26.66 people (per thousand people). In rural areas, it was 33.96 people. However, in the 16th year of Showa, the difference was even greater, with 26.53 in urban areas and 34.11 in rural areas. I think the biggest reason is that many feudal characteristics have been eliminated in the social customs of urban areas.

Question: However, in fact, Japan's population is larger compared to the land, so it goes without saying that it takes a lot of effort to raise these populations. According to research, Japan's population was roughly 25 to 26 million during the 300 years of the Tokugawa shogunate. Because Japan was still in the era of national isolation at that time, foreign food was not easy to import, so it seems that the number of people that Japanese agriculture could support was only about this level. After the Meiji Restoration, it engaged in industry and exported its products abroad in exchange for foreign food. As a result, Japan's population suddenly increased, and finally realized the phenomenon of Japan's mainland population reaching 70 million. To maintain the current population number, it is necessary to maintain the current commerce and industry. To maintain the current commerce and industry, it is necessary to ensure raw materials or sales markets. It is quite difficult for Japanese capitalism to compete with American giant capitalism, so it has no choice but to seek its raw materials or sales markets in China.

Answer: That's right, so it can be said that the competition between Chinese capitalism and Japanese capitalism is a natural conclusion. I see your argument as explaining the inevitability of Japanese capitalism entering China, and at the same time explaining the inevitability of Chinese capitalism competing with Japanese capitalism. You are considering Japanese capitalism cooperating with Chinese capitalism in peace. Of course, sometimes the economic competition between capitalist countries is not very obvious. For example, when the capitalism of one country is developed in heavy industry, and the capitalism of another country is developed in light industry, during a certain period, one country with developed light industry imports machinery from the country that manufactures heavy industry and ships out its light industry products, so there is a kind of economic balance that does not lead to fierce economic competition. In contrast, the economic competition between countries with not too different levels of capitalist development tends to intensify. For example, Japan and China, both of which have light industry as their main industry, have a particularly obvious relationship of economic competition. Let us study this issue in more detail.

Looking at the composition of Japan's trade with China in 1937, the percentage of the market share of heavy industry in the total amount of 419 million yen of Japanese industrial products exported to China was 29.4%, and the percentage of the market share of light industry was 70%. Also, in the amount of 83.8 million yen imported from China, the heavy industry market accounted for only 12%, while light industry accounted for 87.8%. Secondly, looking at the position of Japanese manufactured goods in the Chinese market, out of the total amount of 585,426 yuan of woolen yarn imported from foreign countries by China, the amount supplied by Japan accounted for 95%. Out of 761,968 yuan of silk fabrics, the amount supplied by Japan accounted for 41.3%, as well as 77.3% of rayon, and as for linen and cotton fabrics, 96.8% were supplied by Japan. In the field of heavy industry, China imported textile machinery and its parts totaling 4,777,934, of which 59.1% came from Japan, 29% of iron pipes, and among chemical industrial products, alcohol accounted for 52.2%, pharmaceuticals accounted for 22.8%, and the rest are not worth mentioning. Based on the two sets of numbers mentioned above, we can know the following facts.

First, China's economic structure is still centered on light industry as the most powerful center. Second, Japan's economic structure in China is also centered on light industry.

The total number of factories in China that apply the Factory Law (that is, those that use 30 or more workers) is 2,435, with a total capital of 406.87 million yuan and a workforce of 500,000. Among them, the capital of textile factories accounts for 34%, and the number of workers accounts for 32%. From this, it can be seen that China's national capital is centered on the textile industry. Therefore, the crisis of textile capital around 1930 was the crisis of China's national capital. Also, the confrontation between China and Japan began with the opposition between China's spinning capital and Japan's spinning capital in China. In 1930, China's rejection of Japanese goods targeted Japanese cotton products, and unfolded its movement in the form of China's national spinning industry attacking Japan's textile industry in China.

The fact that the economic struggle between China and Japan has become so extremely acute, and finally became the cause of the Sino-Japanese war, is the most important point that should be noted when I consider the fundamental solution to Sino-Japanese relations.

Until now, many people have thought that making China recognize the entry of Japanese capitalism into China can solve the Sino-Japanese war. However, the fact is the opposite. The entry of Japanese capitalism into China has promoted the war between China and Japan. Therefore, although you say that Japanese capitalism entered China in a peaceful atmosphere, this observation cannot be accepted as it is. This is definitely not a way that is on the right track towards resolving the incident. The spirit of the famous Kita Ikki's book "An Unofficial History of the Chinese Revolution" advocates that Japan should help the Chinese revolutionary movement to achieve autonomy and independence, and that Japan should not be an imperialist stooge of Britain and the United States to invade China. If there are Japanese among the Japanese who cannot understand how just this claim is, he is probably not a real Japanese person. Even so, why did Japan adopt what the Chinese thought was an imperialist policy in the past? That is the problem. Although we can inherit the spirit of Kita Ikki, we must not stop at what Kita Ikki said. The fact that the development period of the capital industries of Japan and China was much later than that of British and American capitalism, and that the level of capitalist development in Japan and China was not very different - especially the fact that the capital in both countries is concentrated in light industry - intensified the economic competition between China and Japan. Although Kita Ikki warned in that way, Japan's policy towards China has become what it is today. Therefore, I think that unless the problem is pushed to the point of how to resolve the contradiction between the capitalism of China and Japan, it will be difficult to achieve lasting peace between China and Japan.

### Strengthening Air Raid Relief Work: Government and Civilian Liaison Meeting; Citizens' Welfare Association Invites City Government Officials for Cordial Talks

The Air Raid Relief Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, to discuss practical issues related to relief methods and protect relief workers, held a liaison meeting with relevant city government authorities at the City Government Conference Room at 5:00 PM yesterday. Attending from the city government were Secretary-General Luo, Deputy Secretary-General Hu, Secretary Ling, Secretary Liu, Deputy Director Du of the Police Bureau, Deputy Director Yang, Section Chief Sugihara, Section Chief Ping, Section Chief Bao, Director Yuan of the Health Bureau, Director Zhou of the Social Welfare Bureau, and Section Chief Noguchi of the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters. Attending from the Citizens' Welfare Association were Chairman Guan Jiting, Vice Chairman Li Sihao, Directors Deng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Shao [], Chen Riping, Wang Boyuan, Bao Chang, Quan Nan [], Yang Fusheng, Chen Binsu, and Executive Director Hu []ting. Chairman Guan and Vice Chairman Li first explained the significance of convening the liaison meeting.

Overview of Work of Each Group

Subsequently, Wang Boyuan of the Relief Group reported on the work of the group: ① regarding the burial of the dead, ② regarding the accommodation of refugees, planning to set up at least one shelter in each Baojia district, ③ regarding the elderly and young left destitute after the death of family members, etc., and Chen Riping and Xiang Kangyuan added supplementary explanations. Gu Nan [] of the Medical Supplies Group then reported on the group's work: during normal times, hospitals already feel that beds are insufficient; if injured people are admitted to the hospital, it is practically impossible to transfer existing ordinary patients. Therefore, on the one hand, additional beds are being added, and on the other hand, specialized trauma hospitals are being established. Regarding the issue of hospital beds and buildings, it is hoped that the city government will do its best to find solutions. [] also explained that the water and electricity supply to hospitals is insufficient and hopes for an increase. Afterwards, Chen Binsu of the General Affairs Group and the Finance Group reported on the work of the two groups: ① The target for the first phase of disaster relief donations is 200,000 yuan, divided into four items of 50,000 yuan each: disaster victim food, medical supplies, shelter expenses, and subsidies for various hospitals. A second phase of fundraising will further enrich air defense and fire fighting expenses. ② Currently, there are three places for collecting donations on behalf of the organization: the social service offices of Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao, and the Nanjing Industrial Bank. As of this year (28th), Shen Bao has collected 26,000 yuan on behalf of the organization, Xinwen Bao 16,000 yuan, and Nanjing Industrial Bank 9,000 yuan, totaling over 50,000 yuan. ③ Regarding disaster victim food, 1,500 bags of wheat flour have been ordered. Thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of the Wheat Flour Unified Committee, the price per bag is 49,500 yuan, only half of the allocation price. 500 bags have already been delivered. ④ Medical supplies are being purchased in large quantities to meet the large demand.

Secretary-General Luo's Speech

Secretary-General Luo then delivered a speech, stating in brief: "After hearing the reports on the work of the Citizens' Welfare Association, I am very pleased with your great efforts. I would like to offer a few suggestions regarding relief work: ① It is necessary to have overall unification and coordination, including not only officials and civilians, but also Chinese and foreigners. ② Officials, civilians, Chinese, and foreigners must work together closely. For example, relief workers in each unit must cooperate, medical personnel must cooperate, and so on. ③ Human and material resources must be concentrated, used effectively, and not wasted. In short, the most important aspects of relief work are speed and stability: speed means quickness, and stability means no []. After hearing the reports from each group, there are a few points that should be addressed: ① The joint rescue and liaison work in disaster areas should be carried out by responsible representatives from the Air Defense Headquarters, the Police Bureau's Air Defense Division, and the Citizens' Welfare Association, who should separately discuss technical measures. ② Regarding the issue of hospitals and shelter buildings, choose school buildings in convenient locations and with better construction. Schools should be temporarily closed and converted into temporary hospitals and shelters. ③ Regarding the supply of hospital beds, in addition to providing as many as possible from the Health Bureau's existing resources, borrow an average of 1,000 sets of beds and bedding from various hotels. If the Welfare Association approves, the city government will issue an order for implementation. ④ Regarding the issue of food and medicine, in addition to the food that the Welfare Association has already obtained, the pharmaceutical industry should jointly offer a humble price for a large batch of essential medicines. The new pharmaceutical industry has been doing well in recent years, and it should also shoulder some obligations for disaster relief. ⑤ Regarding the issue of increasing water and electricity supply to hospitals, the city government will negotiate with the [] company. However, contingency plans should be prepared in case of water and electricity outages, such as [] wells and self-generated electricity.

Section Chief Noguchi's Report

Afterwards, Section Chief Noguchi of the Air Defense Headquarters reported on the Air Defense Headquarters' rescue work and raised two questions: ① Is the Welfare Association's Air Raid Relief Committee the agency that implements relief during air raids, and is its liaison with the responsible authorities the same? ② Recently, civilian disaster relief organizations have been established one after another. Is the Welfare Association prepared to unify them in order to avoid dispersing efforts and wasting human and material resources? Chen Binsu replied: ① The nature of the Welfare Association's Air Raid Relief Committee is to concentrate all civilian human and material resources and, under the guidance of relevant authorities, engage in various cooperative tasks of rescue and relief. It is not an independent implementation agency. It is hoped that the authorities will make full use of civilian forces. ② The Welfare Association welcomes the enthusiastic launch of relief and protection work by civilians, but it must be coordinated to achieve unification, so that valuable human and material resources are not wasted. Afterwards, discussions and exchanges of views continued until the meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

Joint Meeting of All Groups

The Air Raid Relief Committee of the Citizens' Welfare Association convened a joint meeting of all groups at the City Government Conference Room at 3:30 PM yesterday. Committee members from the General Affairs Group, Finance Group, Medical Supplies Group, Relief Group, and Fundraising Group, including [] Zong []yao, Li []yong, Yuan Sansheng, Shen []liang, Jin Xiongbai, and more than 20 others, discussed coordination and promotion of work. The Fundraising Group decided to hold a radio fundraising event on the 30th and 31st, hoping that citizens from all walks of life would cooperate widely. Jin Xiongbai put forward the following working suggestions:

① Establish close contact with the Air Defense Headquarters to be able to accurately know the location of air raid points at any time. ② Contact the city government to obtain permits to rush to the scene of the incident for rescue at any time. ③ Each group should have a fixed location and responsible personnel on duty all day. ④ Disclose the goods needed for relief and specify the donation locations at any time. ⑤ Convene and appoint responsible persons from the thirteen Baojia districts to discuss liaison matters. ⑥ Establish shelters, burial places, and hospitals as soon as possible. ⑦ Contact various hospitals to ensure that they do not refuse to accept injured citizens, and negotiate on subsidy matters. ⑧ Regulations on the receipt, distribution, and payment of funds. The committee members of each group also exchanged views.

### Enemy America Attempts to Realize Overall Domination Under the Guise of Aiding Chongqing

Chief Reporter Shimada Delivers a Speech

Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, the chief reporter of the Shanghai Japanese Army Reporting Unit, made a speech at the regular reporting meeting yesterday (28th) morning, revealing that America is using the name of aiding Chongqing to extend its power internally. The main points are as follows:

Using the Pretext of Assisting Chongqing to Expand its Influence

American assistance to the Chongqing government has now gone beyond the scope of assistance and has even reached the point of controlling the government's internal affairs. This incident is undeniable. The American control of the internal affairs includes the comprehensive control of its economic affairs. Furthermore, it is observed that the Chinese reporting forces are implementing separate breakthrough policies towards various departments, and they will not let go of subordinate organizations. The United States believes that the organization of the subordinate agencies is scattered and lacks identification cards, so it pays special attention to this point. Furthermore, the expansion of American publishing power in Chongqing is also unexpected. In short, the Chongqing government cannot smoothly promote its implementation in politics, economy, or military affairs without the consent of the United States. Other matters, such as practical development, production organization, and control of connected agencies, rely on American power to proceed. This fact is even more obvious in the military sphere. For example, in June of this year, the United States specially established a headquarters for the Special District of China in Chongqing. Without the consent of this headquarters, no affairs can be carried out independently, and the responsibilities of the headquarters are mostly concentrated on subordinate aspects, such as restricting the transportation of civilian materials, various constructions, purchasing materials, organizing commercial groups, and managing materials related to China's lifeline, all of which are directly controlled by the United States.

Chongqing Army's Actions Lose Freedom

Although the American training team that came to Chongqing from Myanmar in mid-May was disbanded on July 16, it was actually dispersed in various places to engage in the task of training the Chongqing army. Its purpose is nothing more than to extend the common forces into all levels of the Chongqing army, which can be seen at a glance after careful consideration.

### Police Consumer Cooperative Returns Loaned Funds

Starting tomorrow for one week, the Citizens' Welfare Association, initiated and assisted the Police Bureau in organizing the Police Consumer Cooperative (now named the Police Welfare Society) and loaned funds on behalf of various industry associations and all sectors, with an interest rate of one percent, to be repaid within one year. Approved by Secretary-General Luo of the City Government, the funds will be returned in full. The repayment methods are as follows:

The sales date is one week starting from July 30.

Original receipts should be presented to the Citizens' Welfare Association (address: Chinese Red Cross Society, Xinwen Road) for collection.

For principal and interest below 5,000 yuan, cash will be paid. For those above 5,000 yuan, checks will be issued, with rounding to the nearest hundred (amounts ending in forty yuan will be omitted, and amounts ending in fifty yuan will be increased to a hundred yuan).

Those who do not come to collect within the time limit will be donated to the city's air raid relief fund after the deadline.

### Do Not Be Complacent, Do Not Fall Behind, Hope Wealthy Households Will Donate Generously

Yesterday's Donations Reached a New High

The newspaper's readers' scholarship fundraising campaign has seen a sudden surge in the past two days, creating a record of over 10 million. It is expected that thousands of poor students feel comforted and believe that the problem of dropping out of school is still salvageable and will not lead to "schools only existing in name"!

There are a few points worth telling to our readers about yesterday's donations: ① Yang Changkang and Shou Zhanjie each donated 5 million yuan. Due to their ties to the [] team, they and Zhu Mingyu and others donated money on the previous day, which can be said to be difficult to emulate later. We very much approve of and commend such meritorious deeds. ② The owner of Dachang Silk Weaving Factory has always donated large sums of money and never failed to keep their promise. Their sincerity and perseverance are admired by their colleagues. Yesterday, they specially delivered another 10 million yuan (half of which was used for disaster relief) to sponsor two [] Rongyao teams, which shows that the factory's leaders have excellent leadership and foresight, making them a role model for general industrial and commercial entrepreneurs. ③ Shen []liang, the president of St. John's University, donated 500,000 yuan to sponsor two [] Tong teams. President Shen took the lead, and we believe that the authorities of other schools will also follow suit. ④ Dachang Wool Spinning Factory donated 200,000 yuan, of which 20 copies of "Family Doctor" were attached (Home Doctor), saying that they would be distributed to the workers to enhance their medical knowledge. This is truly a win-win situation.

In addition to thanking all sectors for their enthusiastic support of the scholarship campaign, we sincerely hope that all wealthy philanthropists will generously donate to the scholarship campaign as soon as possible.

This time, American Commander in Chongqing [] Te Man inspected various places in the Northwest, even places that Chongqing military leaders had never set foot in. For example, in June of this year, an American Congressional delegation visited Chongqing, inspected various cities and regions, and paid special attention to remote areas, all of which are areas where Chongqing's politics have not yet fully penetrated. Recently, such as the transfer of Jinuode, it is said that Jinuode intended to strengthen the Chongqing army but differed in opinion from the American authorities. It is not difficult to imagine the subtle clues in this. In the Chongqing army, there is extreme American intervention in military command. If the United States directly controls the Chongqing army, regardless of its form, it will be completely manipulated by the United States. The United States seems to have sensed Chongqing's dissatisfaction and has changed its policy, trying to avoid the superficiality of leadership, and instead grasp the reality of control from the sidelines. Therefore, under the pretext of changing tactical training, it has penetrated its forces into all levels of the Chongqing army. From now on, the actions of the Chongqing army will lose freedom, and the United States can fully utilize this control even after the war. It can be seen that the American methods are clever.

### Second Renaissance Festival to Be Celebrated; Relevant Authorities Actively Preparing

August 1 of this year marks the second anniversary of the Chinese Renaissance Festival and the recovery of the Shanghai Concessions. In order to celebrate, the city's propaganda office has launched various propaganda activities. The office is now actively preparing with relevant authorities. In addition to holding a commemorative ceremony in the City Government Auditorium on the morning of that day, all entertainment venues in the city have been ordered to reduce ticket prices by half on that day to treat family members and celebrate the occasion. It is expected to be an unprecedented grand occasion.

In order to achieve widespread celebration, the city's propaganda office has previously notified the government administration offices and various district offices to conduct large-scale publicity. It is reported that the various district offices have also actively prepared after receiving the order.

Five Groups Hold Celebration Meetings

The city's citizens, the city's chamber of commerce, the National Party Affairs Promotion Association, the Industrial and Commercial Association, and the Xinhua Association's branch will jointly hold a Renaissance Merchant and Civilian Celebration Meeting to commemorate the second anniversary of the recovery of the Shanghai Concessions. It is scheduled to be held at the Grand Guangming Theater at 5:00 PM on August 1 (Wednesday). Director of the City Propaganda Office [] Cuntao will be invited to give a lecture, and the latest film "National Treasure" will be shown. Free tickets will be distributed to citizens for admission. A portion of the admission tickets will be distributed by the Shen Bao Social Service Office and the Xinwen Bao Information Office starting at 9:00 AM today (29th). Tickets are limited, one ticket per person, first come, first served, while supplies last.

Cinemas Show Early Morning Shows

The China Film Company has informed its affiliated cinemas to universally show early morning shows on August 1 and charge half price to celebrate the occasion, in order to assist the City Propaganda Office in launching a grand celebration of the August 1 Chinese Renaissance Festival.

### Deputy Director Man Instructs Subordinates

Deputy Director Man of the City Police Bureau convened all branch directors, deputy branch directors, water patrol captains, deputy captains, and other personnel at the [] Building at 8:30 AM yesterday (28th) to instruct them. The main points are as follows: ① At this stage of air raids, all levels of supervisors must pay special attention to the anti-aircraft duties of officers, anti-aircraft technology, and the spirit of selfless service, in order to achieve the important responsibility of guiding citizens in air defense and rescue and relief. ② Sum up past work and encourage active transformation. ③ Strengthen police discipline and strengthen regular duties. ④ Describe in detail the director's care for the officers and police. We hope that all officers and police will fulfill the mission of wartime police with a fearless spirit. The meeting adjourned around 10:00.

Social Service

### Distribution Method for Funeral Expenses from Madame Zhou's Funeral to Aid Good Causes

The funeral expenses from Madame Zhou's funeral to aid good causes totaled 10,000 yuan. On July 25, Li Sihao, Luo Junqiang, and [] Fu [] Zeng [] Chu distributed 4,000 yuan to the funeral. The remaining 6,000 yuan was distributed to 30 charitable organizations, with each organization receiving 200 yuan. The list of charitable organizations is attached below. The donations can be collected starting next Wednesday (August 1) by presenting receipts to the newspaper's social service office:

Home for the Elderly, Fuyou Orphanage, Andang Hospital, Huili Hospital, Yang [] Bang Orphanage, Xin [] Yutang, Hui Production Department Hospital, Shanghai Poor Children's Home, China [] Dao Yi Society, Shanghai Fu [] School, Dystocia Sanatorium, Women and Children's Relief Society, Nanshi School for the Deaf and Dumb, [] Sanatorium, China Leprosy Relief Society, China [] School for the Deaf and Dumb, China [] You Association, Buddhist Congee Factory, Prison Improvement [] Sheng Fund, [] Xing Guang [] Bitter Children's Home, Homeless People [] Mobile Station, Yao Road Fire Site Construction Site

### Broaden the Response to Aid Air Raid Victims

Mr. Bao Hexiang, General Manager of the China Enterprise and Industry Bank, stated: "The city has been repeatedly subjected to air raids, and innocent civilians have tragically suffered misfortune. As fellow human beings, how can we not feel saddened? Currently, post-disaster relief requires expenses in every aspect. Since your newspaper has promoted it, our bank will follow suit, doing our best to contribute and jointly participate in good deeds, to fulfill our mutual assistance responsibility and broaden the response of all."

Do not be complacent, do not fall behind; to make the 30 million yuan scholarship fund reach its target as soon as possible. Heaven helps those who help themselves, benefiting both oneself and others, a great merit.

Disaster Relief and Scholarships: Two-Pronged Approach

Colleagues at Dachang Silk Weaving Factory stated: "The [] day is getting stronger and stronger, and disaster victims are gradually increasing. At this time and place, all of our citizens, those with remaining strength, should take a boat trip for the sake of co-suffering and raise the crown and silk. To overcome the difficulties, to see peace again, only in this way can we report the country in case of emergency. The colleagues in our factory have seen that, in addition to setting aside 5 million yuan of admission tickets in the fifth scholarship donation plan, we will donate another 5 million yuan for air raid relief, to show our hearts and do our best."

Increasing Workers' Medical Knowledge

A letter from Dachong Wool Spinning Factory stated: "In order to support your newspaper's scholarship campaign, we will donate 200,000 yuan, of which 100,000 yuan will be donated to your newspaper's readers' scholarship fund in the name of Dachong Wool Spinning and Dyeing Factory, and the remaining 100,000 yuan will be donated to the "Family Doctor Scholarship Fund." Please provide "Family Doctor" copies, which our company will distribute to the workers to increase the workers' medical knowledge. It is a win-win situation, and both families and society will benefit. We are extremely happy."

Save on Secular Rituals; Red Eggs for Scholarships

Zhonghua Xingjun sent a letter yesterday: "A man was born yesterday. In response to your newspaper's scholarship campaign, we have saved on various secular rituals and formed a "Red Egg Scholarship Team." I hereby offer a check for 100,000 yuan. Although the number is small, the sincerity of helping the scholarship is the same. I hope you will accept it."

Improvement in Treatment, Increased Hope for All Officers and Police to Complete the Mission of Wartime Police

According to reliable sources, the fifth phase of gold securities is scheduled to be issued next Monday (July 30). The redemption period is two months. It has been decided that the issuance method will not be sold at the Central Reserve Bank, but will be sold publicly on the gold securities market. The commission brokers are sold, which can meet the needs of the market and supply ribbon at any time, and balance the market price to keep it stable. As for the preparation gold period, it is still kept in the special treasury of the Reserve Fund Management Committee. The redemption location is still at the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank and has not changed.

Gold Securities Market Conditions

After the securities market opened yesterday, the situation was not encouraging, and the opening immediately fell to the limit. The details are as follows: The opening was 420,000 yuan, the closing was 842,000 yuan, down 80,000 yuan from the previous day, and the transaction was 5 taels.

### County and District Heads' Air Defense Meeting

The City Civil Air Defense Headquarters convened a meeting with the heads of various counties and districts of the city and the Allied Japanese military officers responsible for suburban air defense yesterday (28th) to strengthen county-level and district-level air defense and relief facilities. It started at 9:00 AM. The county heads' representatives Feng Jing [] attended on time. At 2:00 PM.

I am enclosing a bank draft for 1 million yuan for the needs of relief to air raid victims. Please accept it.

A letter from the Buddha [] Factory stated: "Recently, the city has been frequently subjected to air raids, and there are numerous injured disaster victims. Our factory hereby offers 100,000 Zhongzhi coupons. Please check and forward them to the relief agency. If the city's pharmaceutical factories and pharmacies can all follow this purpose and donate generously, they will be able to accumulate a large amount of aid."
