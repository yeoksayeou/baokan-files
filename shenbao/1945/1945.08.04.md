### Great Bird Island Subjected to Naval Bombardment, Japanese Troops Respond with Coastal Artillery, Iwo Jima Base Aircraft Attack Kanto Region

Central News Agency Dispatch from Central Pacific Base, 3rd: A portion of enemy mobile forces approached Great Bird Island on the 1st. After bombing the island with several dozen carrier-based aircraft, they proceeded to conduct naval bombardment with battleships, destroyers, and submarines. The Japanese troops guarding the island also responded with coastal artillery, destroying enemy ships and causing them to retreat.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: Approximately one hundred and fifty enemy P-51 fighter planes from the Iwo Jima base, from around 10:00 AM on the 3rd, for about an hour and a half, conducted air raids on various locations in the Kanto region, primarily targeting airfields, military facilities, transportation hubs, and urban areas in Gunma, Ibaraki, and the Keihin region.

### Director of Army Medical Administration Discusses Air Raid Relief

Plans to Train Students and Impart Skills

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd: On the 17th and 18th of last month, enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed Shanghai, resulting in many innocent civilian casualties. Upon receiving the report, the Director of the Central Army Medical Administration immediately went to Shanghai to inspect the disaster area, comfort injured compatriots, and assist in medical relief efforts. The results were quite satisfactory. He returned to Nanjing yesterday. Reporters visited him specifically to inquire about the air raid relief situation in Shanghai and the administration's future preparations for medical relief. He briefly stated: "Shanghai's peacetime air defense and relief facilities were quite comprehensive, but after experiencing air raids, their effectiveness fell far short of expectations. Issues such as slow transportation, lack of ambulances, and improper allocation of liaison doctors all contributed to reduced relief effectiveness. Active improvements were subsequently made, so the damage from the air raid on the 22nd was greatly reduced. Various relief organizations and the Air Defense Headquarters maintained close contact. The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association has made especially great efforts in air raid relief work. Currently, the organization is raising 200,000,000 yuan for relief funds, and donations from all sides are quite enthusiastic. It is expected that the funds will be fully raised within days. Before the end of the war, other locations are likely to experience air raids at any time, so it is necessary to automatically form relief organizations. At the same time, in view of the lack of rescue personnel, our administration plans to first train students and the general public in the capital, imparting rescue skills so that they can assist in rescue efforts in the event of an air raid. As for medical and hygiene supplies, we are actively seeking ways to obtain them and will distribute them to various provinces and cities for reserve use once arrangements are made."

### Graduates of the Japanese Army Academy Received an Audience with the Emperor Yesterday

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 2nd: His Majesty the Emperor granted a special audience to the graduates of this year's Army Academy at the Imperial Palace at 10:00 AM on the 3rd. That morning, all the students, led by Academy President Lieutenant General Kaya, entered the Imperial Palace through the Sakashita Gate at 8:50 AM. Chief of the General Staff Umezu and others also accompanied them. The ceremony was orderly, and they waited quietly for the audience. His Majesty the Emperor, in military uniform, accompanied by Chief Chamberlain Fujioka and Adjutant Officer Chief, appeared at 10:00 AM and gave a salute to all the graduates.

### Chongqing Aims to Consolidate Post-War Position

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd:

The armed conflicts between the Chongqing and Yan'an forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have typically been resolved temporarily in the area. However, after this latest conflict, Yan'an actively launched a propaganda offensive, claiming that the Chongqing army used American-made rocket launchers, indicating their deep resentment towards Chongqing, making a quick resolution difficult. Yan'an's hardline stance aims to expose Chongqing's policy of suppressing Yan'an to the world. While Chongqing recently promoted a political resolution to the Chongqing-Yan'an relationship, they simultaneously ordered the Third War Zone troops to actively implement communist suppression efforts, conduct political education for troops in various regions, issued multiple directives to intelligence agencies, and promoted propaganda in peaceful areas, labeling Yan'an as traitors. This reveals that Chongqing prioritizes the war against Yan'an over the war against Japan. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, Chongqing superficially promotes a general counter-offensive against Japan, but preparations are not progressing because the beautification of the 20th Division of the Chongqing army will require several years. Therefore, Chongqing seems to want to eliminate Yan'an before the general counter-offensive begins, resolve the Chongqing-Yan'an issue, and then unify China to consolidate its international position after the war. Therefore, Yan'an has no choice but to desperately launch its political offensive.

### Competition for Coastlines Intensifies

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: After establishing the Tenth War Zone (Commander-in-Chief Li Pinxian) on the north bank of the Yangtze River in southern Anhui Province, the Chongqing authorities recently established the Eleventh War Zone in the Hebei-Chahar-Shandong area, appointing former Sixth War Zone Commander-in-Chief Sun Lianzhong as the zone's Commander-in-Chief. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, Chongqing secretly established the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War Zone in the central area of the coastal regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in April of this year, appointing former Third War Zone Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liu Jianxu as the zone's Commander-in-Chief. Chongqing's move is intended to coordinate with the U.S. military because the focus of the enemy's (U.S.) mainland landing attempts has recently shifted from South China to Southeast China and East China, so it is natural for them to actively strengthen coastal facilities. However, Chongqing's true intention is to prevent Yan'an from seizing the opportunity to reland and expand its territory. Since Yan'an moved to northern Shaanxi in 1939, they have gradually expanded their influence over the years, encroaching on the Chongqing-controlled areas of North China. Their vanguard has advanced to the coastal areas of North China centered on Huaihai. In Central China, Yan'an's guerrillas have also advanced to the areas of central Jiangsu and Jiangnan, stubbornly continuing to expand their territory, carrying out organized large-scale actions. In preparation for the U.S. landing, they are eager to invade the coastal areas, hoping to bring the rich areas along the coast of Central China under their control after the U.S. landing. Chongqing had no choice but to take counter-measures.

### Japanese Army Determined to Protect the Mainland

The Jiangsu War Zone under Zhi Xuezhong lost its actual strength before the Greater East Asia War due to continuous suppression operations by the Japanese army. Later, the Japanese army's Shandong operations were transformed into completely eliminating the communist bandits. Since the Central Plains Campaign, the Hebei War Zone has almost lost its combat power. Later, the Japanese army's operations in that area were transformed into clearing the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region and the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region on the Yan'an side. At this time, the strength of the Chongqing army in North China was visibly weakened, and the Yan'an army seized the opportunity to enter and expand its sphere of influence, intending to reap the benefits of the fisherman while the U.S. army lands. Chongqing is very aware of this, and the Yan'an army, which has recently gradually moved eastward from the Wuhan area along the Yangtze River, intending to turn the Yangtze River basin into a vast red area, has also detoured and gradually moved toward the coastal areas. Therefore, the newly established Tenth War Zone by Chongqing is to prevent the coastal army from advancing eastward and has formed a defense line. As the atmosphere of Chongqing and Yan'an competing for the U.S. army to land on the mainland becomes increasingly intense, the competition between the two for the coastline is also becoming increasingly fierce. Regardless of the conflict between the Chongqing and Yan'an armies, the Japanese Continental Expeditionary Army is determined to protect the mainland and directly advance on the path to defeat Britain and the United States and those who instigate them, in order to achieve the sacred war's objective.

Travel Correspondence

### Worth a Glance

â€” Yifei

Gaoyou and Baoying are only one hundred and twenty li apart. Although they are close at hand, current transportation is inconvenient. The canal section of the waterway between Gaoyou and Baoying is silted up and shallow, only knee-deep. Steamships easily run aground, so the regular Gaoyou-Baoying line of the inland river steamship company has been suspended for a long time. According to locals, the New Fourth Army, entrenched upstream of the canal in the Huai'an-Qingjiang area, has built a large dam about one li wide, blocking the river water and causing the riverbed to silt up.

The transport embankment highway on land has been a cause for concern in recent years, especially since new wheat is being harvested in various counties in northern Jiangsu. Guerrilla forces along the route are creating a terrifying situation to prevent the purchase of grain in the peaceful areas. This situation has become even more rampant recently. On July 5th, when I arrived in Youcheng from Yangzhou, I heard that a passenger bus on the highway was robbed near Jieshou that day. A woman among the passengers was killed, and six soldiers were abducted. It is said that the robbers were militia cadres of the New Fourth Army.

On the morning of the 9th, I boarded a small car (privately operated passenger car; in the past, China Railways had public buses operating, but due to a lack of vehicles and fuel, the service was suspended last winter) at the wharf outside the north gate of Youcheng. The car owner, capitalizing on the scarcity of vehicles, demanded exorbitant fares from passengers without any standard. After repeated negotiations, we finally agreed on 60,000 yuan. The car departed at 8:00 AM, carrying a total of twelve people inside and out, so the journey was slow. After about an hour, we arrived at Jieshou (under the jurisdiction of Gaoyou), where the two counties meet (Baoying is actually under jurisdiction). Because the area is considered dangerous, passengers were asked to get off the car and walk for safety, pretending to be ordinary pedestrians mixed in with the locals. The car, protected by armed soldiers, sped through. After walking about one li, we reboarded the car at Fanshui. From there, the road was clear, and after another hour and a half, the car arrived outside the west gate of Baoying.

Streets of Baoying

The city walls of Baoying are higher than those of Gaoyou. There are many local scenic spots, such as the Huachuan Academy, quietly located at the east end of Xinma Road, with lush trees. It is said that this academy was a garden of a prominent official in the Ming Dynasty, with mountains and lakes, making for excellent scenery. In addition, historical sites include the ancient pine trees of the Harm Dynasty with a long history and the tomb of Yuan Shu of the Han Dynasty, all of which add a lot to the quiet small town on the east bank of the Grand Canal.

In Baoying city, there is only the east-west "Dama Road" (i.e., Xinma Road) and the north-south "Changjie". Each is about one li long. Except for Dama Road, the rest of the streets are paved with large stone slabs. There are many magnificent courtyards in the city, with deep and wide eight-character door walls, maintaining the solemnity of the old families of a century ago.

Raw peanut oil and soybean oil produced in northern Jiangsu are transported to Zhenjiang and sold in southern Jiangsu, with Baoying as a transfer point. Therefore, the oil firms are concentrated in the north of the urban area, while the grain firms are concentrated in the south.

Strike Wave

The troops stationed in Baoying County in the past were the 1st Regiment of Ma Youming of the former 22nd Division. For more than a year, military discipline was lacking, and there were frequent extortion incidents. The people could not bear the disturbance and went on strike together to appeal to the higher authorities. Then they were ordered to be transferred to Xinghua. When they were transferred through the Dongxinzhuang area of Sanjie, this army, which was more than enough to disturb the people but unable to fight, was mechanized by the New Fourth Army. This happened in March of this year.

In the spring of this year, the North Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office appointed Jiang Lianqing as the magistrate of Baoying County. Although the Ma Regiment had left, the people gradually resumed business after suffering from extortion, and most of the arbitrary levies were also abolished. Recently, Jiang sympathized with the hard lives of the fishermen and rickshaw pullers in the county and ordered the fishermen's tax and rickshaw tax to be abolished.

Baoying County Administration

Since Jiang took office as the magistrate of Baoying, he has reformed the county's administration a lot, especially paying attention to the problems of the people's livelihood in the county. In terms of hygiene, Jiang has ordered an investigation into the "City River", which is closely related to the people's hygiene, and personally inspected each section and implemented dredging work to benefit the people's desires. In addition, as the summer season is approaching and epidemics are occurring, the county government has recently sent personnel to Yangzhou to purchase a large number of vaccines for residents to inject.

In terms of education, at the county-wide Baojia Committee meeting on July 11, it was resolved that the county's Public Education Center and Public Library should each quickly establish a public compulsory school. In addition, in order to promote national studies, a writing competition for students in primary and secondary schools in the county was held in late May.

In order to stabilize the lives of the police and eliminate the bad habits of extorting money from the people in the past, starting from April of this year, the treatment of police officers in the county has been improved, redundant personnel have been eliminated, and the quality has been improved. The treatment stipulates that each police officer will receive a monthly subsidy of three dou of rice and 4,400 yuan for vegetables.

Regarding the problem of water conservancy and increased production, efforts have been made to develop water sources. The west dike of Nanyun in Sanguandian, Baoying, has been started to be excavated and has now been completed. This move can draw water from the lake (Gaoyou Lake) to help transport (Gaoyou), unblock the water flow, and benefit the farmland greatly. Other construction taxes are also being carried out one after another.

The public grain warehouse for regulating the people's food and military supplies has recently been formally established, and Xu Yijian has been appointed as the director, responsible for presiding over it.

Public Order and Suppression

In addition to the county security team, the Second Provisional Division of the military is also stationed in Baoying, so the strength to maintain public order in the urban area is quite strong. However, guerrilla forces appear from time to time a few miles outside the city. The city gates are closed at 6:00 PM every day, and the demonstration gunfire of the guerrilla forces can be heard in the middle of the night.

On June 27, the Muyi County security team stationed in Shanyangou had a fierce battle with the Fifth Independent Regiment of the bandit army, and captured many. Afterwards, they were commended by Director Sun of the North Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office. In the middle of the night on July 3, the Honghu water police brigade discovered a team of bandit troops at the port of Hubin, attempting to infiltrate the port. A fierce battle broke out immediately, and Wang Jisheng, the squad leader, led the troops bravely and repelled them.

Rural Conditions

Baoying County is divided into eight districts, with a total population of 428,792, most of whom are farmers. The total area of the county is 212,366.900 acres, and the cultivated area is 108,811.000 acres. The percentage of cultivated land to the total area is 51.2. The main agricultural product is rice, followed by wheat. In addition, Baoying's lotus root flour is well-known (annual output of 500 dan). Because the life is relatively remote and smuggling is inconvenient, prices are lower than in Gaoyou. On July 10, local prices were roughly as follows:

The highest quality rice is 2,780,000 yuan per dan of 150 jin. Pork is 1,800 yuan per jin. Raw oil is 6,400 yuan per jin (old scale). Matches are 550 yuan per box. Guoguang soap is 2,400 yuan per piece. "Changzhou Jiang cloth" is 2,300 yuan per foot, and white foreign cloth is 6,000 yuan per foot.

In order to explore the rural conditions in the local suburban areas, I ventured to Zhangqiao Town, 20 li away from the city in the north, with the locals for an on-site investigation. According to the old farmers, the town's residents are often taken to attend "public rallies", and afterwards, they have to report the situation of the meeting to the garrison, so sometimes they are very busy going back and forth. The model team and militia team of the New Fourth Army, together with the cooperative, purchase agricultural products, all paid in "resistance currency". The ratio with the Central Reserve åˆ¸ is one to five hundred. Due to practical needs, the face value of the banknotes is like a postage stamp, temporarily stamped to increase the value of the banknotes, without end, and the farmers feel very painful.

As for donations and taxes, farmers must pay 15 jin of wheat per acre, and rice is 35 jin per acre according to last year's official rate. This year, it has not been determined because it is not the harvest season. "Supply firewood" requires three jin of firewood per acre of land.

A Glimpse of the Famine

Rice and wheat in Zhangqiao Town are all single-season crops. Previously, only these two crops were known locally. This year, due to the discovery of locusts in early April, both wheat and rice seedlings have been damaged, with losses of more than 50%. According to farmers, the most surprising thing is that the town was supposed to be very cold last winter, and the locusts should have frozen to death. This year's large-scale disaster was really unexpected.

Due to drought and insects, many local farmers have changed their wheat fields to grow soybeans, mung beans, and red beans. These beans must be harvested in August and September of the lunar calendar. As for the wheat harvest in April of this year, it was only half of that of previous years. Barley only harvested 7 or 8 dou per acre, and wheat only 3 or 4 dou per acre. Last year's rice harvest was about one dan per acre, but this year's is unimaginable.

Also, due to climate and location, wheat is generally sown in the ninth month of the lunar calendar. Because it is cold, growth is very slow and it cannot be harvested until May of the following year. Rice is mostly transplanted in May and harvested in mid-August. The price of farmland is about 200,000 yuan per acre near the water, and about 100,000 yuan per acre for the next best.

Editorial

### Further Discussion on Transforming Shanghai's Atmosphere

â€” Jin Xiongbai

The previous editorial in this newspaper, "Transforming Shanghai's Atmosphere," expressed Mr. Chen Binhe's infinite indignation at the failed fundraising attempts. As someone who followed in the footsteps of those seniors and participated in the events, I share the same feeling. Now is the most important moment to save others and ourselves. I will write another article to elaborate on it.

The general middle and upper classes of Shanghai, especially the so-called gentry and wealthy, have always claimed to be patriotic and loving the people, with upright righteousness. In the moments of discussion, they are often awe-inspiring. Such civil spirit is naturally worthy of admiration. But saving the country with empty talk, there seems to be no such precedent in the world. The more tense the war, the more people take the opportunity to accumulate wealth, and the more severe the rhetoric. Everyone believes that the end of the war is not far away, as long as they have money in hand, they can enjoy happiness in the future. Let others shed blood, and let others bear the burden of the collapse of the sky. As long as they express their opposition to the reality and their disgust for the environment, they will be worthy of being citizens of the Republic of China, and they can safely pass through the chaotic situation. If this phenomenon continues and this atmosphere expands, no matter who wins or loses this war, Shanghai, which has always claimed to lead the talented people of the country, has such desperate facts. The future of China is absolutely pessimistic.

Some people also explain that the previous fundraising events contained some political elements. Donating money is a small matter, and perhaps they will be implicated after "the dawn" arrives. Such foresight aims only at shirking responsibility, and I naturally have nothing to say. If this is the only legitimate reason, it is a bit naive and ridiculous. For example, the first police consumer cooperative fundraising was only to maintain public order, in other words, it was indirectly to protect our own lives and property. The second rescue coupon was for evacuation. The third Jiangsu agricultural loan was to prevent the activities of the bandits on the one hand, and to help Shanghai's food supply on the other hand. The recent air raid relief is even a measure that should be taken by human mutual assistance. What is the connection with the current politics? What is the implication for the future of the funders? Mr. Binhe believes that this shows the fragility of civil power. I believe that this is the decline of civil morality, this is the decline of civil spirit, which is really disappointing.

I would like to contribute some simple ideas that are visible and thinkable to some wealthy and powerful people. The war will naturally end one day, but I ask the Shanghai gentry and wealthy class, who claim to be wise and thoughtful, to open their eyes and look at the environment in Shanghai. The U.S. military's mainland operations, the encirclement of the Communist Party, the indiscriminate bombing of enemy planes, as Mayor Zhou reported at the Municipal Advisory Committee the day before yesterday, "Fate has destined the citizens of Shanghai to experience this tragic life." I ask the people of Shanghai to think about this carefully. The facts will not be so simple as to let you pass the difficulties safely and enjoy happiness forever. In this fate, not to mention whether the property can be preserved, the possibility of saving one's life is still a big problem. Don't wait until the end of your life to regret that you didn't contribute some strength to the society before you died. Don't wait until the last breath to feel that it is too late to donate money and efforts. A common man is not guilty, but he is guilty of possessing jade. In a chaotic era, the rich may not be blessed.

I find this fact ridiculous. For example, the 500 million trillion yuan of the rescue coupon is currently only 50 taels of gold, and it was only more than double that amount at the time. Its value is only worth an ordinary house, and with the power of all the social leaders in Shanghai, it has taken several months, and the total amount is still less than four-fifths, and the actual amount taken out is only one-third of it. I think there are at least 100,000 people in Shanghai who have the power to afford a house worth four to eight gold bars, but they are so indifferent to public welfare matters. Is Shanghai's tragic fate really destined? For example, this time for the donation for air raid relief, in the first few times, when continuous bombing threatened one's own life, or because of a temporary emotional impulse, donations were quite enthusiastic. In the past few days, it seems that things have passed, and at the same time, please check the surnames of the donors. How many of them are the gentry and wealthy in Shanghai? Do all the people in Shanghai have to wait until it is their turn to feel that it is too late to do good?

Given the huge daily business volume of the gold and stock market in Shanghai, as long as one-tenth of the funds can be raised, everything can be done. But how many such people are there in Shanghai?

To save Shanghai, to save yourself, you must rely on your own strength, you must rely on the combined strength of all the citizens of Shanghai. Now is not the time to talk about patriotism and stand by. Disaster is about to befall everyone. To avoid this catastrophe, it depends on how hard we work.

### Meeting Between U.S. President and British King Outside Plymouth Harbor

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to news from Plymouth: U.S. President Truman met with British King George VI yesterday and had lunch together on the British battleship "Renown" anchored outside Plymouth Harbor. To express his welcome to the U.S. President on his first visit to Britain, King George said to Mr. Truman, "Your Excellency's visit to our country is most welcome." Truman also expressed his thanks to the King and shook his hand firmly. President Truman flew to Britain immediately after the Potsdam talks ended, arriving in Plymouth yesterday morning. At the same time, he stepped onto the battleship "Renown" to the sound of military music. King George, dressed in the uniform of Admiral of the Fleet, along with the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, saluted Truman as he appeared at the top of the ship's ladder. The Royal British Navy band played the American national anthem. Truman held his hat tightly in one hand, with Secretary of State Byrnes and Chief of Naval Operations Leahy standing on either side. As Truman walked to the rear deck of the ship, the King stepped forward to welcome him. Suddenly, a naval officer stepped forward to salute and reported, "The guard of honor is ready for inspection." Truman smiled and replied, "I deeply love inspecting your country's soldiers." After speaking, Truman in front, and the King behind, began the inspection ceremony under the guard of general officers. After completing the inspection, Mr. Truman introduced his entourage to the King one by one and shook hands with Halifax as a courtesy. Afterward, the King and Truman spoke for ten minutes. The King then went with Truman to the bow of the ship for a photograph. When Truman got up to leave the ship, the military music started again, playing the American national anthem. The King and the U.S. President faced each other. Mr. Truman said loudly, "Your Majesty, I will ask your band to teach our band how to play 'Victory at Sea,' the 'Navy Hymn'." Mr. Truman returned to the American cruiser "Augusta." Ten minutes later, the King took a barge to return the visit to President Truman. On a gray-brown American cruiser, Mr. Truman warmly welcomed the King. At that time, the national flags of Britain and America were fluttering on the ship's mast. The ship's band played the "British National Anthem." At the same time, the King inspected the American Navy on the ship. The King stayed on the ship for about thirty minutes and then bid farewell to Mr. Truman and returned to the "Renown." As the "Augusta" sailed back to the United States, the King sent a telegram to the cruiser from the battleship "Renown" to express his final greetings.

### Attlee and Bevin Return to London Together

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to news from London, British Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin both returned to London yesterday after the Potsdam talks ended, making their first visit to Parliament after the Labor Party government was announced.

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a Reuters political correspondent, it is widely believed in London that Labor Party member Lawrence (age 73) will hopefully be appointed British Secretary of State for India by Prime Minister Attlee.

### Joint Declaration by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Published in the Capitals of the Three Countries - Only a One-Sided Account of East Asian Issues

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to information obtained here, after the Potsdam talks ended, the capitals of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union issued a joint communiquÃ© yesterday, stating in brief: "The purpose of this meeting is to realize the declaration on Germany issued during the Crimea Conference and to ensure that Germany will never again invade neighboring countries and hinder world peace in the future." The joint communiquÃ©, six thousand words in length, mentioned Germany's compensation issues, administrative issues, and temporary handling of Poland's border issues, etc. Among them, there was a mention of Japan and the Pacific War.

### Council of Foreign Ministers Established in Britain - First Meeting Held Before September 1

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Potsdam Tripartite Conference issued a final joint declaration on the 2nd, the main points of which are as follows:

As a result of the tripartite conference, in order to prepare to conclude peace treaties with the defeated countries and in order to plan for a peaceful settlement with Germany after a German government capable of undertaking the above-mentioned purposes is established, it was decided to organize a Council of Foreign Ministers. The Council will consist of the Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, France, and the United States. The Council will be located in London, and the first meeting is scheduled to be held before September 1. The Council's permanent secretariat will be in London. Its main tasks are to draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, submit them to the United Nations, and be given the power to propose solutions to unresolved issues at the end of the European war. When a government capable of this purpose is established within Germany, the Council should prepare a plan for a peaceful settlement with Germany. Countries other than the above five may also be invited to send representatives to attend, depending on the content of the discussions, especially when discussions on peace with France and Italy begin, representatives from other countries should be invited to participate. Although the conference invited France and Chongqing to participate, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union still reserved the right to "tripartite discussions." Regarding the German question, the following political and economic principles were agreed upon:

### A. Political Principles

The rights within Germany will be exercised by the supreme commanders of the four countries, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, each in their respective occupation zones, according to the instructions of their respective governments, and may be exercised jointly in the position of members of the Management Council. The treatment of the German people should be unified throughout Germany as much as possible. The purpose of the occupation is to completely disarm Germany, prevent its future military production, and make Germany peacefully cooperate in the future international life. All Nazi activists and party members should be expelled and removed from responsible positions. To achieve the above-mentioned goals, the whole country will be assisted in establishing local autonomy based on democratic principles, especially through universal suffrage. The United Nations will assist in the revival of all democratic systems. A central government will not be established temporarily, but central administrative officials will be set up for finance, transportation, communications, trade, and industry. Freedom of speech, publication, and religion will be allowed, and religious institutions will be respected, and trade unions will be strengthened.

### B. Economic Principles

In order to eliminate Germany's potential for war, the manufacture of weapons, ammunition, and other military machinery, all aircraft, and ships will be prohibited. Industries directly related to the war economy will be subject to severe control. Unnecessary productivity will be eliminated and destroyed in accordance with the compensation plan. In order to eliminate the excessive concentration of German economic power such as trusts, cartels, and syndicates, the German economy should be decentralized as quickly as possible. The focus of economic revival will be placed on agriculture and the development of peaceful domestic industries. During the occupation period, German territory will be treated as a single economic unit. A joint policy of the United Nations will be established for financial and economic policies. The German people will be recognized with a standard of living that does not exceed the average living standards of European countries, and appropriate measures will be taken immediately to repair transportation agencies, increase coal production, ensure maximum agricultural production, repair people's residences, and manage foreign assets of the German state not seized by the Allied countries. When handling this, resources by which the German people can live should be retained.

### Britain and the United States Concerned About East Asian Issues

Zurich, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) Recently, the propaganda organs of the United States have been promoting that the Three-Power Conference will have important announcements in the final communiquÃ© regarding East Asian issues and Pacific issues. According to authoritative neutral parties, East Asian issues and Pacific issues are therefore causing vigilance in British and American public opinion. In particular, there is great concern about how the Stalin-Soong Tzu-wen talks will develop in the future.

### A Daring Attempt Actually Succeeded, Strengthening Confidence in Helping Students - Hoping for Quick Donations in the Last Two Days

There are many things in the world that must be tried before they can succeed. This time, the newspaper's fundraising for student aid, with a target of 300 million yuan, was indeed a "daring attempt," and the result was actually successful. This proves that positive good deeds that serve the public, benefit the nation, and serve the country will definitely be supported by the public and will eventually be completely successful.

### This Newspaper's Qualification Examination to Be Held Tomorrow Morning and Afternoon

All New and Old Students Must Participate

The student aid exam of this newspaper is scheduled for tomorrow (the 5th) from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. (Upper and lower grades of senior primary school, upper and lower grades of senior primary school 2, upper and lower grades of junior high school 3, and all grades of senior high school) and from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. (upper and lower grades of junior high school 1, upper and lower grades of junior high school 2, and all grades of vocational school and university). All new and old students must participate, otherwise it will be considered abandonment. The examination hall is located at Datong University, 1370 Xinzha Road. Students must bring their student ID cards and take their seats according to the number assigned to their grade in the previous semester. They must bring their own pencils and erasers. Accompanying parents can rest at Xinzha Road Elementary School and are not allowed to stay inside or outside the examination hall to maintain order.

On July 5, this newspaper started a fundraising campaign, running around and appealing, but the donations were few. Now, with the enthusiastic support from all parties, donations are coming in continuously. The owner of Jingming Hall borrowed money to help students for his birthday, and Mr. Gongbo sold books to help students. Again, Mr. Wang Peng provided huge sums of money to help students. Therefore, this newspaper's target of 300 million yuan is within reach, and our confidence in helping students is even stronger. Not only will thousands of poor students be guaranteed access to higher education, but this newspaper, after marking and reviewing the exams, will be able to relax the standards and allow more young people to avoid elimination and avoid being overlooked. We can report these two points to all enthusiastic people in the community. Now, the predetermined fundraising deadline is only two days away (originally scheduled to end on August 5), and there is still a difference of 100 million yuan from the total amount. We hope that more huge sums of money will be donated in the next two days to reach the full amount as scheduled. That is what the staff of this newspaper blindly and eagerly expect.

### Mayor's Speech

Mayor Zhou said in his speech: Today is the graduation ceremony of the cadre training organized by the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters. All of you have been able to put aside all your personal affairs with perseverance, braving the heat to come together for rigorous training, and have completed the training period from beginning to end. This is worthy of praise. From today onwards, you are already true cadre talents, and have become the backbone of the 450,000 members of the city's Self-Defense Corps. At the same time, just as you have completed your training from the training corps, the situation is even more tense than before. Therefore, the responsibility you bear is very great, and all the training you have received needs to be put into practice.

Recently, enemy planes have bombed the urban areas of Shanghai, and innocent people have often suffered disasters. You are local self-defense cadres, and you must have a deep sense of vigilance regarding the current state.

Although the self-defense corps in various districts of the city have made the greatest efforts, shed countless blood and sweat, and served the local area during the air raids, and have been very active and hardworking in firefighting, rescue, and other items, there are still many local forces that cannot achieve their ideals, and the effectiveness of various tasks cannot exert a more magnificent force. This is all due to the lack of cadre talents and the inability to command and operate. Now that you have received rigorous training, and have made a lot of progress in spirit and physique, we have very deep and unavoidable expectations for cadre talents in the future, and there is even more possibility of increased bombing, which is nothing more than a means of terror and threat, and it is inevitable that it will affect social order. But our lives and property are entrusted here, and we are confident that the members of the city's self-defense corps will be able to deeply understand the mission of protecting local social order, and with the penetration of the strength of the cadre, we will be able to cope with the enemy's strategies and assist the authorities in ensuring the social order of Greater Shanghai.

Therefore, in today's graduation ceremony, I would like to present Zhi, Ren, and Yong (wisdom, benevolence, and courage) to all of you, because Confucius said: "The wise are not confused, the benevolent are not worried, and the brave are not afraid." In this era of war and urgency, we must use great wisdom and great courage to deal with the current difficulties, and even more so use great benevolence to serve the local area and the citizens. This is what I would like to encourage all of you.

### Director Liu Discusses Recent Work Focus of the Economic Bureau: Answers Questions at Press Conference

The press conference organized by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held at the Municipal Government yesterday morning at 10:30 AM. Director Liu of the Municipal Economic Bureau attended and answered questions from reporters from various newspapers regarding issues such as wartime price control, strengthening various trade associations, household rationing, and registration of major commodities. The details are recorded below:

### Price Issues

(Question) Could you tell us about the recent key areas of work for the Economic Bureau?

(Answer) The important work of this bureau includes: Industrial and commercial registration, guiding and managing trade associations, registering major commodities, managing prices, supervising agricultural production, and rationing goods.

(Question) It seems very rare for shops to comply with the prices of goods recently approved by the Price Evaluation Committee. For example, it is very difficult to purchase items like leather shoes and toothpaste at the controlled price. What is the bureau's opinion on this?

(Answer) Price evaluation is very difficult. If the prices are set too low, it is difficult to implement; if they are set too high, it goes against the original purpose of evaluation. Furthermore, the factors that influence prices are extremely complex, and it is difficult to achieve practical results without addressing both the symptoms and the root causes. This bureau is paying close attention to this. The reason why the evaluated prices are difficult to implement and why goods cannot be purchased at controlled prices is because prices are changing frequently.

(Question) Recently, general prices have risen sharply again. How does the Economic Bureau intend to deal with this to ensure the livelihood of the people?

(Answer) Although there are various reasons for the soaring prices, the high cost of living and the fact that merchants are not seeking normal profits, leading to hoarding and opportunistic behavior by some, are the biggest factors. This bureau has received an urgent order from the Minister of Industry to quickly develop countermeasures. We are currently seeking instructions from the authorities and coordinating with relevant parties to handle the matter.

### Strengthening Trade Associations

(Question) To what extent has the strengthening process progressed?

(Answer) There are many types of businesses in this city. In the past, the organization of trade associations was not always sound, and there was often competition among the same industries. Requests to organize associations and disputes arose frequently. We have investigated their nature and types, and made adjustments and guidance, or merged them. Currently, there are 261 units of associations that have been organized, approved, and established, and 11 units that are being reorganized. The methods for strengthening trade associations include: Establishing levels, investigating whether the organization is sound, strictly prohibiting manipulation and control, and selectively reorganizing or merging as a standard for adjustment.

### Household Rationing

(Question) The household rationing of various goods is intermittent. Does the Economic Bureau have any plans to improve this?

(Answer) The reason why household rationing cannot be done on schedule is due to the lack of material sources. This bureau is constantly negotiating with relevant parties to handle the matter. Recently, we are preparing to implement household grain rationing. The household rationing of flour and daily necessities has not been interrupted. It should be smoother after the new grain harvest.

(Question) What is the current situation of major commodity registration?

(Answer) The registration of major commodities was previously approved by the Ministry of Industry to be carried out within a specified period (April 16 to May 15 of this year). The scope of items includes eight categories: Vitamin, Chemical industry, Hardware, Electrical appliances, Leather raw materials, Newsprint, These eight types of commodities involve three Already registered and are being counted.

### Sympathy for Air Raid Victims: Donations from All Sectors Continue

A letter from Mr. Xu Shifan, Jiang Yongling, and Yang Houren states: "Our city has been subjected to air raids for days, and countless civilians are displaced and living in dire straits. In the spirit of human mutual aid, how should we express our sympathy and assistance? Therefore, we have launched a campaign to raise air raid relief funds and have collected a total of 10.24 million yuan, which we are sending in full. We hope it will be duly received. Although this small amount may not be of much help, it is merely to fulfill our responsibility."

A letter from Mr. He Zhuoxian states: "Shanghai has been repeatedly subjected to air raids, and although the citizens are in distress, it is heartbreaking to witness. I deeply admire the initiative of your organization to raise relief donations. I am donating 5 million yuan in national currency to express my modest sincerity. Here is a check for 5 million yuan. Please acknowledge receipt."

A letter from all the Chinese and Japanese employees of Shanghai Panasonic Electric Co., Ltd. states: "Our city has recently been subjected to air raids, causing citizens to be displaced. The colleagues of our company cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, all the Chinese and Japanese employees have donated according to their ability, collecting a total of 1,904,000 yuan, which we are sending in full. We hope it will be accepted. We know that a drop in the bucket will not solve the problem, but we hope to inspire others to contribute."

### Commemorating Deceased Father: Donating to Disaster Relief

A letter from Mr. Dibo, a member of the Allied nations, states: "The second of this month is the seventh anniversary of my father's death in China. According to Japanese customs, a grand memorial service must be held. However, I would like to do something of value to commemorate him. Therefore, I am donating the remaining 200,000 yuan from the donation for airplanes as an air raid relief fund for your country, a small amount to express goodwill."

### City Buddhist Association Assists in Disaster Relief

In view of the current air raid relief work being coordinated by the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, the City Buddhist Association has specifically notified major temples and monasteries throughout the city to open their doors as much as possible to accommodate disaster-stricken refugees if citizens in the vicinity of the temples and monasteries are subjected to air raids. At the same time, the association is also preparing to organize a Buddhist rescue team to take charge of air raid rescue work.
