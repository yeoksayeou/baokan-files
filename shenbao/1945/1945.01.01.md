Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government, at the beginning of the 34th year of the Republic of China, plans to make a fresh start with the people and promote renewal. In accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Organic Law of the National Government, he issued an explicit order to grant a general amnesty. The detailed articles and regulations have been carefully drafted by the various departments and commissions of the Executive Yuan. The government order is recorded as follows:

Order of the National Government (January 1st, 34th year of the Republic of China)

This is the 34th year since the founding of our Republic of China, and the 5th year since the return of our National Government to the capital. Alas, Heaven has not ceased its trials, and calamities follow one another. The flames of war have reached every corner, and the world is in turmoil. The late Chairman Wang, braving all difficulties, first led the way to peace and followed the path of co-prosperity with our allies, establishing a grand plan for our nation for centuries to come. In these five years, we have shared weal and woe with our neighbors, pacified the borders, and brought peace to the people. We have promoted education, built up the military, and encouraged commerce. All the major principles for governing the country and establishing prosperity have been implemented in order. However, his ambitions were not fulfilled, and he passed away prematurely. The present Acting Chairman reluctantly undertakes this difficult task and is constantly filled with apprehension. Recalling the past six years, the national vitality has not yet recovered, the people are suffering, the markets are in ruins, the granaries are desolate, and music has long ceased. As a result, studies have been neglected, laws have been disregarded, and wicked officials and treacherous people are terrified and act inappropriately. Considering the origins of these situations, we cannot help but sigh with sorrow. Some have been deceived by cunning enemies and gone astray, while others have acted rashly and fallen afoul of the law. Remembering the warnings of our predecessors against punishing those who have not been taught, and following the ancient principle of not punishing those who acknowledge their wrongdoing, except for those who are stubbornly wicked, we should show leniency and compassion. Therefore, following the benevolent spirit of the late Chairman Wang, we hereby issue a decree of general amnesty, hoping for the pervasive nurturing of spring and the season of plowing. Based on the provisions of Article 6 of the Organic Law of the National Government, we hereby grant a general amnesty and instruct the relevant departments and commissions to properly prepare the articles and regulations and respectfully carry out this task, in order to demonstrate the meaning of making a fresh start with the people and promoting renewal. All our countrymen should uphold this spirit, strive forward with determination, cultivate a loyal spirit to serve the country, cleanse themselves of past misdeeds, and temper the moral character of the nation, in order to welcome great fortune and promote great achievements. This is our sincere hope. This order is issued by Acting Chairman Chen Gongbo.

### Striving for Three Major Tasks to Fulfill the Mission of Revival - New Year's Address by Acting Chairman Chen

Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - The following is the New Year's address by Acting Chairman Chen for the 34th year of the Republic of China:

In the New Year's Day of last year (the 33rd year), the late Chairman Wang instructed us that after the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the enhancement of friendly relations between China and Japan has a brighter path, the alliance of the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia has a clearer principle, the victory of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War is more assured, and the independence of China and the liberation of East Asia are more reliably guaranteed. Facing this bright future, there is no need to hesitate or look back. Regarding the direction and steps for future progress, there is also no need to be unconventional. We only have to follow the established policies and strive further for the three major tasks of "purifying thought," "ensuring security," and "increasing production." We must devote all our energy to the top priority of the decisive battle, in order to achieve the fulfillment of the goals of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity War and the active development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, thereby completing the dual mission of reviving China and defending East Asia.

Last year, the most unfortunate thing we felt was that after the late Chairman Wang pointed out the direction and steps for our progress, he fell ill and went to Japan on March 2nd for medical treatment. Unfortunately, he passed away on November 10th. For a year, we lacked leadership, and the achievements of the three major tasks he pointed out were not satisfactory. This is what we regret and feel very ashamed of. In the future, we must redouble our efforts to complete the three major tasks and enable China to truly gain freedom and liberation. When I assumed the position of Acting Chairman and President of the Executive Yuan on November 20th of last year, I stated that the policies set by Chairman Wang were all the policies I would implement, and the measures taken by Chairman Wang during his lifetime are all the measures I will take today.

Five Points Declared

Self-Encouragement and Encouragement of Others

Furthermore, I declare that, first, opposition to imperialism is the long-cherished aspiration of the National Government and the determination of the people of the whole country. Based on this determination, we will move forward courageously, regardless of success or failure. Second, we are determined to fulfill the late Chairman Wang's legacy and achieve the great aspiration that the Party must not be divided and the country must be unified, no matter how difficult it may be. Third, we are determined to purify the government, in accordance with the late Chairman Wang's instructions and the wishes of the people of the whole country, and strive for self-reliance. In the future, we will strive for national independence and freedom externally, and for national peace and unity internally. We will hold on to these two principles, carefully encourage ourselves, and encourage the people of the country.

Today, the country has entered the stage of decisive battle from a long period of war. Perhaps there will be a greater shortage of materials and greater hardship for the people, but the final victory will surely belong to the country that is firm and resolute. In order to achieve liberation and the true independence and freedom of the country, we need not only patience, but also unity and a clean government. Anyone who poisons the people or harms the foundation of the country, no matter who they are, must be punished. Fourth, it is undeniable that production has gradually stagnated today. In the future, we must attach equal importance to both military needs and civilian needs, in order to encourage the people to continue their efforts in production. Fifth, military affairs and politics must be coordinated. In the military, discipline and education should be emphasized. In politics, integrity should be valued and construction should be implemented. All of this requires not only perseverance, but also progress. This is the first thing we hope the people will understand.

Overall Peace

Full Effort

China is now beset by crises. If we do not work hard, we may become a battlefield for the decisive battle, or we may be completely communist, or we may become a colony of Britain and the United States again. If so, the achievements that the National Government has made in recent years in abolishing unequal treaties, recovering concessions, and abolishing extraterritoriality will all be ruined. Therefore, the people of the whole country should rise up in time to demand overall unified peace, unite the strength of the whole country to eradicate communism, eliminate the foreign forces of Britain and the United States in China, and implement the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, so that China can achieve freedom and independence. This is the second thing we hope the people will understand.

In short, China must be unified before it can achieve complete national independence, and only peace can achieve complete national freedom. Moreover, we must be firm and persevering in order to unite our efforts to achieve the future of the country and the people. With full effort, China can be revived and East Asia can be defended. This is what I sincerely hope for.

### Prime Minister Koiso's New Year's Address - Striving for the Final Victory with Unified Effort

Tokyo, December 31st, Central News Agency - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered the following New Year's address: At this New Year's of the fourth year of the Holy War, I respectfully wish His Majesty the Emperor boundless longevity. His Majesty, at the opening ceremony of the 86th Imperial Diet, bestowed an imperial rescript, saying: "Today, the war situation is becoming increasingly critical, and it is the time for hundreds of millions of people to unite and devote all their strength to destroy the enemy." We are truly honored and fearful, and the 100 million people will cooperate with each other and vow to die to destroy the enemy, break through the national crisis, and relieve the Emperor's anxiety. Now, the soldiers at the front line bear the great responsibility of annihilating the enemy, fighting bravely and resolutely. Especially on the Philippine front line, which determines the trend of the war, the special attack forces of the Japanese army and navy are launching courageous attacks day and night, sacrificing themselves for the country, and destroying the enemy's invasion attempts. The 100 million people in the rear should take this spirit as a lesson and express their noble spirit in their daily lives. Each should strengthen their combat power to the best of their ability, in order to destroy the enemy. This war has spread to the whole world, and all mankind is participating. Therefore, its scale and the complexity of international relations are unprecedented in history. In terms of victory or defeat, those who fight and lose their will to fight will eventually be defeated. Those who fight to the end with strong fighting spirit and strive to support the country will undoubtedly achieve final victory. As the war progresses, our daily lives become more difficult, and air raids will intensify. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the 100 million compatriots will strive to enrich their lives, strengthen their air defense posture, adhere to the determination to fight to the final victory, and increase production. This year is the final year of the war, and the government has taken all measures to fight for victory together with you. This year marks the 1300th anniversary of the Taika Reform in Japan. At that time, the internal and external situation in Japan was extremely difficult, and ominous clouds were spreading. However, due to the reform, the imperial power was proclaimed both internally and externally, and the original face of Japan was restored. Now, although the forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been expelled, they have begun to counterattack, attempting to permanently place Greater East Asia under their control. Therefore, it is today's task to clear the ominous clouds of Greater East Asia and to ensure the permanent stability of the original state of Greater East Asia. We should, with this conviction, cooperate with the countries of Greater East Asia, defeat the enemy's counterattack, and fulfill our common mission.

### Madame Wang Donates Funds for Allied Nations to Purchase Aircraft

Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - Madame Chen Bijun, member of the Central Committee and wife of the late Chairman Wang, deeply admired the recent bloody battles and repeated meritorious deeds of the Allied nations' land, sea, and air forces against the American forces in the Philippines, and was deeply impressed by the loyalty and bravery of the Allied forces. She specifically donated five million yuan a few days ago and personally delivered it to the headquarters of the Allied nations' dispatch army in China for the purpose of purchasing aircraft.

### General Commander Okamura's New Year's Day Address - Completing the Mission with Unwavering Faith

Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - General Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, delivered the following address on New Year's Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China: At the beginning of the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War, all the officers and soldiers of the Expeditionary Army respectfully wish long life to His Majesty and the prosperity of the Imperial fortunes. We are deeply moved and inspired. The purpose of the Holy War has been clearly stated in the Imperial Edict. The soldiers of the Expeditionary Army must, on both land and sea, crush the British and American ambitions to invade East Asia, and are still fighting to the death. This year is the year of decisive battle. We believe that our 100 million people will be able to uphold the Imperial Edict, regardless of the front or the rear, consolidate their determination to destroy the enemy, and promote the traditional spirit, dedicating themselves to the decisive battle in both material and spiritual terms, then victory will surely belong to us. On the Chinese front, last autumn, we completely annihilated the American air force bases in the southwest of China, a key area. Our strategic posture has been further strengthened, and preparations for the decisive battle are also being completed step by step. The Chongqing army is still gathered in a corner of the west, eking out a living, relying on American material assistance to continue the war of resistance, but it has no significant combat power. The American air force uses the inland as a base, either attempting to invade the Japanese mainland, or massacring innocent Chinese civilians, attempting to turn peaceful areas into scorched earth. However, the day when our army will strike a heavy blow against the enemy is near. All the officers and soldiers of our Expeditionary Army, at this New Year's, reaffirm their unwavering faith, thoroughly annihilate Britain and the United States, and accomplish the mission entrusted to us. Here, in addition to expressing our gratitude for the cooperation of the National Government since its participation in the war, we also wish for the consolidation of the National Government's foundation and the well-being of the 400 million people. Finally, we sincerely thank the support of the officials and people in our rear, and we earnestly hope that the Japanese residents in China will persevere, overcome all difficulties, and move forward.

Editorial

### New Year's Dedication

Today is the first day of the 34th year of the Republic of China.

Yesterday was the end of the 33rd year. We have already put forward many things that should be reflected upon for the past year. Today, based on yesterday's reflections, how should we start to do things in the coming year? We feel that fundamentally it is still nothing more than:

First, seeking thorough and clear politics,

Second, seeking the true establishment of security,

Third, seeking the substantial increase of production,

Fourth, seeking the appropriate stability of people's livelihood.

Regarding the first point of clear politics, we believe that the four principles of political innovation proposed in this newspaper's article "Resolutely Strengthening Politics" on December 24th of last year can be used as a foundation, namely:

1. Strong governance,

2. Expert governance,

3. People-oriented politics,

4. Clean governance.

Only by establishing strong governance—with strict organization, sound institutions, and reasonable personnel—can various tasks be done well, government policies be implemented without obstruction, and cunning people be unable to manipulate and ruin things.

Only by establishing expert governance and achieving the right people in the right positions in politics can cooperation between officials and the people be seamless and the task of participating in the war be jointly practiced. Establishing representative bodies and giving the people the opportunity to participate in politics is very important.

Only by establishing clean governance, eradicating corruption, and eliminating extortion can official discipline be revitalized, political affairs be just and selfless, and national policies be implemented without obstruction. Therefore, severe penalties must be used to punish corruption and extortion.

At the same time, what we cannot ignore is that we are currently in the period of the Greater East Asia War, especially in the decisive stage. The life and death of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia is tied to this decisive stage. Therefore, the most important mission of the government and the people this year is to work together to support the war. All efforts and all activities should, of course, take striving for military victory as the first priority. However, working together to support the war cannot be achieved solely by high-sounding slogans or written propaganda. The government must fully exert its power to lead the people and fully induce the power that the people should contribute, in order to assist the war and make a real contribution to striving for victory.

Therefore, to work together to support the war, political coordination must be done first. The government authorities should pay special attention to this principle. The so-called political coordination, the four basic points of which have already been put forward above, political clarity, is the revitalization and innovation of politics itself. Only with clear politics can we achieve security, increased production, and stable people's livelihood. Therefore, the first point is the soundness of politics itself, and the second, third, and fourth points are the good effects arising from sound politics. These four basic tasks are actually the important tasks of the government and the people this year. If they cannot be achieved, then it is a political failure, and there is no way to talk about working together to support the war.

In summary, we would like to put forward the slogan of "political competition" at the beginning of this year, which is the direction of work this year. What is the goal of political competition? It is the four basic points mentioned above. As for the specific methods of how to compete, we will not hesitate to express our humble opinions and will elaborate further.

Japanese Institutions in China

Eliminate Red Tape on New Year's Day

Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - At a time when the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce, coinciding with the renewal of the year, it is heard that the Japanese institutions in China, in this period of the East Asia's one billion people putting all their efforts into dealing with the war, have decided not to hold the customary New Year's exchanges of greetings and New Year's visits.

### Japanese Special Attack Force Achieves Great Battle Results - Sinking Ten Enemy Ships in Two Days

Tokyo, December 31st, Central News Agency - An enemy transport convoy, heavily damaged by fierce attacks by the Japanese air force, attempted to continue its northward advance from the Sulu Sea to reinforce Mindoro. On the 29th and 30th, it was attacked again by five squadrons of the Japanese special attack force. At 5:00 PM on the 29th, the Ichishin Flying Squadron first launched an attack, with one of its planes hitting an enemy transport ship advancing north in the Sulu Sea, causing it to catch fire and sink. On the same day, at midnight, three planes of an assault team attacked an enemy convoy near San Jose. One of them hit a transport ship, which immediately caught fire. The other two planes were unable to find their target in the darkness and returned safely to base. At 7:00 AM on the 30th, three planes of the Koka Squadron also sank one of the three enemy transport ships off the coast of San Jose, while the other two caught fire. On the same day, enemy warships appeared again near San Jose in the afternoon. There were 22 transport ships in the eastern sea and two large transport ships, five cruisers and destroyers in the southern sea. The five planes of the assault team immediately attacked them, causing two transport ships to catch fire in the western sea and one large transport ship to catch fire and sink three minutes later in the southern sea. The other two planes each sank two cruisers in the southern sea. In the two days of the special attack force's attack, excluding the four planes with unknown battle results, the remaining ten planes achieved the brilliant result of sinking ten enemy ships.

### Thai Prime Minister's Congratulatory Message

Bangkok, December 31st, Central News Agency - Thai Prime Minister Apaiwong, in order to celebrate the beginning of the New Year, specially delivered a congratulatory message to the allied nation of Japan. The main points are as follows: At the beginning of this new year, people of all countries pray for happiness, express congratulations to each other, and at the same time, repay the country, and their determination is further consolidated. At this New Year, the hearts of all citizens are concerned about the war, because it is absolutely necessary to gather the total strength of the nation in order to complete the purpose of the war. Whenever we think of the illustrious achievements of the Japanese army since the Greater East Asia War, we are even more convinced that the belief in the victory of the Japanese people will be even more firm. For the freedom and prosperity of the countries and nations of Greater East Asia, the Thai people highly understand the noble ideals of Japan in the war and cooperate as much as possible in accordance with the alliance. On this joyous New Year's Day, all the Thai people sincerely express their prayers for the victory of the Japanese army and the prosperity of Japan.

### Various Soviet Institutions and Organizations Hold Group Greetings on New Year's Day

### Ambassador Tani Explains the Current Situation - China and Japan Should Jointly Fulfill Their Mission

Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - Japanese Ambassador Tani delivered a speech on New Year's Day, explaining the current situation and expressing his belief in the adherence to moral cooperation between the two great nations of China and Japan to overcome the post-war chaos and hardship. The original text of the speech is recorded as follows:

Expanding Relations

Survival Decisive Battle

The enemy America's counterattack, after the past year, has taken a serious form and is gradually approaching our mainland's defense line. At the same time, in Europe, our allied nation Germany is also welcoming the armies of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union near its homeland, launching a decisive battle related to the survival of the nation. On this New Year's Day of the 2605th year of the Imperial Era, I respectfully wish the Imperial State prosperity and face the national difficulties that have occurred before, and fight for the country to the death. Considering the ancient and modern history of Persia and Greece, Rome and Taiji, and the replacement of the decaying old order with the new order, all have gone through several pains. This is called the process of history, and the greater the future, the deeper the pain of production. Since China and Japan stood on their original footing and embarked on the path of morality two years ago, they have now entered a fierce battle situation. In this fierce war against Britain and America, China's provision of combat power and materials is an inevitable requirement. However, the so-called moral friendship of the policy towards China and the requirements of the war situation and materials are sometimes inevitably contradictory and mutually exclusive. However, history is a continuous creation that solves contradictions and unifies mutual exclusions, and now the moral history of the ideal of national construction has been unfolded. The current advancement of Japan has gradually liberated the various ethnic groups of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere from the old British and American system.

Efforts

Strengthen Air Defense

Due to the progress of the war, daily life is becoming more difficult, and air raids are becoming more intensified. 100 million compatriots should conscientiously and clearly strive to make practical efforts to seek practical life, strengthen the air defense posture, and adhere to the determination to win victory, in order to increase production. I cannot help but earnestly hope that this year will be the year of the progress of the war. The government is also studying various measures for this purpose and hopes to move towards victory with all compatriots. This year is exactly 1,300 years since the Taika Reform. At that time, the internal and external situation was difficult and dangerous. However, once the state power was promoted internally and externally and the original face of the Imperial Country was restored, after the forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been expelled, they have returned and began a counterattack to permanently enslave the various ethnic groups in East Asia. Therefore, this year is the year to clear the ominous clouds of Britain and America. Jin Ren must have this belief, share weal and woe with the countries of Greater East Asia, crush the enemy's attempt, and firmly grasp the common ideal of building Greater East Asia. On the part of Japan itself, appropriate measures have also been taken for compatriots in Korea and Taiwan to ensure that they will be treated equally with Japanese compatriots in the future and become true Japanese citizens. Japan must first correct itself and act as a righteous person in the spirit of morality, which will surely ignite the belief that thousands of people dare to be the first in the world.

British and American Exposure

Hegemony Purpose

On the contrary, considering what Britain and the United States have done in the past, we cannot help but feel deep gratitude and firm self-confidence. Their empty talk about freedom is insincere. Considering the facts of the Atlantic Charter, it is indeed the case. Especially the recent Greek civil unrest has fully exposed their purpose of dominating the world with imperialism, and they are not qualified to deal with European problems. The British and American troops claim to be liberators and protectors of freedom in the countries where they landed. But how do they behave in our country? Batriolo's rebellion did not save his country, and the French did not welcome de Gaulle. In Greece, armed conflict broke out with the liberating British troops. Therefore, tracing back to the Soviet Union's past overcoming the difficulties of being oppressed by the German army, demanding to be far away from its national territory, and in France, launching a fierce battle line and independently maintaining the eastern battle line, it is really incomprehensible why they automatically requested the British and American troops to land in their own country and conduct air guerrilla warfare on their own citizens' territory. Where does it belong? The enemies we are fighting are the British and American troops, which rely on their material strength, and the Chongqing personality, which has lost this national self-consciousness. The battle situation is now extremely fierce, but Britain and the United States still have a persistent will to fight. Their indiscriminate bombing of Hankou is expected to expand its scale and air raid various places. We must endure the bombing encountered by London, Hamburg, Berlin, and Moscow.

Chinese and Japanese Nations

Moral Cooperation

On this New Year's Day, I firmly believe that the two great nations of Greater East Asia, China and Japan, will carry out moral cooperation, which is an indispensable foundation for completing the war, overcoming post-war chaos and hardship, and building Greater East Asia. Thinking back to today last year, the late Chairman Wang inherited the great cause of the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen and strongly stated that there is no independence or freedom without sacrifice. He vowed that the people of the two countries would live and die together. The two nations should overcome the difficulties before them and complete the common mission of the two countries. Their descendants should do their best in mutual respect. Finally, I would like to express my infinite gratitude to the heroic spirits of the two countries who sacrificed to complete this great cause and pray for the long-lasting martial luck of the Japanese soldiers fighting in various places.

### Enemy Warships in San Jose Bay: More Than Half Destroyed by Heavy Bombardment; Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces Supplementary War Results

Tokyo, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 31st: Regarding the previously announced war results of the air force's attack on the enemy reinforcement transport convoy off Mindoro Island, it is hereby further reported that five transport ships have been sunk and one cruiser has been destroyed.

A Certain Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Frontlines, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – According to a Japanese naval reconnaissance report on the situation in San Jose, Mindoro Island, on the 30th, three large transport ships were on fire near the mouth of San Jose Bay, seemingly on the verge of sinking. At the airfield south of San Jose, there were numerous small aircraft wreckage. Only six remaining aircraft were burning. This airfield housed more than twenty small aircraft, with several more patrolling overhead. The Japanese army's morning attack set two of these aircraft ablaze. Furthermore, about twenty transport ships and five warships were sighted in the sea south of San Jose, half of them docked and half seemingly having completed their mission and heading south through the waterway between San Jose and Mindoro. The enemy convoy, attempting to reinforce the San Jose base, has suffered losses estimated at one-third based on confirmed reports since the 28th due to continuous attacks by Japanese naval aircraft. Adding the war results of the Japanese attacking forces, the actual losses should exceed half. It is evident that this enemy reinforcement convoy has suffered substantial losses. Since landing in San Jose on the 15th, the enemy has attempted to reinforce the base, assembling fewer than a hundred fighter planes. Starting from the 22nd, they launched operations to suppress the northern Philippines, seeking coordination from Morotai to bomb key Japanese positions. However, due to the active attacks by the Japanese air force and naval vessels, their plans were completely thwarted since the 27th. Recently, even air raids on the northeastern Philippines have largely ceased.

### Enemy Air Raids on Haha-jima and Iwo Jima

Central Pacific Base, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – On the night of the 29th, eight enemy B-24 aircraft attacked Iwo Jima several times.

Southwest Pacific Base, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – On the afternoon of the 29th, fifty enemy small aircraft attacked Halmahera Island.

Philippine Base, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – On the 29th, approximately sixty enemy aircraft, including B-25s and P-38s, attacked central Philippines. On the same day, a dozen or so B-24s attacked the southern region.

### Field Marshal Rundstedt: Message to the Troops, Strive for Victory with All Our Might

Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Huitong News Agency reports: General Rundstedt, Commander-in-Chief of the German forces on the Western Front, issued a New Year's message to the troops, stating briefly: The German army will intensify its efforts until the end. The spirit of the fallen soldiers will forever be our model. 1945 will show us as loyal and courageous soldiers of Führer Hitler, attacking with certainty of victory, defending with steadfastness, responding calmly to battle, and achieving victory on the battlefield. Our faith in Führer Hitler and the power of the people shall never waver.

### US Secretary of State to Visit London to Participate in Three-Foreign-Ministers Conference

Stockholm, Sweden, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – A Reuters reporter reports: London has not officially denied Washington's report that US Secretary of State Stettinius will visit England to meet with Foreign Secretary Eden. It is also said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov may meet with Stettinius. London political circles believe that Stettinius may come to England soon.

### German Counteroffensive Has Achieved Its Goal: Frontline Soldiers Calmly Respond to Battle

Stockholm, Sweden, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – German News Agency reports: A military correspondent for the "Essener National Zeitung" stated that the main goal of the German offensive on the Western Front, to overturn the enemy's plans and relieve the Aachen front, has been achieved. Anti-Axis sources claim that the German army has gained a temporal advantage, a special result of Field Marshal Rundstedt's strategy.

Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Huitong News Agency reports: In the winter battle in Belgium and Luxembourg, the German army continues to fight with a steadfast attitude, while the Eisenhower forces continue to pressure the northern and southern flanks of the German army. The American counterattack is becoming increasingly strong, seemingly intending to eliminate the source of the German vanguard. The German measures are transitional. A large number of American troops have been transferred from other lines. Half of the forces originally on the 700-kilometer front have been moved to the 50-kilometer war zone. German reports indicate that fifteen American divisions have been routed or annihilated.

### Fortress of Budapest Under Heavy Siege

Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Hai Society News: In the past twenty-four hours, the Hungarian-German allied forces defending Budapest have resisted the Soviet advance in the most intense fighting. The Soviets are currently attempting to enter the city from the north, but the majority have been destroyed by German automatic weapons. Although the remaining forces have made slight progress, they have only gained ruins and rubble. The fiercest fighting is currently taking place in the western part of the city. The Soviets have repeatedly reinforced their attacks, but have ultimately failed to seize strong German strongholds. Budapest is gradually becoming a fortress. Every step the Soviets take triggers mine explosions. German-Hungarian forces have set up rifles and machine guns at every narrow doorway in the underground, mowing down Soviet assault teams. German tanks and artillery positions are firing from concealed locations to block the Soviet advance. The defending forces also launch sudden night attacks, annihilating or repelling the Soviets.

### France Signs Anti-Axis Declaration

Lisbon, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Huitong News Agency reports from Washington: The French provisional government's ambassador to the United States will sign the Anti-Axis Declaration on New Year's Day, becoming the thirty-sixth signatory.

The record of the discussion is published in the Japanese-language "Continental" monthly magazine's New Year's issue, and is translated as follows:

Continental News: We are honored to have the guidance authorities for press and propaganda in Shanghai, the Army, Navy, and the heads of the Embassy Press Section, grace us with their presence! As the Greater East Asia War enters its fourth year, we would like to ask the three of you to discuss the current state of the war and the public's perception of it. We would like to invite Mr. Matsudaira, head of the Press Section, to speak first.

Matsudaira: Not at all, not at all. Now, as desired by your esteemed company, let's begin the discussion. First, let's look at the current stage of the war and briefly review the situation since the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Now, I would like to invite Mr. Matsushima, head of the Fleet Press Section, to talk about the progress of the Pacific operations.

Army-Navy Cooperation
With One Heart and One Mind

Matsushima: The past year has been the most intense year of counteroffensives by the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the United States, in the Pacific. Since the counteroffensive in the Gilbert Islands at the end of last year, they advanced into the Marshall Islands at the beginning of this year, and then invaded Truk in February. Before long, the tentacles of the enemy's Pacific general counteroffensive extended to the Mariana Islands. On the one hand, following the fierce attacks on Rabaul and the occupation of the Admiralty Islands, they emerged from Biak on the northern coast of New Guinea, and finally landed on Saipan in June. At this point, the war situation entered an extremely important decisive stage. Thus, MacArthur's Philippine invasion began approximately two months earlier than planned, opening with the attacks on Leyte and Peleliu on September 15th. The American Pacific Fleet, cooperating in this battle, also invaded the Ryukyu and Taiwan areas, marking the beginning of the decisive battle between Japan and the United States. This decisive period can be said to have come very early. Needless to say, the United States' extraordinary anxiety about the global war situation, especially the crisis in Chongqing and the situation within the United States, are all related. Due to these circumstances, the United States had to carry out a very risky and unprepared operation. As for Japan, we had long anticipated such a day and had been preparing for the decisive battle, considering the close relationship between the mainland operations and the Pacific operations. Regarding the mainland operations, please let Mr. Izubuchi explain in detail later. In the Pacific, around the time of the fall of Saipan, the strategic situation became slightly unfavorable. However, thanks to thorough preparation, we quickly maximized our warfighting capabilities and immediately reversed the unfavorable situation. Everything went smoothly, far exceeding our expectations. Not only did the enemy suffer severe blows of eight or ninety percent, but our own warfighting capabilities were further strengthened than before, putting the enemy in a very unfavorable situation. And this decisive battle has unfolded from this point onwards. Thanks to the divine power of the Emperor, after the great battles in the Taiwan and Philippine waters, we also achieved great results in the Battle of Leyte, inflicting deep blows on the main force of the enemy's Pacific Fleet. Subsequently, in the fierce Battle of Leyte, we further shattered the enemy's American ambitions. Particularly, due to the courageous fighting of the Army and Navy air forces, as well as the suicidal attacks by special attack units and airborne troops, we fully demonstrated the essence of the Japanese spirit, striking terror into the hearts of the enemy. The development of the war has clearly been favorable to us. However, the enemy Americans are now resorting to any means to try to find a foothold in the Philippines in order to cut off the transportation arteries between the southern resource area and us, and further to land in China. Therefore, their greatly reduced naval and air power is colluding with the remnants of the Pacific Fleet, using transport ships, which still have surplus capacity in terms of quantity, to inject troops and materials into Leyte Island. And recent developments suggest that they may still be using some of their forces in other locations—according to local propaganda, on Luzon Island or elsewhere—to attempt landing operations. On the other hand, as you all know, of particular importance in relation to this is the strategic bombing of Japan from mainland China and the Mariana Islands. This, of course, contains political and ideological implications, and at the same time, they want to weaken our production capacity through this. Therefore, the future of the war can be divided into two aspects in the Pacific: the decisive battle in the Philippines surrounding Leyte Island, and, in response to this, the air war against the Japanese mainland from bases in Chengdu and the Mariana Islands. The decisive battle around Leyte Island is very advantageous to us in every aspect. This is unparalleled in all the battles in the Pacific thus far. Why? Because we largely control the sea and air, and our army's deployment on land is also very favorable. Consequently, we hold the initiative in operations. It is only the air raids launched by enemy aircraft flying from bases on the mainland and in the Mariana Islands against northern Kyushu and the vicinity of the capital that deserve attention, and we must take necessary measures.

One more point is the British ambitions. The war situation in Europe is currently at a stalemate, but due to the strength of the German navy, the British navy has considerable surplus capacity. Part of its forces has gradually been transferred from the Mediterranean or Africa to India and Australia. This is foreseeable, and there has also been recent intelligence to this effect. In addition, the British Eastern Fleet, based on Ceylon, seems to have some ambition recently, and part of it seems to have advanced, exiting the eastern coast of Australia and the Southwest Pacific war zone, i.e., the New Guinea area. At the same time, part of the so-called defeated fleets of France, Italy, and the Netherlands—whose strength is, of course, extremely small—is assisting MacArthur or Nimitz's offensives. This is also foreseeable. Therefore, under today's circumstances, although the enemy's offensive in the Indian Ocean is diversionary, it is on a certain scale.

In addition to this, the enemy is also coming from the north, but due to weather conditions, it is currently only a small number of aircraft or faster units such as destroyers carrying out mobile operations.

Under the above circumstances, the Navy is cooperating closely with the Army, with one heart and one mind, standing with the Chinese mainland behind us, and fighting on the Pacific front with the belief that we will surely destroy the enemy. At this time of renewal for all, we are determined to inflict a decisive blow on the enemy in the fourth year of the air war.

Matsudaira: As Mr. Matsushima said, the situation of the Pacific operations is very closely related to the operations on the mainland, and the enemy seems to be acting in accordance with this principle as well. Regarding this point, I would like to ask Mr. Izubuchi to give a comprehensive summary of the situation of the Army's activities on the mainland and in the Philippines.

Land War Results
Can Be Expected

Izubuchi: To summarize the mainland operations in the third year of the Greater East Asia War, it can be said that the color of the decisive battle against the United States became increasingly intense. In the Hunan-Henan operation that began in April of this year and the Guangxi operation that followed, the targets were clearly the enemy Americans. This is clear from the statement issued by the Japanese government less than immediately after the start of the operation, and the statements by the supreme commanders thereafter. The Japanese army's operation this time was to destroy the true enemy of East Asia, the United States, which had been secretly disrupting East Asia since the Sino-Japanese Incident, on the mainland. The United States' ambition on the mainland, needless to say, was to use the mainland as a base to bomb our mainland, cut off the connection between Japan and the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere, and to bomb the Philippines and Taiwan. To achieve this ambition, the enemy Americans built a group of airbases on the mainland and instigated the Chongqing forces to resist the Japanese army. However, due to this large-scale offensive operation, all the airbases in southeastern and southwestern China were destroyed. Starting with the Changsha airfield, about twenty major enemy airbases, including Guilin, Liuzhou, Guiyang, and Nanning, are all under our control. The enemy American ambitions have therefore suffered a major blow. Furthermore, we broke through the provincial border of Guizhou and advanced into Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. On the one hand, we advanced from Nanning to link up with Vietnam, connecting with Saigon. As a result of this operation, the north and south of mainland China have been severed, splitting the Chongqing forces that assist the American forces into two, and also cutting off most of the resource area on which Chongqing relies, which is also what the United States relies on. Therefore, Chongqing must have suffered a significant blow in the political and economic aspects as a result of this battle. What makes this operation different from past operations on the mainland is the issue of air superiority regarding air power. In this mainland-spanning operation, we have been constantly hampered by superior enemy air power, causing various difficulties in the operation, especially in terms of supplies. We have experienced unprecedented difficulties. Water and land routes are virtually the same. We cannot move in broad daylight. In other words, it is a battle for supplies. This is the same in the Pacific operations. In short, there have been enormous tactical changes in the war on the mainland that have never existed before.

The same is true of the battle situation on Leyte Island in the Philippines. As far as we know, the enemy's strength is approximately eight divisions, or about 100,000 men. In contrast, after repeated reinforcements and the great victory of the Navy, we have overwhelmed the enemy everywhere. However, air superiority, which has a great impact on ground battles, is being fiercely contested by both sides' air forces. Recently, due to the active roles of the Army and Navy special attack units and suicide squads, the enemy airfield has been destroyed, and the enemy American air power has suffered great damage. We can expect the future battle results.

### Minister Tsuchida Delivers New Year's Address: Devote All Efforts to the Decisive Battle to Destroy the Stubborn Enemy

Mr. Tsuchida, the Japanese Minister Plenipotentiary to Shanghai, issued the following New Year's address:

As we welcome the 605th year of the Imperial Era, I first pay my respects to His Majesty the Emperor and express my heartfelt gratitude to the soldiers of the Army and Navy for their valiant and arduous fighting. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, we have now entered the fourth year. On this auspicious New Year's Day, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States is unfolding, centered on the Philippines. The enemy, having suffered a crushing defeat in the Philippine Sea, must now be recognized as having prepared a considerably strong counteroffensive. The battles of Leyte and Mindoro demonstrate the enemy's intention to counterattack. However, the eternally loyal Imperial Army and Navy, with special attack units as the vanguard, are engaging in total suicide attacks to annihilate the enemy, who relies on material strength. To achieve victory in the war, we must continue this death struggle. The great spirit of defending the Philippines, our imperial homeland, and preserving our national polity is a manifestation of the essence of our 3,000-year history of nation-building. The 100 million people are moved to tears, and the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia praise in unison. In view of the spirit of certain death displayed in the Philippine decisive battle, with free special attack units as the vanguard, leading the way to victory, the 100 million people should quickly rise up as the backup of the special attack units, devote all their efforts to the decisive battle, overcome all difficulties, and fully embrace wartime conditions. In order to secure China's commitment to the war, all must act with broad-mindedness and implement wartime action completely, to deepen the trust of the Chinese people, and the Chinese and Japanese peoples will join hands and work toward completing the Greater East Asia War. As we face the beginning of Showa 20, the year of the decisive battle, I shout three times "Long live the Imperial Nation!" and reiterate my determination to destroy our archenemy, so as to respond to the imperial will. This is my sincere hope.

### Commander-in-Chief Kondo Delivers New Year's Message: Maintain Steadfast Faith and Strive for Victory in the Decisive Battle

Admiral Nobutake Kondo, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, issued the following "New Year's Message" on this, the New Year's Day of the 34th year: As the New Year begins, I respectfully bow towards the Imperial Palace from the front lines of the mainland, and wish long life to the Emperor and prosperity to the nation. Looking back on the past year, the momentum of the Anglo-American counteroffensive has become increasingly fierce. Since October, the situation has suddenly entered the decisive battle stage, and a fierce battle is currently unfolding, centered on the Philippines. This year will determine the final outcome of the Greater East Asia War, and we must recognize the great significance of this year. For three years of the Holy War, with the ironclad unity of the entire nation and the cooperation of our allied nations bound by a vow to live and die together, we have destroyed the enemy's warfighting capabilities and maintained an undefeated record in both political and military warfare, forever shining in the annals of history and illuminating the world. The billion people of Greater East Asia are breaking through all difficulties and advancing bravely under the ideal of co-prosperity. The enemy's counteroffensive cannot be ignored, and although there are many contradictions and weaknesses hidden within their country, their ambition to seize world hegemony is detestable. But today, they are arrogantly launching heavy counterattacks relying on their superior material strength, exposing their final desperate state. It is especially important to note that the people must not be negligent in the slightest degree amidst their great enthusiasm. At this opportune time, the China Fleet and the China Expeditionary Army, under close and rapid coordination, will fight unexpectedly and preemptively in a situation where the mainland and the Pacific are shaped into a decisive ring, in order to complete the objectives of the operation. The soldiers are protecting the country with utmost loyalty and fulfilling the great righteous cause. As the war situation develops, the position of the mainland front is becoming increasingly serious. The greatest power must be demonstrated on the three fronts of land, sea, and air, and at the same time, the political and economic mission of the mainland must also be established. I believe that in this decisive battle, we will surely subdue the British and Americans. The recent counteroffensive by the German army on the Western European front is invincible and can serve as an example for us. We should base our efforts on the fighting spirit of the Army and Navy special attack units to demonstrate the spirit of courage of the 100 million people. The war depends on the turning point, and the decision of victory or defeat lies in the most difficult time of the fierce battle between the two armies. At this time, if we can gain even an inch of ground over the enemy, we will be crowned with the glory of victory. There are clear examples of this from ancient times to the present. Therefore, we must maintain unwavering faith, deal with the current difficult situation, and make desperate efforts. The opportunity for victory will be grasped.

### Recent Weekly Financial, Industrial, and Market Conditions in the City: General Situation Remains Stable

The financial, industrial, and market conditions in Shanghai have been stable in the past week. Silver and Chinese stocks have not seen any major fluctuations, likely due to the year-end settlement of the national calendar year. Banks and money changers have tightened their mortgage lending practices, and the flow of funds has been stagnant. The authorities' crackdown on speculation and close surveillance have prevented market manipulators from operating, resulting in quiet trading. The markets were closed for the second half of the week, and the public was relaxed. Although the Ministry of Finance is strictly enforcing the strengthening of financial institutions and operations, it is absolutely committed to protecting legitimate and legal operations, so the entire financial system is solid and stable. On the industrial and commercial front, production has been unable to increase due to electricity restrictions, and the adjustment of material supply and demand has not been balanced. Although the price increase has been slightly suppressed, the future is uncertain. Those holding edible goods are still reluctant to reduce prices and sell. The general public hopes that the authorities will quickly find ways to smooth the flow of raw materials and restore production, and that there will be thorough and effective measures to suppress speculation and hoarding in order to reassure the people.

### Income Tax Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Investigate and Collect Taxes

Since Luo Guangxu took over as Director of the Shanghai Income Tax Bureau, he has been actively promoting tax affairs, and tax revenues have been extremely strong. Most businesses have already paid their taxes, but there are a few businesses that have failed to pay. In order to universally urge collection and cultivate the habit of businesses paying taxes voluntarily, the bureau has decided to dispatch a large number of investigators from January 4th, dividing them into fifteen groups, each led by a tax police officer, to investigate door-to-door in each district and on each road. If businesses are found to have not paid their taxes, they will be ordered to fill out a declaration form on the spot. If there is resistance, they will be ordered to cease operations as a warning in accordance with the regulations. It is expected that the investigation will be completed within one month, in order to strengthen tax administration.

### Finance Bureau Urges Reporting: Estimated Income for Next Year

The Municipal Finance Bureau, urgently preparing the estimated revenue for all types of taxes in the city for the thirty-fourth year, had already issued orders to its subordinate district revenue offices, limiting them to reporting within seven days. However, it has been found that the respective revenue offices have not uniformly complied with the deadline, which is highly inappropriate. Therefore, a further circular has been issued to urge reporting, so as to compile the overall estimate.

### Red Cotton Painting Gallery Opens Today

The Red Cotton Painting Gallery is initiated by figures in the painting world such as Tian Jiwei, Hong Shuan, Wei Youye, with the purpose of circulating paintings by famous artists and recommending contemporary artistic works. It is said that all paintings in the gallery can be returned for cash, demonstrating integrity. The location is on the third floor of the Red Cotton Restaurant, and it is scheduled to open today.

### Welfare Bureau Recruits Laborers

In view of the post-war factory closures and economic decline in the city, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed workers, and on the other hand, due to production stagnation and material shortages, there is a need for a large amount of labor to increase production. Employing unemployed workers for production is a win-win situation. Therefore, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau is recruiting various unemployed workers, providing them with appropriate work and relatively generous treatment, which is truly a blessing for unemployed workers. Those interested can register from the 2nd of this month at the following locations: (1) 470 North Suzhou Road, (2) 200 Yongkang Road, (3) 267 Penglai Road.

### Everything is Renewed, Doing Good is Most Joyful: Recognizing and Donating to Student Aid is of Profound Significance

The New Year has arrived, and when you meet people, you can't help but offer blessings of "Congratulations, congratulations!" As the saying goes, "Once the New Year arrives, everything returns to spring." Everything must be renewed and welcome the new. From a personal point of view, the past is like yesterday's death; the future is like today's birth. Now that we have the psychology of sending off the old and welcoming the new, we should reflect on our words and deeds, examine our good and evil, and re-determine our direction. In this sense, the responsibility of each person seems to be much heavier when the New Year arrives. Before the new responsibilities are fulfilled, there is no happiness to speak of. Looking back at the era when I was a child, I thought that the New Year was happy, but after middle age, I no longer think that the New Year is happy. So when is the happiest time in life? "Graduation from school," "promotion and wealth," "newly married bliss," "career success"—aren't these the happiest times? I say it doesn't count. A person must have a "bright heart," must be "pure and inactive," must "benefit oneself and others," and the so-called "doing good is the most joyful" is the "happiest time" in life. For example, even if I have "high position and generous salary" today, but what I do is all "harming the country and hurting the people," then there is no "happiness" to speak of. If I do something today that "benefits oneself and others," and it is a good deed that is very meaningful to the country and the people, then the gentle smile from the heart is the absolutely true "happiness." For example, the "special fundraising" initiated by this newspaper for student aid is the best "example."

Teachers' Long Live Student Aid Movement

A letter from Chengyi Middle School states: "Respectfully, the expenses of your newspaper for one semester of student aid are quite large, and the donations received a few days ago are far from the difference, which makes me regret for how many young people lose the opportunity to study! Our colleagues in the education community originally belonged to a poor life, but we always embrace the joy of cultivating talents. Seeing this situation, how can we not be moved? My colleagues in the school value this New Year and specially initiated the "Teachers Long Live" student aid movement. Each person donates 100 yuan for every ten years of age, in order to extend the celebration of the new year and wish for longevity and help education. Although it is a small amount, I hope to arouse the response of my colleagues in the education community to express our love for our students. I now offer 20,000 yuan and hope to receive it."

Another letter from Ma Renzhu, the principal of Lizhi Middle School, states: "Respectfully, Mr. Lu Zhizhe, a math teacher in the high school of our school, because he realized the suffering of poor students who lost the opportunity to study, specially raised 25,000 yuan from the high school students and named it "Lizhi Middle School High School Team" to respond to your newspaper's enthusiastic spirit of helping students. A small token of appreciation, I will send it with the cash, please check."

Sino-German Students Fundraising for Aid

A letter from the students of the Sino-German Midwifery School who received aid states: "Respectfully, recently prices have soared, everything is expensive, and tuition fees in various schools will inevitably increase. It is not easy for people in the salaried class to have enough to eat, let alone take care of their children's education. Seeing this situation, I can't help but sigh! We are students who have received aid from your newspaper, and we dare to imitate Wu Xun's method of begging to seek help from major philanthropists. We have raised 22,500 yuan, which will be used as the "First Team." We will continue to raise funds in the future, and when we have a certain amount, we will pay it again to fulfill our duty as a citizen."

Ballad Storytelling for Student Aid Charity Performance

A letter from Tongfu Bookstore states: "Respectfully, our store is scheduled to open today (New Year's Day), and we have specially hired famous male and female ballad storytellers from Puyu Society. In order to respond to student aid, the daily performance today will be changed to a ballad storytelling charity performance. All ticket income (excluding expenses) and charity singing will be donated to help education. Welcome to donate for songs. The ticket price is 80 yuan per person, and a Bayer monthly calendar will be given as a gift with the tea donation. All proceeds will be donated to the Shen Xin newspapers' student aid fund. I hope people from all walks of life will come together to support this charitable cause. Liang Cheng Company manages Tongfu Bookstore, address 243 Tongfu Road."

Eighth Reader's Student Aid Special Fundraising Team

Team 176: Teachers Long Live Team (Initiated by Chengyi Middle School) 20,000 yuan

Team 177: Staff of Huafeng Foreign Firm 20,000 yuan

Team 178: Rice Association Team 50,000 yuan

Team 179: Wuzhou Team (Fundraised by Xiang Shengwu) 50,000 yuan

Team 180: Second Team of Student Fundraising at Minli Middle School 20,000 yuan

Team 181: High School Team of Lizhi Middle School 25,000 yuan

Team 182: Fourth Team of Huxin Middle School (Fundraised by Class 2C) 32,000 yuan

Team 183: Fundraising Team of Sino-German Midwifery School Students 22,500 yuan

Team 184: Sheng You Team 200,000 yuan

Total: 409,500 yuan

Grand Total: 6,725,228 yuan

Yesterday, all the faculty and staff of "Chengyi Middle School" sent a letter to donate the "Teachers Long Live Team." The method is to donate 100 yuan for every ten years of age of the teachers in the school. If the total is 2,000 years old, they can donate a team of 20,000 yuan. Its intention and method are excellent. If the total age of all teachers in secondary and above schools in Shanghai is more than one million years, then it is not difficult to raise 10 million yuan in aid. However, our intention is not to accept the hard-earned money of the teachers, but to hope that the teachers will solicit donations from wealthy people outside the school or wealthy students and parents within the school, which would be the best method. Mr. Chengyou has donated a large amount to our newspaper's student aid fund in the past. Yesterday, he sent another 200,000 yuan to donate a team. His heart is commendable. The staff of Huafeng Foreign Firm, Rice Association, Wuzhou, each organized nine teams, and Minli Lizhi Huxin middle school students enthusiastically raised funds. Thank you on behalf of the students who received aid.

### Song for Being a Good Person

— Huang Jingwan

Get up at dawn, writing and calculating are the most important. Be serious about uniting industries and doing things. Be cautious when speaking when going out. Eat breakfast early, eat lunch fully, eat dinner sparingly. Be diligent and endure hardship, and avoid the three urgent illnesses (rushing on the road, rushing to speak, rushing to eat) to live a long and healthy life. Be filial to parents, respect elders, brothers and sisters are harmonious, daughters-in-law and sisters-in-law are close, relatives and friends are sincere and trustworthy. Raise children into adults, and strictly discipline their character. It is appropriate to work, study, farm, or do business. Don't admire vanity or be alarmed by false fame, or rely on constant wealth without seeking a career, which will harm your descendants. Accumulating virtue is deeper than accumulating wealth. Choose a son-in-law and marry a daughter with emphasis on morality. The family hopes for peace and everything will prosper. Eliminate the custom of fighting for wealth and gifts. (Give a new marriage couplet: A virtuous couple starts with mutual respect and love, and a good family comes from diligence and thrift) Prostitution, gambling, smoking, drinking, and greed for eating will lead to ruin and self-destruction. Be humble and tolerant in dealing with things, and don't be jealous. The sky is wide, the earth is broad, and Buddha is fair. Ethics and righteousness, matters and emotions, physics and literature, the six principles are prepared so that there are no regrets. Often read family instructions and the Five Classics to cultivate oneself and improve customs day by day.

### Improvement of Rice Rationing System

— Qi Mi

As the problem of people's food is becoming increasingly serious, there are many opinions from all parties on the improvement of the rice rationing system, but the most important meaning is still how to seek a reasonable and fair rationing method. I think the authorities in charge will never "persist in their own opinions"!

(1) Conducting an Accurate Census

In order to deepen the rationing system, conducting an accurate population census is considered the first important step to improving the rationing system. Taking the Nanshi district of the urban area as an example, in the past, there were only people moving in and no people moving out. This not only affects the accuracy of the rationing, but also allows those involved to take the opportunity to embezzle. Therefore, in order to improve the sound rationing system, the following strict regulations should be made for the entry and exit of the population.

1. If there are situations such as moving in, moving out, or death, report to the Baojia within one week to complete the procedures.

2. Conduct temporary spot checks at any time. This spot check method can be carried out by the Baojia office and the Unified Distribution Office to conduct spot checks on each Baojia in the city at any time. Those who falsely report or impersonate will be disqualified from rationing.

3. Those who register as residents, such as those who travel elsewhere, are generally limited to three months. If this period is exceeded, their rationing rights may be temporarily suspended.

4. Strictly supervise the Baojia heads to prevent them from cheating.

(2) Reform of Rice Rationing for Military Police and Civil Servants

Among the special rations, rice rations for military police and civil servants accounted for 30% of all rations, according to the statistics of the Food Bureau last year. In the future, the supply of this rice can be rationed by the municipal government. The basic source can be drawn from the Jiangsu Province in-kind collection method, with the owners paying in-kind. In this way, the government can obtain a large amount of rice from the land tax. If there is not enough, some can be purchased on the market. The amount is limited and will naturally not affect the financial situation of the municipal government or hinder farmers from re-producing. If the municipal government and its counties are calculated with 800,000 mu of cultivated land, and an average of one sheng of rice (one dou in Jiangsu Province) is collected per mu, each county can obtain 64,000 shi. Except for the urban area, which is a non-rice-producing area, the following areas, such as North Bridge, Fengxian, and Jiading, can collect up to 488,000 shi. Using this in-kind purchase as rice for military police and civil servants is more than enough.

(3) Improvement of Insufficient Rationing

The insufficiency of the rationed amount is a well-known fact. Assuming an ordinary family of five, the minimum requirement is five he of rice per person per day, which is only enough for one meal for lunch and one bowl of porridge for dinner. In this way, 7.5 dou of rice are needed every month. At present, each person in the urban area is rationed 2 sheng of rice every ten days. Calculated with five people, a total of 3 dou are obtained per month. Although there is flour to match each period, it is only 2 jin per person every sentence, and a total of 30 jin are rationed per month. At 1.5 jin per sheng, it is equivalent to 2 dou of rice. Compared to the minimum required amount, it is still short of 2 dou. If you are not used to miscellaneous grains, you still have to rely on black market rice to supplement it. At present, the price of black market rice in Shanghai is tens of thousands of yuan per dan. With the general employment status of Shanghai citizens, no one can afford it. For example, a family of five needs more than ten thousand yuan per month for rice. Therefore, our opinions are:

1. Find ways to increase the rationed amount: The household rice that each person can currently receive is not even half of what each person needs. Taking the domestic rationing in Japan as an example, each person has 247.5 liang per month, which is about 9.7 he in our country, which is 3.7 he more than the current rationing amount in the city. Since the Chinese people's appetite is inherently healthier than the Japanese, it is reasonable to require the rationing authorities to increase the rationing amount to at least the same as the Japanese. We believe that once the household rice rationing is increased, it will not only curb the rising prices of other commodities, but also facilitate the implementation of price control.

2. Universalize extra rationing: We hope that the universalization of extra rationing can also significantly reduce the severity of the food problem.

3. Increase the rationing of miscellaneous grains: If there is not enough rice, you can increase the rationing of miscellaneous grains. This is much more reasonable and beneficial than mixing mud and sand in white rice.

(4) Discussion of Focused Rationing

In the case of insufficient and untimely rationing, it is necessary to carefully consider those who really need it. Therefore, focused rationing is the most reasonable and fair rationing method at present. However, our opinion on how to allocate focused rationing is:

1. By age: In Shanghai, the rationing of rice does not distinguish between age and gender. In fact, this method is not much different for a child and an old person, but it seems unreasonable for a strong adult. In Japan, the rice rationing amount for people from 11 to 60 years old is generally 330 grams per person per day (equal to 2.5 liang for Chinese people). If you exceed or do not reach this prescribed age, you should reduce the amount of rationing accordingly. This method is necessary for our reference when rice is not abundant.

2. By labor and mental effort: So-called labor and mental effort refers to industrial workers, teachers, civil servants, etc. who are engaged in production. They are contributing to the country. If they are made to worry about food and clothing, it will affect work efficiency. Therefore, Japan specifically stipulates that heavy laborers can get 390 grams per day for men and 350 grams for women. Special heavy laborers can get 570 grams per day for men and 420 grams for women. The country gives preferential treatment to their food rationing, and it feels reasonable both in terms of personal needs and remuneration.

3. By personal wealth: At a time when rice prices are as high as 40,000 yuan, wealthy people do not necessarily need to rely on household rice rationing to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the authorities should carefully consider whether to reduce or stop the household rice rationing for some wealthy classes. Secondly, I have recently heard that the household rice for the servants of the wealthy class will be cancelled. This method can be implemented first. According to the statistics of some experts, if the household rice rationing for the wealthy class can be stopped in Shanghai, it can save one-sixth of all household rice. On the contrary, if this one-sixth is increased to the impoverished people who lack food and clothing, wouldn't it be the ideal of rationing! We hope that canceling the rationing for the propertied class and increasing the rationing for the extremely poor have the same expectations.

4. By current needs: Consumables that are deemed unnecessary under the wartime system can be stopped from being produced at any time. Taking rice as an example, wine, candied fruit, and rice cakes all need to be made with rice, and these things are usually known as "snacks" in the habits of the Chinese people. From now on, the unified distribution authorities should also pay attention to the amount of these special rations and impose strict regulations. When necessary, the rationing can be stopped. Secondly, it may be appropriate to increase the rice rationing for restaurants and small hotels, because small hotels are just like public canteens, but the amount of food for customers may be strictly limited.

(5) Coordination of Rice Flour Rationing

According to a reporter who recently returned from inspecting the rice-producing areas, various control institutions in the rice-producing areas (such as oil, grain, flour, and wheat) mostly acted on their own. Their indifference greatly affected work efficiency, which can also be seen in Shanghai. Taking this topic as an example, if the rice is rationed late, then the household flour may as well follow the rationing. If the amount of household flour is too small, then the household rice can be appropriately increased. Everything must be considered for the people and not just "deal with" it. Therefore, in future rationing affairs, rice rationing and flour rationing should take mutual coordination.

(6) Planning of Rice Rationing Funds

Rice rationing is delayed again and again, and rice rationing is increasing in price again and again. On the one hand, it is due to the lack of materials, but on the other hand, it is due to the insufficient financial resources of the rationing authorities. Therefore, the author hopes that this fundamental problem will not be ignored in improving the rationing system. The opinions are as follows:

1. The major banking groups in the city can take a broad view and plan for rice rationing loans. The amount of funds must be based on the standard of storing rice for three months (ie, nine periods of household rice). Taking Shanghai's 3.5 million citizens as an example (published by the Unified Distribution Office), each person temporarily needs 6 sheng per month, then 210,000 shi of rice are needed per month. Now, calculated at the purchase price of 5,000 yuan per shi, 300 million yuan are needed. If this huge amount of money can be gathered from small contributions, I think there will always be a way.

2. Recently, we heard that the municipal government will accept the request of the Municipal Advisory Council and will issue 150 million yuan of municipal bonds, of which 100 million yuan is planned to be used as funds to adjust rice prices and to adjust the price of rationed rice. This method is a great merit in improving the rice rationing system. We do not hope that the government authorities will implement a subsidy system of buying in at high prices and selling at low prices, but we believe that using this 100 million yuan as a fund to maintain the price of rationed rice at 5,000 yuan per shi is absolutely reasonable.

Therefore, our hopes are:

If the first method can be fully implemented, then using this huge amount of money as rice rationing funds, the rice panic in the city will be resolved once and for all. If the first method cannot be implemented, the second method will also benefit the people. It would be better if the two methods can be implemented in conjunction with each other.
