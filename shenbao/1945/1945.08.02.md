### Mobile Force Cruises Near Japanese Waters, Japanese Elite Forces Closely Monitoring

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The enemy force that attacked Kanto on July 10th has been active for over twenty days. While urgently seeking maritime resupply, they cruise near the Japanese homeland, repeatedly attacking Hokkaido, Tohoku, Tokai, Kinki, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu with carrier-based aircraft. On July 30th alone, they attacked the Kanto region three times, with a total of approximately 1,000 aircraft. Simultaneously, enemy ships shelled Kamaishi, Muroran, Hitachi, Mito, Shirakawa, Paramushiro, Cape Shio, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, and other locations. Japanese air and ground air defense units shot down 478 enemy aircraft and damaged approximately 400. Submarines also attacked, inflicting considerable damage on enemy ship groups.

Hanoi, 31st (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing army, active near the border of northern Vietnam, has not taken any active action since then. They are urgently seeking to transport troops from the rear and prepare their positions, only launching attacks with small units. Specifically, on the morning of the 28th, approximately 700 enemy troops, like a detached force, attempted to invade the Dongxing-Mong Cai area, but were preemptively attacked by Japanese forces and routed. In the Mong Cai area, Japanese forces achieved battle results, including over 50 enemy corpses left behind and the capture of numerous firearms and ammunition.

Forward Base in Burma, 1st (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces are reorganizing a section of the battle line along the Kalaw-Loilem Road, constructing strong positions, and completing preparations to intercept the enemy.

### Hoping for China's Freedom and Liberation, Urging the People to Redouble Their Efforts

—Instructions from Acting Chairman Chen on Restoration Day—

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – The 1st is our country's Second Restoration Day, and also the anniversary of our country's recovery of the last concession. The entire nation is happily celebrating this festival, which has profound and epoch-making significance in the history of the national revolution, and is deeply inspired. The National Government solemnly held a commemorative ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM. All senior civil and military officials from various departments and committees attended. Acting Chairman Chen personally presided over the ceremony and gave earnest instructions. The ceremony concluded at approximately 10:00 AM. The original text of Acting Chairman Chen's instructions is recorded below:

Today is Restoration Day, and also the anniversary of China's recovery of the last concession. On this day two years ago, China recovered the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. Since then, China no longer has the name of concession. This is a pioneering achievement for China in a century, and also the beginning of China's restoration after a century of decline. Therefore, it is named Restoration Day.

The Spirit of Righteousness Deserves Gratitude

Recalling that after the National Government joined the Greater East Asia War, Japan first automatically returned the exclusive concessions and promised to abolish extraterritoriality. It then assisted the National Government in recovering the Legation Quarter, Gulangyu, the Shanghai International Settlement, and other countries' exclusive concessions, and abolished the Boxer Protocol stationing of troops. This spirit of righteousness from Japan deserves our gratitude. We no longer have so-called unequal treaties, and China is free and independent. Looking around at the current situation in the world and looking forward to the future of China, today we should work harder and be more determined.

Tempering Ourselves and Facing the Crisis

What I want to say today is: First, China's pursuit of freedom and independence has nominally been achieved, but how to maintain China's freedom and independence and develop China's freedom and independence requires further efforts from us. Now many people think that the current situation is so urgent that China's future is worrying. I tell you, everyone, I am also among those who are worried, but what we are worried about is not the pressure of the current situation, but how we can be a truly patriotic citizen in spirit. China's weakness is not due to foreign oppression, but to the inability of our people to be self-reliant and determined. In my opinion, the crisis in East Asia is just beginning, and the crisis in China is also just beginning. If we Chinese do not start with being good people, seeking knowledge, upholding dignity, and taking responsibility, we cannot even maintain the nominal freedom and independence we have. This is something we must deeply reflect on.

The Party Must Not Be Divided, the Country Must Be United

Second, the meaning of Restoration Day is to commemorate China's restoration, in other words, to commemorate China's achievement of freedom and independence. Is China truly free and independent today? The most important condition for a country's freedom and independence is still the country's unification. China has not yet achieved complete peace, forming the division between Nanjing and Chongqing. Needless to say, even the political, military, and economic aspects under the rule of the Nanjing National Government are not completely unified. It is too far from reality to say to the people of a disunited country that we are already free and independent. On November 20th of last year, I advocated that the party must not be divided, and the country must be unified. At the same time, I sympathize with the People's Representative Assembly's call for a unified national salvation movement this spring. Therefore, I once again ask the people of the whole country, China must be unified, especially Nanjing's rule, regardless of north and south, must be unified first. If we are not unified, we cannot concentrate our strength to deal with the important current situation. If we are not unified, we cannot talk about national independence and freedom.

Firm Determination, Never Wavering

The urgency of the current situation is not to be feared, nor is it to be worried about. Our demand for China's liberation is the right of all our people. Our demand for a world without colonies is our highest advocacy. No matter where we are, no matter when, whether successful or defeated, we will never waver in our determination, nor will we ever stop our actions. Dare to proclaim this meaning to the people of China and East Asia.

### Chongqing Executive Yuan Thoroughly Reorganized

Guangzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing Broadcasting: Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen has begun a thorough reorganization of the Executive Yuan. In addition to appointing Kuomintang Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie as Minister of Foreign Affairs (formerly held concurrently by Song), he has also dismissed Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Sheng Shicai, to be concurrently held by Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang. It is said that there may be further changes in the future. According to another report, the ministers of the Executive Yuan have submitted their collective resignation, and future developments are worth noting.

### The Big Three Hold Long Meeting

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to Berlin sources: Marshal Stalin, President Truman, and Prime Minister Attlee held a three-hour and thirty-minute meeting in Potsdam today. This meeting was the longest of the meetings held since Attlee's return to Potsdam.

Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to news from Potsdam: Marshal Stalin has been slightly ill for the past two days. Although it is said that the condition is not serious, doctors have not yet been able to diagnose the nature of the illness. Stalin is currently following his doctor's advice and resting at home temporarily, but still receives visitors as usual. Marshal Stalin is currently 66 years old. Since arriving in Potsdam on July 17th, Foreign Minister Molotov attended the weekend meeting on his behalf. No meeting was held on Monday. There is currently no official news on whether the meeting needs to be postponed. Since Prime Minister Attlee's return to Potsdam on Saturday, the heads of state have only held one very short meeting. In other words, since former British Prime Minister Churchill returned home and the meeting was interrupted, there has been no progress. Since the new British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived in Potsdam, he has held morning meetings with the US and Soviet Foreign Ministers Burns and Molotov on Saturday and Sunday as usual.

### Yasushi Ishii Appointed as Japanese Minister to the Philippines

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines, Shozo Murata, has contributed greatly to the establishment of the country since the independence of the Philippines and has now resigned. The Japanese Cabinet announced that Yasushi Ishii, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Thailand, will be appointed as Minister to the Philippines to succeed Murata.

### Laval Arrested by US Military Authorities in Northern Austria, Transferred to French Garrison Headquarters

Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to information obtained here: After 24 hours of rumors, news suddenly came from Barcelona that the plane Laval was on had landed in Italy. Then there were other false reports, causing French police officers to rush to various airfields, hoping to arrest Laval, but failing several times. Suddenly, an official message stated that former Vichy leader Laval had been captured by the local US garrison in Austria. Last night, Agence France-Presse quoted the headquarters of the US garrison in Austria as saying, "Laval and his wife arrived this morning in the Horsching area (northern Austria) near Linz (Lnz). Upon arrival, they were arrested by the US military authorities, and the local French garrison headquarters was immediately notified. At 3:30 PM, US 75th Corps Commander Cooper personally transferred Laval to the French military headquarters."

### Japanese Reporting Agency in Shanghai, Propaganda Department, Established Yesterday, Department Head Tsuchida Instructs Staff to Strive Hard

In order to improve reporting efficiency and strengthen the reporting lineup, the three Japanese reporting agencies in Shanghai, the Army, Navy, and Overseas, decided to merge and establish the Shanghai Propaganda Department, making reporting work unified. The establishment ceremony was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included Army Minister Kawamoto, Naval Attache Minato, the commander of the Shanghai Garrison, the commander of the Kempeitai, the chief of the General Army's reporting department, Department Head Tsuchida of the Propaganda Department, Councilor Kishi, Colonel Kuwahara, Secretary Katsuno, Lieutenant Colonel Ichikawa, Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, section chiefs, and all staff members. After the ceremony, Department Head Tsuchida gave an instruction, explaining the meaning of the establishment of the Propaganda Department. Then, Army Minister Kawamoto and Naval Attache Minato delivered congratulatory speeches in succession. The ceremony was simple and solemn.

Department Head's Instruction

In order to achieve consistency in political warfare, the Japanese government previously merged the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau with the Army and Navy Reporting Departments of the General Headquarters to realize the unification and activeization of propaganda warfare, hoping to improve reporting efficiency. This kind of necessity is also felt to be equally important locally. Human resources and materials must be concentrated and fully utilized to obtain high effectiveness. Especially in Shanghai, in order to fully utilize its important value as a propaganda base, and based on the unified thinking of various agencies, ideological warfare should be vigorously promoted with a simple and powerful lineup. The establishment of the Propaganda Department today is for this purpose. The Propaganda Department is composed of officers and reporting agencies with tradition and experience, but this merger must be meaningful and able to highly exert its capabilities. First, it must be harmonious. I hope that everyone will stand in the position of serving the country in the midst of this extraordinary wartime and work together with all our strength.

The key to propaganda is to make the other party fully accept your own ideas, and to always grasp the autonomy of ideological warfare. This is self-evident. But in order to achieve this effect, you must first understand the other party's psychology, adapt to the situation, and take prompt and appropriate measures. We, as soldiers of reporting and propaganda warfare, should first establish our own ideas and adhere to unwavering beliefs. This is the first essential. We should be indomitable, hold the belief of certain victory and invincibility, and set an example to enlighten the people. At the beginning of this department's creation, I hope that all staff members will rise up and strive diligently. This humble person has taken on the heavy responsibility of Department Head of the Propaganda Department, and I am worried about whether I will be able to complete this great task in the future due to my shallow learning, limited talent, and lack of experience. Fortunately, with the cooperation of the honorable members of the Propaganda Liaison Conference, the promotion of the General Affairs Office, and the dedication of colleagues in all sections, I am determined to stand at the critical moment of the country's survival and work hard to the end.

Organizational Content

The organization and personnel of the department are: Propaganda Department Head: Minister Tsuchida. Under the department head is the General Affairs Office, which is jointly responsible for presiding over all affairs by Councilor Kishi, Colonel Kuwahara, Secretary Katsuno, Lieutenant Colonel Ichikawa, and Lieutenant Colonel Shimada. Under the General Affairs Office are four sections: Section Chief of the First Section: Consul Fukuma, in charge of news and magazine review; Section Chief of the Second Section: Captain Matsumoto, in charge of all propaganda matters; Section Chief of the Third Section: Secretary Mori, in charge of matters related to materials, etc. In addition, the former Army and Navy Special Reporting Sections will be merged and renamed the Special Reporting Section of the Propaganda Department, with Yokota as the section chief. This strong reporting agency officially began operations yesterday, and the development of propaganda work can be expected in the future.

### On the Second Report of the Shanghai Special Municipality Advisory Committee - Zhou Fo Hai

Today, at the Advisory Committee, we broadly reviewed the work of the Municipal Government over the past six months and briefly expressed my personal feelings.

Conscience is at Peace After Doing Our Best

When I took office, I asked the citizens of Shanghai, "I hope everyone doesn't have too many expectations of me. Without expectations, there will be no disappointment in the future. The greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment in the future... In such a situation, under such circumstances, even a deity with three heads and six arms descending to earth would not have a solution." I also said, "We must be impartial in our work; we must not be self-serving. Therefore, improper profits that previously went into private pockets have been eliminated or returned to the public. As a result, I believe those whose personal relationships have not been respected and whose personal interests have not been continued will definitely create rumors or fabricate facts to attack the Municipal Government." Now, half a year has passed, and unfortunately, my words have come true. Because prices are rising, people's livelihoods are becoming more and more difficult, and past hopes for the municipality are gradually turning into disappointment. Because we enforce the law impartially and seek to get things done, those who have been dismissed, punished, or whose requests have not been granted are gradually voicing their dissatisfaction with the Municipal Government. But these are all things we had already anticipated and are by no means unexpected. Therefore, we will never be discouraged or disheartened because of this, and our conscience will not be condemned in the slightest. Firstly, although we have made no great achievements, we have also made no major mistakes. Even if there are some small things that are handled improperly, they are mistakes made in the public interest, not for personal gain. Secondly, the Municipal Government is by no means unaware of Shanghai's current economic situation and is not neglecting to improve it; especially since this situation was created by the Municipal Government itself. Many complex reasons have created Shanghai's current economic phenomenon. Although the Municipal Government has made its greatest efforts, its strength is insufficient, and there are too many obstacles, so it has not been able to improve the general economic situation. However, most of the other plans have been implemented one by one. We have never just talked the talk without walking the walk. Therefore, the colleagues in the Municipal Government have done their best, and their conscience is at peace. In the future, we must still implement our original intentions, adhering to the spirit of "public interest is more important than private interest, society comes before the individual," regardless of success or failure, regardless of praise or criticism, just knowing how to cultivate, not asking about the harvest, and moving forward straight ahead.

Now, let's review the work situation over the past six months. In the first report, I cited the central tasks of the first half of the year, which were divided into two parts: internal rectification of the Municipal Government and key general facilities.

Internal Rectification of the Municipal Government

Regarding the internal rectification of the Municipal Government, I cited four items: reducing the size of the organization, dismissing redundant personnel, enforcing discipline, and increasing salaries. These four items have been almost fully implemented. The largest reductions in the size of the organization were the merging of the Bureau of Public Works and Utilities, the Bureau of Economic Affairs and the Material Allocation Office, the unification of the treasury, and the simplification of the internal structures of various bureaus and offices themselves. In terms of dismissing redundant personnel, each bureau and office has, in fact, dismissed about one-third of their staff. In terms of enforcing discipline, we have investigated and verified illegal personnel, and some have been dismissed, some have been sentenced to imprisonment, and some have been executed. Therefore, in the past six months, I dare not say that all abuses have been eliminated, but at least no major legal cases have occurred. But precisely because of this, precisely because the above three items have been implemented, not only those who have been dismissed and punished, but also those who care about municipal administration and those who stand by and make sarcastic remarks, have unanimously said that the Municipal Government's actions are excessive or too drastic. To encounter such specious so-called "public opinion" and so-called "criticism" for doing this little, insignificant reform, how can one not weep for Wang Anshi and Zhang Juzheng of a thousand years later? As for increasing salaries, we have done our best. The speed of increasing salaries cannot keep up with the speed of rising prices, and there is absolutely no way to remedy this. But we have done everything we can. Honestly, the salaries of Shanghai civil servants and military police are probably the best. Starting in July, we have implemented further increases, but the most regrettable thing is that the rice rations for civil servants cannot be issued absolutely on time. As for the military police, they are better off than ordinary civil servants. But we have also made our greatest efforts to negotiate. Recently, with the assistance of Commander Matsui and Chief of Staff Doi, the rice rations for military police and civil servants will not be delayed too much.

In the first report, I presented the four items of internal rectification of the Municipal Government to all of you. Thanks to all of you, they have all been accomplished one by one. The colleagues in the Municipal Government, regarding this point, have given an account to all of you and can plead innocent to the citizens.

Review of General Facilities

Secondly, let's review the general facilities. These can be further divided into four items: reorganizing finances, stabilizing people's livelihoods, maintaining public security, and improving the Blockade Management Office.

Regarding financial management, on the expenditure side, we adopt the principle of prioritizing key areas, reducing or even eliminating unnecessary expenditures. As for absolutely necessary expenses, we do not hesitate and try our best to raise funds. These facts do not need to be listed in detail one by one. As for the income side, the increase is indeed considerable. There are many reasons for the increase, such as introducing new taxes, raising tax rates, and the natural increase in revenue due to rising prices. However, the increased revenue due to eliminating embezzlement and eliminating tax evasion is also significant. As a result, the Finance Bureau has offended many people. Because of the legal imposition of new taxes and the increase in tax rates, the burden on citizens cannot but increase, so they also feel unhappy with the Municipal Government. However, regarding this point, there is no way for us to make the citizens happy. In the past, citizens disliked the police extorting along the way and civil servants extorting bribes. This situation can now be said to be gone, or at least greatly reduced. My virtue is insufficient to transform people, and my power cannot subdue the masses. How could this happen? It is because salaries have been increased. To increase the salaries of civil servants and military police, we cannot turn stones into gold. What other way is there besides increasing the burden on citizens? As long as we take from the people and use it for the people, as long as we dedicate every drop to the public, even if the citizens complain, our conscience will not be condemned. One of my best friends among the advisory committee members asked me, "The Municipal Government's income has increased a lot, so why do you still have to raise tax rates and add new taxes? We believe that the authorities will definitely not embezzle, but after thinking about it, we can't figure out the reason for needing this money. Are there any unavoidable special uses?" Even this very well-intentioned speculation feels that too much money has been collected. One can imagine the other malicious or inexplicable comments. Regarding this point, the Finance Bureau has a separate detailed report, so I don't need to say more now. What I want to point out here is that the financial reorganization we planned in the first report cannot be said to have achieved considerable success.

Regarding maintaining public security, in these times when people's livelihoods are difficult, the situation is serious, and people's hearts are shaken, we expected the public security situation to deteriorate at an accelerated rate. But unexpectedly, although public security has not significantly improved, at least it has not deteriorated much. We are now doing our best to rectify the discipline of the military police and to strengthen their strength and training so that they can fully fulfill their mission of maintaining public security during serious times.

Stabilizing People's Livelihoods Faces Great Resistance

As for improving the Blockade Management Office, you probably all know that the general office has been completely abolished. The personnel in the inspection stations scattered in various rural areas have also been dismissed in stages. The situation where villagers entering the city were heavily exploited in the past, I dare not say has been completely eliminated, but at least seven or eight out of ten have been eliminated. This is also something that can be reported to you with comfort.

What I feel I have not been able to account for to you, and even more so to the citizens, is that stabilizing people's livelihoods is extremely difficult. Therefore, in the first report, I said, "I have no confidence in how much of this task can be achieved." I also said, "Even if the Municipal Government authorities have a sincere heart, they really only have empty hands. With a sincere heart and empty hands, to be able to lower prices and to be able to allocate fully and on time, unless you have the ability to turn stones into gold, even a deity has no way." Having said that, we still made our best efforts, hoping to stabilize people's livelihoods somewhat in the midst of the impossible. Who knew that the economic situation would deteriorate so quickly! As a result, some people wrote letters complaining about the Municipal Government, and some people criticized the Municipal Government face to face or behind its back. It is only natural that citizens who have suffered from the hardships of life have nowhere to turn but to complain about the Municipal Government. We should be complained about. We are also happy to accept the criticisms of prominent figures who are anxious about the current situation and criticize the Municipal Government. However, the Municipal Government authorities are not numb and indifferent, and they are not unaware of the current situation in the slightest. Nor are they devoid of conscience, turning a blind eye and not trying to seek relief. Look at the important staff members of the Municipal Government and the various economic cadres. Which one is not negotiating east and west, holding meetings to discuss early in the morning and drafting plans late at night, and being busy from morning till night until they are dizzy? Which one has ever muddied the waters, wanting to take advantage of the economic situation to make a windfall? But no matter how hard you try, no matter how much you don't cheat, the resistance to stabilizing people's livelihoods is really too great, too great to resist. This irresistible resistance is caused by many internal and external reasons. These complex reasons are not something that the Municipal Government alone can eliminate, nor can the entire National Government do anything about it. If everyone studies and analyzes these reasons, these resistances, I am afraid that they will only sympathize with the Municipal Government and will not bear to complain. However, the colleagues in the Municipal Government do not hope for sympathy from all sides. Under the complaints and criticisms from all sides, we are encouraged by the foolish loyalty and courage of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountain and Jingwei Filling the Sea, making every effort, bit by bit, to supply materials and adjust prices, hoping to contribute somewhat to the stabilization of people's livelihoods. However, this cause will not succeed unless it receives the practical and powerful assistance of the citizens, especially the leaders of all sectors.

The above is a general and objective review of the work of the past six months for all of you, based on the first report. As for other issues, there are separate reports, so I don't need to elaborate here. I hope all of you will give your guidance.

Officials and People Working Together with One Heart

In the future, the situation will become more and more serious, and Shanghai's situation will become more and more difficult. The full cooperation between the Municipal Government and the citizens is even more necessary. For a hundred years, Shanghai has not directly suffered from the ravages of war. The approach of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army to Shanghai, the repeated civil wars since the Republic of China, and even the Sino-Japanese Incident, Shanghai has used the concessions as a talisman and has not tasted the flavor of war in the slightest. Even after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has only suffered the indirect effects of war, such as economic poverty and pressure on life. As for the direct power of war, such as destruction, burning, destruction, and death, it has never been experienced once in a hundred years. But now, fate has destined the citizens of Shanghai to experience this tragic life. If Shanghai becomes the target of contention and becomes the place of decisive battle, then it goes without saying. Even if the air raids of the past few times continue, it will be enough to suffer. Therefore, in the future, the work of the Municipal Government will probably focus on saving the dying and helping the wounded, and maintaining public security. How to treat the wounded and bury the dead in the event of a sudden attack, and how to shelter those who have lost their homes, are all things that must be done and are extremely difficult to do. During a sudden attack, looting or riots will inevitably occur due to the chaos in order. How to prevent and suppress them is also something that must be done and is extremely difficult to do. Moreover, to do these two things, expenses are inevitable. However, in the midst of chaos, citizens are too busy escaping for their lives. What taxes are there to collect? The more difficult things are to do, the more difficult it is to get the funds necessary to do them. The difficulty of the work can be imagined. This kind of difficulty is not in the future, it is in the present. How can we avoid or reduce this unprecedented catastrophe in Shanghai? This is the responsibility of the Municipal Government, and it is also the responsibility of the citizens. No matter what, the colleagues in the Municipal Government will definitely fulfill their responsibility and strength for one day while they are in office, and stand on the front line of the citizens in the midst of all difficulties to do the work of rescuing Shanghai. I hope that in the future, whether it is between government agencies and agencies, between social organizations and organizations, and between the Municipal Government and the citizens, we will not shirk responsibility or blame each other. If everyone can adhere to the spirit of acting bravely for righteousness and not remembering the sacrifice, and work together with one heart to do the work of rescue, then the impending catastrophe in Shanghai may be reduced by several degrees.

Commentary

### Transforming Shanghai's Atmosphere - Chen Bin He

Today, our newspaper publishes two articles, one is the report on general municipal administration by Mayor Zhou, and the other is the report on finance by Director Luo. Both were reported at yesterday's municipal advisory meeting. I hope that every citizen should read them carefully because these should never be regarded as mere formal documents.

At yesterday's advisory meeting, after the individual reports by the mayor and others, before starting the discussion of the agenda, I asked the chairman to give me an opportunity to speak. Now I will write down what I said at the time and the supplements below:

Mayor Zhou hopes that all the work in Shanghai must be jointly undertaken by officials and people, especially in the current tense situation, it is especially necessary to be united from top to bottom and shoulder this heavy responsibility. Now I will postpone explaining my views on the municipal facilities and first deeply and frankly reflect on how much strength the people have and to what extent they are cooperating.

First of all, let me give a few examples. Standing on the side of the people, I really feel ashamed and almost have no place to stand.

The first thing is the matter of the Citizens' Welfare Association assisting in providing loan funds for the Police Consumer Cooperative last spring. At that time, the police authorities established a cooperative to improve the treatment of the police and planned to borrow 100 million yuan of funds from the people. As a result, after several months of delay, only four-tenths of the funds were raised. At that time, most people thought that borrowing was equivalent to donating, so they adopted a wait-and-see attitude and shirked responsibility. Now the authorities have repaid all the principal and interest, which was unexpected by those who made the initial loans. We express our gratitude to the authorities for valuing credit and are even more pleased that this provides a guarantee for future social undertakings. On the other hand, we recall that at the time of fundraising, it was the heyday of speculative enterprises. Companies with a capital of tens of millions of yuan could be established in one or two weeks by recruiting shares at ten yuan each. However, for public welfare undertakings to assist in maintaining public order and improving police treatment, they were so stingy. The profiteering of putting personal interests before social interests is really chilling and shows how weak the strength of the people is!

The second thing is that the Municipal Government issued 150 million yuan of relief treasury bonds in March this year, of which 100 million yuan was used to make up for the shortfall in rice distribution last year and was raised by the Municipal Government. The remaining 50 million yuan, including relief, evacuation, and special security expenses, was allocated and determined by various trade associations. However, several months have passed and the funds have not been fully raised. Only 37 million yuan has been raised. At that time, those who attended the meeting to discuss the allocation and fundraising methods were all responsible people from various trade associations. However, they disregarded good faith and public welfare and shirked responsibility, and have not yet paid in full. This fully shows how weak the strength of the people is!

The third thing is the 500 million yuan agricultural loan for the Jiangsu rice-producing area that was recently organized. This is the most meaningful work, and no one can deny it. However, starting from early May and lasting until late July, it took two months to raise less than 300 million yuan. The authorities had no choice but to discuss with the Jiangsu Provincial authorities to reduce it to 300 million yuan, and the remaining 200 million yuan will be used for the second phase in the future. However, we still have to ask, how much of these 300 million yuan was actually raised by the people? In order to save the face of the people of Shanghai, I don't want to reveal it for the time being. Recalling that Mr. Jin Xiong Bai and I jointly visited Mr. So-and-so, the leader of a certain trade association in this city, to discuss fundraising loans, we first explained the significance of agricultural loans and the method of repaying debts with rice in the future. Then he asked, "The method is very good, but what will the situation be when the new grain is harvested? Can you guarantee it?" What he meant was, "Day is about to dawn, why bother?" However, we calmly explained again that the Central Reserve Bank is making every effort to assist and can discount two-thirds, and in fact only one-third needs to be borrowed. Please sponsor us. He also said, "In this case, isn't it that we owe a debt to the Central Reserve Bank? You know, Chongqing has issued an order that anyone who has a debt relationship with the Central Reserve Bank will be severely punished." He also said a set of theories that farmers do not need loans. After repeated discussions, he finally agreed to convene a trade association meeting to decide. A few days later, a trade association meeting was convened and we were invited to attend to explain. We went on time, explained, and withdrew. However, to this day, they have not said whether to participate or not to participate, and there is no news. In order to organize agricultural loans, we visited the leaders of the grain, flour, and yarn industries, who are most closely related to agricultural production increase, but the result to this day is still uncertain. However, unexpectedly, the cigarette industry, which has nothing to do with agricultural production increase, has undertaken 60 million yuan of loans, and the special industry association has undertaken 50 million yuan. Therefore, after each visit, we can only sigh at each other. However, although this agricultural loan work has failed, the efforts of the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank and the Fuxing Bank, as well as the two members of the Advisory Committee, Mr. Li Si Hao and Mr. Zhu Bo Quan, cannot be denied. We have heard that these stingy people not only do not eat coarse grains, but also do not eat brown rice. They must eat the best white rice, but they are so indifferent to the farmers who supply white rice. Therefore, some people say that these people in Shanghai should be starved to death. Judging from these points, isn't it an extreme statement!

In addition to these examples, at least one-fifth of the five million citizens of Shanghai directly or indirectly rely on speculation to make a living. For example, they make a living by speculating in gold bars, stocks, discounts, arbitrage, etc. Have these speculators ever thought about the current and future crisis in Shanghai? Have they ever thought about assisting the authorities to resolve the crisis with their own strength?

There is also the most shameless group of people who are all social leaders on the surface. They say that they don't care about any political and social work in the peaceful area, and their attitude is very negative. However, they are the best at using political and economic loopholes to do things for their own benefit and their attitude to that is very active.

I hope that the senior members of the Advisory Committee present will jointly promote the work of transforming the atmosphere. The atmosphere in Shanghai has been permeated with the atmosphere of personal interest before society and private interest over public interest. Therefore, to overcome the Shanghai crisis, we must first transform the atmosphere, and to transform the atmosphere, we must first give the general public mentioned above a merciless blow. We must stand on the front line and fight against these people before there is hope of transforming the atmosphere and overcoming the social crisis.

Secondly, although the municipal measures cannot be said to be completely successful, eight out of ten can be said to have achieved results. In particular, improving the treatment of military police and civil servants due to the effectiveness of financial rectification is a prelude to political reform, and I am very satisfied with this point and absolutely support it. Although some people think that the tax increase has increased the burden on citizens, this kind of voice is not unheard of. However, reading item (C) of the financial report will prove that it has not increased the burden on citizens. Moreover, even if it does increase the burden on citizens, as long as it is taken from the people and used for the people, even if there is an increase in fact, it is harmless. Some people in Shanghai's business community always want to reduce taxes, but they forget that the value of their own stocks has increased from the face value of ten yuan to several thousand or tens of thousands of yuan. What is the multiple? Therefore, the demands of these people are actually the demands of stock owners, not the demands of the citizens.

The mayor said that the administrative measures in the past few months may have been a bit excessive. However, I believe that Shanghai needs strong politics. Only strong politics can overcome all unreasonable difficulties and not be underestimated by others. Therefore, I believe that it is not only not excessive, but also not excessive enough!

2. Civilian side (written)

### Discussion Items

Proposal to Implement a City-Wide Grain Reserve Plan

Reason: In these extraordinary times, the storage of food for urban residents is of utmost importance. The city should have at least one month's worth of food reserves to meet unforeseen needs.

Methods: 1. The types of food should include rice, flour, and all kinds of coarse grains. 2. Utilize the Baojia system; each Bao should set up a public grain storage site, the quantity of which should be determined by the size of the population. 3. The expenses for grain storage should be raised independently by each Bao; the wealthy should bear more responsibility, contributing either money or grain.

Resolution: Forwarded to the Civil Food Regulation Committee for study. Proposal for Special Compensation for Civil Servants Who Die in Air Raids.

Reason: Families of firefighters, civil defense corps members, medical rescue workers, etc., who die in the line of duty during air raids should receive special compensation as an incentive.

Methods: Although the municipal government has explicit regulations, the amount is too small. The funds designated by the Civil Welfare Association should be fully distributed as maintenance fees according to the number of family members.

Resolution: To be handled through consultation between the municipal government and the Civil Welfare Association. Proposal for Mandatory Evacuation of Public and Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the City.

Reason: Primary and secondary schools in major cities of the countries at war have all been evacuated to safe areas first. However, most primary and secondary schools in this city have not yet been evacuated. The Municipal Education Bureau should be asked to prepare a detailed evacuation plan.

Methods: 1. At least half of the primary and secondary schools must be evacuated before the start of the next semester.

2. The school buildings after evacuation will be used as air raid refugee shelters or hospitals.

Resolution: To be studied and handled by the Municipal Education Bureau.

Proposal to Requisition Bedding from Hotels to Replenish Equipment for Air Raid Relief Hospitals.

Reason: The equipment of public and private hospitals in this city is usually insufficient to meet the needs of temporary relief. With frequent air raids expected in the future, preparations should be made in advance.

Methods: During the first phase, approximately one thousand sets of mattresses and bedding should be requisitioned evenly from various hotels to meet the temporary needs of air raid hospitals.

Resolution: Passed.

### Lieutenant General Towaki Memorial Service to be Held Regularly

### Mr. Wang Peng Donates 10,000,000 Yuan, Setting a New Record for this Year

The fundraising goal for this year's student aid fund is 30,000,000 yuan. After a month of our vigorous appeals, we have only reached one-third of the goal, which is truly worrying. Because insufficient funds mean no student aid, and it is not a pity if our work fails, but it is a fatal blow to the country and society that several thousand aspiring poor students cannot study, which is truly regrettable. However, based on past experience, we always firmly believe in eventual success. Because although most wealthy and powerful people only seek personal enjoyment and are stingy with public welfare, there are still a small number of far-sighted and wealthy people who will always fulfill the students' desire for education. When we are not desperate, we always think this way, with such hope.

Indeed, knowledgeable and enthusiastic people will never disappoint society. Yesterday, thanks to Mr. Wang Peng's honorary donation of 10,000,000 yuan, breaking our highest fundraising record this time, not letting the Jìngmíngtáng Owner Team and Hánfēng Team monopolize the lead. Moreover, Mr. Wang also donated 10,000,000 yuan to the News Daily student loan fund, and another 10,000,000 yuan to the Xinpu Yutang Pushan Villa, generously donating 30,000,000 yuan at once, which can truly be said to be an unprecedented move. On the one hand, we express our most sincere gratitude to Mr. Wang on behalf of the students who have received assistance from this newspaper. On the other hand, we also sincerely urge wealthy merchants with strong financial resources to display their enthusiasm for public welfare, emulate Mr. Wang, and not allow him to monopolize the lead. In that case, what public welfare cause cannot be achieved?

Honor Teams

Thirty-fourth Team: Wang Peng Team Thirty-fifth Team: Gaoge Team

The above collected a total of 10,100,000 yuan, bringing the total to 17,540,000 yuan.

### Setting a Target for the Gift to Mr. Huang Jingwan, Hoping to Conclude it Soon

Previously, this office believed that Mr. Huang Jingwan had served the society for more than 30 years, was enthusiastic and friendly, and made many contributions. However, he did not accumulate wealth in his daily life and was truly in a state of having only clean sleeves. Recently, he was also suffering from illness and experiencing extreme hardship. The colleagues in this office believe that since Mr. Huang has dedicated himself to serving society, society should also lend a helping hand to him in this predicament, to show justice and public opinion. We appealed to Mr. Huang's relatives and friends for assistance. We are grateful for the generous assistance from all walks of life, whether acquainted or not, who have shown unanimous sympathy. We have now collected more than 8,000,000 yuan, and we plan to set a target of 10,000,000 yuan. We will also work with Mr. Huang to properly plan the use of the funds so that he can live in peace. We still hope to continue to receive assistance so that we can reach the target as soon as possible and bring this matter to a conclusion.

### Overview of the Work Implemented by the Shanghai Special Municipality Bureau of Finance in the Past Six Months

— Luo Junqiang

Upon examination, the financial administration of this city has had its own systems due to the existence of concessions in the past. After the recovery of the concessions, although the form has tended towards unification, the financial system has not been thoroughly adjusted. All collection systems, revenue and expenditure systems, and accounting systems have not been established and unified. This kind of non-unification is due to historical traditions, regional customs, and international diplomatic relations, forming different systems between China and foreign countries. Once adjusted, it is not easy to make it a standardized, unified, and systematic one. For example, in terms of the collection system, the adoption of the tax system, the formulation of collection methods, the establishment of collection agencies, and the control of financial administrative personnel; in terms of the accounting system, the preparation and procedures of the budget, the review and reporting of the final accounts, the recording and sorting of accounting reports, the pre- and post-audits of accounting supervision, and inspection matters; in terms of the revenue and expenditure system, the unification of revenue and expenditure and the procedures for cash receipt, disbursement, and safekeeping, etc. The financial systems of each government are different, and the situations are different, so they cannot be handled rigidly. The finance of this city, under these complex Chinese and foreign circumstances, wants to use a single financial agency, and choose an appropriate tax system, and use a unified collection method. It is able to apply to all parts of the city, and is carried out without obstruction, which is naturally difficult and success is not easy. This special and difficult situation is rare in any place in our country. However, there are regular rules for laws, and there are fixed principles for things. In the past six months, the financial system of this city has been based on the actual situation of the area, based on the exploration of academic theories and active efforts, and has already had a rough framework. In the so-called integrated financial system, a prototype has already been formed. If we follow the path and work hard, it will be difficult to succeed in a short period of time, and we hope to do our best. The facilities, the actual situation, and the opinions on difficult problems in the past six months are described below:

### (A) On the Organization of the Tax System

Changing the Land Tax to Collect Actual Goods and Expediting the Collection of Past-Due Taxes: Since the 34th year, this city has levied land tax in kind. However, the collection of actual goods is still a new initiative in this city. After detailed research and discussion, an implementation plan was drafted and submitted for approval. It was divided into two phases for collection. The total amount to be collected for the year was 416,333 stones. The first phase should be collected according to the regulations, accounting for three-tenths of the total. The city and counties were originally not rice-producing areas, and it was also the time of year when the old grain had been depleted and the new grain had not yet come in. Because the deployment of each county took time, the collection was delayed until June. In order to take into account the actual situation, both rice and wheat were collected, and the standard was calculated as 40 catties of wheat equal to 1 dou of rice. At present, the rice and wheat collected by each county have reached a considerable quantity and are being transported and stored in the designated warehouses in the southern district.

The amount of arrears in the city's counties before the 33rd year is still large. Measures have been formulated to urge the recovery of arrears, and personnel have been sent to each county to expedite the collection. The results are also good.

Taking Over the Deed Tax in the Urban Area: The deed tax in the urban area was originally handled by the Land Administration Bureau. Since May, in accordance with the regulations of the central deed tax regulations, it has been transferred to the Finance Bureau for unified authority to comply with regulations. The tax is quite prosperous.

Opening the Business Tax in the Old One and Eight Districts: Business tax in the old urban area and various counties of this city has long been implemented. However, the first eight districts have not been levied due to concession relations. After the implementation of the recovery of the concession, it has been delayed. The burden on the citizens is unfair. After active preparations, the spring business tax this year was implemented on April 1, and six tax collection offices were set up in the old one and eight districts to handle tax collection matters. Merchants are still able to report and pay in accordance with regulations. The summer business tax was also continued to be levied on June 10.

Revision of the Consumption Special Tax Rate and Rectification of Tax Revenue: The ordinary goods tax rate of the retail consumption special tax was originally 4%. In order to balance the income and expenditure of the municipal treasury, it was approved by the central government to add 1%, for a total of 5%. It has been implemented since February 1 this year. As for the tax rate on luxury goods, it was originally 30%. Because it did not fully conform to the actual situation, it was submitted for amendment to 15%. Also, the special tax on banquets and hotels is levied according to progressive tax rates, which makes it easy for merchants to evade taxes. It has also been submitted for approval to be changed to a uniform 30%. Street stalls and small inns are reduced by 10%, and the fine is increased from 5,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. It has been implemented since April 2. In terms of rectification, additional personnel have been assigned to implement tax collection through account checking, strictly implement the invoice system, re-register merchants, strictly prohibit civil servants and military police from resisting taxes, implement centralized tax collection on pork and beef, and set up a meeting to collect taxes on cigarettes at the time of leaving the factory. All have been effective.

Regulating License Fee Rates: The implementation of the license system in this city has many types, different names, and varying fees, which are quite chaotic. Moreover, the license fees collected are all stipulated a few years ago, which is vastly different from the actual situation. After detailed adjustment, the fee rates were re-established and approved for implementation. The method of assigning personnel to collect fees was changed to allow merchants to pay on their own within the time limit, thereby eliminating long-standing malpractices.

Rectifying Entertainment Donation Income: In the past, entertainment donations in this city were very small, due to the evasion of taxation by various entertainment venues, or the embezzlement of donations after collection, the malpractices were very serious. After strict measures were formulated to punish those who evaded donations, and personnel were assigned to conduct serious investigations and strict penalties, each entertainment venue was able to comply with the regulations and report and pay donations truthfully. The income has increased sharply, and the past trend of evading donations has also been swept away.

Adjusting the House and Land Donation Rate: In the old one and eight districts of this city, the municipal administration was handled in the past, and the house and land donation was the main source of income, relying on it to make up for deficits. However, in recent years, the donation rate has not been adjusted. The original donation amount is too low, and the deduction rates in the old one and eight districts are uneven, and the burden on the citizens is uneven. Therefore, from the summer, the house donations in each district of this city will be based on the house rent valuation standards set in the 26th year, and the house donations collected will be increased by 250 times the original number. The donation rate is still calculated at 40% of the 26th year. On May 25, the collection was first started in the old one and eight districts. The method for the old urban area has also been formulated according to the standard and implemented one after another. As for the land donation, due to the receipt of the land rent tax of the old urban area, Hùnán, Zháběi, Yángjīng, Fǎhuá, Yǐnxiáng, Pǔsōng, etc. on October 16 last year, and the receipt of the land donation in the eighth districts at the end of March this year, the collection of land donation has been unified. And the original name of the land donation is not entirely suitable, it is renamed land price tax, but the land valuations in each district are individually drafted, resulting in huge price differences, and the collection of land price tax is unfair. After referring to the actual land price situation, and in accordance with the standard of land tax collection in various counties, measures for collecting land price tax were formulated and implemented, so as to balance the burden and enrich the municipal treasury.

The Opening of the Gold Special Tax: The gold trading in this city is extremely prosperous. This transaction is either for speculators to profit from it, or for upstarts to purchase and hoard property. It was approved by the central government to open a special gold tax. The tax rate is 5 per mille, which is borne equally by both buyers and sellers. A Gold Special Tax Collection Committee was organized to be responsible for the collection. All merchants engaged in gold trading must first apply for registration. Those who pass the review are counted as 150 companies, and 50 companies are designated to be responsible for the special tax. Among them, 4 companies have their qualifications for special tax collection revoked and ordered to suspend business due to violation of the law. The remaining 100 companies are affiliated to 46 companies for easy management and prevention of tax evasion. On the one hand, the registered merchants organize their own trade associations. Since the tax was levied on July 5, more than 500,000,000 yuan have been collected by the 30th. It is stipulated that 5% will be first used for all expenses and bonuses, then one-quarter will be paid to the central government, and three-quarters will be transferred to the municipal treasury.

### (B) On the Adjustment of the Organization

Unification of Accounting Administration: The accounting system of this city was established in July of the 31st year, and a General Accounting Office was established to be in charge of its affairs. The internal organization of the office did not divide the departments according to the nature of the affairs under its jurisdiction, but divided them according to the accounting affairs of the "Old First District", "Old Eighth District", and "Old Urban Area", becoming independent states and failing to implement an integrated organization and adopt an internal control system. As a result, the city's budget and accounting books are divided into three parts: "Old First District", "Old Eighth District", and "Old Urban Area". Revenue and expenditure are independent of each other, and the salaries and benefits of each part are also different. Therefore, on February 1, the General Accounting Office was abolished, and all the affairs handled by the office were merged into the Finance Bureau, and the Accounting Section was established to handle them in a unified manner. Four shares are divided, including the budgeting, accounting, audit (pre-audit and post-audit), and inspection shares.

Merger of Treasuries: In this city, cash receipts and disbursements were nominally provided by the Municipal Treasury, which managed its affairs in a comprehensive manner, but the actual internal organization was handled separately by region. Therefore, the revenue and expenditure system could not be established. For example, the "Centralized Municipal Treasury" was handled by the head office of Fuxing Bank, the "Old Eighth District" Treasury was represented by the South Branch of Fuxing Bank, and the "Municipal Treasury" itself only managed the revenue and expenditure of the Old First District. As a result, receipts and payments were divided and audits were difficult. Therefore, starting from February 1, the business handled by the above treasuries was unified and merged into the newly established Treasury Section of the Finance Bureau. All tax revenues from the city, counties, and suburban areas are directly paid to the Treasury Section with a payment slip, and the expenses requested by various agencies are also directly paid by the Treasury Section based on the payment order. The treasury system is thus determined.

Organizational Adjustment: In order to implement administrative simplification and increase work efficiency, the organization has been adjusted as follows: On February 1, the original four sections of house donation, damage assessment, and urging investigation were merged into the House and Land Donation Section. The duties of the assessment section were incorporated into the House and Land Donation Section, and a share was established to handle them. As for the urging investigation work, it was handled separately by the House and Land Donation Section and other relevant personnel. The various donations and taxes within the Old Eight Isolated Area were originally collected by the Ma Chang Road Office. Starting from January 22, the consumption special tax part was merged into the Consumption Special Tax Section for handling. On April 1, the Ma Dang Road Office was abolished, and all the donations and taxes collected by the office were classified into the respective competent sections for continued handling according to their nature. The Consumption Special Tax Office had a distorted organization and a large scale. Therefore, it was changed to the Consumption Special Tax Section on February 1. The former Tax Section was in charge of the land tax and various donations and taxes in the old urban area and various counties. Since the recovery of the concessions, it has not been corrected. Therefore, on February 1, the land tax, deed process, and sand field cleaning affairs managed by the Tax Section were established as the Land Tax Section to be responsible for handling them. The business tax in the old urban area and various counties managed by the Tax Section was established as the Business Tax Section and classified for handling, and the section was responsible for preparing for the opening of business tax in the old one and eight districts. The other license fees, vehicle and vessel donations, etc., managed by the Tax Section were classified into the respective competent sections for handling, and the collection administration was unified. The Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Inspection Office and the Bamboo and Wood Business Special Tax Inspection Office were both abolished because the number of collections was not high. After the tobacco and alcohol license tax was suspended, the business tax was changed, and after the bamboo and wood business special tax was suspended, the Yaxing was changed to collect the business tax from customers who transport bamboo, wood, firewood, and charcoal. Although the organization was abolished, the tax revenue was not affected. In order to implement clean politics and prevent the malpractice of financial administrative personnel, a Supervision Section was established on February 1. The Supervision Section personnel can investigate at any time whether the general financial administrative personnel can abide by the law when performing their duties. If there is evidence of embezzlement or other illegal activities, they can be reported and have the power to arrest immediately. Since the establishment of the Supervision Section, the staff on duty have been aware of vigilance and encouragement, and are loyal to their duties. Although the malpractices have not been eliminated, the atmosphere may be clear. The establishment of the Supervision Section is beneficial to the sound organization of financial administration and the development of the spirit of clean politics.

### (C) Revenue and Expenditure Situation and the Burden on Citizens

After active reorganization of various donations and taxes in this city, the revenue has increased monthly on the surface. Before the special gold tax was levied, the major source of revenue was the special consumption tax. The highest revenue record was in July, totaling 53,700,000 yuan, of which more than 40% had to be remitted to the Ministry of Finance, leaving the city treasury with only over 20,000,000 yuan. Other revenues, although increased, either because the donation and tax rates were not changed (such as entertainment donations, business taxes collected on a per-unit basis, etc.), or because the revenue did not increase as expected even with the changed donation rates (such as housing donations due to vacancy issues and foreign residents' tax arrears, etc.), inevitably affected the overall revenue. On the expenditure side, both salaries and office expenses often needed to be increased, and all kinds of temporary expenses also increased sharply due to high prices. Especially the temporary necessary expenditures to cope with wartime were so urgent that they could not be reduced, and could only be paid with effort. The inability to balance revenue and expenditure is a phenomenon that any financial institution cannot avoid under the wartime system. The revenue and expenditure situation for the past six months is listed separately below.

According to a report from the city's research office, in 1936, the average monthly tax burden for citizens in the old first district of the city was 1.76 yuan. In June 1945, the average monthly tax burden for citizens of the city was 1,235.52 yuan. If 1936 is taken as 100, the citizen tax burden index in June of this year is 70,200, which is 701 times higher than before the war. However, before the incident, there was no business tax within the concession, and the city did not have a special consumption tax. Therefore, the increase in various donation and tax rates after the war is actually far less than 701 times. Even the housing donation, which has increased the most, has only increased to 250 times the original amount in 1937. However, the price index in June of this year has risen to more than 24,000 times that of 1936, which proves that the burden on citizens in this city has not increased compared to before. In fact, the actual burden is less than before the war.

### (D) Opinions on Difficult Problems

The amount of cultivated land in this city and various counties is 4,523,345 mu. The amount of rice to be collected for the land tax this year is divided into 30% for the first harvest and 70% for the second harvest. The total annual rice to be collected is 416,333 shi. Referring to past tax collection situations, the average actual annual collection only accounts for 60%. However, the difficulty in grain collection is more technical than that of tax collection, coupled with the rising rice prices, farmers are unwilling to pay rice. Further discounting by 10%, a collectable amount of 233,092 shi can be obtained. In addition, due to transportation, losses, and commission expenses, the collected rice is subject to an average loss of 15%, leaving a net yield of only 198,128 shi. However, the monthly rice demand for rations for troops, police, public security, civil servants, teachers, and workers in various districts of the city and suburbs is about 35,000 shi, and the annual demand is 300,000 shi, resulting in a shortage of more than one-third. It is necessary to purchase additional rice to make up for the deficit. Rice prices may rise at any time, and this additional expenditure is impossible to estimate for the time being.

Although the special consumption tax, business tax, and special gold tax may increase in revenue due to rising prices, the account books of commercial firms are incomplete, and there are two sets of account books, one official and one unofficial. Furthermore, because the selling prices exceed the price limits, merchants are afraid of punishment and often do not record them in the account books. As a result, much of the tax to be collected is evaded or embezzled, making investigations difficult. Some merchants even do not understand that paying taxes is an obligation of the people, and instead regard tax evasion as an honor, seeking various ways to get advantages. Furthermore, due to the air raid situation, business is sluggish, and tax revenues may be reduced at any time.

When commercial firms apply for various licenses, according to previous practice, they must submit copies to various bureaus for review. Only after being deemed qualified can the licenses be issued. If the various bureaus fail to process them quickly, honest merchants become suspicious and think that they must offer bribes, while cunning people operate without licenses, which damages the government's reputation. Therefore, close contact between the various bureaus and joint adoption of rapid and effective methods are necessary.

In the past, the old urban area and the first and eighth districts each had different accounting systems. This year, the preparation of a unified general budget is difficult because there is no standard to follow and data collection is difficult. A good budget lies in careful preparation beforehand, so that revenue and expenditure can be balanced afterwards. However, at present, prices are rising daily, and it is difficult to increase revenue arbitrarily, while expenditure is difficult to reduce due to the variety of expenses. The gap between revenue and expenditure is becoming increasingly large and cannot be balanced. In addition, as the situation has entered a serious stage, prices will continue to rise, and the expenditures of various institutions must in fact expand. To meet the needs of wartime, various projects such as road construction, air defense facilities, etc., cannot be reduced. Expenses such as relief, medical care, and pensions for air raid victims cannot but be planned for in advance. The amount of expenditure hereafter will inevitably be huge and impossible to reduce. In the second half of the year, the salaries of civil servants in this city will be greatly increased according to the regulations of the central government. Because the price level in this city is the highest in all regions, a local living allowance will be added in addition to the wartime allowance. Although the amount of this expenditure is very large, the income of each civil servant, judging from the current cost of living index, can only maintain the minimum living standard of one or two people. If prices rise again in the future, the increased salaries will not be enough. If civil servants are to be honest and law-abiding, they must be given the minimum cost of living. However, for those responsible for finance, fulfilling this most basic and minimal requirement is also very difficult. Under this wartime state, financial resources are limited, and not only is it impossible to reduce expenditures, but it is also necessary to raise the necessary funds at any time for emergency payments. In the past year, the difficult situation encountered has been deeply felt to be like living through a year in a day, and it is not easy to cope with. The difficulties that will be encountered in the future will surely exceed those of the first half of the year by far. Fortunately, the actual burden on citizens is lighter than before the war. In the future, wise citizens will surely understand the actual financial difficulties of the city and provide full cooperation, which is the great fortune of those who are in charge.
