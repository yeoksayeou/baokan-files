### Japanese Soldiers, Survivors, Discuss the Bloody Battle of Okinawa

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Lieutenant Colonel Naomichi Kami and Captain Hiroji Moriwaki, two officers who were ordered to carry out the final special attack during the Battle of Okinawa, bid farewell to their comrades on the night of the attack, escaped from the island, and returned to the Japanese mainland. This is truly a miraculous survival. Recently, the two brave soldiers met with a group of reporters from Imperial General Headquarters to discuss their experiences fighting to the death for eighty days in Okinawa, as follows:

### Lieutenant Colonel Kami's Account

During the Okinawa operation, the enemy landed eight divisions, of which seven have already been annihilated by our forces. The strength of my Ushijima unit was small, only a fraction of that of the enemy. What I deeply felt during my participation in the Battle of Okinawa was that the elite individuals and units of the Imperial Army were truly admirable in their strength. For example, in a certain unit at the front line, several severely wounded soldiers were lying at the regimental headquarters. One of them detonated a hand grenade himself, making a heroic self-sacrifice. This kind of heartbreaking scene fully demonstrated the elite nature of the Japanese Army. Whether they chose self-sacrifice or continued to fight for their lives, to the very end, they could not be said to have been defeated in battle. When I left in early June, I did not see a single person who could be considered to have been defeated. Volunteer combat teams also participated in assaults, achieving considerable results. When asked what kind of weapons these troops used, most of them relied heavily on rifles. In difficult situations, they even dismantled the rails used to transport sugarcane on the island and used them to attach to the front of bamboo spears to kill enemies. Whether or not there were weapons on the island was not the issue. All the soldiers and civilians were filled with the spirit of reducing the enemy and fought bloody battles. Furthermore, I personally witnessed something at the Okinawa battle command post. Our single-engine aircraft sank a large battleship three times in a row. The special attack unit led by Lieutenant Hiromori sank ten large ships with ten aircraft. The effectiveness of single-engine aircraft was unexpectedly great. Furthermore, the activity of the students on the island was also inspiring. In particular, the Okinawa Normal School and the First Middle School, for example, a student team bravely advanced one after another, with those following treading over the bodies of their comrades, saying, "I will avenge you!" and charging straight ahead. The Okinawa Women's Normal School was also similar. These schools were able to fully cooperate with the military in combat, which made us extremely grateful.

### Captain Moriwaki's Account

The enemy's tactics did not have a specific strategy. Generally, they would first bombard our positions with hand grenades, then gradually close in. However, our positions suffered very little damage from enemy artillery fire. Before landing, the enemy fleet initially fired from 5,000 meters from the harbor. Seeing that we did not respond, they then approached to 1,000 meters and fired heavily. However, apart from one artillery vehicle being destroyed, our positions suffered no other damage. Therefore, the invading enemy could be repelled. However, the enemy deployed new troops day and night. Although our troops fought continuously day and night without rest, they were forced to retreat gradually. In the end, we had no choice but to consolidate our protruding defense lines. The enemy's naval artillery fire was too dense during the landing to clearly distinguish each shot. After landing, they attacked our positions during the day and bombarded important transportation routes at night. However, very few were hit on the highway, so we were still able to move freely even under enemy fire. More effective than artillery fire was the dive-bombing by giant aircraft, but the time was extremely short, so the movement of a small number of soldiers was still quite unsafe. Observing the enemy's tactics, the lead and second aircraft of each squadron were excellent, while the fifth and sixth aircraft had weak performance and could not dive-bomb, only carrying out horizontal bombing. Our air defense units could shoot at them from the front. After a burst of machine gun fire, the enemy aircraft would respond in formation. Furthermore, regarding enemy tanks, their weakness lay in the personnel on board. As soon as they were hit, they would quickly open the top of the vehicle and jump out to escape. Our troops approached enemy tanks and attacked them, destroying 40 to 50 vehicles every day. Furthermore, enemy tanks always advanced on the same road, so we could aim during the day and attack them at night. When attacking tanks, concentrated artillery fire was most effective. Amphibious tanks could be destroyed with light machine guns. The enemy also used flamethrowers, but we would snipe them down when they approached within 30 meters. When encountering flamethrower attacks, two layers of woolen cloth could be used for protection. Japanese troops trained to charge and kill, if they have sufficient training, will surely be successful, especially on rainy nights.

### Female Students Fight Bravely

To give an example of the bravery of the Japanese soldiers, I once saw soldiers stripped to the waist a few kilometers ahead, opening fire on the enemy under a rain of enemy bullets. Their attitude was calm. Although enemy bullets occasionally fell to the left and right, causing casualties, they did not care. Furthermore, the communication line maintenance soldiers were also extremely brave, fulfilling their duties under a rain of enemy bullets. If weapons were lacking, they would manufacture bombs and hand grenades on the spot and use these self-made, excellent munitions to attack enemy positions. Conversely, although the enemy fired many bullets, most of them were wasted, so the damage to the Japanese troops was minimal. Many residents of Okinawa Prefecture acted together with the military. The Japanese Girls' School in the Nago area initially cared for wounded soldiers in the military and eventually fought to the death alongside the Japanese army. I witnessed a female student caring for wounded soldiers at the front line, but her lower limbs were severely injured by enemy mortar shrapnel. However, she did not forget her duty. Furthermore, a village head on a certain island led all the men in his village to cross over to another island to search for the military unit. When they arrived on the island, they learned that the Japanese army had already withdrawn, causing the village head to panic. However, since things had already come to this, they had no choice but to return to their original island, determined to charge and kill the enemy. The cooking and laundry work for the headquarters of the Japanese army units was done by local women, who gathered green vegetables to supplement their meals amidst flying enemy shells or washed clothes in pools of water next to corpses. Seeing this situation brought tears to one's eyes. Finally, the women declared, "We will also charge and kill the enemy," each holding a hand grenade.

### Over a Thousand Carrier-Based Aircraft Attacked Various Parts of Japan Yesterday; Kii Peninsula Attacked by Naval Gunfire

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A portion of the enemy mobile fleet that dispatched carrier-based aircraft to attack the area west of the Tokai region and the Chugoku and Shikoku regions on the 26th of this month later moved east, approaching the sea south of Kanto. A total of 880 F6F, SB2C, PBF, and other types of carrier-based fighter aircraft invaded Japan from the Suruga Bay and Shizuoka areas around 5:30 AM on the 30th, continuously strafing and bombing airfields and military facilities in the Kanto and Koryo regions. A portion of the enemy aircraft carried out bombing attacks on urban areas in Fukushima, Kanagawa, the southern Izu Peninsula, and the outer Boso Peninsula. In addition, a total of 350 other carrier-based aircraft and P51-type aircraft flying from the Iwo Jima base attacked areas near the front line in waves from 7:30 AM, attacking air bases, transportation facilities, and ships. As of 2:00 PM, the Japanese side had confirmed the destruction of 14 enemy aircraft.

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – At around 8:00 PM on the 29th, a small number of enemy ships shelled the Hamamatsu airfield. Subsequently, from 11:30 PM to 12:05 AM on the 30th, they again carried out naval gunfire attacks on the southeastern coast of the Kii Peninsula.

### Japanese Army Technicians Successfully Research Gun Barrel

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese Army Technician Lieutenant Colonel Seiichi Yamamoto and two others have been working hard to research a simple manufacturing method for the rifling of machine guns and automatic cannon barrels. They have now succeeded, and the Japanese Army Ministry has awarded them a meritorious service award, which was held on the 30th. The rifling is a spiral groove installed inside the barrel, which causes the bullet to rotate as it is fired. This work has always been extremely difficult, requiring special dedicated machinery and skilled workers, and its efficiency is low. It is said that after this method is improved, even manual workers can make it.

### Japanese Army on Samarinda Highway Strives to Prevent Enemy Advance; Five Assault Teams Launch Attack Simultaneously

Southern Front Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Enemy forces in the Balikpapan area began an offensive on the 20th, causing fierce battles to resume. The Japanese garrison is striving to prevent the enemy from advancing on the Samarinda highway and is implementing its successful assault tactics, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties. They are also coordinating with attacks by the Japanese Air Force, causing extreme chaos in the enemy's positions. In particular, on the 24th, five assault teams led by Sergeant Major Ooi launched an attack simultaneously. That night, they made contact with enemy outposts near the Nani Garu airfield, annihilating six of them. They also charged into enemy forces constructing positions in the mountains behind the airfield, killing or wounding approximately 50 enemy soldiers. Subsequently, on the evening of the 25th, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy's Chen 20 kilometers north of the Nani Garu airfield, killing or wounding approximately 20 enemy soldiers and occupying the position. That night, they cut the enemy's power lines in the vicinity, and the entire team returned to defense on the 26th.

### Japanese Army Night Attack in New Guinea

Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – After sweeping up enemy troops in the Mar area on April 28, the Japanese New Guinea northern coast combat unit retook its airfield and positions. From early to mid-May, it has repeatedly raided the airfield, thoroughly striking the enemy forces around it. On the night of the 23rd, it launched a fierce night attack on the remaining enemy troops that continued to act up, inflicting considerable damage on enemy personnel and seizing a considerable amount of provisions.

### Large Explosion Occurs in Ulithi Harbor

Central Pacific Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – From dawn on the 27th for eleven hours, Japanese warships heard continuous large explosions intermittently from the direction of Ulithi Harbor, an enemy base east of Yap Island. It is unknown whether it was caused by an attack by a Japanese submarine or an enemy accident. Judging from the sound of the explosions, Ulithi appears to have suffered considerable damage.

### Japanese Army Counterattacks on Vietnamese Northern Border

Vietnam Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese troops in various areas have launched counterattacks against the Yu army near the northern border of Vietnam, achieving considerable results. Furthermore, elite Japanese troops near the border in the Ba Yang area also launched a daring melee assault on the enemy in that area on the night of the 26th, defeating them.

### Central Party Headquarters Holds Memorial Week

### Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department Broadcasts a Speech on the Reflections of Commemorating the Reception of the Shanghai Concessions

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The 30th marks the second anniversary of China's recovery of the French Concession in Shanghai. Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department broadcasted a speech entitled "Reflections on Commemorating the Reception of the Shanghai Concessions" on the Central Broadcasting Station at 8:20 PM this afternoon, addressing the nation. The original text is recorded as follows:

"Today, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, our country received the French Concession in Shanghai, and then on August 1 of the same year, we received the Shanghai International Settlement. At that time, I was the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and I felt deeply honored to participate in the negotiations. Today is the second anniversary of our country's reception of the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai. I would like to take this opportunity to share some thoughts with my compatriots across the country. Recalling June 30, 1943, when our ally Japan and our country agreed to implement the return of the Shanghai International Settlement on August 1, the late Chairman Wang once said in a speech: 'We will make our best efforts to negotiate with France to ensure that the return of the French Concession in Shanghai can be realized no later than August 1 of this year.' Subsequently, the Chinese and French authorities signed the official agreement to return the French Concession in Shanghai in the capital on July 22 of the same year, setting the date of return for July 30 of the same year. Thus, in the enthusiastic anticipation of the people of the whole country, this memorable and celebratory day finally arrived. Today, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the French authorities officially returned the French Concession in Shanghai to our country, and the three words 'French Concession' have forever become a historical term in our country's diplomacy from that day on.

### A Glorious Page in the Last Hundred Years

When our country had just received the French Concession in Shanghai, and then received the International Settlement in Shanghai on August 1 of that year, it can be said that these were the two most glorious events in our country in the last hundred years. Since Shanghai had concessions, our country has suffered from territorial division and incomplete sovereignty, because the meaning of concessions in international law is called "a state within a state," and the meaning of extraterritoriality in international law is called "an extension of territory." Therefore, as long as concessions and extraterritoriality existed in our country for one day, our country's territorial sovereignty could not be complete for one day. All political and economic matters were affected by the influence of "a state within a state" and by the constraints of "an extension of territory." However, since July 30, 1943, concessions and extraterritoriality have disappeared in our country at the same time, and our country's territory and sovereignty have also become complete at the same time. Now that I think about it, aren't our country's reception of the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai the two most glorious events in our country in the last hundred years?

If it were not for the righteous and devoted assistance of our ally Japan, these two glorious events would certainly not have been realized so easily. Therefore, we are not only grateful to Japan, but also deeply aware of Japan's good intentions to assist our country in achieving freedom and independence. In order to awaken the further understanding of compatriots across the country, I would like to briefly discuss the historical facts.

### Review the Past and Encourage the Future

Recalling a hundred years ago, our country went to war with Britain due to the prohibition of opium imports. As a result, we were defeated in the war and forced to sign a treaty of surrender, which sowed the seeds of the opening of concessions in Shanghai. For the past hundred years, our country has suffered from the poison of concessions. The whole country unanimously and urgently demanded its recovery, and the national revolution of the past few decades also took the recovery of concessions as one of its main goals. However, the national revolution ultimately failed to thoroughly follow the teachings of Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, so it was not only isolated and helpless, but also caused a wall of conflict among the East Asian nations, and a large part of the national strength was consumed in unnecessary conflicts. Thus, the forces of Britain and the United States were able to continue to occupy our country, and the concessions in Shanghai were also under the control of Britain and the United States, making it impossible to recover them. After the incident, the late Chairman Wang led the peace movement, restoring the original appearance of Sino-Japanese relations. Our country is willing to cooperate with Japan to build East Asia, and Japan is more willing to support our country's freedom and liberation. We should have a deep understanding of Japan's great moral spirit and the facts of need, assisting our country in recovering the concessions.

### Conscientiously Follow Sun Yat-sen's Teachings

It has been two years since the reception of the Shanghai concessions, but the question I feel is how to build and revitalize the country. Therefore, we should first review the past. The reason why our country's revitalization and construction work has been slow to succeed in the past is, of course, because it was affected by "a state within a state," but the disunity within our country in the past, which led to the rampant warlords and the communist rebellion, was also the main reason why our country's revitalization and construction cause was difficult to complete. Therefore, today, while we are celebrating this glorious day, we must also eradicate the roots of past disasters and open up a great road to national construction for the future. To achieve this goal, compatriots across the country have no other way to follow except to thoroughly believe in the Three Principles of the People. Moreover, compatriots across the country should also know that the Three Principles of the People, hand-drafted by Sun Yat-sen, are different from any other doctrine. The Three Principles of the People are purely based on our country's history and geographical environment, and were carefully studied and formed. Any other doctrine may be suitable in other countries, but when applied to China, there are many incompatible places, and therefore it is definitely not enough to solve China's problems. The Three Principles of the People is a doctrine of national salvation. That sentence may sound empty to a few people who lack self-confidence, but the facts can prove that today, the only thing that can truly save China from danger and destruction is the Three Principles of the People. Without the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle of our national revolution, the national revolution is blind. Without the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle of national construction, national construction is also unsuccessful.

Although our country has embarked on the path of independence and autonomy with the assistance of our ally Japan, how can we ensure independence and autonomy in the future, and how can we establish a strong country, and unite with the nations of the world on an equal footing to maintain world peace? It goes without saying that we must thoroughly believe in the Three Principles of the People and ensure the Three Principles of the People. When the Three Principles of the People are fully realized, it will be the time when China is truly saved and as solid as a rock.

### The Whole Country Rises Up to Meet the Crisis

However, in today's severe situation, it is really a critical moment for our country to strive for revitalization. Compatriots across the country must always keep in mind the words that Chairman Chen has shown us: No matter what country wants to survive or wants to revitalize, the most reliable way is to rely on itself. It also says that in order to seek liberation and to seek the true independence and freedom of the country, we need not only patience, but also unity; not only perseverance, but also advancement. China is now in a crisis on all sides. If we do not work hard, we will either be completely communized, or we will be reduced to a British or American colony again. If this is the case, then the National Government's efforts over the years to abolish unequal treaties, recover concessions, and abolish extraterritoriality will all be defeated. Therefore, the people of the whole country should immediately rise up, demand full peace, use the total strength of the whole country to eradicate the red disaster, and eliminate the British and American forces in China. I hope that compatriots across the country will abide by and implement them in order to pass through the difficulties and embark on revitalization.

Therefore, today, as we commemorate the reception of the Shanghai concessions, we should not only feel grateful for the glory of the last hundred years, but also review ourselves, spur ourselves on, follow national policies, correct our thinking, ensure security, increase production, and continue to work hard in accordance with the points that Chairman Chen has instructed us, so as to carry forward this glory of the last hundred years, strive for more glorious results for the country, and make greater contributions.

Editorial

### Practicing Benevolence as the Wealthy

In May of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Welfare Association, to assist the authorities in improving police treatment, established a police consumer cooperative, raising 10,000,000 yuan in funds. The association solicited loans from various trade associations and enthusiastic individuals, marking the beginning of collaboration between officials and the public. At that time, this newspaper's editorials repeatedly elaborated on its significance and appealed to all sectors to provide loans. Subsequently, many trade associations and individuals were genuinely helpful, but there were also many who remained hesitant and perfunctory, so that it took months to reach the full amount, only reaching about 40%. This shows that most wealthy citizens have a weak sense of public welfare. Conversely, those with a weak sense of public welfare inevitably value private interests, competing and pursuing nothing but personal profit, so that society is full of speculation, hoarding, and opportunistic practices. In recent years, only Shanghai society has been the most chaotic, which is by no means accidental. At the time, people thought that providing loans was equivalent to making donations. Now, the authorities have agreed to repay the principal and interest in full, and payments will begin today. The authorities' adherence to their word is admirable, especially given the old habits of officialdom, where successors often disavow the accounts of their predecessors. At the same time, it can provide a clear message to those who were stingy in the past, thinking that loans were donations.

Not long ago, the municipal government issued temporary relief bonds, a third of which was also allocated to various trade associations and enthusiastic individuals for subscription. The purpose of these bonds, everyone understood, was undoubtedly for public welfare. However, some trade associations still only partially subscribed or did not meet the full amount. Despite repeated extensions, they still delayed payment, which is regrettable. Of the relief bonds, 200,000,000 yuan were originally designated for air raid relief funds. However, with the current urgent need for disaster relief and funds, the president of the Citizens' Welfare Association, Wen Guanting, and the vice president, Li Sihao, have taken the lead in finding ways to advance the 130,000,000 yuan of unsubscribed relief bonds. It is hoped that trade associations that have not yet paid in full will no longer delay and will promptly pay up within the deadline. Moreover, subscribing to relief bonds will allow for the return of both principal and interest in the future (the first period has already been announced for interest payment), which is different in nature from making donations. Currently, donations for disaster relief are very enthusiastic, so subscribing to relief bonds can both provide relief to disaster victims and recover the principal and interest. We believe that trade associations that have not yet paid in full will be able to make every effort to jointly contribute to this good cause.

Recently, everyone has sympathized with the displaced and suffering air raid victims. The public is assisting the authorities in carrying out relief and rescue work. Both relief and rescue require a large amount of funding. In addition to government allocations, it is especially hoped that individuals will voluntarily donate. The amount of donations received by this newspaper on behalf of donors in recent days is not large, but the number of donating units is very high, which is quite encouraging. However, although donations are very enthusiastic, why is the total amount of donations not very large? Because the donors tend to be those with lower financial capacity, so the amount is small. However, we do not believe that those with higher financial capacity are less enthusiastic about public welfare than others. Therefore, we sincerely hope that merchants and magnates will show compassion and also enthusiastically donate. Then, the total amount of donations can quickly rise. According to the Air Raid Relief Committee's estimate, the first phase of disaster relief funding requires 200,000,000 yuan. After deducting government allocations and donations already received, there is still more than half missing. Assuming it is 100,000,000 yuan, divided into 100 units, each unit is 1,000,000 yuan. If each wealthy merchant donates one unit, then 100 wealthy merchants can solve the problem. According to our estimates, in vast Shanghai, there are more than a thousand people who can donate one unit with one ten-thousandth or one thousandth of their wealth. Then, as long as the wealthy are merciful, the disaster victims can be saved. The wealthy should practice benevolence, and everyone should strive for it.

What we have said above is nothing more than hoping that someone among the citizens will be enthusiastic about social welfare. Finally, we believe that in addition to the government providing compensation to the firefighters, air defense personnel, police, and Baojia personnel who sacrificed or were disabled due to rescue work during air raids, the public should also provide special compensation. The Citizens' Welfare Association's Air Raid Relief Committee advocates using the second phase of donations to replenish fire and air defense funds. We believe that a portion should be allocated as compensation for those injured or killed in the line of duty, as a fair representation of the people.

### Indian Ocean Warplanes Gradually Become Familiar with Japanese Elite, Severely Monitoring Enemy Supply Routes South of Donggua

Central News Agency, Indian Ocean Base, 30th – The enemy mobile unit that appeared in the waters around Phuket Island, southern Thailand, on the 25th of this month continues to stir, but it has been fiercely countered by Japanese forces stationed there, preventing the enemy from landing. On the night of the 26th, it was fiercely attacked by Japanese special attack planes, and a cruiser and a large ship were sunk, eventually moving out of the Japanese attack range. Recently, the enemy announced that the British Eastern Indian Fleet is based on the battleships Queen Elizabeth, Renown, and the French battleship Richelieu, plus seven cruisers and fourteen destroyers. In addition, according to various intelligence reports, there are currently seven or eight fast aircraft carriers in the Indian Ocean, and the enemy fleet that stirred this time is probably a part of it. The enemy's attempt to attack this time is twofold: first, to reconnoiter the strength of the south coast, and second, to alleviate the difficulties of the counterattack in Burma and implement a distraction operation. The enemy is anxious to counterattack Malaya, so it is reconnoitering the Japanese defense positions on the south coast, and trying to alleviate the bitter battles in the Donggua and Bago areas of Burma, and the fierce counterattack of the Japanese army centered on the Xidan River. The elite Japanese land, sea, and air forces are severely monitoring the enemy's movements and are fully confident of destroying the enemy's attack.

Central News Agency, Burmese Front Base, 30th – The elite Japanese troops defending the Begu Yuma Mountains have always held their positions, blocking the enemy's main force, and at the same time attacking the vital supply arteries of the Rangoon and Prome highways, hindering the transport of enemy supplies. This time, they crossed the Sandan River, launched a clever infiltration operation, secured the two fortresses of Nika and Myokyo, and coordinated with the westward-advancing troops to organize a pincer attack system. To severely damage the enemy in the Xidan River basin, they began to advance eastward. On the Burmese highway south of Donggua, they cut off the enemy's supply routes everywhere, causing the enemy to suffer increased losses. The enemy blew up the bridge necessary for transportation at a location fifteen kilometers north of Donggua, and is in extreme chaos. The enemy has made great sacrifices to consolidate the battle situation, avoid the retreat of the 15th Division, newly deploy the 7th Division, and devote its air force strength to assist in the operation. In addition, the Japanese troops fighting against the enemy armored division in the area west of Mokji have switched to the offensive since the 16th of this month, forcibly crossed the Takuet River successfully, and are currently attacking the enemy's important strongholds.

### National Government to Hold Commemorative Ceremony for Restoration Day Tomorrow

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th – August 1st is the second Restoration Day of our country. Recalling that after the National Government moved its capital, thanks to the continuous efforts of the highest authorities and the sincere cooperation of the allied nation Japan, on July 30th and August 1st of the 32nd year, the concessions in Shanghai and other places, which had been used by the powers as bases to exploit East Asia for a hundred years, were all recovered, making our national sovereignty complete again. This is truly a great event in the epoch-making national revolution. The government authorities specifically designated August 1st as Restoration Day. Now that the second session has arrived, the National Government authorities, in order to commemorate this day of great significance in the history of our country's restoration, specifically decided to hold a grand commemorative ceremony in the auditorium of the National Government at 9:00 a.m. on that day. At the same time, all provinces and cities across the country will also launch commemorative events separately.

### Provincial Governor Allocates Funds to Relieve Shanghai Disaster Victims

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 30th – The U.S. aircraft recently carried out continuous indiscriminate bombings of Shanghai, and disaster victims urgently need relief. Enthusiastic people in Suzhou society have already donated 50,000,000 yuan for relief. Now, Governor Ren, in view of the large number of disaster victims in Shanghai, has ordered the finance department to allocate 10,000,000 yuan to be remitted to Shanghai for relief purposes.

### Northern Jiangsu Plans to Rush Repairs to the Canal Embankment

Central News Agency, Yangzhou, 30th – Since the incident, the canal embankment in northern Jiangsu has been damaged due to military influences. Although the water conservancy authorities have paid attention to repairs at any time, its terrain is special, and the New Fourth Army appears and disappears in the area, and often destroys it, making it difficult to repair immediately. Recently, the floodwaters have surged, washing away the built dams, causing the water to be stored to flow down with the floodwaters, and the downstream of the canal embankment will suffer major damage. The Northern Jiangsu Canal Engineering Office has recently drafted a flood control plan for the 34th year, which has been reported to the Northern Jiangsu Appeasement Office for review and handling, in order to carry out timely prevention and repair and avoid flooding.

### Zhejiang Province Rectifies Water Transportation

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th – Zhejiang Province's water transportation has been hampered by frequent wars, which has had a profound impact on transportation, logistics, and local prosperity. Governor Liao, in view of this, based on the recommendations of the Provincial Advisory Committee, ordered the relevant agencies to focus on reorganizing the five shipping routes of Shanghai-Hangzhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, Shaoxing-Xiaoshan, Hangzhou-Yuqian, and Hangzhou-Fuyang, and ordered the Liji Company to be responsible for handling shipping matters on each route. Zhejiang Province's transportation will become smoother.

### County Police Implement School Training

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th – In order to strengthen the police teams of various counties and unify the organization, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has formulated police training rules for each county, ordering the counties to train the police in various technical subjects in order to improve their overall quality and cultivate them into a strong force to defend the local area.

### Hangzhou Prepares to Purchase Food

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th – In order to prevent the rise in rice prices during the lean season, the Provincial Advisory Committee has formulated a plan to mobilize merchants and people to purchase flour to meet urgent needs, and to raise huge sums of money to order the municipal government to organize a procurement agency with the municipal chamber of commerce to carry out procurement work. After being submitted to the provincial government for approval, various tasks will begin.

### Potsdam Conference to Conclude Soon, Details of Discussions Cannot Be Ascertained

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 30th – According to a report from the British correspondent in Berlin: The end of the Potsdam Conference is imminent. Although there is no official confirmation, informed circles in Berlin firmly believe that everything discussed at the conference will be completed by Tuesday or Wednesday. At the same time, it is possible that the speeches to be delivered at the final meeting have already been drafted. The conference was in progress yesterday and achieved satisfactory results, but the detailed contents of the discussions among the three heads of state cannot be ascertained. The three leaders have held twelve meetings, but at each meeting, no true content of the meeting was revealed. The joint declaration on Japan by the United States, Britain, and Chongqing has nothing to do with the three-power conference, because the Soviet Union does not want to declare war on Japan. If it is intended to be published before the end of the conference, there is no strong basis for a communique on the Asian war. The topics of the conference do not involve military matters. According to a Soviet Communist Party newspaper, "The future of Germany is the main topic of the Potsdam Conference." According to the diplomatic correspondent of the London Sunday Newspaper, the new British Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin, both believe that the Labour Party government has just been established, and it is inconvenient to participate in the decision of various major issues in the meeting. Therefore, they may ask Truman and Stalin to allow other major issues to be postponed until the second half of the year for further discussion.

### Ministry of Social Welfare Records National Exercise Method

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th – In the past, in order to make it easier for the general public to exercise, the Ministry of Social Welfare created a National Leisure Exercise Method. Now, in order to enable all localities to practice from time to time, experts have been hired to record a large number of exercise records, which will be distributed to radio stations in various places for broadcasting in the shortest possible time, so that the public can exercise according to law and enhance their physique.

### War-Weariness in Britain and the United States

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th – After the news of the Labour Party's victory in Britain came out, all parties felt surprised. However, in view of the current situation at the end of the European war and the imminent end of the world war, this phenomenon is not surprising. This is because the British people have suffered from six years of war and are extremely tired. During the war, the British people could only expect and look forward to how to rebuild their personal safe lives. Therefore, Churchill, the Conservative Party who adhered to British imperialism, was far less attractive than the Labour Party, who advocated stable people's livelihood, solving housing problems, and guaranteeing employment. In short, the British people's vote this time was not for Churchill, nor for Attlee, but for the Labour Party's program of stable life. From this, it can be seen that the British people are concerned and worried that the war will be prolonged, and it is also a fact that the British army does not want to go to war in East Asia. In this general election, about 70% of the soldiers on the front lines voted for the Labour Party, which guaranteed post-war employment, which is also a very noteworthy phenomenon. As for the United States, its desire to achieve peace is no less than that of Britain, and the momentum to transform military demand into civilian demand is particularly significant. The recent food famine in the United States has especially made the general public dissatisfied. When American people received the news that the U.S. military in Okinawa suffered heavy casualties, they sighed that it was not worth the loss to mobilize the main force of the Pacific Fleet and dispatch a large number of army troops to capture a small isolated island, and it took three months, which led to the responsibility issue of Nimitz. Recently, the United States has also revealed the argument of peace conditions with Japan, and the reason is only to end the East Asian war as soon as possible. Therefore, the governments of Britain and the United States, in view of the unanimous surging of the domestic peace trend, had to seek countermeasures urgently to avoid their bloodshed and sacrifice. The release of the joint declaration on Japan by the three countries on the 28th is also a reflection of domestic demands.

### British New Parliament Adjourned

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 30th – According to London: The date for the convening of the British new parliament has been decided to be postponed to August 15th. The King will deliver a speech on that day.

### Morrison to Act as British Prime Minister

Central News Agency – According to TASS, London: Reuters reported that information revealed by the Prime Minister's Office on the evening of July 28 stated that during Prime Minister Attlee's stay in Potsdam for the Three-Headed Conference, government affairs will be handled by the President of the Privy Council, Morrison.

### German Army Lost Over Four Million in Five Years of War

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 30th – According to a British reporter in Berlin, a very important secret document was found in the official residence of General Rinnack, the general director of the propaganda movement of the German Supreme Command, which detailed the German military losses from September 1, 1939, to November 30, 1944, as follows:

The total number of German military losses was 4,064,438, of which 1,911,300 died, 1,435,853 were missing, and 278,201 were captured. The numbers of the three do not match the total, but the numbers of the three do not include the German military losses from November of last year to May of this year. At the same time, the secret document also stated that in November of last year, 774,148 injured German soldiers were still recuperating in hospitals. Also, when fighting on the German border front line, 64,000 German soldiers were killed by Allied aircraft, 1,000 were missing, and about 9,000 were executed for violating military law.

### British Eighth Army Ordered to Dissolve

Central News Agency, Berne, 30th – According to information obtained here: Official news from Rome stated that the British Eighth Army was officially ordered to dissolve at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The army had fought in North Africa, Sicily, and the Italian mainland.

### Pétain Continues to be Tried, Implicating Laval, Witnesses Give Testimony

Central News Agency, Berne, 30th – According to Paris: The trial of Marshal Pétain began today. Many of the witnesses' testimonies involved former Vichy leader Laval, who is currently in Spain and cannot immediately appear in court. According to Duen, former chairman of the German armistice agreement committee in Wiesbaden, France, "Laval is truly a lowly degenerate." According to Blum, "Laval is the one who played the trick of the Vichy regime." According to Rocks, "Laval did his best to promote discord between Britain and France." According to a female witness (35 years old, named Denise Bettite, secretary to an instructor in an Italian newspaper in Paris until 1941): "Laval's intention was to form an alliance of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain to replace the current United Nations." Laval is currently detained in the Mentqueuy forest in Barcelona. Laval resided there when Germany collapsed. It is claimed that Laval went to Spain and asked the Spanish authorities for protection after the French authorities refused to protect his safety, so that he would not be tried in Paris at the same time as Pétain.

Authorities Deeply Hope Citizens will Assist in Reorganizing Traffic, Designating Every Wednesday as Traffic Safety Day

In order to reorganize traffic order in all districts of the city, improve citizens' traffic ethics, thoroughly abide by the rules, and reduce traffic accidents, the Municipal Police Department, in conjunction with the Allied military authorities and Baojia personnel, implemented a Traffic Reorganization Strengthening Week from the 25th to the 31st. Thanks to the cooperation of the military police and citizens, the results were satisfactory. The Second Division of the Municipal Police Department, in view of the fact that today is the last day of Traffic Reorganization Week, held a symposium for the city's news media at the club on the seventh floor of the bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Chief Hiraoka of the Second Division was unable to attend due to official duties, and Police Chief Kobayashi attended on behalf of him, along with Traffic Section Chief Chen Shutong, Deputy Section Chief Yoshino Sakae, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers.

### Chief Kobayashi's Speech

During the meeting, Chief Kobayashi delivered a speech on behalf of Chief Hiraoka, stating that the city's traffic situation is chaotic and disorderly due to the increase in vehicles and the fact that drivers, coachmen, and the general public treat the current traffic management regulations as mere formalities, competing to be first. Once an emergency occurs, traffic accidents and citizen injuries are inevitable. Therefore, taking advantage of the opportunity to announce the Land Traffic Management Regulations, a Reorganization Strengthening Week was implemented to increase people's awareness of traffic control. Looking back on the week, with the active cooperation of the Allied Army and Navy authorities, the Police Department authorities, and Baojia personnel, the results were satisfactory, but still did not meet our ideal goals. The focus of this week's implementation is to strictly observe left-hand traffic and absolutely obey traffic command signals. For a week, military police personnel have been serving enthusiastically, organizing traffic on various roads, but the general public still does not pay attention to traffic light signals, drivers stop beyond the stop line, and pedestrians arbitrarily cross the road. These situations easily cause accidents and lead to chaos. It is hoped that citizens will actively assist in reorganizing traffic for the sake of their own safety and the safety of others, to achieve the goal of safe traffic. At the same time, it is stipulated that every Wednesday is Traffic Safety Day, and vehicles and pedestrians who do not obey the rules will be strictly punished. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will pay attention and cooperate.

### Traffic Section Chief's Report

Traffic Section Chief then reported on the city's vehicle situation, stating that the number of motor vehicles in the city is currently more than 5,000 less than five years ago, and the number of trucks is 1,600 less, but the number of manual rickshaws, tricycles, and bicycles has greatly increased, reaching more than 9,000. Because the areas have been merged, the driving area is concentrated, so in addition to implementing training for traffic police, their level and equipment have also been improved.

Deputy Section Chief Yoshino reported that the number of traffic police has decreased compared to the past, and efforts are being made to improve their quality and restore the use of whistles. At the same time, the Traffic Section is in contact with the Construction Bureau to draw very clear traffic standard signs on various roads to facilitate traffic.

Finally, reporters from various newspapers raised issues such as restoring one-way traffic on narrow roads, strictly prohibiting two people from riding bicycles, and vendors on sidewalks for discussion. The Traffic Section will investigate in detail and then make improvements. The discussion ended at around 5:00 p.m.

### Five Groups Scheduled to Bid Farewell to Director Matsudaira and Welcome New Director Katsuno

### Responding to Wartime Material Conservation The *Guomin Xinwen* Newspaper to Cease Publication Automatically

The *Guomin Xinwen* newspaper, in order to adapt to the needs of the times, expanded from a small newspaper to a large daily newspaper on February 28, 1941. It has been four years and five months since then. In these short years, it has conveyed faint calls for the belief of "nation-building." Although it has gone through many hardships, thanks to the guidance and encouragement of Chairman Zhou and the love of readers, it has been able to overcome difficulties and complete a part of the arduous task of publicizing national policies and inspiring morale. However, recently, due to the lack of both financial and material resources, in order to respond to the wartime policy of conserving materials, it has decided to cease publication from August 1st, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Zhou, and to reserve the saved financial, material, and human resources for future use. Once resources are abundant and there is a need from all parties, it will resume publication at any time to serve the country and society again.

### A Wealthy Man's Act of Kindness: A Struggling Student Smiles Through Tears Awaits Support for Difference in Scholarship

For nearly a month, our colleagues have been handling all the procedures for scholarship assistance, and they are generally in order. More than 3,600 returning students, plus more than 3,000 new students, have reviewed the registration lists of students at all levels in each school. The lists are indeed a grand sight. Many of these promising young people will surely be talented individuals in the future and pillars of the new China. Unfortunately, they are all impoverished children who have suffered through eight years of war and are oppressed by high prices, making their living conditions impossible to cope with. This is such a pitiful and painful thing!

### The Owner of Jingming Hall Borrows Money to Help Students Creates the Highest Scholarship Record of This Year

The owner of Jingming Hall, over sixty years old, has lived a frugal life and supported himself through his own efforts without property. Recently, seeing that the scholarship fund for this year's applicants is far from the target, he expressed his infinite sympathy and offered his years of hard-earned private savings, mortgaging 20,000,000 yuan to donate to our newspaper's charity medical team, setting the highest record for this year. His enthusiasm and righteous deeds are truly admirable. It is hoped that wealthy gentlemen in Shanghai will follow the owner's virtues and generously donate so that this year's scholarship fund will reach its target early and not fall short of success.

The scholarship work carried out by this newspaper over the years aims, first and foremost, to rescue this large group of lovely young people from adverse circumstances, to sift gold from the sand, and to present them to the wealthy and compassionate people of Shanghai. It is hoped that everyone will think of the country and the nation, donate a few more coins, contribute a little more effort, and take on the responsibility of cultivation to fulfill the greatest obligation to the next generation of citizens. Now, the registration lists have been prepared, and a strict examination will be held at Datong University on News Road on August 5th to eliminate the weak and retain the strong, selecting 4,000 students to continue their hard studies. However, the scholarship fund of 350,000,000 yuan is still far from the target, even after a month. How will the enthusiastic gentlemen take action to prevent them from worrying like fire? How will they lend a hand to make them smile through their tears? Dear sirs, time is of the essence! Do not wait and see, do not delay, this is what our colleagues earnestly wish for readers.

Please each school quickly submit the application forms - This office checks that each University, college, high school, middle school, and elementary school still has a small number of schools that has not sent the old and new student application to the center, causing an inability to register. The screening and test will be on August 5 at the Xinwen Road Datong University, and the date is close. Each school must submit the forms by 5PM today (31st). Late submissions will not be accommodated.

### Notice on the Re-issuance of Residence Permits for Citizens in Newly Merged Areas

The six newly merged areas of this city, namely, Penglai, Yimiao, Xieqiao, Xujiahui, Zhabei, and Dongchang (One Five and Two Joint Guarantee), are now nearing completion of the population census. The Baojia Department of the Municipal Police Bureau has specially set August 1 as the date to begin the re-issuance of residence permits for the above six districts. At that time, citizens should comply with the notices from their respective sub-bureaus and joint guarantee offices and go to their respective sub-bureaus to have their fingerprints taken on the specified dates. The following is a detailed notice on the re-issuance of residence permits after revisions:

All citizens between the ages of 12 and 60 must apply for a residence permit in accordance with these regulations. (Citizens who are not within the specified age range may also apply for a residence permit at the same time in accordance with these regulations if they voluntarily wish to obtain one.)

[Residence permit application forms can be purchased by residents from their respective Baojia offices (to recover the cost of printing).]

The fourth section of each sub-bureau must first schedule the dates and times for fingerprinting of each *bao* according to the numerical order of the *baojia*, and when issuing the application forms, notify the *lianbao* chief to bring the notice to each citizen through the *bao* chief, *jia* chief, and head of household, so that they go to the sub-bureau to have their fingerprints taken on schedule.

[After a citizen purchases a residence permit application form, they should use a writing brush and regular script to clearly fill in the number on the old citizen certificate and all the items to be filled in on the application form, affix a seal, and ask the head of household and *jia* chief to affix their seals. Enclose a handling fee of 100 yuan and two bareheaded 2.5-inch photos. (Those who have already obtained a citizen certificate from the sub-bureau are exempt from submitting photos unless their photos are damaged.) The citizen must also, in accordance with the regulations of the sub-bureau, have the *jia* chief accompany them to the fourth section of the sub-bureau to have their fingerprints taken simultaneously on the application form and the blank residence permit, so that the blank residence permit is filled in with the same number as on the application form and the receipt for the handling fee, in order to avoid errors.]

The fourth section of each sub-bureau shall, based on the items on the fingerprint-marked application form, retrieve the old application form, verify that there are no errors, and then fill in the residence permit and process the photo pasting, registration, and hard seal affixing procedures.

After the fourth section of each sub-bureau has completed all the procedures for the residence permit, it shall send them in batches to the respective military police teams for stamping, and at the same time, it shall submit the number of people sent for stamping each time to the Baojia Department for record. During the period when the fourth section of each sub-bureau is processing the issuance of residence permits, in addition to assigning special personnel to the sub-bureaus for supervision and inspection, the fourth section of each sub-bureau must also fill in a "Residence Permit Daily Report" in the prescribed format and submit it to the department for verification.

After the fourth section of each sub-bureau receives the newly issued residence permits, it shall schedule the dates and times, divided by *bao* and *jia*, and notify the *lianbao jia* chiefs to inform each household, and the head of each household shall collect the old citizen certificates of all citizens in their household and go to the fourth section of the sub-bureau on the specified date to exchange for the new residence permits and distribute them to each citizen for use.

Citizens who have newly moved into the area and citizens from other ports who have come to Shanghai must provide a movement certificate, travel permit, good citizen certificate, county citizen certificate, or other documents issued by the authorities at the place of departure. If they do not have the above-mentioned supporting documents, they must find a guarantor from a shop or two people with the qualifications of a head of household to act as guarantors before they can apply. They must also enclose two photos and a handling fee of 100 yuan. The remaining procedures are the same as the general procedures.

If a citizen who has completed the application procedures loses their old citizen certificate before the residence permit is issued, they must immediately report to the fourth section of the sub-bureau and find a guarantor from a shop or two people with the qualifications of a head of household to provide proof, and submit two additional 2.5-inch photos and a handling fee of 500 yuan to apply to the fourth section of the sub-bureau for issuance.

Citizens who are indeed ill, pregnant women who are about to give birth, or who are in the puerperal period must ask the *baojia* chief to provide proof, and the fourth section of the sub-bureau may separately schedule a date to apply for the re-issuance of the residence permit.

### Enthusiastic Individuals from All Walks of Life Responding to Disaster Relief

A letter from the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange's Accounting Department states: "Recently, our city has been frequently subjected to air raids, and the disaster area is extensive. We, the staff, are heartbroken by what we have witnessed and feel deeply distressed. Therefore, we are donating 500,000 National Currency units as a token contribution to air raid relief. However, considering the large number of victims and the perceived lack of treatment facilities, we feel that even minor injuries can lead to death due to a lack of timely first aid, which is a great pity. The most urgently needed thing at present is general first aid knowledge. However, there are very few publications of this kind. We hope that the relevant authorities will pay attention to and promote this issue, or invite experienced doctors to compile a small handbook on 'First Aid Medical Knowledge,' detailing first aid methods, main medications, and their usage, and make them publicly available so that citizens can use them at any time to reduce mortality, which would be of considerable benefit. Therefore, without being ashamed of our ignorance, we contribute our humble opinion, hoping that the authorities will adopt it."

A letter from the staff of the Hongkou Branch of the Shanghai Telegraph General Bureau states: "Recently, the Shanghai urban area has been repeatedly bombed, resulting in a wide disaster area. The affected compatriots have suffered broken families, death, and displacement, the tragic situation is self-evident. We, the staff, are heartbroken by what we have witnessed and cannot bear to stand idly by. Furthermore, we believe that providing relief to the disaster victims is a matter of utmost urgency. Therefore, all staff members have contributed to the best of their abilities, collectively raising 350,000 National Currency units, which are respectfully offered as a donation for disaster relief. We hope that all institutions, companies, and commercial firms will respond enthusiastically, contributing whatever effort and money they can, so that small contributions can accumulate into great achievements, and small amounts of sand can build up into a tower. This would truly be a blessing for the bombed compatriots."

A letter from the staff of Lao Jie Fu Silk and Satin Store states: "Our city has been bombed for several consecutive days, and the disaster situation is severe. We, the staff, are heartbroken by what we have witnessed and cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, we have raised 622,000 National Currency units. Please accept them and promptly forward them to the relief agencies, we hope." Also, Mr. Gao Guosong, a barber at Lao Jie Fu Barber Shop, wrote that he saw the city suffered continuous air raids, which caused severe disasters, and he couldn't bear to see such a tragic scene. He specifically donated 30,000 National Currency units earned from barbering during the week from July 23rd to July 29th to the affected compatriots, expressing his sympathy.

A letter from Mr. Fu Tiren states: "Yesterday was my twelfth birthday, and my father rewarded me with 100,000 yuan. I didn't dare to waste it and wanted to do something valuable to commemorate the occasion. Recently, our city has been continuously subjected to air raids, and the casualties are so tragic that I cannot bear to witness or hear about them. Therefore, I am sending this 100,000 yuan to your institution as air raid relief money. The small amount is just a token of my heartfelt feelings. Please accept it."

### Shanghai's Rapid Infant Home Fundraising

The Shanghai Fu You Infant Home has been established for four years, housing more than 1,200 orphaned children since its establishment. Currently, there are still more than 300 children in the home, and it has been supported by people from all walks of life, allowing for both education and nurturing. However, with the rising prices and the need for evacuation, maintenance costs are required after the relocation.
