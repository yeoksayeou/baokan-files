### Of Unprecedented Significance: Japan Convenes Extraordinary Diet, House of Peers Passes Rescript Reply

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – In light of the increasing gravity of the war situation, necessitating extraordinary measures for the impending homeland决战, the Japanese government, after seeking imperial sanction, convened the 87th Extraordinary Diet on the designated day, which possesses unprecedented significance. It was also decided to continue the sessions on the 9th and 10th. Among the legislative bills submitted by the Japanese government in this Diet are the Wartime Emergency Measures Act, the National Volunteer Corps Act, and other important bills. The Wartime Emergency Measures Act, in particular, aims to empower the government to exercise its authority at any time based on extraordinary measures, strengthening military production, increasing food production, implementing war disaster countermeasures, and reinforcing transportation and communication—urgent measures currently needed. The Diet is to grant the government full authority. The introduction of this bill is a legislative measure with the same effect as the “extraordinary powers under Article 31 of the Constitution” recently advocated by various parties, and the government hopes the Diet will unanimously approve it.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese House of Peers convened the 87th Extraordinary Diet on the 8th. The inaugural session was held at 10:07 AM. After all the formalities were completed, the House of Representatives convened at 1:32 PM, nominating Mr. Yoda and Mr. Katsuyama as candidates for Speaker and Deputy Speaker, respectively, awaiting the continuation of the session. In the evening, both houses jointly convened, and the opening ceremony will be held on the 9th.

### Imperial Address at the Opening Ceremony

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – His Imperial Majesty the Emperor, on the occasion of the opening ceremony of the 87th Extraordinary Session of the Imperial Diet, bestowed the following address:

"We hereby hold the opening ceremony of the Imperial Diet and inform you, members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, that our loyal and brave army and navy officers and men, united in heart and strength, are diligently thwarting powerful enemies. Our loyal one hundred million subjects are braving war and enduring hardships, diligently fulfilling their responsibilities in the rear, and the alliance with our friendly nations is becoming ever stronger, which We find deeply gratifying. Recently, the global situation has changed rapidly, and the enemy's aggression has become exceedingly rampant. Now is the time to crush the enemy's extravagant ambitions and achieve the goals of our war, thereby demonstrating the essence of our unity. We trust in the loyalty and bravery of you all to share our hardships, hoping to restore and glorify the heritage of our ancestors. We have instructed the Minister of State to submit to the Imperial Diet urgent bills concerning the current situation. We urge you to embody Our will, deliberate harmoniously, and diligently fulfill your duty to cooperate."

### Japanese Prime Minister's Speech at the Diet

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Suzuki delivered a policy address today at the plenary sessions of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, the content of which is as follows:

"Today, at the opening ceremony of the Diet, We received an Imperial Address, for which We are overwhelmed with reverence and gratitude. I wish to join with all of you in abiding by the Imperial will to reassure His Majesty. Previously, enemy aircraft attacked, and fires occurred at the Imperial Palace and the Omiya Imperial Residence, for which We, as subjects, are deeply apprehensive. Fortunately, Their Majesties and the Imperial Family are all safe and sound, and His Majesty the Emperor continues to attend to affairs of state within the Imperial Palace, which is indeed a great blessing. Today, the Japanese Empire is facing an unprecedented crisis since its founding. Although we have made every effort, the war situation is gradually intensifying. Okinawa Island, a corner of our homeland, has already been invaded by the enemy. In the Battle of Okinawa, our army and navy fought bravely as one, and the officials and people cooperated and dared to resist, repeatedly inflicting damage on the stubborn enemy. This loyalty and righteousness will surely be recorded in history for all time, and I express my deepest respect. However, the current situation in Okinawa is deeply concerning. As things stand, other parts of the homeland may soon be invaded by the enemy as well. At this time, all one hundred million compatriots should unite in heart and strength to deal with this grave situation. The Greater East Asia War, as clearly stated in the declaration of war, was undertaken by our country due to the tyrannical attitude and unreasonable ambitions of the United States and Great Britain, which threatened the survival of our nation. The Empire was compelled to take this step for the sake of its own survival and independence, and for the sake of maintaining its responsibility for the stability of East Asia and the fruits of its efforts. In the world, none loves peace and desires the welfare of humanity more than His Majesty the Emperor. Allowing all nations to return to their rightful places, and enabling all peoples to understand the principles of humanity and advance culture, has been the fundamental aspiration of the Imperial Family since the founding of the nation. However, due to the injustice of Great Britain and the United States, the aforementioned national policies could not be carried out. In other words, the Empire's war is based on the great justice of humanity and must be pursued to the end. Although the warring nations may use clever words and embellish their reasons, upon close examination, they are nothing more than the product of human weaknesses – the base emotions of jealousy. We hear that the enemy is now demanding our unconditional surrender. To do so would be to destroy our national polity and eradicate our people. We have no choice but to fight to the end to preserve the Empire's self-preservation and self-defense. Today, the Republic of China, Manchuria, and the nations of Greater East Asia have concluded alliances with our country and are contributing to the war, for which the Empire is deeply grateful. This war is a war of liberation against the enslavement of East Asia by Great Britain and the United States. If the war is lost, the peoples of East Asia will forever lose their freedom, and world justice will be completely 受　　. The Empire pledges to stand united with its allied nations to the end. The Empire's fundamental policies regarding the Greater East Asia and world order are to ensure the dignity and prosperity of all nations under the principles of political equality, economic mutual benefit, and respect for indigenous cultures, and to establish a path to security that does not threaten or invade. From this perspective, the Empire supports the unification and national salvation aspirations of the Republic of China, and further desires to promote prosperity with neutral nations.　If the homeland becomes a battlefield, we will be a million times more victorious due to the advantages of terrain and the unity of the people. In other words, at that time, we will be able to concentrate our fire forces at necessary locations, and military supply will also be easier. This will be very different from previous battles. At that time, we are confident that we will defeat the enemy and crush their intentions. At this critical stage of the war, the situation within our country, in terms of food, cannot be said to be sufficient in the future. There are also concerns about a lack of smooth transportation. As for military production, its difficulties are also increasing daily. However, if the entire nation can fight bravely and exert every effort to defend their respective positions, I am confident that we will overcome the difficulties and achieve the goals of the war. Observing the trends in enemy nations and the direction of the international situation, we are all painfully aware that we have no choice but to fight to the end. There is no other path to follow. It is on this conviction that I have been instructed to form a cabinet. Although the work is arduous, I deeply appreciate the cooperation of the people in dedicating themselves to serving the public. I have requested the convocation of this Diet and submitted various bills, and I pray that you will promptly deliberate on them."

### Xicheng Worries About the People Following Blindly; The Inside Story of Xiantiandao (1)

— Yu Yu

The Origin of Xiantiandao

The emergence of Xiantiandao (Way of Former Heaven) has a long history, but it only emerged in the Jiangnan area last year at the end of the year. Ni, who has been living in Hengshantang at Shanmenkou, Wuxi for a long time, is affiliated with the Tongshan Company within the Xixian County Security Team. He is over thirty years old. Before the incident, he worked in the circulation department of a newspaper and later managed accounts for the wealthy Zhu Meijie in the township. According to Ni's confession, he initiated Xiantiandao due to a stimulus. He was kidnapped by the bandit Zhou Dongqin's troops and, after being attacked, he thought of revenge. He was originally a member of the Tongshan Society, having been a member for eleven years, which is how he knew Xu Cuichu. He told Xu about his experience and his intention to seek revenge, and Xu also deeply suffered from the exploitation of bandits, expressing sympathy. At that time, they heard that the Xiantiandao had great influence in Beijing and Shandong, and that after joining the sect, one could become invulnerable to swords and spears. Therefore, they decided to seek the Tao and, in November of last year, they traveled with five others to Jinan, Shandong. Through the introduction of Zhang Zhixian, a Xiantiandao liaison, they met Jiang Hongtao, the leader of the sect. Xu and Ni explained their intentions and strongly requested Jiang Hongtao's assistance. At that time, Jiang sent teacher Bian Shicang and assistant Liang Jianqing to return to Ansuo Township, Xixian with Xu and Ni to begin preaching.

Setting up Lectures and Reviewing Skills

Initially, they were strictly secretive, calling it the "Xiantiandao Buddha Power Protection Association," meaning to use Buddha power to protect their hometown. When it was launched, there were very few members, only a few dozen, later increasing to more than two hundred. The methods of preaching were divided into two types: one was setting up lectures, and the other was teaching martial arts. When teaching martial arts, the teacher first used a knife to cut three times on his wrist to prove that he was invulnerable to swords and spears. In reality, the knife was very blunt, and the force used was very light. The villagers did not notice and, seeing a slight effect, believed it to be true. Thus, one person told ten, and ten told a hundred, spreading widely. Soon, the number of Dao followers joining the sect increased sharply to two thousand.

The weapons they used were broadswords and long spears. They wore a black cloth on their heads and a short black shirt with dense buttons. When performing martial arts, they first paid respects in front of the hall, chanting incantations. The spell was "Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper, everyone walks under the pen, divine soldiers go down, sever the black dragon's head." After chanting, they widened their eyes, brandished their weapons, and shouted "Kill! Kill! Kill!" like madmen, advancing forward.

Rules and Sacrifices

According to the locals, Xiantiandao also had rules. After joining the sect, one must eliminate all evil thoughts, "do not engage in adultery, theft, or evil, do not deceive the world and reduce ancestors, do not pass on the Tao to bandits, do not covet ill-gotten wealth," otherwise the magic would be ineffective. Therefore, everyone followed the rules and regulations, creating a phenomenon of "not picking up lost items on the road, and not closing doors at night." The method of joining the sect was to be introduced by two members, regardless of gender, and to worship the preacher as their teacher. While silently reciting the names of the deities, they used yellow paper and vermillion ink to draw a talisman, which was burned in front of the deity. The ashes were then ordered to be swallowed by the recipient of the ceremony, claiming that from then on, they would be permanently protected by the deities in secret, and would be invulnerable to swords and spears.

The Xiantiandao sacrifices were very simple. A hall was set up, with incense and candles on the platform, but no fruit or tin foil was offered. According to Zhang Zhixian, the representative of the Beizhou Jing side of the sect, "Fuxi" was enshrined as the ancestral society of the former heaven, and "King Wen" was the ancestral society of the latter heaven. Other deities such as Lao Tzu were also important deities. Because Fuxi created the Eight Trigrams, creating heaven and earth and indicating the mechanism of the former heaven; King Wen established the Book of Changes, established rituals, and invented the way of the latter heaven and the path of later life; as for Lao Tzu, because he passed the Hangu Pass and wrote a "Tao Te Ching" with Guan Yin, it was "mysterious and mysterious," making it "the gate of all mysteries" for the Xiantiandao. However, it was different in the Wuxi area. The deities worshipped were "Former Heaven Grandpa" and "Heaven and Earth Grandpa," without names or evidence. The only one that could be investigated was "Lord Guan Yu," which may be the difference between the southern and northern factions! (To be continued)

Weekly Commentary

### Practical Problems and Political Power

— Zhu Yousong

The strength or weakness of political power is sufficient to determine the outcome of a battle in wartime and the success or failure of construction in peacetime. Whether for war or construction, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and obtain their sincere cooperation to achieve success. So how can political power be strengthened? First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the people's confidence in order to make a planned allocation of popular power. To achieve this goal, in addition to theoretical propaganda, it is also necessary to attach importance to practical issues—especially since this war has been going on for a long time, and people are generally anxious about their real lives. Whether the permanent authorities can make wise and appropriate solutions to practical problems is enough to determine the direction of popular sentiment.

Today, China is a participating country in the war. It should use strong political power to ensure the rear and contribute materials. But this kind of work is closely related to practical problems. The following is an extension of the most important practical problems:

The first practical problem is public security. To ensure the rear, it is necessary to maintain public security. Unfortunately, in recent years, public security in the peaceful area has not only failed to improve, but bandits have also infested rural areas. Recently, in the four counties of Xi, Wu, and Cheng, there have been evil cults such as Xiantiandao and Jinguangdao, who have confused farmers and carried out vendettas. Furthermore, in large cities, people's lives are difficult due to high prices, and the public is panicked. If this continues, public security is worrying. The reason for the chaos of social order to this extreme is that in rural areas it is due to the enemy's fraud and the bullying of bad military police, which leads to public resentment and gives bandits an opportunity to take advantage of; in cities it is due to profiteers hoarding and speculating, which leads to crazy rises in the prices of goods. Therefore, the way to save the situation is to first purify officialdom and arrest treacherous merchants, and then guide the people and suppress bandits and evil. This accumulated work should start from a point and gradually extend to a surface, and should thoroughly understand the meaning of "using the death penalty in wartime" to catch both big and small fish in one fell swoop. As long as you are responsible, serious, and earnest in handling the matter, then the public security of the rear will definitely be stable.

The second practical problem is production. The consumption of materials in wartime is doubled compared to peacetime, and materials from distant places cannot be transported. If production is not increased, supply will inevitably fall short of demand. The impact of this is not only social poverty, but also leads to popular dissatisfaction and weakens political power. But simply chanting the slogan of "increasing production" is useless; it must be put into practice in order to be effective. For example, agricultural loans are one way to increase agricultural production. Other measures, such as providing factories with sufficient power, making the supply of raw materials and the transportation of machinery as convenient as possible, and training specialized industrial technicians, are all hoped to be discussed and implemented jointly by the authorities and the people.

The third practical problem is the people's food. This is the prerequisite for all problems. If people have enough food and their lives are stable, the people can fulfill their responsibilities and, with proper training, dedicate themselves to national policies. If the people do not have enough food and cannot make a living, the old and weak will die in the ditches, and the young and strong will take risks. The government will lose its foundation, and the impact on political power is obvious. Today, rice prices are soaring, and commodity prices are rising accordingly, and the people's food and livelihood are under great threat. If this fundamental practical problem is not solved, it will form a serious social crisis. Therefore, for this urgent food problem, the relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities should do their best to solve it quickly. On the negative side, it is hoped that an order will be issued to prohibit grain collection officers from burning rice piles, and to severely punish grain merchants for hoarding and speculating, so that the already insufficient food supply will no longer be artificially reduced, and that the high food prices will be suppressed to a considerable extent. On the positive side, it is hoped that on the one hand, the source of supply will be dredged quickly, and on the other hand, discussions will be held with the local allied authorities to borrow grain, and that distribution or fair sales will be implemented in the most critical period to stop the public's fear of food shortages and avoid causing adverse consequences. As for the most important countermeasure, it is to increase food production; the specific methods have been repeatedly listed in this newspaper before, so there is no need to repeat them here, just implement them!

"Governing does not lie in many words," "facts are the best propaganda," and the generation of political power is based on solving practical problems. The above three points are only the most fundamental problems. If they cannot be solved, how can we win the hearts of the people, how can we talk about political power, and how can we seek victory in war? This is by no means alarmist, and it is hoped that the authorities will consider it!

### Section Chief Shimada Speaks: Burmese-Japanese Forces Flank, Air Force Fiercely Attacks the West Dwina River's Right Bank

Central News Agency Dispatch: The Shanghai Japanese Army Department's press conference, hosted yesterday morning at 11:30, featured Section Chief Shimada answering reporters' questions regarding the latest war situation in Burma.

### Yesterday was the 18th Anti-Aircraft Day; Strict Drills Implemented; Sino-Japanese National Air Defense Ideas Harmoniously Exchanged

Yesterday (the 9th) was the 18th Anti-Aircraft Day. As usual, the city's air defense authorities conducted extensive propaganda on the meaning of air defense and implemented air defense drills. The entire day was spent in a state of air defense preparedness, with a highly tense atmosphere. The details are as follows:

Alarm Drills

Alarm drills did not involve sounding sirens, but rather implementing alarm transmission drills. At 8:00 AM, a drill for issuing a pre-alarm was conducted. Each district transmitted the alarm using copper gongs, flags, telephones, etc. Each branch office dispatched personnel to inspect air raid shelters, air defense wells, and other air defense facilities for each neighborhood and family. Air defense personnel were also convened for briefings and to prepare for various air defense measures. At 4:00 PM, a drill for issuing an air raid alarm was conducted. In addition to transmitting the alarm using copper gongs, flags, telephones, etc., city-wide traffic control was implemented. All neighborhood personnel were mobilized to assist the police in directing traffic. Pedestrians were required to stand along the left side of the street for ten minutes before being allowed to walk on the left. All vehicles, except those with special identification, were prohibited from driving and were parked along the left side of the street. Strict enforcement was carried out. All entertainment venues suspended music, dancing, theater, and other forms of entertainment. At the same time, shelter drills were implemented. Air raid personnel guided residents to air raid shelters. All shops, banks, and various entertainment venues implemented shelter drills. Audiences were guided by the special self-defense teams and air defense teams of each venue to air raid shelters or appropriate locations. Each district designated appropriate addresses to conduct comprehensive air defense drills, including surveillance, sheltering, fire extinguishing, and rescue. The air raid alarm was lifted at 5:00 PM.

Lights Out

A pre-alarm lights out was implemented after sunset. At 9:00 PM, an air raid alarm drill was issued again. Lights out and traffic control were strictly enforced. No vehicles were allowed to pass, except for essential vehicles. Military police and neighborhood personnel organized lights out inspection teams to patrol their respective jurisdictions. All companies, shops, theaters, cafes, dance halls, hotels, and other entertainment venues were strictly prohibited from leaking light and were required to suspend entertainment. Violations would result in the inspection team recording the address or shop name, followed by power disconnection. Furthermore, a joint responsibility system was implemented, where entire neighborhoods and even groups of neighborhoods would face power disconnection. At the same time, each district implemented night-time comprehensive drills, with a particular focus on shelter drills. In the "blackout state," air raid personnel guided residents to air raid shelters and appropriate locations. At 10:00 PM, the air raid alarm drill was lifted. A pre-alarm lights out was implemented, and air raid prevention lights were restored until 10:30 PM, when the pre-alarm was completely lifted, and normal conditions were restored.

Local Drills

This local area comprehensive drill was held within the jurisdictions of the Hongkou, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, and Zhabei branch offices. From morning to night, the chief and deputy chief of each branch office, along with the heads of each section, directed Sino-Japanese male and female neighborhood air defense personnel at key traffic intersections in each district to implement comprehensive air defense drills, including bomb disposal, fire extinguishing, rescue, sheltering, and surveillance.

### Notice from the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command

To further invigorate civil defense activities during air raids, the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command will begin broadcasting air defense information starting from the 10th and has decided to issue a type of preparation alarm. The announcement is as follows:

Broadcasting Air Defense Information

To provide Shanghai citizens with appropriate and effective air defense measures, promote more vigorous civil defense activities, prevent unexpected damage and injury, eliminate rumors and enemy propaganda, and stabilize public morale, air defense information broadcasts will be implemented. These broadcasts will be transmitted via radio to general households and via street broadcasting towers or mobile loudspeaker vehicles for pedestrians.

Regulation of the Preparation Alarm

Before issuing a pre-alarm, to alert the general public and to indicate that enemy aircraft are approaching Shanghai or that a small number of enemy aircraft are threatening Shanghai airspace, allowing for judgment of the extremely low risk of bombing and to alert the general public to prepare for air defense measures (especially the strict implementation of lights out at night) while minimizing disruption to business operations, a new type of preparation alarm is being implemented, according to the following guidelines:

Issuance: A siren sound, one short blast every ten seconds. Cancellation: No siren sound. Broadcast via radio and street broadcasting towers.

Based on the actual situation, broadcasts and preparation alarms may also be issued beyond the two items mentioned above.

Air defense broadcast information is issued as information from the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command. However, the publication of this broadcast in newspapers or other publications is strictly prohibited.

### Police Bust Drug Manufacturing Plant; Large-Scale Production in Enemy-Owned Housing

At the beginning of this month, the Shanghai Police Bureau's Third Section Narcotics Investigation Unit learned that someone was using enemy-owned housing at the end of Daxilu Road, west of the railway, to manufacture drugs on a large scale. The details were reported to Li Shiyu, Chief of the Third Section, who instructed Wu Xiquan, Chief of the Narcotics Investigation Unit, to actively investigate. After a week of detailed investigation, at 9:30 AM on June 7, Wu Xiquan, Chief of the Narcotics Investigation Unit, and Ito Fumio, Deputy Chief, led Section Members Jin Hongkang and Pang Hao, along with all unit members and military police, to 6 Yili Road, West Shanghai, where they busted the drug manufacturing operation. Six individuals, including drug technician Shen Jusheng, were apprehended. Approximately 100 taels of finished heroin, as well as raw materials, semi-finished products, manufacturing equipment, chemicals, and other items, were seized, with a total value of over 150 million yuan. After detailed interrogation at the Bureau, it was learned that the operator of the drug operation was named Ye Peng (also known as Ye Gongfu), the current Chairman of the Board of Dasen Qianzhuang on Beijing Road. Section Member Jin was dispatched with plainclothes police officers Ding Zhaogan and Zhu Xihui to Dasen Qianzhuang, where Ye Peng was apprehended. Ye Peng confessed to having studied political economy at Waseda University in Japan in his early years and enjoyed studying chemistry. He began manufacturing drugs as early as 1941 and gradually expanded the operation until today. The rented enemy property was leased from a Japanese national. The case is currently under thorough investigation. The bust of this drug operation will greatly help eliminate the atmosphere of drug use.

### Minister Kuwahara Explains the Pacific War Situation; First Meeting with Press Corps Since Taking Office

The newly appointed Naval Fleet Press Minister, Colonel Kuwahara, met with local Chinese and foreign reporters at the Naval Attaché's Office at 2:00 PM yesterday for his first meeting since taking office. He gave an impromptu explanation of the Pacific War situation and future trends in the enemy's mainland operations. The main points are as follows:

Since Colonel Matsushima's reassignment, the position of Press Minister has been temporarily held concurrently by myself. However, I have little experience in this task and hope that everyone present will offer much guidance. Today, I will start with a discussion of the recent Pacific War situation as an introductory conversation.

Fierce Battle on Okinawa

The Pacific War situation centers around Okinawa Island, where Japanese and American forces are still engaged in a fierce battle. This intense battle is truly the prelude to the future decisive battle between Japan and the United States. The Japanese military is utilizing the best tactics to make the enemy bleed, as everyone is already well aware. The Japanese military's method of operation is to inflict maximum casualties on the enemy. The target of attack is enemy transport ships around Okinawa. The number of ships sunk or damaged has already exceeded 560, which the enemy can no longer conceal and has announced. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal has requested more trained and skilled workers to repair ships, and Nimitz has also acknowledged the significant damage to ships and manpower. Therefore, significant obstacles to future operations are inevitable.

Significant Increase in American Casualties

The number of deaths among U.S. naval personnel is increasing significantly, as is the case on land. For example, the damages announced by the U.S. military yesterday (the 8th) showed an increase of 3,347 in the Navy compared to last week, bringing the total to 116,215. On land, there was an increase of 9,162 compared to last week, bringing the total to 895,834. This shows how much the enemy has bled in one week. The Japanese military is continuing to advance with this operational goal in mind and is confident that the enemy's damage will continue to expand significantly, causing them to lose their will to fight. The most important moment in warfare is the final five minutes. We must fight thoroughly and resolutely to achieve final victory.

Prepared for Enemy Action

Colonel Kuwahara also answered two questions from reporters:

(Question) The decisive battle on Okinawa is intensifying. How will this impact China if the war takes a new turn?

(Answer) The battle on Okinawa is currently intensifying. We will never allow the enemy to suppress us arbitrarily. Assuming that the enemy gains control of the area, the focus of attention will be on the enemy's air operations against China. At this time, the enemy air base will be closer to mainland China, and their air force will have the potential to be more active along the Chinese coast. Large-scale active operations may be carried out against Shanghai, Qingdao, Nanjing, and other places. However, it is impossible to predict the actual situation without consulting Nimitz. In short, we are prepared and have made adequate preparations.

Landing Operations Will Be Met with Resistance

(Question) What are the trends in mainland operations?

(Answer) The conclusion to this question is that no matter how abundant the resources of the United States, it will be difficult to achieve a quick victory. Assuming that the enemy attempts landing operations, the first problem will be manpower. In the past, considerable manpower was required for remote islands such as Okinawa and Iwo Jima. In the battle on Okinawa, each American soldier had to be accompanied by 1.6 tons of ammunition. If 100,000 soldiers are deployed, 16 tons of supplies will be required each day. Since the enemy has already suffered serious blows in the battle on Okinawa, the difficulties they will face in terms of personnel transport will be evident. Secondly, the closer the enemy gets to Japan's important bases, the greater the resistance they will face. Therefore, even if the enemy intends to launch a landing operation, the Japanese military will inflict a serious blow.
