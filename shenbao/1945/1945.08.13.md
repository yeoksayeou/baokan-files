Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement, Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 12th: The Japanese army in Manchuria and Korea, in cooperation with the Manchukuo army, engaged in fierce battle on August 11th to repel the Soviet forces invading the areas of Unggi, Chun, and Ryeong in the eastern front, and Hailar, Solon, and Reishi in the western front. On August 11th in the afternoon, Japanese submarine units attacked an enemy transport convoy in the sea south of Okinawa, sinking three of their ships.

### Japanese Kwantung Army Announces War Situation

Shinkyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kwantung Army announced at 12:00 PM on August 12th: The Japanese and Manchukuo armies continue to repel the Soviet forces invading on all fronts. The currently confirmed situation is as follows:

(A) Northern Korea and Jiandao Province Area

A portion of the enemy that invaded northern Korea on the 10th entered Unggi and is currently being blocked at Unggi and Rajin.

On the evening of the 11th, a portion of the enemy broke into Chun, where the entire military and civilian population engaged them in fierce battle, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

On the 10th, a portion of the enemy broke into Chunhwa.

There have been no enemy incursions in other border areas in this region.

(B) Mudanjiang Area

The Japanese Dongning garrison troops continue their strong resistance, crushing the enemy's invasion.

A strong enemy force invading from the north of the Suifen River area gradually advanced to the northeast of Muling on the night of the 11th. The Japanese army has completed its defensive posture to intercept them.

The situation on the southeastern front is unclear, but the enemy's advance is being blocked everywhere, with no major progress.

Enemy forces invading the Sanjiang Province area gradually advanced to the Fujin area on the afternoon of the 11th.

In the Heihe Province area, the enemy army is being blocked by the Japanese garrison army on the banks of the Heilong River. Currently, units are being dispatched to cross the river on all fronts, and subsequently, the main force will be sent across the river, seemingly preparing to attack the Japanese army's resistance areas.

In the Hailar area, the Japanese garrison troops continue to fight fiercely under heavy enemy siege, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. A portion of the enemy is advancing to Hak.

In the Outer Mongolia area: 1. On the afternoon of the 11th, a strong enemy vanguard unit was advancing towards the Reishi area. 2. The enemy forces in the Yiwuqi area are gradually moving southward towards Linxi. 3. There have been no major changes on the Baidu front.

The enemy air force used a small number of planes to bomb Hailar, Lalin, and Jiamusi on the 9th, and Mudanjiang on the 11th, without suffering any losses.

Most of the residents in the border areas are gradually being evacuated to the rear.

### Manchurian-Soviet Border War Gradually Becoming Full-Scale

Shinkyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The fighting along the entire Manchurian-Soviet border is gradually becoming full-scale. In the eastern border war, the Soviet army has invaded several locations, and the Japanese and Manchukuo armies are engaging in a courageous defensive battle. The enemy seems to be planning to expand the battle lines and invade eastern Manchuria in one fell swoop, so they are continuously transferring rear forces, using tanks as the vanguard, breaking through civilian houses along the border and attacking. The Japanese and Manchukuo armies are doing everything possible to block the enemy's advance. The Soviet army has now broken into the Chun and Chunhua border lines, but the Japanese and Manchukuo armies are still securing their positions and launching a major counterattack. The fighting on the northern border is still small-scale warfare, but the enemy's attacks are gradually becoming more active. The enemy, who broke through Manzhouli Sanhe and aimed for Hailar, has now surrounded Hailar and is carrying out a fierce attack. The Japanese army in Hailar is using a surprise attack to destroy the enemy troops. The enemy who broke through Hailar and advanced eastward along the railway line, attempting to invade Hak, was suddenly struck by the center of northern Manchuria. Furthermore, the Soviet army that crossed the Halaha River and invaded, echoing the Hailar front, is preparing to move south towards Linxi. The enemy is attempting to invade the Yuehe River, cutting off the connection between the Japanese army and North China. From this, it can be judged that the enemy's offensive has become all-out, and the Japanese Kwantung Army is conducting a defensive battle along the entire border.

### War Situation in Various Locations

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The war situation in various locations in East Asia for the past week is as follows: From the end of July to the beginning of August, a portion of the enemy's mobile forces, which had retreated along the mainland coast, converged on Jeju Island and its vicinity on the 6th to carry out small-scale operations. On the 9th, they used approximately 1,700 carrier-based aircraft, and on the 16th, a cumulative total of approximately 1,600 carrier-based aircraft, to attack the northeast Kanto region in a dispersed manner. Large aircraft also launched attacks in support. The Japanese army units engaged them, shooting down 91 and destroying 91. On the night of the 9th, the Japanese special attack force also attacked the enemy's mobile forces in the sea east of Mt. Kinhua, confirming the destruction of one large enemy ship. The enemy air force that invaded the Mariana and Okinawa areas was even more active this week. Combat bomber joint formations of approximately 300 aircraft gradually came to the Chugoku region. In the Balikpapan area, the fighting on the Samarinda front is extremely fierce. Due to the fierce counterattack of the Japanese army, the enemy's attacking power is gradually weakening. On Bougainville Island northeast of Buka Island, the two armies are still engaged in jungle warfare. The Japanese army units on Hainan Island are mopping up the remaining bandits on the island. In July, the battle results were the killing or wounding of over 400 enemy soldiers and the capture of 40 who surrendered.

### Fierce Japanese Counterattack in Balikpapan

Southern Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – The enemy in the Balikpapan area has been eagerly pushing its forces under naval gun fire and bombing, but due to the fierce counterattack of the Japanese army, no progress has been made. Meanwhile, the Japanese garrison unit's new forces launched a bold counterattack from the entire counterattack formation on the morning of the 6th. A melee squad that infiltrated the enemy's rear killed or wounded 150 enemy soldiers. In addition, two tents and two vehicles were blown up. On the 6th, the melee squad that killed at Sepinggan Airport destroyed the material accumulation site. At that time, a large fire broke out in the airfield, and the enemy soldiers who were eager to put out the fire were extremely embarrassed. On the 7th, the enemy who landed at Muara-Angin with a small team of soldiers had their advance thwarted due to a Japanese bayonet attack. Furthermore, the enemy in the Patton area carried out slow shelling and bombing on the 6th and 7th, but otherwise, no changes were seen.

Travel Correspondence

### Overview of Jinshan

— Lan Huozhi

From Songjiang to Jinshan

From Songjiang to Jinshan, there is only a Yong's distance apart. First, take the Punan Company's bus to Mishidu. This journey is extremely short, about nine li, and can be reached in half an hour. There are two buses a day, and the ticket price is 4,800 yuan.

After arriving at Mishidu, cross the river. On both banks, there is a thatched shed for passengers to wait for the bus and rest. After crossing the river, take the Punan-operated car. Competing for a seat here is even worse than on the bus, because the car is narrow, and everyone is afraid of being left behind. Therefore, in addition to the carriage being crammed with passengers like sardines, there are often six or seven people hanging on the outer pedals. This method of hanging on the car is more dangerous and inevitably gets covered in dust. In other places, there is a half-price discount, but here it is uniform.

From Mishidu to Jinshan, the road is still flat, the entire journey is about ten li. When approaching the destination, you must pass over a long bridge, and below is the turbulent Huangpu River water. Here, the river is quite narrow, and the two banks can talk to each other. At the lower left corner of the bridge is the Pinghu Wharf, which has become a necessary route for water transportation. Standing on the bridgehead, you can see Jinshan at a glance. From Mishidu to Jinshan, the fare is 11,000 yuan. The reporter recently took a car from the opposite bank of Minhang to Nanqiao (Fengxian County), which is only about ten li, and the fare was only 5,000 yuan. So, I asked the ticket seller the reason for the high price. The seller said with a bitter face: "First, the weather is hot, and the tires are easily damaged. Second, there are too many people riding on white cars."

In addition to transportation: on land, there is the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, which runs along the coast from Zhalin through Jinshanwei to Zhejiang. Although there is a highway to Fengxian, the overseas Chinese have returned in the Tinglin section, and the security is not good, so there is no through traffic. By water, there is the Pinghu bus, which runs between Shanghai and Pinghu every day. Most of the passengers are rice merchants. Since the opening of the rice trade, it has become even more crowded.

And Jurisdiction

Jinshan is a land of fish and rice, and its products have always been abundant. The terrain is narrow and long from north to south, and wider from east to west. It is bordered by the sea to the south, Songjiang to the north, Zhaopu to the west, and Qingcun to the east. The terrain is flat, but in the southern territory of Zhangyan, there is Mt. Tai in the west, a small hill of dozens of meters. In the sea, there is Jinshan Island, and the Huangpu River runs across the northern border. It was originally called Xiaogong Town. In the third year of the Qing Yongzheng period, it was promoted to a county under the jurisdiction of Songjiang Prefecture. Jinshanwei was first established. In the twenty-fourth year of Qianlong, the county seat was moved to Zhujing Town. After several changes, the old city base and government site have been demolished and no longer exist. The entire county covers an area of 940 square li, divided into six districts, 51 townships, and 12 towns, with a male and female population of approximately 172,800. Districts 1, 2, and 3 can be freely governed. Districts 4 and 5 are more left-leaning. District 6 is almost entirely controlled by the New Fourth Army and the Zhongjiu forces. In addition to Zhujing, Zhangyan, Songyin, and Zian are the county's large towns.

Local Customs and Culture

Zhujing Town is a long street, about two li long. Although there are streets before and after, they are not as lively as that long street. The characteristic of this two-li-long street is the tea houses, large and small, no less than ten. These tea houses were all established before the war. Before the war, farmers were wealthy due to their farming income. When they had nothing to do during the slack season, they often went to the tea houses to drink tea or sat down to play cards with acquaintances. Over time, they developed a habit of idleness and gambling. Now, under the pressure of high living costs, this trend has decreased slightly.

The clothing of the rural women still retains a traditional local style: black skirts, short white striped shirts. The sleeves and skirts of married women are longer, while those of young women are the opposite. This kind of dress is similar to that of Fengxian. When they come to town from the countryside to shop, they usually carry a basket in their right wrist, and their skirts flutter as they walk gracefully. With their strong physiques, they have the flavor of Southeast Asian women. The accent is similar to Songjiang, with a slight Pudong intonation.

The Donglin Temple in the area can be said to be the only historical site. The temple was built in the Yuan Dynasty and is quite large in scale. Inside is a stone Buddha of Sakyamuni, with an iron head and a stone body. Looking at the Buddha's calm and peaceful attitude, one cannot help but admire the ancient carving art. There is no park here. What there is is a small ball field rebuilt from the ruins, and another storytelling venue, which can be considered to embellish the entertainment of the whole town.

Industry and Commerce and Others

On this long street in the town, commerce is still lively. In the places the reporter has passed, the scene is like Nanqiao in Fengxian, slightly worse than Zhoupu, but more prosperous than Nanhui. Large and small shops are complete with all kinds of goods. Most of the storefronts are double-spaced. Pedestrians still come and go endlessly. There are three or two hotels, and most of the travelers are merchants on the Pinghu bus. Recently, people's purchasing power is weak, and at the same time, the cost of supplies is huge, so many businesses have found it difficult to make ends meet, and the business atmosphere is far from what it used to be. There are two money houses in the financial industry, and the trend of discounting bills is much less than in Shanghai. It has recently been heard that cash in the countryside is being secretly absorbed by many people, and there is a trend of flowing to Shanghai. The only industry is a small rice rope factory.

The level of education is extremely low in the area. There is only one junior high school in the entire county. Although there is another central primary school in each district, the number of students is quite small, and the level of teachers is also very low. Teachers are paid three dou of rice and several thousand yuan per month. The rice is not necessarily received on time, so many hold a do-or-die attitude. In terms of charity, there is a relief center that houses more than a dozen old and weak people. Part of the funding is raised, and the rest is subsidized by the Songjinqing Three Charity Hall's public property office. Recently, due to rising prices and shortfalls in income, it has been very difficult to maintain.

Township Mayor Training Class

Speaking of cooperative undertakings, there is such a facility in the area, but due to poor management, it is only in name.

Recently, the local government ordered the establishment of a township mayor training class, first selecting trainees from Districts 1, 2, and 3, with a total of 29 people. The training period is three weeks. The training method is to report to the county, and then pay six dou of rice as the cost of personal meals. When the reporter and his party arrived in the county, the training class was about to hold a graduation ceremony. The reporter went to visit it. The training courses were divided into Baojia, Party Ideology, Local Autonomy, and Air Defense Common Sense. The trainees were all dressed as farmers, sleeping on the floor, and their spirits were very healthy.

On behalf of the theory

### Those who love the local area must love the country

— Wen Lanting

Today, the municipal authorities hosted a tea party for leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai to discuss two matters: maintaining public security and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Secretary-General Luo has already explained the significance, which is very concise. I believe everyone present has the same feeling.

Everyone here has a long history in Shanghai, has prestige, and has a high position. Everyone must have the desire to protect the local area and maintain local order, and everyone is very concerned about it. At the same time, the local people are also equally concerned and pay attention to every word and deed of everyone, especially when the situation is turbulent and rumors are rife. Local leaders must take the initiative to rise up with enthusiasm and do their best to take responsibility for maintaining public security and stabilizing people's livelihoods.

Originally, the maintenance of public security and the stability of people's livelihoods are the responsibilities that the authorities should bear, and local people are only in a position to cooperate and assist. However, when a major change occurs in the situation, local leaders with prestige, status, and history can come forward and work hard on public security and people's livelihoods, which will have a greater effect than the government's decrees.

Public security and people's livelihoods are two sides of the same thing. If public security is poor, a small number of people will easily believe rumors and act rashly. If it is allowed to go unchecked and not corrected, it will be enough to trigger a major unfortunate event. As a result, people's lives will inevitably be unstable. Because people's lives cannot be stabilized, it is enough to brew problems in public security. At the same time, a small number of bad elements will inevitably take the opportunity to make trouble, which is enough to cause difficult problems in public security. Judging from the situation in the past few days, there have been some superficial actions, and this action has followed suit, which easily leads to unfortunate events. As the saying goes, "Insufficient to accomplish anything, more than enough to spoil things." If the government authorities and social leaders do not come out to maintain order, and a truly unfortunate public security event is created, it is really not worth it.

Therefore, we must use the enthusiasm of loving the country to love the local area, and express our patriotism through the action of protecting the local area. First, we must correct the rash actions of the masses and keep the social order calm and peaceful, hoping that the local military police and Baojia personnel will work together to prepare for this. Second, we should persuade the industrial and commercial circles to resume business immediately, and those who spread rumors and raise prices should be punished for disturbing the market.

We firmly believe that all true patriots will never bear to see the chaos in the local society and the suffering of the people, and are willing to come forward to fulfill their responsibility to protect the local area. Only those who can truly protect the local area are worthy of being patriots.

### Working Together to Overcome Difficulties, Implementing the Spirit of Maintaining the National Polity, Japanese Newspaper Indicates the Path that Nationals Should Follow

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial today, pointing out that the entire Japanese nation should be united under His Majesty the Emperor, with a hundred times the courage, to overcome the sad fate. It said in brief that the country has reached a juncture of national survival, which has never been encountered in three thousand years. Distant events such as the foreign troubles of Bunji and Hongan, and recent events such as the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, although they all plunged the country into difficulties, were not as severe as today. So, what is the national attitude in dealing with this difficult situation? Japan has an unparalleled national polity united under His Majesty the Emperor, and everything is issued by the Holy One, which goes without saying. For nearly two thousand years since the founding of the country, the way of the monarch and ministers has been fixed, the direction of the country is clear and unwavering, and there must be one and only one key step for the country. In the face of this greatest difficulty since the founding of the country, compatriots throughout the country can only have a hundred times the courage, only have the utmost sincerity to reflect on themselves and practice self-discipline, and when compatriots hold the firm belief that the Divine State will not perish and have the conviction to maintain the national polity, each individual ego can be united with the long-standing great ego, the individual will be annihilated and merged with the whole, and at this point, a belief in mutual trust and harmony will naturally arise. The individual is a unified phenomenon of the whole. The seriousness, depth, and duration of the national disaster facing compatriots are really difficult to measure. At this time, how can we still hesitate and be indecisive? We can only face it with unwavering unity. The most important thing to avoid at this time is being careful and suspicious, hesitating, and internal strife. The post-war national life should be a completely unparalleled phenomenon. Only by the country's courageous and decisive efforts to overcome the misfortune can we reserve the only way to build a glorious future.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – As Japan faces an unprecedented difficult situation, Tokyo newspapers are all vigorously advocating the spirit of upholding the national polity and the direction that the nation should take. "Asahi Shimbun" published the leading news on the right side of the 12th, with the title "Uphold the Imperial Heart and Achieve the Duty of a Child," in a four-segment position. "Mainichi Shimbun" also published a chronicle titled "The Great Justice of Eternity." The first chronicle of "Asahi Shimbun" is recorded below: "Since the beginning of its history, the Japanese nation has encountered many trials, overcome them, and become a strong country, and the people have achieved today's prosperity. Our ancestors used calm and decisive means to open the thorny road. In several national disasters, the fate of the country and the people, both external and internal, has repeatedly presented the danger of a stacked egg, and they have entered a chaotic stage where they do not know which direction to go or how to deal with it, but they only know to rely on the Japanese national spirit and act in unison. The heart of His Majesty the Emperor is the heart of God. By following the orders of His Majesty the Emperor, they opened the way to life from death. Our ancestors have opened such difficulties several times, and today's Japan conveys this spirit to us at the same time. The fact that the Soviet Union unilaterally announced that it should go to war against us and started military operations, and that Britain and the United States used the atomic bomb, starting the most violent massacres in human history that have never been seen before, have made the war situation since the fall of Saipan through the Philippines and Okinawa even more significant. Today's fact that it has entered the worst possible state has been frankly admitted by the Director-General of the Information Bureau, and the situation can be said to have reached the final juncture. In order to protect the national propriety and preserve the nation's honor, and to defend the last line, what is required of the entire nation, including military officers and civilians, at this stage is that our ancestors have always calmly faced reality, have always dealt with matters decisively, and that they live for the sake of being a child of His Majesty, and His Majesty expects the nation not to violate this purpose, to eliminate personal selfishness, and only then can they exert the national spiritual power of returning the favor with seven lives, and combat power will gush forth. At this final juncture, our army must inherit the legacy created by our ancestors in adversity, and fulfill the duty of being a child of His Majesty. If we can fulfill this point, then no matter how much more difficult it becomes in the future, the foundation of the Japanese nation will not be shaken in the slightest."

### The British Also Express Indignation Towards Inhumane Weapons

Zurich, Central News Agency, 12th – According to a London Exchange Telegraph dispatch: On the 9th, various London morning newspapers published that the general public was filled with indignation regarding the inhumane weapon, the atomic bomb. For example, one reader of the Chronicle requested that "the scientists who dedicated themselves to this demon of human slaughter should be executed immediately." Furthermore, according to a political reporter for the Daily Mail, the Labor Party’s condemnation of the use of the atomic bomb was particularly vehement. Attlee's coming into office so soon encountering such a difficult situation is not a good omen. It is also unknown whether Attlee will be asked to explain the extent to which the British government agreed to the decision to use the atomic bomb. Furthermore, Attlee will be asked to guarantee that atomic bombs will not be used in future operations against Japan, or even in future wars.

### Overview of Policies of the Ministry of Interior; Director of Land Administration Zhang Shi Reports

Central News Agency, Beijing – The Ministry of Interior met with reporters on the 11th, with Director of Land Administration Zhang Shizheng representing the ministry to announce the following overview of the ministry's policies:

Civil Affairs Matters

During the "cleansing" period in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality, all delegated administrative regions were simultaneously returned to their respective jurisdictions, starting from the second half of this year (July 1). Two areas of Jurong County in Jiangsu Province were placed under the jurisdiction of Jiangning County. The organizational law of the Haizhou Municipal Government of Huaihai Province was amended.

Land Administration Matters

Regarding applications for tax deeds by foreigners, the ministry, together with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Industry, previously drafted two sets of measures: 1. Citizens of countries without treaties and stateless persons may rent houses for residence within recovered concessions but may not rent land. This restriction does not apply to those who have been naturalized and obtained Chinese citizenship. 2. Those who have already obtained land through mortgage or perpetual lease must transfer it to Chinese citizens within a limited time. If they encounter danger, the local government will reclaim it. An order was received approving the amendment to Article 4 of the Tax Regulations drafted by the Ministry of Finance. The return of land and houses to former owners was handled. The application for registration by the Xuzhou Huaihai Housing Co., Ltd. was reviewed in conjunction with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry. It was decided that, according to the regulations of various concessions and commercial ports regarding the land rights of foreigners obtaining Chinese legal person status, current laws do not restrict general real estate businesses. As this pertains to company registration, it falls under the management of the Ministry of Industry, to be handled at its discretion.

### Municipal Government's Measures for Air Defense in Schools at All Levels

The Municipal Government issued the following air defense implementation measures for schools at all levels on the 7th of this month:

Section 1: The Focus of School Air Defense

In addition to carrying out all orders issued by the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters regarding air defense matters, schools at all levels in this city, fearing that the environment and facilities of each school may not be fully complete and that the danger of air raids is considerable, should pay particular attention to the following key points of school air defense: protection of students, protection of important documents, books, instruments, and research materials, and protection of school buildings.

Section 2: Air Defense Preparations

Each school should organize students into several teams based on age, address, and grade level, and distinguish between "staying at school" and "returning home" types so that they can be assembled at any time. The measures are as follows:

(A) Staying-at-School Team: 1. Limited to high school students in the second and third grades and above who live near the school. 2. Distant or young students entrusted by their parents to stay at school (a letter of entrustment should be obtained).

(B) Returning-Home Team: 1. Divided into several teams according to the direction of students' addresses (the address of each student should be thoroughly investigated in advance to prepare for team formation). 2. Each large team is further divided into several small teams.

(C) After the formation of each team, attention should be paid to the speed of assembly, not exceeding one minute.

(D) Stipulate the location for the general assembly of each team. This location must be in a relatively safe location with specific signals and walking routes.

(E) Notify the parents of the students in detail of these implementation measures in writing, explaining whether the student will stay at school or return home immediately when an alarm sounds, and ask the parents of the students to answer the following points: 1. The parents agree that their child will stay at school and take on protection work (this is limited to high school students in the second and third grades and above who live near the school). 2. The parents agree that their child will return home immediately on their own. 3. The parents request permission for their child to wait temporarily at the school until someone from home arrives to pick them up and accompany them home (if there is such a request, the person picking up the child must come to the school immediately after hearing the alarm). 4. For students living far away (the journey from school to home takes more than 20 minutes), please have the parents designate relatives or friends living nearby (name and address) where the student can go to take refuge on their own (still considered to be returning home on their own). 5. For students living far away (the journey from school to home takes more than 30 minutes), and the parents cannot designate relatives or friends living nearby for refuge, they request the school to arrange for them to be taken to a shelter.

Within three days, all glass windows in each room of the school must be covered with "well-shaped" strips of paper two centimeters wide. The paper should preferably be cellophane or kraft paper and must be pasted on the inside.

This pasting work should be done jointly by teachers, students, and employees during art classes.

The school should have sufficient equipment for water, yellow sand, medicine, and various firefighting tools. The quantity should be based on the needs of each school. The cost should be raised by each school and should not be collected from students. The Education Bureau or the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters may send personnel to inspect at any time.

Each student must clearly state their name, grade, and home address on their collar.

The school building should be sturdy, and one place inside the school should be designated as the school's shelter. If there is a shelter near the school, it should also be contacted in advance to prepare for evacuation, so it is not necessary to designate a place inside the school.

Kindergarten, primary school, junior high school, and first-year high school students should not be assigned air defense duties. However, second- and third-year high school students should be given air defense training and encouraged to participate, but participation is not compulsory if their parents do not agree.

Schools should regularly explain air defense knowledge and measures to be taken during air raids to students, and hold exercises at least once a month.

Section 3: Organization of the School Air Defense Team

In order to strengthen air defense preparations, each school should establish its own school air defense team. Its organization and system are as follows:

The school air defense team should have a team leader and a deputy team leader, each, who should be assumed by the principal or a director and a physical education teacher, respectively. They will be in charge of all school air defense matters. The team should have the following groups:

(A) Shelter Guidance Group: With one group leader, assumed by a teacher, and one employee to assist, the group is responsible for guiding "staying-at-school students" to evacuate to shelters or waiting for evacuation.

(B) First Aid Group: With one group leader, assumed by a teacher, and several members, the members are composed of teachers, school employees, and volunteer second- and third-year high school students who stay at school to take on air defense work. The group is responsible for first aid for the sick and injured, as well as the preparation and management of first aid supplies and materials.

(C) Fire Prevention Group: With one group leader, assumed by a teacher, and several members, the members are composed of teachers, school employees, and volunteer second- and third-year high school students who stay at school to take on air defense work. The group is responsible for implementing firefighting, managing firefighting equipment, and removing dangerous items.

(D) Surveillance and Security Group: With one group leader, assumed by the head of administrative affairs or a clerk, and several members composed of gatekeepers, school employees, and on-campus staff, the group is responsible for aerial surveillance, control of lights and sounds, and inspecting and storing all lighting control equipment.

(E) Important Material Transportation Group: With one group leader, concurrently assumed by the deputy team leader, the members are composed of teachers, administrative staff, school employees, etc., and are responsible for transporting important materials.

(F) Student Escort Group (Limited to Primary Schools and Kindergartens):

1. Divided into several large teams based on the direction of children's addresses, each with a team leader, assumed by a teacher, to escort the children out of the school and line up to a designated location.

2. Each large team is further divided into several small teams, with senior children serving as small team leaders to escort the children home.

(G) Telephone Message Group: With one team leader, assumed by a teacher, and several members composed of teachers and school employees, the group is responsible for intelligence, inquiries, entrustments, and relaying alarms, and must maintain close contact with the local neighborhood association, police station, and fire department (limited to fires).

The names of the personnel of the above groups must be displayed in a conspicuous place in the school. However, schools below the university level can reduce the number of groups or merge groups.

Section 4: Implementation of School Air Defense

When an alert or alarm is issued, preparations for air defense should begin immediately without any further delay. The details are described below:

(A) Alarm Occurs Before Students Go to School: When a warning or emergency alarm occurs before students have gone to school, parents should instruct their children not to go to school for the time being and should wait until the alarm is completely lifted and it is safe before going to school. However, the school authorities must not consider students absent or on leave. If students encounter an alarm while on their way to school, they should immediately return home or enter a nearby shelter and must not linger on the street.

(B) Alarm Occurs After Students Arrive at School: When an alarm sounds, air defense status should begin immediately, and the principal or other responsible personnel should take the following actions:

1. Immediately issue an order to suspend classes. 2. Implement the general assembly of each team. 3. Except for the "staying-at-school team" students, who are led by the shelter guidance group leader to the shelter, the "returning-home team" students are immediately led by the leader of the student escort group to send each team back home. 4. Under the command of the school air defense team leader, each group begins its own work, striving to achieve calmness, agility, and decisiveness. 5. If it is an air defense drill, classes can continue after the general assembly of teams.

(C) Alarm Occurs While Students Are on the Way Home from School: When a warning alarm sounds and school has already been dismissed and students are on their way home, if they are close to home, they should return home immediately; if the journey is still far, they should quickly enter a nearby shelter and must not linger on the street.

(D) Alarm Occurs Outside of the School's Scheduled Hours: When an alarm is issued, all personnel regularly stationed at the school should take the following actions: 1. The school air defense team leader, deputy team leader, group leaders, and personnel on duty must immediately go to the school. 2. When an alarm is issued, if it is at night, lighting control should be implemented immediately. 3. The person in charge must maintain contact with the police station, neighborhood association, and fire department and be under their command. 4. Command the staff living on campus to engage in the activities, with particular emphasis on rescue, fire prevention, surveillance, and security, and removal of important materials. 6. Direct team members who come to the school to work. 7. Students at home must not go to school until the warning alarm is lifted.

(E) Precautions for the General Assembly of Teams: When an alarm is issued, each team should quickly assemble and prepare for action.

The matters to be noted by students and teachers are described separately below: Student side: Stay in the team. Be quiet. Act swiftly. Two people in a row, holding hands (limited to primary school and kindergarten students). Do not gather in the corridor; form a team in the classroom and walk out. Keep to the left. Like meeting on the road. When two levels meet, the level in the front moves first. Place desks and chairs back in their original positions in the classroom. All doors and windows in the classroom should be opened. Do not carry any books or supplies. Teacher side: Command all actions of students. Lead students to the "team assembly point". Bring the register to check the number of people. Immediately engage in various activities of the school air defense team after the "returning-home team" students leave the school.

(F) After an Alert Alarm, an Emergency Alarm (i.e., an Air Raid Alarm) is Issued: 1. Personnel of the school air defense team should immediately handle the following tasks: Telephone Message Group: Immediately convey the alarm to all personnel in the school to ensure accuracy and speed. Surveillance and Security Group: The person in charge of lighting control should immediately implement air raid control (at night) and pay attention to whether all indoor windows are open. After completing the above tasks, quickly go to the designated shelter to hide. 2. All other personnel staying at school should go to the designated shelter to hide.

(G) An Emergency Alarm is Issued Suddenly Without a Warning Alarm (When an emergency alarm suddenly occurs after the police intelligence report is issued, and the expected work has not yet been completed, it should be handled in the same way as this item).

1. If an emergency alarm is issued within the school's scheduled hours, the principal and other school officials should take the following actions:

Immediately issue an order to suspend classes. Quickly implement the general assembly of teams. Except for the "staying-at-school team", the principal or other school officials should make careful observations. If the journey home for students is within five minutes, they should be ordered to return home (previously stipulated). All personnel of the school air defense team should immediately engage in the prescribed work. Other personnel in the school should immediately lead them to the designated shelter to take refuge.

2. If an emergency alarm is issued outside of the school's scheduled hours, the following actions should be taken: Personnel of the school air defense team, such as the team leader, deputy team leader, group leaders, and members (pre-arranged duty roster), must immediately go to the school to engage in air defense work. Other personnel must assist in air defense matters at home.

3. If an emergency alarm is issued on the way to school or on the way home from school, the following actions should be taken: Take refuge in a nearby shelter and must not linger on the street.

Section 5: Measures to be Taken in the Event of Air Raid Damage

The leader of the school air defense team should adapt to the situation and seek the cooperation and mutual assistance of each group.

The person in charge of aerial surveillance in the surveillance and security group must pay attention to the direction of the enemy plane's bombing and quickly report to the team leader. The surveillance and security group personnel, if they find incendiary bombs falling, should immediately shout loudly or knock on copper or iron utensils to inform the fire prevention group to rush to rescue. Even if no bombs are seen falling, they must carefully check toilets, patios, under beds, storage areas, etc. for any damage.

When an incendiary bomb falls, the fire prevention group should immediately call the fire department and the police station.

Regardless of the type of incendiary bomb, the first priority is to put out the fire immediately.

In the event of a fire, efforts should first be made to prevent the spread of the fire, and then to extinguish the burning location.

If there is a sound of bombing nearby during firefighting, immediately lie flat on the ground or use a nearby shelter to avoid harm.

If the school building is in danger of spreading fire, the doors and windows should be closed immediately.

If the fire is too large and initial firefighting is difficult, immediately call the fire department and the police station for assistance.

When there are casualties, the first priority is to rescue them from danger, administer the minimum amount of first aid, and quickly escort them to the first aid location.

### The Municipal Government Invited Social Leaders to a Cordial Tea Party Yesterday to Discuss Issues Such as Stabilizing People's Livelihood and Public Security

In order to discuss the issues of stabilizing the people's livelihood and public security in this city, the Municipal Government specially invited social leaders of this city to hold a cordial discussion at 5:30 p.m. yesterday (12th), hosted by Secretary-General Luo Jian. The attendees included Wen Lanting, Huang Jinrong, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Li Sihao, Zhao Jinqing, Zhu Boquan, Pei Yunqing, Tang Shoumin, Shen Siliang, Chen Binhe, Jin Xiongbo, Xu Xiaochu, Huang Xuanping, Zhang Weiru, Tang Xinghai, Wang Boyuan, Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Fuxiao, Xu Guanqun, Wu Zhenxiu, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Riping, Gu Nanqun, Zhu Rutang, and more than 20 other people.

Secretary-General Luo Delivers a Speech

Secretary-General Luo delivered a speech first, saying: "Today, Mayor Zhou invited everyone to discuss the public security and livelihood issues of this city, but due to diarrhea and fever, he was unable to attend in person. I am honored to attend on his behalf. Thank you very much for attending. The Municipal Government will make every effort to maintain the public security of this city. This time, the Municipal Government has specially joined forces with the Security Headquarters and mobilized all police, neighborhood watch personnel, self-defense team members, security inspector brigades, and security special task forces to put forth effort to strictly maintain the public security of the entire city. In addition, although the Municipal Government has various countermeasures for livelihood issues such as finance, food, and prices in this city, we hope that everyone will cooperate and work together for the stability of the people's livelihood in this most difficult period. As for the phenomena of a few citizens acting rashly the other day, it is even more regrettable. We also hope that everyone will use their status as social leaders to guide and correct them and maintain order and tranquility."

Then Mr. Wen Lanting delivered a speech (the speech can be found in this newspaper's editorial). Mr. Zhao Jinqing, Mr. Zhang Weiru, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, Mr. Chen Riping, Mr. Wang Boyuan, and others expressed their opinions on issues such as finance, markets, food, and the resumption of business in the city. Deputy Secretary-General Hu and Director of the Economic Bureau Liu successively reported on various countermeasures such as food. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 p.m.

Food and Finance Issues

Regarding the food issue in this city, the Municipal Government has considered countermeasures and decided to ensure that the source is sufficient and stabilize the people's livelihood. Liu Xingchen, Director of the Economic Bureau, reported that household flour and miscellaneous grains will be shipped and distributed to citizens soon. A large amount of flour and rice will be transported to Shanghai from other counties in the near future for adjustment. There is no need to worry about the future of food.

Regarding the issue of the market opening for trading, the Shanghai Securities Exchange and the Gold Securities Market will resume normal business operations from today (13th).

In terms of stabilizing finance, silver and money houses will operate as usual from today (13th). At the same time, they will continue to handle small loans but will refuse loans for speculative purposes.

Regarding the resumption of business for various stores, the Economic Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will separately convene meetings of representatives from various industries. The Economic Bureau will convene a meeting of major trade associations at 11:00 a.m. today (13th), and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will reconvene a meeting of all directors and supervisors this afternoon (13th) to discuss and promote the full resumption of business. At the same time, Director Liu and Chairman Yuan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce both deeply hope that all industries and residents in the city will abide by the intentions of the authorities and strive to economize on consumption and avoid unnecessary waste.

On the 11th, the China Revitalization Corporation donated 100 million yuan in cash and 300 million yuan in medicine to the Municipal Government for the purpose of relieving the wounded and affected people of the air raids. It entrusted the Municipal Welfare Association to distribute them. Deputy Secretary-General Hu of the Municipal Government made a special report at the meeting to express his deep gratitude to the spirit of the Allied nations' love for Chinese friendship. He hoped that the association would distribute them appropriately and live up to their good intentions.

### Air Raid Precautions: Strict Enforcement to Continue; Military and Police Authorities Reiterate Previous Orders

Due to the ongoing severe state of war, the city's air defense authorities have noted a growing negligence among citizens regarding air raid lighting control since the night before last. Some have even dismantled air defense equipment, which is highly inappropriate. Therefore, the military and police authorities have reiterated previous orders, directing citizens to continue implementing lighting control measures. After 10:00 PM each night, regular air raid lighting control will remain in effect. All shops, residences, and especially entertainment venues must strictly comply, ensuring that no light is leaked. The military and police, in conjunction with local self-defense corps, will organize lighting inspection teams to patrol all areas of the city. Those found to be violating lighting control measures by allowing light leaks will have their power lines cut and electricity supply terminated as punishment. Furthermore, a collective responsibility system will be enforced, with the entire bao and jia (neighborhood units) in the vicinity being subject to power cuts without leniency. Therefore, citizens are urged to pay close attention and strictly adhere to the regulations to avoid severe punishment.

### Police Station's Investigation Rooms to be Converted into Duty Rooms

To increase work efficiency, the Municipal Police Bureau has successively adjusted its internal organization. At the same time, the investigation rooms of each branch bureau have also been adjusted, in accordance with the police bureau's organization law promulgated by the central government, and converted into duty rooms to comply with the law. Orders have been issued to each branch bureau to implement this change from the day before yesterday.

### Finance, Industry and Commerce to Operate as Usual Today

Following rumors in the city yesterday, merchants and civilians were mutually alarmed and illegally raised prices. To maintain social and economic order, the municipal authorities have decided to take responsibility for stopping these malicious behaviors to prevent unscrupulous citizens from disrupting the market. It is learned that the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank and all banks and money houses in the city will operate as usual today (the 13th), handling payment transactions for customers and continuing to accept deposit and loan requests. However, new loan applications will be temporarily suspended. The gold, securities, and Chinese stock markets will open and trade as usual today, and all companies and commercial firms will open for business.

### Shanghai's Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Experienced Violent Fluctuations Last Week

In the past week, Shanghai's financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions experienced significant fluctuations due to the changes in the international situation, especially the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union. Speculators took advantage of this opportunity to engage in large-scale activities, causing violent changes in the market. The situation was particularly chaotic on Saturday. Fortunately, Mayor Zhou convened meetings with the heads of the gold and stock markets, instructing them to suppress drastic rises and falls. After the relevant financial authorities confirmed measures to maintain financial stability, the chaotic situation began to calm down somewhat.

Gold Certificates

On Monday, when the gold certificate market opened, prices declined due to low morale and widespread selling. The black market price for spot gold fell below the 9,000 yuan level, further discouraging interest in gold certificates. Prices rebounded slightly before closing, with the closing price at 9.8 million yuan, a slight decrease of 200,000 yuan from the closing price on the previous Saturday. The fifth-term gold certificate also decreased slightly by 90,000 yuan, closing at 8.1 million yuan. Due to the difficulty of achieving higher prices for spot gold, the market for gold certificates expiring on Tuesday was unable to open. The fifth-term certificate continued to decrease slightly by 60,000 yuan, closing at 7.5 million yuan. On Wednesday, gold certificates shook off their weak trend, and buying interest revived. Both expiring and fifth-term certificates increased by 300,000 to 350,000 yuan, and the black market price for spot gold exceeded 1,000 yuan, boosting morale. On Thursday, news of changes in the international situation emerged, and financiers rushed to buy expiring gold certificates, pushing the price above the 10 million yuan mark, closing at 11 million yuan, a rise of 850,000 yuan. The fifth-term certificate closed at 8.65 million yuan, a rise of 850,000 yuan. On Friday, morale remained high, and buyers continued to purchase, leading to further price increases. Due to the excessive rise in the black market price for spot gold, the market for expiring certificates was unable to open at a high price. The fifth-term certificate surged by 1.25 million yuan, closing with a squeeze of 1.25 million yuan. The highest price for spot gold was 14,500. On Saturday, the market situation became even more chaotic. Buyers raised prices to purchase, but no one was willing to sell, creating a situation with prices but no market. As a result, there were no official prices for spot gold and gold certificates. Silver bullion rose from 55,000 yuan to over 100,000 yuan, and silver dollars reached as high as seven yuan.

Chinese Stocks

The Chinese stock market was also affected by the situation last week, with morale uncertain, experiencing initial stability, followed by a surge, and finally a return to level. The fluctuations were quite complex, and traders experienced uneven gains and losses. On Monday, the market hovered with stability. While medium-sized stocks saw increases, the three hottest stocks showed weakness and listlessness. However, as many as seventeen small-cap stocks rose to their limits. On Tuesday morning, all large, medium, and small stocks experienced a decline due to reports of tight credit. Bulls and retail investors competed to sell. In the afternoon, some stimulating news emerged, and credit conditions were reported to have eased, suddenly boosting morale. Continuous aggressive buying led to a recovery in all stocks, with more than twenty stocks rising to their limits. On Wednesday, the stock market continued to rise following the high prices of gold. There was a strong desire to buy, and the upward trend was unstoppable. A wave of buying at high prices was unprecedented, with ninety-one large, medium, and small stocks hitting their daily limits. On Thursday, the situation became even more turbulent, with another ninety-eight stocks hitting their daily limits. Some buyers were even willing to secretly add 30-50% to the limit price to purchase. Buyers were everywhere, as speculators took the opportunity of the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union to push up the stock market, making absorbing stocks the best strategy for preserving assets. On Friday, the municipal authorities, concerned about the chaotic stock market's impact on the financial system and social economy, instructed the securities exchange authorities to suppress drastic rises and falls in stocks. Any violation of the law would be severely punished, thus curbing the upward trend. On Saturday, due to changes in the international situation, brokers urged buyers and sellers to settle their transactions. Bulls aggressively sold, causing all stocks to plummet, but the market was much more stable than other markets, with moderate trading volume.

Commodity Prices

As for industry and commerce, at the beginning of last week, most gold and stock market speculators sold their gold and stocks, shifted their focus, and purchased essential food items. As a result, market prices rose accordingly. Rice, grains, oil, sugar, and flour all increased in price. The prices of goods sold by companies and commercial firms uniformly increased by 50% to 70%. Cotton textiles, wool fabrics, and daily necessities such as matches, soap, and candles also increased accordingly. The upward trend became even more severe in the second half of the week, with the market seemingly in a state of extreme chaos. Although this situation was caused by special events, it is hoped that the municipal authorities and the industrial and commercial sectors will work together to maintain the overall livelihood and security of the people and stabilize the social economy in order to curb the crisis.

### Brief News

The fifth issue of the comprehensive large-scale magazine New Century Monthly, New Century, will be published on the 14th. Essays include: A Brief History of Modern Warfare, How to Avoid War, Why Germany Was Defeated, and Reportage Literature includes three pieces such as "The Evening of the White Horse Association." There is also a special collection of short stories by emerging writers, and Qiu Shimou's masterpiece "Tide," etc. The second edition of New Century, Issue 3, has also been published.

"A Brief History of Shanghai's Talents in Various Industries" Nearing Sell-Out: "A Brief History of Shanghai's Talents in Various Industries," edited by Xu, records the talents of Shanghai's various industries over the past five or six years, their experiences in business, and their academic achievements, without bias or prejudice. It aims to value talent and add to the historical record of Shanghai's culture. It is distributed by the Longwen Bookstore in the Salt Industry Building on Beijing Road and is reportedly nearing sell-out.

Sports

### "Old Men's" Small Ball Game Opens Yesterday

The invitation and friendship tournament of "Old Men's" small ball opened at the Donghua Stadium at 4 PM yesterday. Mr. Sun Zhimin, Yao Yuqin and Shang Shengbai were specially invited to kick off the game, and Ms. Wang Danfeng also came to the stadium to present flowers. Four exhibition matches were played, each lasting ten minutes. The results are as follows:

### Mr. Zhao Ruheng Donates Book for Charity Sale to Help Students

Mr. Zhao Ruheng's book "Research on the Practice of the Doctrine of the Mean," published by the Chinese Knowledge and Action Society, is rich in content and essential reading for self-cultivation. He generously donated 400 copies to this office yesterday for a charity sale, with all proceeds going to student aid. Each copy is priced at 2,000 yuan. Readers are encouraged to purchase enthusiastically.

Dedicating Memorial Expenses to Student Aid

Mr. Pan Jiyan wrote yesterday, "The lunar calendar's Zhongyuan Festival is the anniversary of my late father (Runzhigong). I should recite sutras to commemorate him and fulfill my filial piety. At this time of difficult material conditions, I respectfully follow my late father's legacy of advocating frugality. I will specifically allocate these expenses to donate 300,000 yuan each to your newspaper's and the News Report's student aid funds to express my condolences. I have attached a check. Please accept it."

Regular Teams

Team 367: Pan Jiyan Commemorates Late Father Team: 300,000 yuan

Team 368: Nian Ci Team: 100,000 yuan

The above totals 500,000 yuan, bringing the total to 60,076,900 yuan.

### Joint Report on Maternity Assistance for Poor Women by This Office and Huisheng Hospital

This office has contracted with Huisheng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital to provide free maternity assistance. In July, each pregnant woman received food totaling 15,000 yuan. During this time of rising commodity and drug prices, the amount of 15,000 yuan is actually far from sufficient. The hospital still has to cover the difference and provide enthusiastic service, which is admirable. In July, a total of 29 women were hospitalized for childbirth, and all recovered well. The total cost was 435,000 yuan, all paid directly to the hospital by this office, with no further expenses for the pregnant women. The names of the pregnant women who received assistance are recorded below:

Wang Guifeng gave birth to a boy, Jin Xumin gave birth to a boy, Xi Qianshi gave birth to a girl, Chen Yushi gave birth to a boy, Yang Lishi gave birth to a boy, Tong Chenshi gave birth to a boy, Yang Zhao Huizhen gave birth to a girl, Wang Xiaoshi gave birth to a boy, Lu Chenshi gave birth to a girl, Qin Shenshi gave birth to a boy, Shen Agu gave birth to a boy, Wang Qinshi gave birth to a girl, Huang Zhangshi gave birth to twin boys, Li Zhengshi gave birth to a boy, Tan Wushi gave birth to a boy, Jin Lushi gave birth to a girl, Hu Linshi gave birth to a girl, Liu Tangshi gave birth to a boy, Li Shaoshi gave birth to a boy, Chu Shenshi gave birth to a girl, Du Lushi gave birth to twin girls.

### An Appeal to the Elders of Various Temples in This City for a "Buddhist Nine-Family Team"

— Mika

I remember reading an article in the Shen Bao last December by Zhou Yuying, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau, entitled "An Appeal to Monks and Taoists in This City to Devote Themselves to Social Welfare Enterprises." I felt ashamed for the elders of various temples in this city, that they do not even have a basis to establish, nor have they ever thought about establishing, this simplest and most realistic kind of welfare enterprise. About two months passed like this. Because of matters related to the City Buddhist Association, I first met with Director Zhou. At that time, due to Secretary-General Hu's introduction, we discussed the issue of Buddhist reform for a full hour. In conclusion, the Director said, "I am also a Buddhist believer. However, monks are relatively selfish, which is truly the misfortune of Buddhism." Although the Director gave me personal encouragement and expectations as we parted, my face was already red with shame.

Recently, this city has been bombed several times in succession. I have only heard that a certain temple is about to be dissolved, that a certain temple is afraid that Buddhist affairs will fade and problems will arise in their lives, and some have even sold their provisions to prepare for their own escape. In short, all are based on selfishness. They turn their thoughts and create worries within a small circle, without ever thinking about what we Buddhist monks should do in this time of war and turmoil. Those who usually mark themselves with "Promoting the Dharma is a family affair, benefiting sentient beings is a real enterprise" have also disappeared.

This time, the City Buddhist Association initiated a Buddhist Air Raid Rescue Team. After several meetings, the elders of the various temples seemed to be reluctantly going through the motions without fulfilling their own responsibilities, nor did they have the religious enthusiasm for humanity that they should possess. Moreover, they lacked unity. Every time when it comes to public welfare enterprises, they lack the spirit of Buddhists in terms of economic responsibility. Before the incident, although a few virtuous friends, such as Master Taixu, had vigorously appealed for "more service to society," their response was "apathy" or cold irony.

After the incident, a part of Shanghai, due to the complex and intertwined environment, achieved considerable prosperity. Many temples also experienced a relatively glorious golden age. At the same time, those Buddhist gold-diggers also moved to this "adventure playground." As a result, heaven does not fail those who are willing, and everyone "got what they wanted" and "everyone was happy." Precisely because of this relationship, the more selfish people are, the less interested they are in Buddhist public welfare. This kind of atmosphere is not only a Jewish way of doing things, it can simply affect the future development of Buddhism.

In the City Buddhist Association's letter of advice to believers to serve fellow citizens affected by air raids, it states: "Are the teachings of the Buddha and the good words usually spoken by Buddhists merely兑现的支票? Are Buddhists purely selfish, cold, and unsympathetic? Everything, everything, now gives us the greatest touchstone!" Mayor Zhou also reported at the Municipal Advisory Committee meeting that "Now fate has destined the citizens of Shanghai to experience this tragic life." Moreover, the devastation of Buddhism in the former Jiangbei area and the confiscation of all religions in Russia after the revolution may be reflections of our future Buddhism. Elders of the various temples, the times have progressed with the war. If we want to win the status of Buddhists in the future, then we must first win the faith of the people in Buddhism today. The only way to do this is to serve the people who are suffering from all kinds of hardships at this time and in this place with the Buddhist spirit of saving the world.

### Key Points of Evacuation Work

— Li Fengchi

Whether in terms of the dangers of air raids, the problem of food supply, or other problems, evacuating the population is an urgent task for Shanghai.

In order to meet the needs, the municipal government has established the Shanghai Special Municipality Population Evacuation Committee to handle this matter. The committee gathers talents from all walks of life and shoulders the huge responsibility of evacuating one million people. Judging from the complexity of the procedures and the difficulty of the environment, it is indeed an arduous task. However, if it is approached with a spirit of collective effort, perseverance, and unwavering commitment, it is certain that it will proceed smoothly and achieve the ideal result. I will briefly present my humble opinion for your reference.

Preparatory work to be carried out in advance:　Publicity: Newspapers, publications, screens, and slogans should be carried out simultaneously to make citizens understand the urgency of evacuation and encourage those who can leave Shanghai to return to their hometowns.　Transportation: Planning for boats and vehicles, safety along the way, tidying up of stations and docks, and how to limit and utilize the return journey of boats and vehicles.　Destination: For the preparation of destinations, assuming that the towns, villages, counties and cities near the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, and the triangular area of Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou are the destinations, we should first pay attention to the security and saturation point of the receiving capacity of each town and city, and establish contact with the military and political authorities and the various native place associations in each district.

Those to be evacuated, whether as a group or individually, can be divided into two categories:

Volunteers: A. Those who have a destination and the ability to go: provide various assistance, such as the purchase of tickets, the handling of ships, the relaxation of baggage limits, and the issuance of certificates to avoid the trouble of inspection. If there are remaining houses and furniture in Shanghai, a small number of people must be left to take care of them, and they should receive the same protection to prevent accidental losses. B. Those who have a destination but do not have the ability to go: in addition to the assistance in item A, provide economic assistance. C. Those who have the ability but no destination (such as Shanghai locals or those who have been in Shanghai for a long time and have lost contact with their hometown for a long time): can follow Mr. Kang Yuanjun's method of opening up Dongting Mountain as an evacuation area for Shanghai residents (please refer to the third issue of Shanghai Municipal Affairs). D. Those who have neither a destination nor the ability to go: in addition to providing various assistance, we must also consider their talents and abilities to find them a place to settle down, so as not to fall into the wrong path. This is the most difficult to handle and can be handled slowly. E. The relocation of factories, although more troublesome, has a great impact on the evacuation effect. The relocation of a factory with a large scope will inevitably involve several related small factories and a large number of workers. Therefore, if a factory wants to move, we should try our best to help it.

Compulsory: A. Charity groups, charity groups rely on donations from all walks of life to maintain themselves. If they can evacuate to a place far away from Shanghai, the cost will be saved due to the low price of rice and firewood. The area west of Taihu Lake is the most ideal area. It is said that the price of rice there is only 10,000 yuan per stone. Those who are worried about the security there, charity groups have nothing to do with this. B. Monks and Taoists can be evacuated to the mountains west of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, where there are many temples and monasteries, and the buildings are large. Moreover, the temple property is rich, and in addition to reciting sutras, they can also engage in planting and cultivate for themselves. This is the best way. C. Prisoners should be transferred to other places according to the length of their sentences. Detailed measures should be formulated by the judicial authorities. D. Evacuate people to a more distant place, find ways to settle them down and assign them work, so as not to disturb the local good people. E. Schools, including all schools above middle school, should be moved to a place closer to Shanghai. The area near the Beijing-Shanghai Line of Taihu Lake is the most suitable.

If those who come specifically requesting evacuation are not restricted, then those who leave will leave on their own, those who come will come on their own, or those who leave and return, or those who come but do not leave. In this way, not only will the effect not be achieved, but it will also be a waste of manpower and financial resources. Therefore, when the evacuation begins, restrictions on the population entering the city should be implemented at the same time. The so-called restrictions are by no means a complete cut off of the route to Shanghai. Those who are engaged in peddling and transporting goods, merchants who purchase goods, and even those who visit relatives and friends and those who are purely staying for a while, should also be allowed to enter the city. What is restricted is only the date of stay in Shanghai. Restriction measures:

Stop issuing residence permits to people from other cities entering Shanghai.　Restrict the long-term rental of hotels and apartments to outsiders. Set a reasonable deadline.　Restrict households from accommodating friends from other cities for a long-term stay. Set a reasonable deadline, and the Baojia is responsible for the investigation. Those who exceed the deadline will be urged to leave Shanghai.　Set up a travel permit issuing office at the entrance. For people entering the city holding a non-Shanghai residence permit, the residence permit will be exchanged for a travel permit, stipulating a time limit. It should be returned when leaving the city. We must strive for simple procedures and avoid disturbing the people.

### Methods for Displaced Persons to Apply for Cash to Prevent Abuse

— Shizhou

The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has officially begun a trial implementation of the "Cash Application for Returnees" program starting on the 6th of this month, with a limit of one million yuan per person. In addition, remittance services are also being offered, which will be of great benefit to the evacuation of the city's population. However, if we carefully examine the detailed rules promulgated by the Central Reserve Bank, we will find that there are still some important shortcomings in the Central Reserve Bank's methods that urgently need to be addressed. I will now discuss them one by one:

The original article states in item 1 that "Applicants for cash for returning to their hometowns should provide a guarantor." In fact, if the applicant is familiar with the guarantor, or if the applicant is a relative of the guarantor, it is very easy for the guarantor to collude with the applicant and commit fraud. Therefore, the guarantor cannot absolutely guarantee that the applicant will definitely return to their hometown or will definitely be able to return in the short term.

In addition, the applicant should also have a "Baojia Removal Certificate." The procedure is to first fill out a removal certificate at the Baojia office, and then have it signed and stamped in order by the Jia head, Bao head, joint Bao head, and police station, which can then be used as proof for applying for cash. However, after obtaining the above removal certificate, the applicant still has the right to reside in their original place, because the departure date is not fixed, or there are other matters that have not been completed. Therefore, if the Central Reserve Bank issues cash to the applicant solely on the basis of this removal certificate and guarantor letter, even if it is later discovered that the applicant has no intention of leaving Shanghai, the authorities cannot force the applicant to leave Shanghai immediately simply because they have received cash. In other words, if the applicant does not leave Shanghai immediately after receiving the cash, it does not constitute a crime of deceiving the authorities. How can the authorities distinguish between truth and falsehood? It is even more impossible to have a legal basis for accusing and punishing them for deception. In such a situation, if there are some lawless people who are greedy for profit and make use of the imperfections in the above-mentioned documents to apply for cash from the Central Reserve Bank, is the Central Reserve Bank prepared to treat this large group of applicants, both genuine and false, in the same way?

The original text of item 4 states: "Applicants can collect cash upon presentation of the receipt three days after depositing the bill, and their residence should be recorded at the time of deposit in order to investigate in advance and prevent abuse." The Central Reserve Bank believes that this essential procedure can prevent abuse, but may I ask, if the applicant does not leave Shanghai after obtaining the cash and completing all the proof procedures, what methods will the Central Reserve Bank use to deal with it?

In order to prevent abuses, I now offer the following supplementary method:

The Central Reserve Bank should immediately issue a notice, roughly stating: "Those who apply for cash for returning to their hometowns at this bank should leave Shanghai within ten days after receiving the cash, in order to comply with the original intention of this bank to assist in the evacuation work by vigorously handling 'Cash Applications for Returnees'." Each applicant should immediately prepare a report stating the date of departure from Shanghai within ten days after leaving Shanghai, and have it signed and stamped by their Bao head, Jia head, and neighbors' heads, and mail it to this bank by registered mail as proof. Baojia heads should also immediately report to this bank in writing when residents in their Bao move out of Shanghai. If the bank does not receive a report within ten days after the cash is paid that the applicant has left Shanghai within the prescribed time limit, the original amount should be recovered from the original guarantor, and they should be doubly punished. If the applicant is unable to leave Shanghai within ten days, they should also return the original amount to this bank in person within this prescribed time limit and reapply when the departure date is determined, in order to prevent abuses."

After implementing the above method, those who attempt to take advantage of loopholes will certainly not be willing to risk being humiliated by the Baojia heads for petty gains. The Central Reserve Bank can avoid unnecessary omissions. I hope that the Central Reserve Bank will give this method serious consideration and implement it.

### Building New Parks

— Zhang Mengzhao

Half of a citizen's health requires rich food and nutrition, and the other half requires clean, fresh air. However, in this noisy and bustling city of Shanghai, most citizens are suffocating day and night from inferior food and polluted air. They cannot come into contact with natural scenery. After being exhausted by the labor driven by life, finding a few convenient amusement parks (parks) is like looking for fish in a tree!

I believe that the nutrition of air is more important than the nutrition of food. Exposure to ultraviolet rays from sunlight can eliminate latent bacteria, and inhaling fresh air can protect the health of the lungs. If the ideal of realizing many "new parks" can be achieved, then every spring and autumn, whether it is the working class or the intellectual class, they can stroll through them day and night, cultivating their body and mind, and enjoying their spirit, forgetting the heavy pressure of being exploited by life, and enhancing the physical and mental health of the citizens, reducing the invasion of diseases. This really depends on having more and more parks.

Building new parks does not require a large area, but it needs to be an open area with grass and trees, so that people can have a place to place their spirits. The current Zhongshan Park (Zhao Feng Garden) is too far away, Gujiazhai Park has stopped being open for a long time, and the Bund Park is too small and crowded. It's too troublesome. It would be best to ask the municipal construction authorities to follow the example of the Aili Garden, and order many private gardens with foreign-style residences to turn private property into public property, assist them with the technical talents of horticulturalists, provide them with considerable financial subsidies, and send gardeners to arrange flowers and trees. All pavilions and buildings must meet the standards of municipal management, and police officers should be ordered to guard them twice in the morning and evening. I think that private garden owners will be happy to comply and turn private property into public property, benefiting the public health of citizens and benefiting the people. I hereby put forward a suggestion, hoping that the authorities will adopt it to improve the health of citizens, which is truly beneficial.

### Further Discussion on Strengthening Air Defense Shelters

— Wulin

Air defense shelters, as the name suggests, are of course built to protect the lives of citizens during air raids. In principle, citizens should value air defense shelters as if they were their second life; but the fact is just the opposite. The following points should be eliminated and improved in the air defense shelters dug in the urban area:

Air defense shelters that were once "open-air toilets" and "public garbage bins" have now, unfortunately, become a good place for purchasers to arbitrarily discard melon peels, because many stalls selling watermelon and yellow essence melon have been newly added along the way. As a result, melon peels are scattered everywhere, attracting more lazy worms; and after accumulating for a long time, the stench evaporates, making people want to vomit.

The large amount of sand, mud, and stones dug out of the trenches are mostly scattered around the trenches by the diggers when they are completed, without being tidied up. As a result, a lot of it falls back into the trenches. Often when the wind comes, the sand and dust fly, covering the whole city, which is not only harmful to the cleanliness of the streets, but also helps to promote the spread of infectious diseases, which will inevitably get out of control once they occur, because the urban population is already crowded.

Although there are already many large and small air defense mounds dug in the urban area, unfortunately, most of them are unusable. They are either too shallow or too narrow, and do not conform to the standard size. Especially the personal air defense shelters, some are even only one foot deep, and it is impossible to even hide a child. In addition, it has been found that many of the walls of the personal air defense shelters have many large stone locusts embedded in them, which is extremely dangerous; if a bomb falls nearby, pedestrians will rush to escape, and will inevitably not have time to pay attention to the details in the trenches, and will jump into them, touching these stone locusts, which could cause minor injuries or serious death. The most unacceptable thing is that those large air defense shelters that have been perfectly covered have collapsed before they have been used even once. How can people not be afraid of their fragility! Regarding the strengthening of air defense shelters, I have a few personal opinions for reference and adoption.

Ban vendors selling watermelon, yellow essence melon, and other retail stalls along the way, or at least order them to be responsible for preventing purchasers from discarding melon peels in the air defense shelters. Violators should be arrested by patrolling police officers or self-defense team members or nearby residents and sent to the station for investigation.

The air defense authorities should cooperate with the Baojia police officers to thoroughly remove the dirt in the air defense shelters, and must always maintain their cleanliness. This work can be assigned to the self-defense team members on duty to be responsible for guarding them. Any accumulated water should be drained away, and any dirt should be removed. As far as possible, it is best to often sprinkle disinfectant such as Aoyao water to eliminate microorganisms. When the self-defense posts are replaced, they should first inspect the air defense shelters under their jurisdiction for a week. If there is no unclean place, then hand over the post to make clear the responsibilities. Because air raids may occur at any time, air defense shelters must be used at any time, and the cleanliness inside the shelters cannot be neglected for a moment.

For air defense shelters that are poorly handled or unusable, the passive approach is to simply fill them in, so as not to become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies, and obstruct the road. The active approach is to order the diggers to immediately rebuild them, or deepen them, or widen them, or remove the stones, or pile up the sand, mud, and gravel scattered around the air defense shelters, and be sure to rebuild them into air defense shelters that can be "used" and can "defend against air raids."

Regarding the personal air defense shelters dug along the way and the unfinished large air defense shelters, it is often heard that pedestrians accidentally fall into them, which is quite a suffering. Some people advocate erecting a red light sign with "Beware of Danger" nearby for identification, but in fact, it is not necessary. The most appropriate way to deal with unfinished air defense shelters is of course to complete them as soon as possible, but do not be careless again, so as not to waste effort. As for personal air defense shelters, it is enough to paint a white circle around them to identify them; moreover, it saves on procedures and costs. Furthermore, all large and small air defense shelters are mostly dug along the side of the pedestrian road. If you are careful when walking, the possibility of accidentally falling is very small.

During each air defense drill, air defense shelter evacuation should also be included as a training item to become proficient in using air defense shelters for evacuation, and on the one hand, to promote citizens' love and cleanliness of air defense shelters.

The air defense authorities should send personnel to inspect air defense shelters in various places at any time, giving warnings to those who are negligent and correcting those who are bad, in order to achieve perfect results.

In the midst of strengthening the air defense system, please do not forget the most common and most important air defense shelters!

### Promoting Economical Eating Methods

— Zhai

At this time of high food prices, we should carefully consider frugality in everything. Economical eating methods have also emerged in response to the times. The so-called economical eating method is to make economical considerations for people's three meals a day, so that not only is the cost lower, but also the nutrition should not be reduced, so as to fill the stomach. In my opinion, it can be divided into the following three types:

Implementing a One-Meal-Two-Congee System: Before the war, when rice prices were low, it can be said that most families ate rice for three meals a day. However, at present, it is really too uneconomical, so the one-meal-two-congee system has been widely adopted. The so-called one-meal-two-congee system is to change rice to congee for breakfast and dinner, while rice is still eaten for lunch. This way, not only is the amount of rice consumed less, but also the nutritional value is not lost. Because rice is starch, eating too much does not provide much nutrition. Instead, it fills the stomach and is difficult to digest, which is not in line with hygiene. This method is especially suitable for dinner, because people sleep soon after dinner, so changing rice to congee makes digestion easier. However, the disadvantage of this system is that it makes people hungry easily. To remedy this, it is best to shorten the time between meals, so that its drawbacks can be avoided.

Using Miscellaneous Grains as Much as Possible: Rice prices are certainly very expensive, but miscellaneous grains will never be more expensive than rice prices, because rice is regarded as the main food, while miscellaneous grains are relatively secondary. For example, various beans, wheat, and flour, corn and corn flour, their nutritional components are no less than rice, because they all contain rich vitamins. For example, eating red beans can remove dampness and prevent athlete's foot; eating green beans can cool down and prevent heatstroke; wheat and corn contain a lot of starch, and after being ground into powder, digestion and absorption are easy. Therefore, the effect of miscellaneous grains can be said to be worth noting. I hope everyone will implement the use of miscellaneous grains, so that the consumption of rice can be saved a lot.

Designating a Few Days Each Month to Eat Only Miscellaneous Grains: The function of miscellaneous grains is as described above, and the taste is also very good. We designate a few days in a month, or designate any month in each week as a miscellaneous grain day, so that rice is definitely not needed. For example, eat red bean soup this Sunday, green bean soup next Sunday, and then eat noodles, corn flour pancakes, etc. By analogy, this way, on the one hand, we can change the taste, and on the other hand, we can break the traditional habit of relying on rice for food, which can be said to be a double gain.

I have personally experienced the above three methods. The first method has been practiced for a long time and has become a habit. It does not feel inconvenient, but instead promotes digestion. For the second method, my family implements oatmeal or corn flour for breakfast, and red beans or cowpeas for lunch. For dinner, we usually cook the leftover rice from lunch into rice porridge. Since then, the body is indeed healthier than before, which can be known from the light footsteps when walking. As for the third method, there are many ways to eat. In addition to the above, there is also eating potatoes (foreign taro) recently. The method is to cook potatoes with lard and shallots, which is both fragrant and easy to digest. It is indeed a food with a special flavor, so everyone may want to try it.
