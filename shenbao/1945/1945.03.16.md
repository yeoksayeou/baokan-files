### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Northern Region of Iwo Jima; Japanese Garrison Units Launch Raids and Inflict Damage on the Enemy

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On Iwo Jima, fighting was exceptionally intense throughout the 13th. The main focus of enemy attacks remained the Japanese positions in the northern region. Instead of relying on artillery fire and flamethrowers, the enemy used aerial bombs. The Japanese garrison units, facing this overwhelming enemy pressure, tenaciously defended their strongholds and fought bravely. At 8:00 PM on the 13th, the situation remained unchanged from dusk, with the two sides locked in a stalemate. Japanese garrison units occasionally launched raids from their positions, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. The enemy was also heavily guarded against Japanese close-quarters combat attacks. On the morning of the 13th, enemy tanks advancing towards the southern face of the northern region opened fire with flamethrowers near Japanese positions, approximately 100 meters away, and began to advance. On the Motoyama front, enemy tanks equipped with flamethrowers attempted to penetrate Japanese positions from the morning of the 13th, leading to fierce fighting with the Japanese garrison. Furthermore, the results of the fighting in the northern region on the 12th were: over three hundred enemy soldiers killed, one aircraft destroyed. On that day, in the northern region alone, enemy losses reached over eight hundred and fifty.

Central Pacific Base, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Enemy artillery fire against the northern part of Iwo Jima intensified on the 13th, and enemy transport ships approached the northern region of the island. In the afternoon, the enemy launched a full-scale attack, and fierce fighting is currently underway on all fronts. Powerful enemy units in the northern sector, under the cover of a dozen tanks, advanced on Japanese positions with flamethrowers. Enemy units on the Motoyama front, covered by several tanks, also launched an attack on Japanese positions, but were eventually repulsed by the Japanese garrison after fierce fighting.

### Japan Thoroughly Evacuates Urban Population

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In light of the intensified air raids and the shifting war situation, the government is further strengthening the defense of Tokyo and other major cities and promoting the establishment of a decisive battle system. From the viewpoint of defense and food countermeasures, the government is rapidly implementing a thorough evacuation of people from key cities. On the 15th, the "Outline for Strengthening the Evacuation of Major Cities" was discussed at an extraordinary cabinet meeting. After an explanation by Interior Minister Ota, it was decided and announced by the Information Bureau on the same day. The main focus of the outline is the thorough dispersal of personnel from key cities in Japan to various locations inland, shifting them towards local production.

### Japanese Finance Minister Delivers Financial Speech

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Finance Minister Tsushima attended the general meeting of the Bankers Club on the afternoon of the 14th and delivered his first financial speech since taking office, stating in brief: Future policies must focus on agility and proceed with the principle of speed, implementing decisive reforms of the Ministry of Finance's administrative structure. Future policies for the financial sector include the merger of local banks and savings banks and the centralized management of funds. Major banks also need to adopt this approach. He also stated that the entire financial control mechanism must be reviewed and reformed, and he assured that the government's funds would be strictly scrutinized thereafter.

### Investigation Report on Dongting Mountain (3)

— Yifei

(2) Because it is difficult for villagers to make a living, they have dismantled their houses one after another, transporting the timber, bricks, and tiles to Suzhou for sale. As a result, the whole town is full of ruins and broken walls. Although this trend has slowed down slightly, most of the houses have already been demolished. Rent in Dongshan is quite cheap; a three-room house rents for about 1,000 yuan per month, but it is not easy for outsiders to rent. There are very few fixed-term lease agreements between landlords and tenants. Under the influence of Suzhou, some new tenants are paying rent in rice.

(3) In addition to the fact that half of the houses in Dongting Mountain have been demolished, the trees have also suffered a catastrophe. Most of the larger trees in various places have been sawn down, leaving only the roots. As a result, the mountains are all bare. The future prospects for fruit production are bleak. At present, the price of firewood is also gradually increasing.

(4) The local residents are antiquated in their thinking and disregard science. When women are about to give birth, they still rely on old-fashioned midwives. The "Dongshan Security Hospital" in the former mountain, established by local gentry Ye Zhenmin, offered one hundred free maternity slots, but to date, only seven pregnant women from the whole mountain have gone to the hospital. Furthermore, nineteen out of ten local villagers suffer from malaria; infants and children also often suffer from this disease, commonly known as "fetal malaria," believing in traditional sayings, they leave it to nature and refuse to seek medical treatment, resulting in the deaths of many children. In addition, local hospitals lack medicine, and are often caught off guard in emergencies. Previously, when epidemics such as meningitis and cholera occurred, many people died because there were too few medicines to be distributed.

General Prices: In addition to rice, the prices of other goods are also gradually rising, especially flour and cooking oil, which have risen the fastest. The local prices of various goods on the 8th of this month are listed as follows:

Flour: 500 yuan per catty (360 yuan on the 7th), soybean oil: 1,360 yuan per market catty (rose another 20 yuan per catty on the 9th), adzuki beans: 400 yuan per liter, salt: 400 yuan per market catty, thatch: 1,000 yuan per dan, hardwood: 1,300 yuan (both calculated on a chai scale of 18 taels), pork and chicken: 1,200 yuan per catty (20 taels old scale), green vegetables and spinach: 300 yuan per catty, chives: 400 yuan (imported), soybean sprouts: 240 yuan, shrimp and fish: 600 yuan, chicken eggs: 50 yuan, duck eggs: 70 yuan. Soap: 240 yuan per bar, candles: 800 yuan per stick, small box of matches: 70 yuan.

Overall, the prices of fuel, food, and vegetables listed above are cheaper than those in Shanghai, while the prices of daily necessities are higher than those in Shanghai.

Public Security and Finance: The bandits of Taihu Lake have always been rampant. However, under the stationing of friendly allied security forces in Dongting Mountain, and because the local people are good at coping, the public security situation in the region has been relatively good in recent years, and there have been no major incidents. Residents have been able to live and work in peace, which shows that it is all a matter of human effort.

Before the incident, there were Jiangsu Bank, China Xingye Bank, and Yonghe Money Shop in the area, but they all closed down after the incident. In addition, the pawnshops, which had the mission of regulating the livelihoods of the poor, originally had Yuanyuan and Chongde. Later, due to the passage of undisciplined soldiers in the 26th year (of the Republic of China, 1937), there were many forced pawnings, resulting in losses and closures. Now there are only a few old-fashioned pawnshops that operate in disguise, exploiting the poor with high interest rates. Currently, the most difficult thing for merchants in Dongting Mountain is the lack of cash, which prevents them from importing goods in large quantities. Furthermore, when rice merchants from all over come to trade, they all require cash and refuse to accept checks (mostly from Suzhou), so the purchase and transportation of grain is not smooth. This is also another reason why food shortages easily occur in the area.

Current Education: Dongshan has three complete primary schools and seven junior primary schools, while Xishan has only one county-run junior primary school. There are no middle schools in either mountain. The funding for the schools, especially private schools, relies on donations from gentry and merchants living in Shanghai. For example, Wuben Primary School was established with donations from Ye Zhenmin, Ye Letian, and others.

The tuition fee for county-run primary schools is 450 yuan per semester for lower grades and 600 yuan for higher grades. The cost of books, supplies, and miscellaneous fees is 500 yuan for lower grades and 1,500 yuan for higher grades. In addition, a rice donation of 1,000 yuan is collected. The tuition fee for private schools, including books, etc., is 5,000 yuan for higher grades and 4,000 yuan for middle grades.

Due to the high cost of tuition, most villagers cannot afford to send their children to school, resulting in a large number of children dropping out of school. When this reporter traveled to various mountains, I often saw large groups of children herding sheep and collecting firewood. According to surveys, there are more than 8,000 school-age children in the area, but only 1,600 are currently enrolled (the number of children enrolled this year has increased by one-third). In terms of school units, the school with the most students before the incident was the county-run Wenchang (700 students), and now it is a private school.

As for the treatment of teachers, the new budget for county-run schools has not yet been implemented. Taking Wenchang School as an example, the current base salary for teachers is 130-140 yuan, which is only over 2,000 yuan when calculated at 15 times. In fact, the minimum rice consumption for each teacher is at least two dou per month, plus 7,000 yuan for vegetable expenses, for a minimum living cost of about 14,000 yuan, with a difference of seven times between income and expenditure. Therefore, primary school teachers in the back mountains take turns eating meals in the homes of students every day as a subsidy. Private school teachers are treated better. According to Feng Zhiliang, the principal of Wuben School, the maximum salary for Wuben teachers was 8,000 yuan and the minimum was 4,000 yuan last semester, and this semester it has increased to about 20,000 yuan. This number cannot be compared with the 2,000 yuan of county-run schools.

Due to the meager salaries, the quality of teachers has also decreased. Ordinary teachers are only junior high school graduates, and head teachers are only high school graduates. Even elementary school graduates are teaching third and fourth grade students. The private schools in the back mountains are even more unbearable to mention.

The local educational institution has a "Dongshan Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association" scholarship committee, which subsidizes one-tenth of the total number of students in the mountain. The rest is donated by wealthy gentry and merchants. (End)

### American Forces Continue Fierce Attacks on the Rhine

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Quoting the German official war report released on Wednesday, the German News Agency stated that American forces at the Remagen bridgehead on the Rhine River are continuing their fierce attacks. After pushing the German positions under pressure in the forests and villages, German counterattacks have contained them. German aircraft have joined the battle with great success.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Hai Tong News Agency: Although German forces have retreated to the Rhine River, they still maintain the Yin Er region, Palatinate, and Alsace regions on the west bank. The anti-Axis forces are still focusing on the northern part of the western front, but a simultaneous advance from both north and south is also possible. However, the troop strength in the south will certainly not be as large as that in the north. The US 7th and half of the 3rd Army will likely be the main forces, and units of the French 1st Army may also assist in the battle.

### Soviet Forces in East Prussia Launch New Offensive; Attacks on Stettin Suffer Heavy Losses

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Hai Tong News Agency: Soviet forces yesterday launched a new offensive in East Prussia, deploying seven armies and multiple tank units. Fierce fighting continues in Danzig and Gdynia, but the offensive on the Oder River in front of Stettin and between Küstrin and Frankfurt has slowed down. The focus of the new East Prussian offensive is now northwest of Riechenberg and Neustadt and east of Brandenburg. The offensive launched by Sokolov's troops against the Stettin bridgehead has weakened within 24 hours, and German forces have retaken several key points.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Hai Yong News Agency: Marshal Sokolov has temporarily suspended the fierce attacks on the German bridgehead at Stettin. As of noon on Wednesday, the Soviet army only launched local attacks, which was probably due to excessive damage and the need for reorganization. Sokolov's plan to attack Stettin was to encircle the city from the north and south, but the results were all met with firm resistance. The Soviet army has now moved in a large number of ferries and bridge-building materials, seemingly attempting to establish a bridgehead on the west bank of the Oder River.

### Speech at the Welcome Meeting of Six Organizations
### Alternative 論

### Welcome Governor Ren

— Chen Binhe

——Speech at the Welcome Meeting by Six Organizations——

Today, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association and five other organizations are warmly welcoming Jiangsu Province Governor Ren and other senior officials, which reflects the spirit of unity between officials and the people. Governor Ren is a native of Jiangsu, and the provincial government is now in Suzhou, so I, in my capacity as the vice chairman of the Suzhou Native Place Association in Shanghai, express an extra special welcome.

In the past, Governor Ren served for a long time as the Naval Minister of the central government and the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group. Now, presiding over the administration of Jiangsu Province and concurrently managing public security, he will surely be able to bring his military and political experience to bear in serving his hometown and maximize his effectiveness. As Chairman Li Zanhou said earlier, "Governor Ren is involved in both military and political affairs, is a man of both civil and military talents, and has unified authority, making it possible to achieve unified effectiveness in implementation." This is indeed a very appropriate observation.

Shanghai Municipality is geographically within the scope of Jiangsu Province. Although administrative regions are divided, they cannot be separated geographically. Therefore, economically, they are even more inseparable. In other words, Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality have an interdependent relationship economically, and neither can be separated and independent. For example, Shanghai is an industrial and commercial city with only industrial production and commercial trade, but without agricultural production, especially grain production. Therefore, those engaged in industry and commerce in Shanghai must rely on the agricultural production of Jiangsu Province. On the other hand, most agricultural areas of Jiangsu Province need daily industrial products and must rely on Shanghai for supply. This is an explanation of the interdependent economic relationship between Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality.

Since the economic relationship between Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu Province is so close, each should do its best to exchange with each other. However, the industrial production in Shanghai is now stagnant, and at the same time, there is a grain shortage. It is very obvious that Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality have failed to fulfill their due exchange responsibilities economically. Therefore, in the interdependent relationship, there is a disconnection, and both feel depressed. However, the citizens of Shanghai are not lazy and unwilling to engage in production. In fact, they all hope to exchange their labor and production for a minimum amount of grain to make a living. This is the first point that we hope Governor Ren will help with as much as possible within his authority.

Currently, Shanghai's industrial production is stagnant, and prices are soaring. Most wage earners feel the pain of unemployment and are threatened by the heavy burden of life. At the same time, Shanghai is an important rear base in wartime, and it is very likely to be threatened by enemy air raids in the future. Under these factors, anyone who does not need to stay in Shanghai should be evacuated immediately, especially charitable organizations such as homes for the elderly and children's welfare institutions should be forcibly evacuated. The Shanghai Municipal Government has organized an evacuation committee to actively carry out this work, but in this regard, the assistance of the Jiangsu Provincial Government is extremely necessary. For example, designate certain areas as evacuation sites, which should be a considerable distance from railway lines and not be in vital military areas. In addition, the establishment of security along evacuation transportation lines, especially the convenience of military and police inspections, such as checkpoints along the way, should be given special attention. This is the second point that we hope Governor Ren will fully assist with.

To realize the above two points and promote close ties in the future, we suggest that a regular liaison organization be established between the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government to discuss matters and cooperate on all matters of mutual benefit for officials and people between the province and the city, and to achieve a satisfactory solution through this organization.

Secondly, we also hope that Shanghai industrialists and businessmen will recognize the changes in the times and consider investing in various counties in Jiangsu Province to establish small factories producing various daily necessities, on the one hand to resettle unemployed workers, and on the other hand to maintain their own businesses and plan for future recovery. As for the location of factories, local security, etc., we will of course request the assistance and responsibility of the provincial government.

Yesterday, Governor Ren made a speech, paying special attention to education, saying: "It is better to run more schools than to organize more troops. For the future of the nation, those in power in troubled times should work hard." These are sincere and earnest words. At the same time, Director Yuan has been in charge of Jiangsu Province's education administration for many years and has achieved outstanding results. Recently, he has gained the attention of Governor Ren, so Jiangsu Province's education will surely make great progress in the future. We hope that special consideration will be given to students at all levels evacuated from Shanghai in terms of admission tests and tuition fees. At the same time, practical assistance should also be given to the evacuation of universities and specialized schools in Shanghai.

Finally, I am even more gratified. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet Governor Ren to ask for advice. Governor Ren advocated that Nanjing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu Province should maintain an average level of development in terms of political and economic measures, and should not form a curved development, resulting in distorted phenomena that cannot be coordinated with each other. Now the central government in Nanjing is being refreshed under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, Shanghai is being actively reorganized by Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, and we have already heard about Governor Ren's aspirations for Jiangsu Province. We believe that in the near future, it will definitely become a model area for politics and economics.

### Enemy Aircraft Heavily Damaged in Three Night Raids, Losses Reach 63 Percent

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – Enemy aircraft that attacked the Osaka area on the night of the 13th until dawn on the 14th were intercepted by Japanese air defense forces. As announced by the Imperial Headquarters, 11 were shot down and 60 were destroyed, accounting for 80% of the total number of attacking enemy aircraft, totaling 71. The enemy aircraft carried out night bombings on Tokyo on the 10th, Nagoya on the 12th, and Osaka this time, totaling 350 aircraft. Among them, 52 were shot down by Japanese air defense forces, accounting for 14%, and 160 were destroyed, accounting for 48%. From this, it can be seen that the losses suffered by enemy aircraft in the three night raids actually accounted for 63% of the total.

### International Briefs

Lisbon – Washington reports that the San Francisco Conference will discuss the issue of trusteeships and other dependencies around the world after the war.

Geneva – The U.S. announced that after the ongoing U.S.-Soviet negotiations are completed, the two countries will sign a lease agreement, the nature of which will be the same as the U.S.-France lease agreement.

Stockholm, Sweden – Rome reports that the "Disciplinary Fascist" Commissioner of the Bonomi government was injured in an assassination attempt, and fifteen suspects have been arrested.

### Six Organizations Held Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome Governor Ren, Over Two Thousand People Attended with Great Enthusiasm

Six organizations in the city, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Advisory Committee, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, the Charity Association, and the Suzhou Native Place Association in Shanghai, jointly held a tea party to welcome Jiangsu Province Governor Ren yesterday (15th) at 4:30 p.m. at the Jinmen Hotel. The hosts included Li Sihao, Yuan Fudeng, Jian Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Li Ziyu, Chen Binhe, and others. Governor Ren, along with Chief of Staff Jian Huang, Finance Director Pei Fuheng, Education Director Yuan Shu, Construction Director Sun Yucai, Director Gao Hefei, and General Manager of the Provincial Bank Ren Xiping, arrived on time. Guests from all walks of life included Municipal Secretary-General Luo, as well as various bureau chiefs and directors, including Su Chengde, Xu Jiang, Yuan Junchang, Dai Yingfu, Xu Jidun, Zhou Yuying, Liu Dexuan, Man Qiwei, Li Shiyu, Gu Gangwu, and others. Celebrities from all walks of life included Ye Fushu, Zhao Zhengping, Huang Jinrong, Xi Yunqing, Chen Riping, Shen Siliang, Pan Sansheng, Xiang Kangyuan, Bao Guochang, Fu Qiangeng, Liu Yangshan, Jiang Xiyuan, Chen Guoquan, He Zhuoxian, Zhou Bangjun, Chen Shaowei, Chen Yaofu, Wu Yong'an, Huang Yuzhai, and others, as well as representatives from various industries, including He Wuliang, Song Zhuozai, Cui Shifu, Yao Wenjun, and others, totaling more than two thousand people. After the ceremony, the representatives of the presidium, Li Sihao, gave a welcome speech, followed by Lin Kanghou, who presented a commemorative silver cup on behalf of the group. Governor Ren accepted the cup in person and gave a speech expressing his great gratitude and determination to cooperate on various issues in Shanghai. Then, Municipal Secretary-General Luo and Chen Binhe, chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, gave speeches (Chen's speech can be found in the front-page editorial). Finally, refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned at six o'clock. The speeches are recorded separately as follows:

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Li Guohao said in his speech: "Governor Ren, distinguished Jiangsu Province officials, guests, today, six organizations in Shanghai are welcoming Jiangsu Province Governor Ren and other senior officials. We are very happy to have you here. Although Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality are divided into two administrative regions, geographically speaking, Shanghai Municipality is included within the scope of Jiangsu Province. Outside Shanghai Municipality, the surrounding areas are all administrative regions under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. Therefore, it can be said that the citizens of Shanghai are also citizens of Jiangsu Province. Because of this close relationship, the citizens of Shanghai especially hope that the political clarity of Jiangsu Province will promote and cooperate with the clarity of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, we express our deep expectations for Governor Ren and other responsible officials.

In November of last year, Governor Ren was transferred from Naval Minister to Governor of Jiangsu Province. At the same time, he also served as the Pacification Director and Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group. It can be said that he is involved in both military and political affairs, is a man of both civil and military talents, and has unified authority, making it possible to achieve unified effectiveness in implementation. We hope that Governor Ren will treat the citizens of Shanghai and the people of Jiangsu Province equally, and give full assistance to the areas where the citizens of Shanghai need assistance, such as the recent work of evacuating the population and the most pressing issue of food. On behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, I extend my welcome and wish Governor Ren and all officials good health."

Governor Ren's Speech

Briefly stating that he was unworthy of the hospitality of the six organizations in the city today. Having been in office for several months, I had long planned to come to Shanghai to seek advice from leaders from all walks of life and report on the political situation in Jiangsu Province. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, Mr. Chen Binhe kindly visited me and discussed the general situation of the Jiangsu Province government facilities. I have already published a summary in today's Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao. I hope that all parties will correct me. Now, I will briefly state a few more important points for the education of everyone present:

Regarding the issue of public security, I have always followed the national policy of the National Government of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, and have consistently implemented it for several years. The so-called communist military forces within Jiangsu Province are actually very weak. Except for a small group of the New Fourth Army in Panmian, north of Liuhe, the number of armed communist troops in the other 23 counties is extremely small and has no formal combat capability. The provincial government is closely guarding against this in order to establish public security. This point is not worth worrying about.

In terms of finance, the actual collection of land tax is generally acceptable, except for the guerrilla areas where it is not hindered. Although the results are not very ideal, the provincial treasury has actually increased by 30% to 40% compared to the past, which is not far from the planned target.

Education and construction are the key points of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's policy. I have assumed the overall administrative responsibility of the province. I believe that it is better to run more schools than to train more soldiers. Production and construction are important tasks during wartime, and I am determined to do them responsibly, not just pay lip service. Recently, we have used a section of barren roadbed on the Sujia Road to open up farmland, totaling more than 4,800 mu, which was completed with extremely limited manpower and financial resources. Regarding highway construction, we plan to open three highways between Suzhou and Shanghai first to facilitate transportation. However, the cost is quite large, about 100 million to 200 million yuan. The provincial government will contact the Shanghai Municipal Government to carry out this matter.

Finally, regarding life, especially the life of civil servants, it is naturally more difficult during wartime. However, I believe that civil servants should work hard in their own positions and entrust the solution of livelihood issues to their superiors. This is the only way to improve the spirit of service. The colleagues of the Jiangsu Provincial Government are determined to do so in accordance with this principle. The above is my humble opinion, and I hope that all parties will enlighten me.

Secretary-General Luo's Speech

Briefly stating that I am very happy to attend the welcome meeting for Governor Ren today, despite being ill. I will briefly state one or two of my thoughts: In the past, due to the accumulated habits in the official field, there were many boundaries between provincial and municipal governments or various agencies that did not interfere with each other. That is, there are also many such phenomena in the propositions and facilities between the central and local governments, which is undeniable. Governor Ren and the officials of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Mayor Zhou, and I each bear the responsibility of the local area. We will never have this kind of concept because the region is different. Regardless of the central and local, under one system, it is like the relationship between the limbs and the brain, coordinating and operating without any obstacles. Due to personnel and environmental factors, the two places of Shanghai and Jiangsu are like one family. There should be a very good connection between the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government. From the standpoint of the Shanghai Municipal Government, it should request the Jiangsu Provincial Government to provide practical help and cooperation. At present, the most important points are the evacuation of the population and the replenishment of food. I hope that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will provide unlimited assistance so that the Shanghai Municipal Government can complete its work. Finally, my political thoughts on Governor Ren: I agree with the anti-communism point without any doubt. I feel that anti-communism should be done thoroughly, and its party should not be allowed to take the opportunity to grow in the cracks. We should be vigilant against the tangible – armed communists, and we should also eliminate the intangible – cultural and ideological aspects. This responsibility should be borne by all citizens and the government, especially the leading figures in the society. It is the permanent important problem that everyone should pay attention to, I wish that everyone could achieve this expectation in the same pace and determination.

Training Situation

After the air defense team arrived at the field, they first inspected the bombed field, arranged the guard soldiers, and reported the air defense sentry. Then the whole team mobilized. First, the blocked roads were opened, and the wires cut off around the roads were quickly handled by technicians. Firefighters rushed to the fire site, using soft ladders to climb to the roof, passing buckets, and vigorously putting out the fire. Then, they used ropes to rescue the victims on the upper floor. During the progress of various tasks, they received an alarm from the air defense sentry that enemy aircraft were attacking. All members immediately lay on the ground to take cover. Then, they realized that the bomb dropped was a gas bomb, and all members implemented upwind avoidance again. After the sentry reported that the enemy aircraft had gone west, all members rescued the hypothetical victims of another house that was hit by a bomb and performed emergency surgery on the poisoned people, using ropes and other methods. Then, the new sub-bureau's coroner arrived to examine the bodies. At the same time, a guarantee frame exercise was started.

Brief Commentary

### People's Respect and Awe

General Sun Liangcheng, the Pacification Director of Subei, hosted the various circles and fellow natives of Subei in this city yesterday. On January 19th of this year, the editorial board of this newspaper expressed high expectations for Mr. Sun. The environment of Subei is special and its position is important. Therefore, the military and political affairs of Subei have become the most acute area for competition, and the area where the hearts and minds of the people are most fiercely competed for. Why do we say that? Subei is a peaceful area. If the military and political affairs of Subei are well managed, and better than all aspects, it will not only establish the unanimous faith of the people in the north, but also be enough to influence other peaceful areas to do better. At the same time, bandits and mixed troops cannot compete under the principle of survival of the fittest. This is the problem that the authorities should pay most attention to, and it is also Mr. Sun's greatest responsibility. We believe that the central authorities chose Mr. Sun to preside over the military and political affairs of Subei because the responsibility is arduous, and only those who are honest and capable like Mr. Sun can be competent.

In the speech of the representatives of the fellow natives of Subei, it was hoped that Mr. Sun would achieve the two words "respect" and "awe," which has a profound meaning. It does not mean that Mr. Sun should respect the people and fear the people, but that "good people should respect them, and bad people should fear them." This is the highest administrative efficiency.

We strongly agree with this opinion. We not only hope that Mr. Sun will achieve it, but also hope that the military and political leaders in the peaceful area will achieve it. This is the time when politics is truly clear.
