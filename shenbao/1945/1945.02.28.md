### Japanese Army Achieves Comprehensive Results in Luzon in One and a Half Months: Over 70,000 Enemy Soldiers Killed or Wounded

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy forces landed in Lingayen Gulf on January 9th, the Japanese ground forces on Luzon Island, under the command of General Yamashita, have fought bravely, causing increasing damage to the enemy landing forces. From the date of the enemy American landing until February 23rd, in this one and a half months, the comprehensive results achieved by the Japanese army, in terms of enemy casualties alone, have reached over 70,000. The battle results are recorded as follows: over 70,000 soldiers killed or wounded, 470 artillery pieces destroyed, 18 artillery pieces captured, 235 tanks destroyed or set on fire, 545 various vehicles burned, over 90 aircraft shot down or destroyed, 60 ships sunk or destroyed, 29 other boats destroyed, over 100 shelters destroyed and burned, over 250 heavy machine guns destroyed, and over 130 heavy machine guns captured. These results do not include those achieved at Corregidor Island and by the Japanese air force, and the results in the Banban area are those before February 14th.

Philippine Base, 27th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces on Corregidor in Manila Bay are currently launching fierce attacks with a large amount of material. On the 24th, Japanese and American forces continued to engage in fierce fighting in the central highlands of the island.

Japanese Army in Manila Resist from Buildings

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Manila front, the New York News Manila correspondent reported on the morning of the 26th as follows: Another group of Japanese soldiers, other than those in the old city, have fortified the three major buildings south of the Pasig River—the Legislative Building, the Finance Bureau, and the Bureau of Agriculture and Commerce—into solid fortresses and continue to fight to the death. The roofs and upper parts of these buildings were burned down two weeks ago, and the Japanese army has cleverly built trenches in the basements. Inside these basements, bunkers made of iron sheets and cement are equipped with electric minefields and machine-gun nests. The correspondent also reported on the pincer attack by the Japanese army east of Manila, stating that American forces encountered fierce resistance from the Japanese army in the highlands northeast of Antipolo, ten miles east of Manila. The Japanese forces in that area, holding strong trenches, bombarded the American vanguard with heavy artillery, mortars, and machine guns, hindering the American advance.

### East Asian Nations Should Awaken, Rise Up and Bear the Heavy Responsibility of Defense: Enemy American Attempt to Counterattack the Mainland Will be Difficult to Succeed

Central News Agency Report - The enemy forces that landed on Iwo Jima have suffered nearly 20,000 casualties. Commander Tanaka, the overall commander of the landing operation, has also explained the situation. However, the Japanese side does not believe that the enemy's offensive has weakened as a result. We also do not believe that the enemy's modern warfare is fierce. However, the US's poverty in manpower and material has already affected its boasted operation of landing on the Chinese mainland. This is very obvious. When the Chongqing spokesperson met with reporters on the 7th, he denied the rumor that the US military was using black soldiers in the transport units sailing from India to China. From this fact, it can be proven that it is impossible for the US military to transport a large number of troops to the Chinese mainland to carry out a long-term war against Japan. Therefore, there is a plan to use black soldiers. They attempt to seize command with their own cadres and drive the Chongqing army and black soldiers to sacrifice for them in the war against Japan. For the United States, using Chinese land and manpower to fight against Japan is a consistent ambition since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Now that Chongqing is shouting for a general counteroffensive on the mainland, this is also the American counteroffensive against Japan. The purpose is of course to make Chongqing succumb to its control. Chongqing's war of resistance has lasted for eight years. After the Japanese army carried out a major longitudinal operation on the mainland last spring, Chongqing's combat power suffered a major blow. Even Chongqing itself admits this. Now Chongqing has repeatedly attempted to reorganize the mixed army, but today, the local army still dominates. Judging from its combat power, it is possible to wage war against Japan with only about half of its total strength. Therefore, it is difficult for the counteroffensive against Japan to succeed. According to the investigation, during last year's mainland operation, the enemy fought with approximately 100 divisions, of which 15 divisions were reduced, 45 divisions lost less than half of their strength, and 23 divisions needed to be reorganized. The loss in manpower was approximately 700,000, equivalent to the strength of 50 divisions. The loss in material resources, such as weapons and ammunition, was approximately 30,000 tons. Moreover, important resource production areas such as Guilin, Liuzhou, and Hunan, the gunpowder manufacturing areas of Qingdong, and the agricultural and mineral resource areas were completely lost. It is estimated that the average annual loss of the Chongqing army, excluding war injuries and desertions, was approximately 230,000 in the 30th year of the Republic of China, 210,000 in the 31st year, 240,000 in the 32nd year, and 700,000 in the 33rd year. How to compensate for this loss is considered the most troublesome thing for Chongqing. However, in order to replenish the lost troops each year, it is necessary to reduce strategic units. Therefore, it is attempted to Americanize the army and change its equipment to compensate for the shortage of soldiers. The organization target is approximately 200 to 300 divisions. Once the reorganization is completed, the counteroffensive against Japan will begin immediately. Chongqing's mobilization of 200,000 educated young people to join the army is also for this purpose. In addition, it is planned to improve the treatment of soldiers and replenish ammunition. However, whether the American landing on the Chinese mainland is a blessing for China, the American war aim is to "obtain overseas markets for its own industry." It puts the world into chaos. This is an invasion with a double personality of both waging war and talking about peace. The United States' recent subtle policy toward China has always been to hold Chongqing and attempt to fully utilize China's total strength to counterattack Japan. Their purpose is to make the Chinese sacrifice for them. As the American side said, Chongqing has no happiness to speak of. All that exists is malignant currency inflation and the poverty of the people. The day when Chongqing starts the general counteroffensive against Japan is the time when China will cause great chaos and the day when the war of resistance against Japan will collapse. Since the start of the war, it has been several years. All East Asian nations should immediately awaken, not be tempted by the Anglo-Saxon conspiracy, and rise up to shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending East Asia.

### Japanese House of Representatives Decides to Reconvene in March: Agreement Reached at Yesterday's Consultation Meeting

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese House of Representatives naturally adjourned on February 8th, there has been a high demand for the reconvening of the Diet given the urgency of the situation. Therefore, a Diet consultation meeting was held on the morning of the 27th in the Speaker's reception room to review the issue of reconvening the Diet. As a result, everyone unanimously agreed that the Diet should be reconvened to urgently implement various decisive war policies and demand that the government report on the war situation obtained through the implementation of strong politics. At the same time, they will re-question the government's confidence and other matters. As for the timing and method of reconvening the Diet, it was decided to do so again after a meeting, and a telegram will be sent to the soldiers on Iwo Jima to express gratitude and encouragement. The timing of the reopening will have to take into consideration the situation of the government and the attitude of the Yokusan Seijikai, and the period is approximately in early March.

### Japanese Postal Savings Increase Dramatically

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The national savings amount for the 20th year of the Showa era in Japan was 41 billion yen, of which a portion was postal savings, which had been increasing dramatically every month. In particular, after the fixed-amount savings enhancement campaign was launched from September to October of last year, it increased to 1.17 billion yen. Furthermore, after the decisive battle savings emphasis campaign was implemented in December, it increased to 1.55 billion yen in January. At this point, the monthly target amount for postal savings increase in the 19th year of the Showa era was 1.8 billion yen, which has been completed in ten months. Since the beginning of that year until mid-February, the cumulative net increase has reached a huge amount of 10 billion yen. Compared with the increase of 5 billion yen during the same period in the previous year, it has actually exceeded twice the amount. The current postal savings amount is 29 billion yen, so it will soon break through 30 billion yen.

### Chongqing People's Shipping Company's Poor Business

Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) - The economy under Chongqing's rule is experiencing ever deepening troubles due to soaring prices without end. Recently, the People's Shipping Company, which is jointly operated by the Chongqing government and private individuals, has suffered losses of over 200 million yuan in its business operations in the past year due to the impact of rising prices. It is rumored that if the Chongqing government does not find a way to remedy the situation, its future business will face even greater difficulties. According to the company's business report for the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the price of fuel has risen 550 times higher than before the incident, the steel plates necessary for ship repairs have risen 2,182 times, and rice has risen 538 times. The soaring prices are extremely alarming. Therefore, the balance of income and expenditure has been lost, and the Chongqing authorities have also said that they are helpless.

### Offensive and Defensive War on the Western Front Enters Second Stage: The Important City of Düren Has Been Reduced to Ruins

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: Between the Meuse River and the Eifel region, the enemy has begun to use a large number of tanks, and General Eisenhower's offensive seems to have entered the second stage. Since the infantry and artillery failed to create a large gap in the first three days of the enemy's offensive to allow the tanks to flood in, the heavy losses of the enemy infantry forced their tank corps to come out to charge. The German forces guarding the Ruhr River line completed their mission and retreated to the second line of defense further back. American tanks are now blocked in front of this second line of defense.

Zurich, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German army is currently occupying the eastern part of the key city of Düren in front of the Cologne Plain and is continuing to fiercely attack the American forces that have entered the city from the north and south. However, by the 25th, the city, which had been reduced to ruins, was finally occupied by the American forces.

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: Eisenhower's offensive in the Meuse and Ruhr regions aims to advance in a pincer movement from the north and south on the left bank of the Rhine River in order to isolate the German forces north of the Düren-Cologne line. Between Düren and Linnich, the American Ninth and First Armies continue to advance towards Mönchengladbach, Düsseldorf, and Cologne, but progress is very slow. Only on both sides of Linnich have the American forces reached six to seven kilometers east of the Ruhr River. The German army has established new lines of defense on both sides of the Düren-Neuss highway to launch counterattacks. On the Düren-Cologne highway, the Soviet army is four kilometers east of Düren. In general, the Western Front war is still a fluid trench war on the fourth day. The German army is preventing the enemy from breaking through everywhere with minimal losses. The entire Ruhr line from Roermond to Düren is still under constant bombardment by German artillery fire.

### Fierce Fighting Around Saarlouis

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: In the lower Saar River, new American tank convoys have arrived and have completed the connection of the bridgeheads on both sides of Saarlouis.

### British and French Negotiations: Concluding an Alliance

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that the Associated Press reported: French Foreign Minister Bidault has recently discussed with British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Prime Minister Churchill for a long time. This discussion can be regarded as the beginning of formal British-French negotiations on an alliance treaty. The most serious issue is that Syria and Lebanon refuse to continue to allow France to enjoy special privileges. It is believed that the British will require France to recognize the independence of the two small countries. If France is unwilling to give up its position as a protectorate, the conclusion of the British-French alliance agreement may be delayed.

### French Cabinet Approves US-French Agreement

Lausanne, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports from Paris: The Teugol Cabinet has fully approved the Franco-American agreement as suggested by the American government. Under this agreement, the United States will lend goods worth approximately 3 billion US dollars to France, including supplies of a purely military nature and imports used for reconstruction. Regarding this matter, an official statement was issued stating: Supplies shipped to North Africa and France will soon be paid for with 500 million US dollars. This payment will be paid from the approximately 2 billion US dollars of French funds frozen by the US Department of the Treasury.

Therefore, the Romanian troops suppressing the riots fired on the crowds. According to a dispatch from Paris, by the 25th, only the disturbances in Bucharest had not stopped, and the situation in other cities in the country also showed a tendency to deteriorate. The Romanian government then decided to issue a national martial law order.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports from London: The current situation in Romania is quite similar to the dangerous situation before the outbreak of the Greek civil war.

### Successful German Defensive War on the Northern and Southern Wings of the Eastern Front: Tank Battles Unfold in the Fight for Lauban

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: Yesterday, the German army achieved two major achievements at both the northern and southern ends of the Eastern Front, namely, the defeat of the Soviet offensive plan in the southern Grodno region and the German army's defeat of the main force of three Soviet armies in East Prussia. It is quite important that the German army in Samland (East Prussia) has restored sea, road, and rail traffic to Königsberg. In the fifth battle in the Courland region (eastern Latvia), the Soviet army still failed to overcome German resistance. Marshal Sokolovsky, the Soviet general in the central sector of the Eastern Front, has not yet launched an offensive but is now engaged in advancing its northern and southern wings to align with the central sector. The German army on the northern wing has abandoned Answald, while fierce fighting has broken out again in the Fürstenberg and Lauban areas on the southern wing. Marshal Konev's vanguard advanced straight to the vicinity of Gubino and Forst before being stopped, but several Soviet bridgeheads were defeated by the German army.

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: Tank battles are currently taking place in the city of Lauban in Lower Silesia. Lauban is a key point for attacking Berlin. Yesterday, the German authorities made every effort to defend it and closed a breakthrough point. For several days, German and Soviet tanks have been engaged in mobile warfare, and several places have changed hands several times.

Editorial

### The Interconnectedness of Politics

The structure of politics is like an organic body, with all parts interconnected and interdependent. To use the human body as an analogy, it is nearly impossible for both hands to be paralyzed while both feet are strong, or for the torso to be withered while the limbs are developed. Even if such a thing were possible, it would only result in a deformed state, not benefiting the whole. Only when the five senses and all parts of the body are evenly developed and interconnected can a normal and healthy state be achieved.

Under the Shanghai Municipal Government, there are thirty units. (Refer to "An Outline of the Municipal Government's Structure," a continuous article in the first and second issues of this newspaper's "Shanghai Municipal Affairs" column on the 10th of this month. Although there have been recent mergers, there have also been new additions, so the number has not changed significantly.) These are like the five senses and various parts of the human body. To ensure the overall health of the municipal government, each unit must be healthy. The actions of the Secretariat can affect various bureaus, district public offices, and county governments, and the measures of the Finance Bureau can affect the work of other units. Moreover, there is mutual interaction between the units, such as between the Land Bureau and the Finance Bureau, the Police Bureau and the Economic Bureau, the Public Works Bureau (now merged with the Public Utilities Bureau and renamed the Construction Bureau) and the Health Bureau, all as interdependent as lips and teeth. The work of one unit depends on the assistance of another, and the achievements of one unit can be the foundation for the undertakings of a third. Just as the gears of a machine must mesh tightly, the fingers and arms of an animal must not be disconnected. The more numerous the units, the more difficult the coordination; the larger the organization, the more difficult the command. This is the reason. Now that the municipal authorities have paid attention to simplifying the structure, they should conduct a systematic review of the overall organization and determine a fair and necessary plan for abolitions, mergers, or new establishments. Furthermore, they should promote the joint office system to the extent possible. This would not only save on redundant organizations for general affairs, documentation, personnel, and statistics, as well as the tediousness of official correspondence, visits, and phone calls, but also concentrate the spirit, increase efficiency, facilitate dispatch, and facilitate observation. Each unit could learn from mutual comparison and competition, thus seeking its own path to health, and avoid the drawbacks of "the emperor is far away" of independent administrations neglecting each other.

The Shanghai Municipal Government's relationship to the central government is like the limbs to the head. While the limbs and face should strive for their own health and development, they cannot solve their own problems in isolation from the head. If the foot hurts, the hand will soothe it; if the left hand itches, the right hand will scratch it; if attacked from behind, one must turn around and strike with a fist. These are all actions of the head that benefit the safety of the limbs. Now, when speaking of governing, transforming, and building Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government is at the forefront and bears the primary responsibility. However, with a myriad of tasks and complex details, some of which should be managed by the local government and can be solved by the local government, such as internal rectification, municipal and rural security, and fiscal management, all within the authority of the municipal government. If one is truly determined, one will surely have the strength, and success is only a matter of time. As for the distribution of resources, the streamlining of transportation, and the increase or decrease of power, these are all beyond the authority of the municipal government. It seems that even with determination, one can hardly have the strength, and success is even less certain. For matters where determination surely leads to strength, one should exert one's utmost effort. For matters where determination hardly leads to strength, one should report to and seek instructions from the central government, so as to obtain effective solutions. The central government should have an overall plan, the authority to negotiate internally and externally, and the determination and ability to solve problems that a province or city cannot solve on its own. Otherwise, there is no point in talking about governing Shanghai, transforming Shanghai, or building Shanghai.

### Intense Battles in Central Iwo Jima: Japanese Forces Repulse Enemy Offensives; Geothermal Area Becomes a Huge Battlefield

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy troops landing on Iwo Jima suffered fierce counterattacks from Japanese forces in front of the Japanese lines on the 23rd, their progress has been completely halted. To break this stalemate, from the evening of the 25th, enemy naval forces launched fierce naval bombardment of the main Japanese positions throughout the night. On the morning of the 26th, under the cover of naval bombardment and bombing, the enemy landing forces launched a major offensive on the entire front with a large number of heavy and light artillery, seeking to break the stalemate of the past few days in one fell swoop. In addition, the main force of the Japanese troops on Mount Suribachi broke through the new positions on the night of the 23rd and finally joined the main positions on the night of the 24th. The enemy's encirclement of the 3rd Marine Division on Mount Suribachi detoured around the Japanese positions. Currently, the enemy is launching a major offensive on the main Japanese positions with the 5th Division on the western front, the 4th Division on the front, and the 3rd Division. Therefore, the enemy's focus of attack remains the geothermal area in the central part and the Motoyama airfield. On the night of the 24th, the Japanese forces merged the Suribachi garrison with the main positions and launched a full-scale counteroffensive. As a result, Iwo Jima is now centered on the geothermal area, the intersection of the Motoyama airfield runway, and the area from the west to near the city gate and the south to the south side of Byōbū-yama [Screen Mountain], which has become a huge battlefield.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The enemy Americans are extremely impatient to break through Iwo Jima and are abnormally anxious. The enemy seems to want to destroy the island in one fell swoop. The contents of documents captured by the Japanese forces after the enemy landed reveal that the enemy's plan was to break through the Japanese defenses in four days and control the entire island. However, the actual combat after the landing was contrary to the enemy's expectations. The enemy's bloodshed increased daily, and therefore, the enemy forces, unable to advance, dispatched carrier-based aircraft and B-29s on the 25th to jointly bomb the Japanese mainland, while simultaneously launching a general offensive on Iwo Jima. The enemy's actions were quite vigorous. On the line of confrontation between the two armies, the enemy in the area between Mount Asō and the geothermal area temporarily gathered about 80 tanks. In addition, they gradually massed troops and dispatched more than 50 air vehicles to cooperate. At that time, the naval bombardment from ships cruising in the nearby sea also became more intense. In response to this aggressive general offensive, the Japanese garrison forces immediately concentrated artillery fire, and the enemy's initial offensive was completely repulsed. By the evening of the 25th, there was almost no change in the line of confrontation between the two armies. The Japanese forces are still firmly defending the area around the southern end of the central airfield on Byōbū-dai [Screen Plateau] and the geothermal area.

Central Pacific Base, 26th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima continues to fight bloodily day and night, repeatedly causing the enemy to bleed. The battle situation on the 24th became even more intense. Although the enemy's offensive was active, the battle situation still had no major changes. The powerful enemy forces attempting to occupy the second airfield invaded from the west around 1:50 PM with 64 tanks as the vanguard. A part of them broke into a corner of the Japanese army's position in the Motoyama area, and other units also advanced toward Byōbū-yama. The Japanese garrison forces are bravely intercepting and launching a counterattack at dusk. Short-range combat ensued. At 8:20 PM, the Japanese naval air force, responding to the brave battles of the Japanese ground garrison, repeatedly and fiercely bombed the enemy positions, and flames could be seen everywhere in the distance.

American Planes Re-Attack Macau

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy American air force blindly bombed Portuguese Macau on January 16, several P-24 planes suddenly re-attacked Macau around 10:55 AM on the 25th, repeatedly strafing the bustling streets and the area near the docks. They also strafed transport ships registered under the Panamanian flag, and ten Portuguese crew members were seriously injured.

### The Anguish of the British Empire

"Better do something foolish that has been done before than something wise that has never been done." Balfour's maxim is the golden rule of British domestic and foreign policy.

Since the start of the war, the greatest goal of British diplomacy has been to conserve its own strength and use other countries to continue the war. From this, it can be inferred that the biggest problem of British domestic policy is how to make the people and the masses of the colonies fight for a certain goal. The British war aim seems to be to defeat Germany; in fact, at the time of the Dunkirk disaster, when the possibility of a German attack on the British mainland was very high, this was reason enough. But after that, the situation improved somewhat for Britain. Why was it still necessary to defeat Germany? What could the British people and colonies gain from this? This is of course a question that needs to be explained.

Why Fight?

This needs to be explained from the question of who holds the leadership in the British war machine. Although the British political world appears to have reconciled due to the political truce (see "The Bankruptcy White Paper of the British Empire" in this newspaper's weekly on February 25), the cadres of each party do not intend to cooperate, and the lower-level forces have no intention of completely cooperating. The labor class, which expanded its power during the war, demands to speak whenever it has the opportunity, hoping to replace the conservative forces and seize power if possible. Therefore, suppressing them has become an important task for Churchill and others. If this is not successful, why they are fighting becomes incomprehensible.

Recently, the British political world, due to the optimistic tone of the approaching end of the European war, has already begun to discuss the timing of the next general election and the attitude that each party should take at that time. In general, when the political truce between the parties is eliminated and the expansion of the Labour Party's power cannot be stopped, what kind of strategy should the Conservative Party, centered on Churchill, use to deal with it? This seems to be the central issue.

The British Dream

Therefore, in order to boost the morale of its own people and make them endure the burden of the war, the British government has had to depict the old rose-tinted dreams, arguing that the world must be built by war. Some time after the Dunkirk disaster, the British "Economist" magazine said in the summer of 1940: "The time has indeed come for the organization of oil-exporting countries to guarantee each citizen a sufficient supply of food, clothing, shelter, and other generally recognized necessities of life." As the magazine itself admitted, this argument only represented "not very new general ideas that were popular at the time." The British people, who were greatly disappointed after the last World War, probably hoped fervently from the beginning of this war that they would not suffer such painful experiences again.

Oxford University Professor Lord William Beveridge, commissioned by the British government, began to draft a social insurance plan. As a result of the research, the so-called Beveridge Social Insurance Plan was published in December 1942. The purpose of the plan was to prevent "poverty" within the country without using "Bolshevik methods," and to "guarantee a minimum monetary income when all citizens encounter various crises in life and occupation."

Domestic Disputes

The Beveridge Plan was submitted to the House of Commons for review in February 1943. The radical faction of the Labour Party enthusiastically advocated the immediate implementation of the plan and the creation of a social insurance department, but the government strongly insisted on the need for further research, and the proposal for immediate implementation was rejected. Because of this issue, a rift occurred within the Labour Party, and the radicals even demanded the resignation of the cabinet members belonging to the party, which was a moment of great anxiety. After the desperate efforts of the party cadres, it was finally eased.

After that, although the British government did not formally touch on the domestic front problem excessively, it still seemed to be preparing to create a replacement plan following the line of the Beveridge Plan. Then, on September 26, 1944, the government's social security plan was published in a white paper. The British government's policy on domestic management after the war was thus generally revealed.

What exactly is the British government's social security plan, which is made up of the "essence" of the Beveridge Plan? In short, it is a plan to guarantee the minimum livelihood of all people in times of unemployment, old age, illness, and injury through extremely broad social insurance. The plan has detailed provisions for family allowances, sickness and unemployment relief, apprenticeship allowances, sickness relief for the self-employed, family dependency allowances, retirement benefits, maternity benefits, widows' allowances, general allowances, orphan relief, widows' benefits, and milk subsidies. However, from a fundamental point of view, it is not much different from the pre-war unemployment insurance system. It is just that the working class pays a fixed amount of insurance premiums in peacetime, plus subsidies from the family and the government, in order to achieve "social stability."

Empty Promises

The above is the "new post-war world" that the British government is drawing in front of the people. This is not at all new and is obviously based on the British tradition of "charity." However, even if it is not new, as long as "social stability" can be achieved as desired, then the goal can be considered achieved. This government plan has become the object of discussion in all aspects of the British political and economic circles. Various facts have been clarified from this, and the most noteworthy is that the Labour Prime Minister Bevin once announced in the House of Commons that the number of unemployed after the war would not exceed 8% of the total British labor force. From this point of view, this imperfect plan seems to be based on the assumption that the number of unemployed is below 8%. If it exceeds this percentage, the planned reference amount of £831 million will inevitably be insufficient. As a result, there is no solution other than increasing insurance premiums or reducing or even suspending payments. In fact, in the British House of Lords, the argument that the burden arising from the implementation of the government plan will be beyond the capacity of the British people seems to be very powerful. On the other hand, the Labour Party is still very dissatisfied with the unemployment allowance of 24 shillings per week stipulated in the original plan, and angrily shouts "Let the returning soldiers be disillusioned." If the payments are further reduced or suspended, then the beautiful dream of this "golden land" will be destroyed at once. Furthermore, there seems to be deep dissatisfaction with the government's plan to revise the Beveridge Plan, limiting the sickness and unemployment insurance benefits to within three years and thirty weeks, respectively, and stipulating that the implementation of social insurance must wait until "after the end of the current war."

Bleak Future

In contrast to the government's white paper, Beveridge has newly published the "Full Employment Plan," arguing that revitalizing exports is an indispensable prerequisite for full employment. This is a truly succinct argument. In short, whether it is the Beveridge Plan or the government plan, it will not be established if it does not foresee the restoration of a certain degree of economic prosperity to the UK. This is also a conclusion that can be drawn from the experience of pre-war unemployment insurance. However, to what extent can the economic recovery of the UK after the war be hoped for?

The foundation of the economic prosperity, no, the economic survival of the British Empire lies in three items: trade, shipping, and overseas investment. All three items have been declining in this war. The UK has lost its position as the "world's factory," which has been the case for a long time. Since the start of this war, there has been no place in the world's UK goods market, whether it is India, Australia, China, or South America, where American goods have not been promoted. Especially since the US has obtained a guarantee from the UK that the UK will no longer export Lend-Lease materials or similar materials, the UK's export trade has obviously been further hindered. According to the newly established US-UK Lend-Lease Agreement, this treaty has been repealed, but Lend-Lease materials have also been halved at the same time. The white paper issued by the British government on November 20, 1944, shows the fact that the UK's export trade decreased to less than half between 1938 and 1943, and the total export value in 1943 accounted for only 2.8% of the national net income, which was significantly lower than 10.2% in 1938.

Overseas Trade

Can the UK recover these markets after the war? Today, there are very few goods that the UK can produce that have real value in the international market. The textile factories of Lancashire and the once-unparalleled Manchester steel industry are now inferior to those of the US, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Only silver products, wool fabrics, diamonds, radio, agricultural processed products, horses, and linen can compete with other countries. It is a fact that the industry of the British Empire's autonomous territories and colonies has rapidly progressed during the war, but this makes the UK's position even more disadvantageous. The UK, which owes the US a huge amount of money in the form of Lend-Lease weapons and whose markets have become increasingly narrow due to the sale of American goods during the war, will inevitably fall into extreme hardship after the war, no matter in what form the war ends. As Smuts said, the UK after the war will be "economically very poor."

Before the war, the income that the UK obtained from the shipping industry and overseas investment was listed under the item of income outside of trade, which was more than enough to make up for the excess of imports. Although its domestic trade was sluggish, the British merchant fleet, as a transporter of goods, raised the British flag, and there was almost no major port in the world without its traces. However, due to the huge wartime consumption and the rapid development of the American shipbuilding industry, if the UK has 10 million tons after the war, then the US probably has about three times this amount of merchant ships. As for commercial aviation, it can be said that it is the same; the US is already using bases owned by the UK today, slowly nibbling away at the UK's commercial air routes.

Wasted Inheritance

Although trade and shipping are so depressed, if there is still overseas investment that was boasted to be the world's number one before the war, then the UK may still have the possibility of rebuilding its external economy. The accumulated overseas investment over many years is the legacy of the past prosperous era of the British Empire. It is precisely because of this that the UK was able to safely overcome many previous crises. However, the overseas investment, which is as important as life to the UK, has been consumed more severely than anything else in this war.

Of the British overseas investment, which was said to be about £5 billion before the war and the interest alone reached £100 million per year, it is estimated that about £1 billion has been destroyed by the war or confiscated by Germany and Japan, and the remaining about £3.2 billion has been used up as war expenses. In addition, since the start of the war, it has also been in debt to autonomous territories and colonies for about £1.3 billion. As for the debt to the US, even after deducting the offsetting part, it is said to be about £3.5 billion. In short, the UK has almost completely wasted its pre-war overseas investment in this war. Of course, the UK has its own plans on how to reduce its debt to the autonomous territories and the US in the future, but the era when the UK reigned over the world's financial circles as a major creditor country has passed. The longer the war drags on, the more difficult it will be for the UK to extricate itself from the position of a debtor country. The British government's "Bankruptcy White Paper" published on November 28 also automatically exposed the fact that the UK had exhausted "most of the wealth accumulated since the era of [its] ancestors" in five years of war. And its export trade and shipping industry are in the aforementioned state, so it can be said that it is absolutely impossible to try to recover the overseas investment lost so far after the war.

The Future of Britain

In an essay entitled "The Future of Britain," Inge expressed the above situation as follows:

"The UK's position as the world's factory has long become a thing of the past. The UK's labor force is not only expensive, but its work efficiency has not improved. The UK has lent huge sums of money to various countries, resulting in the establishment of industries that can compete with British industry. Although the interest obtained from this kind of loan is slightly beneficial to balance, today, the principal lent to foreign countries has been repaid in full, and the UK has no other way to support its growing population except to export only a small amount of mineral resources and industrial products that can break through high tariff barriers today. In addition to the economic nationalism of various countries, the UK's foreign trade has also fallen into a state of hemiplegia due to the terrible increase in domestic production costs and public burdens."

Inge's essay was published in the British magazine "Fortnightly Review" in May 1943. He drew a conclusion from the above situation, that is, "The UK has too much population and will reach 20 million in the future." As this conservative frankly admits, the current poison of the British economy urgently seeks to reduce "labor costs," and there is no basis to expect the appearance of an era of peaceful and prosperous life like the one described in the social security plan. This point, no matter which direction the future of the war takes, is simply a decided fate for the UK. However, in order to give the British people false hope and make them continue to engage in war, it is necessary to put up a signboard that seems to improve "labor costs," such as the social security plan.

A Sick Man's Last Resort

Labour Prime Minister Bevin called the Beveridge Plan an "ambulance." According to the "Economist" magazine's commentary, "Because the ambulance is only necessary when something happens." From this point of view, it can be seen that the "Economist" also admits that "something has happened," but deliberately ignores the chronic disease that the British economy has suffered from hemiplegia. Furthermore, although this ambulance has a good appearance, its contents are not worth a look, and it may even worsen the patient's condition. Moreover, it is already highly doubtful whether it can reach the "accident" site.

However, the UK will certainly not sit still and wait for death, and will use all means to kill a bloody path until the very end. This will be the keynote of British domestic and foreign policy. (Translated from the 51st issue of the 25th volume of Allied World Weekly)

### The Tragic Situation in Hankou After Enemy American Airplanes Indiscriminately Bombed

Enemy Americans, failing in their attempt to use mainland China as a battlefield, dispatched airplanes to carry out indiscriminate bombing. The unfortunate Chinese civilians suffered greatly from their poison. For example, in November and December of last year, enemy American airplanes indiscriminately bombed the urban areas of Hankou, resulting in numerous civilian casualties. This cowardly act by the enemy Americans only served to increase the hatred of the Chinese people and drive them to further cooperate with our ally, Japan, until the ultimate destruction of Britain and America is achieved.

### The Commodity Distribution Office Changes the Special Rice Rationing Method; Half of the Required Rice Amount is Sold Before Full Collection

The Shanghai Municipal Commodity Distribution Office, in order to organize the various ration coupons that have been issued, has made slight changes to the special rice rationing method. From February 28th to March 9th, the office will distribute the main rice ration for this month. Because the required amount of rice has not yet been fully collected, half of the amount will be sold first. The quantity and price have been determined as follows:

Quantities of Extra Rice Rationed to Each Level

Based on the 11th-period extra rice purchase coupon for teachers and staff, each coupon will be allocated 1.5 dou (斗). Based on the 11th-period Grade B and the 11th-period Grade D-1 extra rice purchase coupons, each coupon will be allocated 1 dou. Based on the 11th-period Grade C extra rice purchase coupon, each coupon will be allocated 2.5 dou. Based on the 11th-period Grade D-2 extra rice purchase coupon, each coupon will be allocated 6.25 he (合). All rice is unpolished rice (糙米). The price remains at 50 yuan of national currency per shi sheng (市升). Holders of the various rice purchase coupons listed above may purchase the rice from designated publicly-owned rice sales locations within the specified period.

Civil Servants, Journalists

As for the Grade A extra rice purchase coupons for civil servants and journalists, the rationing method has been changed. All unexpired 11th and 12th-period coupons that have already been issued are invalidated. A new rationing method has been established: (1) For various bureaus and offices under the municipal government, after the number of personnel is verified by the Municipal Secretariat, the original units will apply to the Commodity Distribution Office for unified distribution according to the prescribed procedures. (2) For units outside the municipal government, if the number of personnel has been verified by the competent authority, they may directly apply to the Commodity Distribution Office for the collection and distribution of entire bags of rice. (3) For journalists and others whose numbers have been approved by the municipal government, each newspaper office will directly apply to the Commodity Distribution Office for unified distribution. The quantity and price are the same as the rice rationed to teachers and staff, calculated at 50 yuan of national currency per sheng, with half the amount to be issued first.

### The Paramount Dance Hall is Ordered to Suspend Operations by the Police Bureau for Violating the Ban on All-Night Operation

The Municipal Police Bureau has issued a clear order prohibiting dance halls from operating all night. The Paramount Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road claimed to have obtained the understanding of the police authorities and violated the ban by operating all night. After receiving a report, the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday ordered the Huashan Branch to punish the dance hall with a five-day suspension of operations. Manager Yu of the dance hall falsely claimed that he had obtained permission from Japanese staff members of the police authorities to operate. A Korean national associated with the dance hall is being questioned by the bureau. Under this decisive wartime system, those who fail to recognize the current situation and their responsibilities and engage in such improper business operations will be resolutely investigated and dealt with by the police authorities.

### Bảo Jia Personnel Visit the Hongkou Air Raid Shelters

The Shanghai Special City Civilian Air Defense Headquarters convened representatives of the Lian Bảo chiefs from various districts and reporters from various newspapers at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 27th) to visit the air raid shelters in the Hongkou area. More than 30 people from Jing'an Temple District, Jiangning District, Changning District, Huashan District, Xinshijie District, Yimiao District, Xujiahui District, Putuo District, and Penglai District, as well as Chinese and Japanese reporters, were present. First, Police Defense Chief Hiraoka Isamu and Baojia Chief Gu Jiwu gave speeches. Then, everyone departed by car, first to the North Sichuan Road Branch Bureau, where Branch Chief Saito led a tour of the branch bureau's air raid shelter. Next, the group visited seven air raid shelters on North Sichuan Road, Liyang Road, and in the alleys, where Air Defense Section Chief Yamamoto Shinichi, Deputy Section Chief Li Zhenhuan, and clerk Kobayashi Hisaji explained the key points of building air raid shelters to the Baojia personnel and instructed them to study them in detail after this visit. Finally, the group visited the indoor air raid shelter facilities at the Wan Ho Foreign Firm on Suzhou Road, ending at 12:30 PM. Other district Baojia personnel were invited to visit in the afternoon.

### The Municipal Public Works Bureau is Closing Down

The Municipal Public Works Bureau, having received the order to merge with the Public Works Bureau and be reorganized into the Construction Bureau, immediately began to expedite its closure. It ordered all its subordinate agencies to complete their closures by the 28th of this month. However, vehicle and vessel registration and other work will continue as usual during the transition period. It is reported that the closure work of the bureau has been completed. The Construction Bureau is approved to be established on March 1st. All unfinished matters of the former Public Works and Public Works Bureaus will be continued by the Construction Bureau from now on. It is reported that the newly appointed Director of the Construction Bureau, Mr. Xu Jidun, is currently planning all new facilities.

### The Chairman of the Russian Association Was Arrested Yesterday

In order to thoroughly eradicate the atmosphere of drugs, the Municipal Police Bureau has cracked down on the major gambling den of the Russian General Association at 147 Weihaiwei Road. The den owner Wang Maoting and manager Han Huaqing have been arrested, and 174 gamblers have been caught on the spot and are being detained for investigation. It is reported that the Russian Chairman of the General Association, Ge Liebaofu (Thgceboff), and key figures Shi Weijin Shiji (Sverjensky) have also been arrested. Ge Liebaofu is the leader of the White Russians in Shanghai, and Shi Weijin Shiji is also a well-known figure among the White Russians. However, they failed to self-discipline and disregarded the law by engaging in gambling activities. The police bureau will strictly deal with them according to the law.

### The Gold Trade Association Warns Members Not to Manipulate Gold Prices

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special City Gold Trade Association has seen its affairs develop increasingly, and the number of members joining the association has been extremely enthusiastic. Those who have not yet completed the membership procedures will be regarded as illegal businesses. The municipal economic authorities have decided to ban the operations of non-members who have not joined the association. It is now reported that the association, due to the continuous increase in the market price of gold in recent days, which shows a great upward trend, cannot rule out the manipulation by a small number of speculators, which shakes the market and disrupts finance, which is purely illegal behavior and has a great impact on the entire financial system. Therefore, it is specially notified to member gold shops to be deeply warned not to participate in it, so as not to cause self-inflicted disasters. As for the legitimate protection and common welfare that should be possessed in the business of the industry, legitimate solutions should be sought, and no arbitrary actions should be taken, so as not to throw oneself into the legal net.

### Banks and Money Shops to Raise Interest Rates; Decision Imminent

The banks and money shops in this city, in view of the rising prices and huge expenses in recent years, and in order to assist the authorities in suppressing prices and maintaining normal business operations, intend to raise lending rates. The industry has held several meetings to discuss this matter and has reached a broad consensus. A joint meeting of the banking and money shop industries will be convened this week to continue discussions and make a decision. It is reported that the lending rate will be increased by 50 percent. The industry will operate in accordance with the regulations and must not raise prices again in the middle, in order to achieve uniformity.

### Establishment of a Poultry Market Not Permitted

Shanghai businessmen Ye Yinshan and others raised funds to establish Shanghai Poultry Market Co., Ltd., and submitted a request to the municipal government for approval for filing. The municipal government authorities believe that the organization plan of the market does not focus on procurement and transportation and is of no benefit to the source of goods. The sole purpose is to collect handling fees, which only increases the cost of goods and monopolizes the market, which has a great impact on people's livelihood. An instruction has already been issued to deny the establishment.

### Regular Hot District Holds Baojia Symposium

Mr. Yao Yiti, the Chief Lian Bao (聯保) of the Changre Baojia District, hosted a banquet at his private residence at noon on February 25th, as the New Year began and the year changed, to entertain Director Gu of the Baojia Office and welcome the newly appointed Director Yu Dengyun of the Changshu Road Branch Bureau, as well as Deputy Director Songxia, the newly appointed chiefs and deputy chiefs of various sections, and the members of the Changshu District Branch of the Municipal District Baojia Committee. The various positive and negative Lian Baos accompanied him. During the banquet, Mr. Yao gave a welcome speech, briefly stating that the inspectors and officers who had served in the district were extremely virtuous, which was truly a blessing for the residents. Now, Director Yu of the new branch bureau has previously held important military and political positions and has followed Director Zhou and Secretary-General Luo for many years. His political achievements are well-known. In the future, the residents will naturally be able to obtain greater happiness. Subsequently, Director Gu, Deputy Director Dachuan, Director Yu, and Deputy Director Songxia gave speeches in succession. After the banquet, a symposium on Baojia household registration issues was held to discuss the future Baojia work in the Changshu district. Director Yu gave extremely detailed instructions. Chief Lian Bao Yao and others successively expressed their opinions. The fourth section of the branch bureau reported the details of the merger and reorganization of the section and the work plan, and requested the Baojia Office to issue as many application forms as possible so that the new residence permits could continue to be replaced. They discussed future events such as clearing the household registration, checking household registration forms, and training the self-defense group, etc. The situation was very harmonious, and the meeting adjourned at about 5 o'clock.

### Youth Reporter Training Class Holds Graduation Ceremony Yesterday; Chinese and Japanese Officials Attend and Deliver Speeches

The Youth Reporter Training Class, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, solemnly held its graduation ceremony yesterday (the 27th) at 4:30 PM at the Federation of Industry and Commerce Club on the fourth floor of No. 12, the Bund. Attendees included Director Liu of the Propaganda Department, Captain Matsumoto of the Naval Fleet Press Department, Chen Binhe, Xu Liqiu, Chen Riping, Li Quanshi, Zheng Jie, Moriyama Takashi, Zhang Zhaoming, Yang Guangzheng, Liu Yunfang, Lin Junfu, Zhang Yicheng, Lu Feng, Ji Zhonghe, and over a hundred Chinese and foreign guests. The ceremony commenced promptly and concluded at 5:30 PM. The order of the ceremony is recorded as follows: (1) All stand at attention, (2) Bow in respect to the Chinese and Japanese national flags, (3) Speech by Standing Director Chen, (4) Report by Director of Academic Affairs Zhu, (5) Chairman Li presents graduation certificates, (6) Address by Chairman Chen, (7) Speeches by guests, (8) Speech by student representative, (9) Thank you speech by Director Lu, (10) Photograph taken and ceremony concludes.

Chen Riping’s Speech

Following the ceremony, Standing Director Chen Riping of the Shanghai Branch of the New News Association delivered a speech, stating, "Today is the graduation ceremony for the students of the Youth Reporter Training Class organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association. We are extremely grateful for the care and support of all officials and sectors of society, and especially for your presence despite your busy schedules. Details about the training class will be provided in a detailed report by the Director of Academic Affairs. We hope you will offer your invaluable guidance."

Report by Director of Academic Affairs

Next, Director of Academic Affairs Zhu reported, "The motivation for establishing the Youth Reporter Training Class began in April of last year, with the aim of re-training current news professionals. By June 1st, the training class was officially established, with a total of 50 students recommended by various newspapers. However, as many students experienced job changes or were dispatched to other locations, the number gradually decreased. Consequently, the board meeting of the former Shanghai News Joint Association decided to entrust me with the management of academic affairs. I made every effort to reorganize and recruit from the outside world. Including the original students receiving training, it has now been six months, with a total of 30 graduating students. Regarding academic affairs, we emphasized professional training, adding printing, interviewing, and legal system courses to the existing news research subjects. After four months of training and one month of internship, we have now reached the completion of graduation. I hope that all students will continue to work hard and create a new chapter for the news industry in the future."

Issuance of Graduation Certificates

Chairman Li Sihao of the New News Association (represented by Mr. Chen Riping) then presented the certificates, which were received by student representative Huang Jialu. The ceremony was simple and solemn.

Address by Chairman Chen

Chairman Chen of the Shanghai Branch of the New News Association then addressed the audience, saying, "The news industry in China is still very immature, and there is a real shortage of talent. Therefore, our association places great emphasis on the cultivation of news talent. If a newspaper has many talented journalists, then that newspaper will surely thrive. The same is true for a country. For example, before the Incident, the Ta Kung Pao placed special emphasis on talent, recruiting individuals such as Zhang Jiwan, Hu Zhengzhi, Wu Dingchang, and Wang Yunsheng, who dedicated themselves to their work. As a result, the Ta Kung Pao became a leader in the national news industry. Recently, the Sin Wan Pao has also undergone a refreshing transformation in content and layout due to the addition of new talent. As for the qualities that a news reporter should possess, I would like to offer three suggestions: (1) Must have an interest. Interest brings spirit. (2) Richness in skills and experience. (3) A correct and unwavering stance. Such a reporter will at least be welcomed and not cause people to be disgusted. Today is the graduation day for the Youth Reporter Training Class, but I have made no contribution. This is thanks to the instructors who are responsible for the training."

Speech by Director Liu of the Propaganda Department

Director Liu Dexuan of the Propaganda Department said, "I attended the founding day of the Youth Reporter Training Class organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, and today I am participating in the graduation ceremony. This makes me very happy. In the past six months, the Youth Reporter Training Class has recruited outstanding young people from Shanghai and provided them with the necessary basic training in journalism. This has undoubtedly taken a great deal of effort. This shows the painstaking efforts of the directors and teachers, which is to be congratulated. Now that you have graduated, you will be assigned to various newspapers to serve. From now on, the mission and responsibilities you shoulder will be even greater. Therefore, I hope that you can work from the three perspectives of promoting culture, rectifying people's hearts, and winning glory for the country, so as not to fail the support and painstaking efforts of the directors and teachers."

Speech by Captain Matsumoto

Captain Matsumoto of the Naval Fleet Press Department said, "Today is the graduation day of the Youth Reporter Training Class. You have completed six months of training. I deeply congratulate you. The current war has entered a decisive stage, so the responsibilities you bear are extremely important. Your graduation is closely related to the development of Shanghai newspapers and the entire nation. I have high expectations for you and sincerely hope that you will work hard."

Speech by Li Quanshi

Li Quanshi said, "The training class is hosted by major newspapers. Although the Economic Daily, which I run, is a small newspaper, it has the style of a large newspaper. Therefore, I have presumptuously participated in this grand event, and I am even more surprised to be invited to speak on the stage. The ancients said, 'A single word can ruin a country,' but conversely, a single word can also revitalize a country. The news industry is like this. Every word and every phrase directly affects the public. Doing it well can revitalize a country, and doing it badly can ruin a country. Therefore, running a newspaper should be based on the interests of the public. Society, the nation, and even the entire world are all affected. Running a newspaper should be beneficial to people, and news reporters, as the actual practitioners, should pay more attention to this. As the saying goes, 'The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every individual.' A reporter's pen has the power to influence the rise and fall of a country. For example, reporting on stabilizing people's livelihoods can cause rice prices to fall; conversely, it can cause rice prices to skyrocket. Although scandalous content is undesirable, it is acceptable to adopt a humorous, witty, and light-hearted tone that does not harm elegance. There is a saying that compares the pen to a knife, so showing mercy with the knife means showing mercy with the pen. I hope that all students will work hard with their pens and seek happiness for society and the nation."

Thank You Speech by Director Lu Feng

Next, Director Lu Feng gave a thank you speech, saying, "Today is the graduation ceremony of the Youth Reporter Training Class organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association. I am honored to have the presence of all the guests, officials, and senior figures in the news industry. I am also very grateful to Director Liu of the Propaganda Department of this city, Captain Matsumoto of the allied forces, and Mr. Li Quanshi, an authority on economics, for their respective speeches. I have been engaged in the news industry for more than ten years and have a deep passion and sorrow for the Chinese news industry. I am passionate because the Chinese news industry has made considerable progress in recent years, and I am sorrowful because, although the Chinese news industry has made progress, it is still lagging behind in the overall trend of global progress. As Mr. Binhe said, the problem is the lack of talent, that is, the lack of reporter talent. Therefore, I naturally strongly agree with Mr. Chen's initiative to open a reporter training class and discover new talent.

Regarding the issue of reporter talent, I have two observations in the current situation of the Chinese news industry: (1) Among our Chinese news reporters, there are many who have made great contributions to the news industry and promoted its rapid development, but few are able to consistently work for newspapers. Often, after achieving some success in the news industry, they change direction midway, leave the news industry, and enter the political arena to become officials. From the perspective of the reporters themselves, it can be said that they have achieved higher success because their lives have improved, but from the perspective of the entire news industry, it is a huge loss. This phenomenon has its own historical and social reasons, but I always believe that it is a morbid condition.

(2) Is that those who are engaged in the news industry in our country, after reaching a certain age, often no longer seek progress themselves. This kind of situation is extremely rare in other countries. For example, in major Japanese newspapers, there are people who have been working for fifty or sixty years and are still constantly working hard to improve themselves, but it is not the case in China. Most reporters who have reached a certain age no longer plan for the news industry, but only take care of their personal lives. As a result, the progress of the Chinese news industry has become like a snail's pace. In order to remedy these two shortcomings, I believe that the only way is to cultivate new talents, and according to the law of metabolism, new growth, and the elimination of the old and decaying, so that our country's news industry will make progress day by day.

In the Youth Reporter Training Class, I have always advocated practicality and not emptiness, so I hope that the graduates of this class will not have too great expectations. The training period of the training class is only six months. In this short period of time, the knowledge gained is naturally not much. Even if you have sufficient theory yourself, in order to coordinate with practical work, you must start from a very low position when you enter the newspaper. Do not think that we are trained by the News Association, and we have this backer. This concept is wrong. In short, I hope that you will rely on your own true talent and learning in the future to establish a position in the news industry and to open up a broad path for the Chinese news industry, in order to repay the painstaking efforts of the News Association in cultivating young reporters.

Speech by Student Representative

Finally, student representative Lu Shenting gave a reply, saying, "We all know that newspapers are the mouthpiece of the people, the tool of popular education, and the megaphone of government agencies. Not only can they promote social progress, but they can also help the development of all undertakings. In today's world, we need to rely on this kind of news industry to achieve national prosperity and improve people's lives, so we all have a strong interest in coming to the Youth Reporter Training Class to receive training.

During the training period, we received a lot of knowledge from the patient guidance of all the students, and later, when we were assigned to various newspapers for internships, we also received enthusiastic guidance from the editors, so that we gained more knowledge. Today, we are holding a graduation ceremony, and we are honored to have the presence of the seniors in the news industry. Here, I would like to thank all the teachers on behalf of all the students. We will still need your continued guidance and supervision in the future, and we should continue to study hard ourselves.

After listening to the instructions of all the teachers just now, it seems that we have been given a compass. We will definitely keep it in mind and become a loyal, hardworking, and serving public servant in the news industry in the future. We will report the most rapid and accurate news to the people, and always stand at the forefront of society and be a pioneer in leading society." After the reply, the photography announced the completion of the ceremony and the meeting was adjourned.

### Points to Note When Receiving Subsidized Rice

The Subsidized Rice Committee has started distributing rice yesterday. The rice collection slips for each rice-receiving household have also been distributed by representatives of public welfare and charitable organizations, news and culture circles, education circles, labor circles, business circles, and banking circles. Yesterday, the committee held its third meeting to discuss and decide on the following points to be noted by each rice-receiving household:

(1) The three designated warehouses for the first phase of subsidized rice started distributing rice yesterday.

(2) Each rice-receiving household should contact its respective unit immediately to inquire about the rice warehouse and time.

(3) Each rice-receiving household that borrows sackcloth bags must return them to their respective units within seven days. They must be kept intact and cannot be offset by cash. If they are not returned after the deadline, the right to receive rice in the second phase will be cancelled, and new sackcloth bags will be compensated in full.

(4) Each rice-receiving household is responsible for transporting the rice from the warehouse. If you need to entrust a transportation company to transport it, you can contact the Heji Transportation Company in the City Chamber of Commerce.

(5) The price of subsidized rice in the second phase is 37,000 yuan per picul. The payment date is set from February 27th to March 2nd. If the payment is not made after the deadline, it will be considered a waiver and will not be accommodated.

Distribution of Rice Collection Certificates in the Education Sector

The first batch of subsidized rice collection certificates for the education sector will be distributed today (the 28th) at No. 306, Jing'an Building, Jing'an Temple Road. Each unit that has been approved for sale should have the person in charge bring the seal and payment receipt to collect it. After each unit obtains the rice collection certificate, they can go to the designated rice distribution point to collect the rice. In addition, the second batch of subsidized rice can also be applied for at the same place from today. Institutions that have been approved for the first batch of allocation, if they still hope to allocate in the second batch, must re-apply.

### Beyond Severe Penalties: One Solution for Stabilizing Prices

— Song Qing

During the American Civil War, Lincoln once said to Secretary of War Stanton, "In this critical moment, those crazy Wall Street speculators are still gambling on the rise and fall of gold. What do you think? I would suggest cutting off their heads one by one." Unexpectedly, the price of gold jumped by more than a quarter. "Governing a chaotic world requires severe penalties" is a principle that is generally approved, but it is more a "technique" than a "way" to govern chaos. There is a difference between these two. Yu the Great's skills in repairing dikes and dredging channels were techniques for controlling floods, but his idea of channeling the water into the sea was the way to control floods. The way and the technique are mutually reinforcing. Having the way without the technique meant that the wise sage Wang Anshi could not avoid failing just before success. Having the technique without the way is exemplified by Lincoln's failure to control the price of gold.

The difficulty of governing a chaotic world lies primarily in the hardship of the people's livelihood and the soaring prices. The weak inevitably suffer and die, while the strong take risks. The decline of social morality and the collapse of law and order all stem from this. Once this trend starts, whether forced by circumstances or not, officials will inevitably engage in extortion, and merchants will hoard goods for profit, which has become a new standard of morality. High prices force people to do evil, and doing evil in turn fuels prices, creating a vicious cycle that has led to the current state where people have no means of survival. Therefore, the way to govern a chaotic world is to prioritize managing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Officials must be able to live above the level of starvation before severe penalties can be used to make them honest and just. Merchants must be able to operate under stable prices without the risk of asset devaluation before severe penalties can be used to prevent them from hoarding goods. It is rare to see officials who are selfless when hungry, or merchants who sacrifice their fortunes for the public good. It is inappropriate and impossible to demand such things. Based on the above arguments, we conclude that stabilizing prices requires more than just punishing hoarding and wrongdoing.

Apart from hoarding and other human factors that exacerbate the problem, the main reason for high prices is the wartime shortage of supplies, where supply cannot meet demand. Whether the shortage of supplies is due to the interruption of supply sources, difficulties in transportation, or the stagnation of production, it is certain that any attempt to actively solve the problem from the front will be met with obstacles under the current special circumstances. The experience of the past few years has shown that production increases and transportation improvements are unattainable. The only way to solve the price problem now is to address the issue from the perspective of distribution, namely, reducing consumption. All progressive countries have followed this path, as can be seen from the small amount of food rations given to the people in Germany and Japan. The German and Japanese planned economies that are admired by many are simply about allocating consumption based on the possible supply. There is no other way to stabilize prices in our country; otherwise, in a situation of scarce resources, everyone taking enough to consume will inevitably lead to supply not meeting demand. As a result, the price mechanism will only raise prices to complete two missions: (1) Raise prices to force people with weak economic capacity to reduce or even stop consumption in order to match the supply. (2) Raise prices to induce the flow of goods. The latter will lead to rampant hoarding and reduce the supply. The former will create a distorted situation where the rich have feasts while the poor starve on the streets. Why not reduce consumption together under a reasonable distribution system to achieve the principle of not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality? The following plan is based on the situation in urban areas.

Distribution and Consumption Plan

(A) Resource Management: To ensure the reasonable implementation of distribution and consumption, resource management must be strictly controlled to prevent abuses.

A. Agricultural Products: (1) All agricultural products entering the city must be purchased by the government, and individuals are not allowed to purchase them privately.

(2) The purchase price will be based on the current black market price in the city, including the price at the place of production, the transportation costs of individual traders, and profits. Once the price is set, it cannot be changed unless there is a change in transportation costs.

B. Industrial Products: (1) All existing and manufactured industrial products in shops, stores, and factories must be graded and controlled by the government. Individuals can only resell them in bulk and are not allowed to sell them to consumers privately.

(2) The prices of industrial products will be assessed by the government.

C. Raw Materials: (1) Those that flow in will be purchased by the government, the same as agricultural products. Those in stock and manufactured will be registered and controlled by the government, the same as industrial products. Individuals are not allowed to do so privately.

(2) The price of raw materials will be assessed by the government, the same as agricultural products for those that flow in.

(B) Exchange of Agricultural and Industrial Products: The cost of reproducing agricultural products is mostly based on the consumption of industrial products. Therefore, the rational and mutually beneficial exchange of agricultural and industrial products is the key to stabilizing the prices of agricultural products and ensuring smooth purchases.

A. Anyone transporting agricultural products or raw materials to Shanghai for sale will be allocated industrial products of equivalent value.

B. The allocation price will be based on the black market price at the time of setting the purchase price of agricultural products, and once set, it cannot be changed.

(C) Consumption Allocation: The consumption volume of citizens must be allocated by measuring the possible supply of various resources. Therefore, a rationing system must be enforced. For example, according to various statistics, the possible inflow of rice into Shanghai each year is such that each person can only consume an average of five scoops of rice per day. This average amount will be allocated to each citizen. The same applies to industrial products such as cloth and socks.

A. Agricultural Products: (1) Citizens can purchase a specified quantity of rice, grains, and other items from retail rationing stores on specified dates with a ration card.

(2) The allocation price includes the purchase price and profit.

B. Industrial Products: (1) Citizens can purchase a specified quantity of items from ordinary stores on specified dates with a ration card. They can choose the grade of the items at their convenience, and the price is based on the government's assessment. (Daily necessities such as matches will be sold through designated rationing stores.)

(2) Stores can apply for goods with the ration cards submitted by citizens.

C. Raw Materials: (1) Raw materials will be allocated by the government to manufacturers.

(2) Manufacturers should also submit a warehouse receipt for a corresponding amount of finished products to the government at the same time.

Supplementary Plan

(A) Food and Fuel Allocation Issues: Whether it is possible to reduce the consumption of rice and firewood without violating the conditions for survival is worth considering in detail. "Not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality" is certainly a golden rule, but it is meaningless if the scarcity is not enough to sustain life. This question can be answered from two aspects. The first aspect is whether the citizens' food consumption can be reduced from the current amount. In fact, it is undeniable that Chinese people eat a lot. From what the author has seen in the Northeast, one Chinese person's meal can be equivalent to the meal of two Japanese people or even a family of three (husband, wife, and child). Their vegetable dishes are not rich, just two preserved plums, one or two slices of raw fish, and a small bowl of clam soup. As for cooking oil, it can be said to be minimal. During peacetime, it is still necessary to reduce consumption a bit. Why can't we do it now? Moreover, from a scientific point of view, absorbing excessive carbohydrates does not benefit health. Therefore, reducing consumption is not a problem. The only pain is that the stomachs that are used to being full feel a little uncomfortable when not filled. After a considerable period of correction, this feeling will disappear. When it comes to reducing fuel consumption, it is really a question of whether the technology used is rational. If one family uses 30 catties of firewood per day, 10 families can use only 150 catties if they burn together. It is also not a problem.

The second aspect is that, according to the general situation, the possible supply of food and fuel in Shanghai is not so drastically short of the normal consumption. However, hoarding, competitive purchasing, storage, and uneconomical consumption have increased the difference. If attention can be paid to the following issues, the degree of reducing consumption can certainly not hinder the conditions for survival. (1) Rice, wheat, grains, and even root vegetables and rice products such as rice cakes and rice noodles should all be distributed to citizens in the form of main foods, not as supplementary foods. Because people in the Jiangnan region look down on grains, they are more wasteful in their use, which is not right. (2) All delicate snacks on the market should be banned and can only be exchanged for rice and grain ration cards. They cannot be sold privately. The application for raw materials for workshops will also be based on the ration cards submitted. (3) Restaurants selling rice should also exchange them for rice and grain ration cards and should not sell them privately.

(B) Industrial Product Allocation Issue: In addition to daily necessities such as matches, other industrial products such as clothes and socks can be reduced as much as possible. The meaning of reducing consumption is not only to save raw materials but also to leave them for supplying the countryside as much as possible in exchange for agricultural products. The quantity of consumption allocation will be based on this. There are many kinds of industrial products. Whether luxury goods that are not daily necessities should also be rationed, such as silk stockings, woolens, and cosmetics, seems unnecessary on the surface. However, because those who buy luxury goods are all wealthy families, and wealthy families have smaller appetites and higher food storage. It is fair to exchange what they have for what they lack. Therefore, it is advocated to adopt an application and allocation system to exchange for rice and grain ration cards. For semi-essential goods, it may be possible to adopt an application and allocation system for recovering old utensils.

(C) Exchange of Agricultural and Industrial Products: (1) Purchasing agricultural products based on providing industrial products is not only rational and necessary but also a fact. At present, any individual trader transporting goods to Shanghai will inevitably purchase industrial products to return to their hometown. This principle is beyond doubt. Regarding the exchange rate between the two, we insist on using the black market price at a specific period, rather than simply evaluating the production cost. The reason is that first, we do not want to create new changes to stimulate the market, and second, the exchange rate of this black market price includes the supply and demand factors of both parties. Since the exchange rate of this price includes the supply and demand factors of both parties, it should be possible to maintain it unchanged forever unless there is a change in supply and demand. The price of these industrial products is obviously higher than the production cost price assessed by the government. The extra profit can be kept as a subsidy fund for future changes in the exchange rate. (2) According to the above-mentioned exchange function, it is easy to have a misconception that since the principle is mutual benefit, there should be no problem with the inflow of agricultural products, or that the inflow of food can be induced by controlling the price of industrial products. This misconception arises from neglecting the following factors: A. Possible supply of agricultural products (excluding military rice and consumption by rural producers). B. Possible supply of industrial products. C. Possible minimum living consumption in urban areas. D. Possible voluntary reduction in consumption in rural areas.

(D) Raw Material Allocation Issue: During periods of resource shortage, although raw material allocation is different in nature from consumption allocation, it also has its economical use. (1) Manufacturers with production efficiency below the standard will be suspended from allocation. (2) Manufacturers of non-essential products will be suspended from allocation. (3) Manufactured products must be simplified and economized, such as socks must be short, undershirts must be sleeveless...

The above plan is completely based on the current situation. The so-called purchase of agricultural products is nothing more than changing from scattered purchases to collective purchases. The so-called control of industrial products is an expansion of commodity registration. The so-called consumption allocation is nothing more than the promotion of the current rationing system. The so-called reduction of consumption is nothing more than reducing the waste of the rich to help the poor. The so-called exchange of agricultural and industrial products is an ironclad fact, and the determination of the exchange rate is just to stop artificial manipulation. It does not conflict with the facts but is just a rational revision and promotion, so its implementation is very possible. However, its shortcomings must also be recognized. The most important thing is that consumption allocation only focuses on the urban end, and it cannot impose consumption restrictions on rural producers, nor can it directly allocate industrial products to them. Friction will inevitably occur in the exchange of agricultural and industrial products, affecting the overall effect. Only by deepening political power can we achieve completeness.

Although the economic future of this city seems peaceful on the surface, it is actually brewing a crisis. The price of rice has exceeded 10 levels. How can the people in dire straits withstand another blow? The thorough solution to the people's livelihood problem cannot be delayed any longer. I hope that insightful people will give me guidance on my limited view.

### A Beggar Child on Yongshou Street Has Been Sheltered

Our office received a letter from Mr. Wu Jingyi stating: "Dear Sir, several months ago, a couple with a child were sleeping under the eaves of a building across the street (No. 142 Yongshou Street). I heard that the couple were from wealthy families, but they became beggars due to their addictions. The child is very filial, supporting his parents with what he scavenges. Later, unable to withstand the wind and rain, the parents died one after another. The child is alone and helpless. However, judging from his qualities, he is not bad and seems to have received education. He disdains associating with beggars and has never begged from anyone. He has been supporting himself by sleeping on the streets. Such a promising talent, if society does not shelter him, may go astray and repeat the mistakes of his parents. Therefore, I dare to write a letter to briefly describe the situation, hoping that your office and the relevant childcare organizations can provide assistance and find a way to shelter him so that he can become a useful talent, which is a blessing for society."

(According to the letter received from Mr. Wu, our office immediately wrote to the Shanghai Fu You Orphanage, asking them to investigate the matter and, if it was found to be true, to provide shelter. Our office will provide a monthly subsidy from the funds for assisting suffering children. We have now received their reply stating that they have sent staff to investigate and found that the child's parents have indeed died and he has fallen into the streets, which is in line with the regulations, and he has already been sheltered.)

### Donation of Gifts from Classmates for Charity Sale

A person named Shanjushi wrote: "Dear Sir, in this turbulent world, the people are extremely distressed. I deeply admire the various charitable activities organized by your office. I am ashamed that I am unable to contribute even the slightest bit. I recently received a gift from my classmate Chen Shunquan, including half a dozen towels and two cans of Quaker oatmeal, as well as other food items. It would be disrespectful to refuse them and I feel ashamed to accept them. Except for the remaining food items, which cannot be priced and I can only thank him, I have sent half a dozen towels and two cans of oatmeal for charity sale, estimated to be worth about 5,000 yuan. All the proceeds will be donated to the poverty relief fund for the benefit of the people. I hope you will publish this letter so that people from all walks of life will respond and expand the effectiveness of the relief efforts. I hope you will consider my humble sincerity."

### Discussion on Tai Chi Chuan Experiment

Under the leadership of Mr. Chuan Zhongwen, the Yongnian Tai Chi Chuan class organized by our office, despite the severe cold weather, the students are energetic and continue to practice every morning. Recently, in order to encourage the students, Mr. Tang Zuxiang was specially invited to the site to briefly describe the experiment of Tai Chi Chuan. Mr. Tang said: "When practicing Tai Chi Chuan, attention should be paid to maintaining the 'upright, correct, and comfortable' posture and intention. Otherwise, the center of gravity will be lost, and it will be easy to fall. The movements should be continuous, and the breathing should be slow and gradual. This can promote the smooth flow of Qi and blood without stagnation and can also help with the Kung Fu of resisting acupuncture points. According to Tai Chi Chuan, the method adopts the Taoist principle of softness conquering hardness, which is helpful for cultivating Taoism and self-cultivation. When practicing, the 'mind, intention, and spirit' should be gathered, the heel should be firmly planted, the head should be upright, the Qi should sink into the Dantian, the waist and shoulders should be relaxed, and the fingers and hands should be in shape but not exert force. The so-called light and clear Qi that rises up is the sky, and the heavy and turbid Qi that condenses down is the earth. The upper body should be light and the center of gravity should be kept in the Dantian. In short, practicing Tai Chi Chuan requires walking in a circle, following nature, and not forcing yourself. Understanding this principle will gradually lead to health."

### Tao Yuqi's Charming Demeanor, Enthusiasm for Rescuing Child Refugees

According to the news from the China Child Welfare Association, Mr. Tao Yuqi, a member of the association, delivered a donation of one million yuan from philanthropist Dong Dashanshi yesterday. Among them, 500,000 yuan is designated for the education and upbringing expenses of two child refugees, Yang Xinmei and Zhang Boyu, and the remaining 500,000 yuan is used for the living expenses of other child refugees. Mr. Tao has always been very enthusiastic about various charitable causes, and he is especially concerned about the education and upbringing of child refugees. Now, in view of the extremely tight funding of the Child Welfare Association and the difficulty of maintaining it, he has once again enthusiastically run around to solicit donations, which is commendable. Mr. Dong Dashanshi's generous donation of a large sum of money and his emphasis on giving are also commendable. In addition to the receipt issued by the association, we also express our gratitude to Committee Member Tao and Philanthropist Dong Dashanshi on behalf of the child refugees who have benefited.
