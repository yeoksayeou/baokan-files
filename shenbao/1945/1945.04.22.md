### Nimitz and Others to Return to Washington to Discuss the Pacific War Situation

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Sea News Agency reports: There are rumors that the new U.S. President Truman intends to summon Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, and General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Army, to Washington to report on their duties.

Central News Agency: Since the U.S. military began operations on Okinawa Island, it has deployed an unprecedentedly large infantry force in a single combat zone to launch an attack. However, it has been met with fierce Japanese counterattacks and has failed to achieve its objectives. Currently, the enemy fleet near Okinawa Island is using battleships, cruisers, and destroyers to bombard Japanese positions with guns of all calibers. However, due to the fierce attacks by Japanese special attack forces (referred to as "human bombs" by the enemy), the enemy's operations have encountered the greatest difficulties. It is rumored that due to the severity of the Pacific war situation, Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, and General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Army, will return to Washington in the coming days to re-examine the plans for the war against Japan.

### Under Favorable Circumstances, Japanese Forces Fighting Vigorously: Minister Matsushima Elaborates on the Okinawa Battle Situation

The Shanghai branch of the China Press Association held a current affairs lecture yesterday. Minister Matsushima attended and delivered a speech, the content of which is as follows:

"It is a great honor for me to have the opportunity to meet with friends from allied nations at today's grand lecture held by the Press Association. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the current naval operations of the Imperial Navy.

The Significance of the Okinawa Operation is Great – Currently, the focus of the Pacific war is on the battle in the Okinawa area. The enemy, the British and Americans, have already captured Iwo Jima and are now attempting to seize Okinawa as a second base, which they intend to use as a stepping stone for aircraft to attack the Japanese mainland. They have been invading the area since March 17th. This operation has the most significant meaning in the naval operations of the Greater East Asia War, a feeling shared by both the enemy and ourselves. This operation has become the focus of the decisive battle in Greater East Asia, and it began after Japan and the Seto Inland Sea were prepared. The enemy attempted to first attack this area to disable Japanese air bases, preventing Japanese mainland aircraft from coming to aid, and to lure out and destroy our Combined Fleet, thereby advancing the operation on the island. However, the enemy underestimated our air power, a fact that will soon become apparent.

The Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses – The enemy, unexpectedly facing a defensive line, has found themselves in a very difficult situation. Since then, the enemy has repeatedly attacked and suffered heavy losses. However, since April 1st, approximately three divisions have landed, and in the subsequent twenty days, the operation on the island has become increasingly fierce. Since April 5th, our forces have launched several general attacks, and as of the 10th, the enemy's losses have totaled 393 ships, including approximately 20 battleships and over 20 aircraft carriers. This has a significant impact on the enemy's future operations. The enemy's personnel losses are at least 140,000, as can be seen from the rapid weakening of enemy air power in the Okinawa area. On the land front, the enemy has landed approximately six divisions, attempting to quickly seize the island, but has not yet achieved any decisive results. Since the 18th, it has been reported that the enemy has launched a German-style attack, but the result has only been bloodshed. During this period, the valiant fighting of our Kamikaze attack units and the air units of the Army and Navy has terrified the enemy and inflicted unexpected heavy losses. The sudden death of Roosevelt the other day may also be one of the reasons for the U.S. operation.

The Enemy is Anxious About Special Attack Units – In the past, the British have remained silent about special attack units, repeatedly denying the results of our special attack units. This shows how anxious the enemy is about our special attack units, and from the opposite perspective, we can also glimpse the fervor of public opinion in the United States. Also, in the past, the United States did not want the British fleet to participate in the Pacific operations, but this time they have requested the cooperation of the British fleet, which also proves the heavy losses suffered by the U.S. military. However, to this day, their cooperation has been ineffective, and their losses have increased. The Okinawa operation, from Japan's point of view, is progressing under extremely favorable circumstances. In their anxiety, the enemy has dispatched B-29 and P-51 aircraft from the Mariana Islands to indiscriminately attack our many air units and place them in a desperate situation. The daredevil spirit of the Japanese military is therefore even more excited.

China and Japan Cooperate to Achieve Their Goals – The enemy, considering the current situation in the European theater, will shift the forces from Europe to Asia to carry out the final operation. Today, although the German people are facing their last stand, in order to fundamentally destroy the international Jewish ambition to dominate the world, they continue to make superhuman efforts. As Propaganda Minister Goebbels declared, we express our infinite respect for the patriotic spirit and courage of the German army, who will fight to the last man and the last bullet, and we vow to... But in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to rely on the valiant fighting of the Japanese troops at the front and the economic support of the rear. In particular, we hope that the people of China will cooperate. The success or failure of various conditions during the war can only be determined after the war aims have been achieved. We must not be misled by enemy rumors and should immediately stabilize the local economic situation. China and Japan should cooperate to develop a common fighting power.

The War is Approaching its Most Important Stage – The enemy's intentions in the North Pacific are to... In India, the British fleet and air force are gradually increasing their strength; under the current circumstances, it is still impossible to predict the future direction of the operations. In short, the current state of the Pacific War has reached the most important stage of the Greater East Asia War. We should follow Sun Tzu's saying "place them in a deadly position and then they will live" and seize the opportunity to destroy the British and Americans."

### Japanese Circles Comfort Detained Japanese Residents

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – Various circles in Japan are comforting and encouraging Japanese residents detained in enemy countries. The Enemy Countries Resident Association consulted with the Council of Commerce and determined, after discussing with the Red Cross, to pack kelp and wakame and send them to Japanese residents residing in India to increase their nutrition and express their condolences.

A telegram to compatriots nationwide: All fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters, please take note: On the 28th of last month, the Wartime Mass Representatives Conference of various provinces and cities was held in the capital. Representatives of the national masses gathered in one hall, exchanged opinions, and jointly discussed state affairs. The resolutions passed are of great significance. In addition to sincerely supporting all the resolutions of the representatives' meeting, the citizens' congress has listed four points, requesting the government and relevant parties to implement them as soon as possible: "Unified National Salvation Movement" Our country has suffered from foreign aggression and internal warlord division, leading to a precarious national situation and the people's livelihood being difficult. The current urgent tasks are to seek internal peace and unity, oppose local divisions, seek external independence and autonomy, oppose the advantages of the great powers, and to eliminate the disturbances of the communists, which are sufficient to hinder the local "Establishment of Public Opinion Organs" National weaving, implementing local autonomy, and establishing public opinion organs are the most concrete manifestations of exerting the power of the masses, and should be realized in the short term, in order to gather all forces as a backing for the government and complete the work of restoration. "Improve People's Livelihoods" Since the incident, the people's livelihood has been extremely difficult, and the biggest reason for this is that materials have not been circulated and individuals have greedily sought exorbitant profits. For the present plan, the first step should be to open up the sources of materials and further seek reasonable control. All speculative profit-seeking illegal controls should be strictly prohibited in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. "Oppose the Great Powers' Warfare in China" Our country has suffered from successive wars, and the people have been displaced and devastated. The national strength has been exhausted. In order to seek national independence and freedom, and to seek national liberation and revival, we should strictly oppose the Great Powers using the Chinese mainland as a battlefield, and blind bombing of non-military areas is especially hated by the people of the country. Effective measures should be taken as soon as possible to prevent the motherland from falling into a state of irreparable destruction. The above points are especially appealed to all compatriots across the country to request the government and relevant parties to implement them quickly and effectively. The people are fortunate, the country is fortunate.

Weekly Commentary

### Property and War

— Zhou Yuying

The enemy's long-propagated San Francisco Conference, Chongqing especially appointed Song Ziwen as the head of the delegation, and first-class figures such as Gu Weijun, Wang Chonghui, Hu Shi, and Wei Daoming as members, with Zhang Junli, Dong Biwu, Li Huang, and others also participating, totaling fifty people. Chongqing's serious participation in the conference, coupled with the exaggerated boasting from Britain and the United States, created the impression that this conference would have enormous power, accelerating the resolution of the current war's suffering. However, regarding the enemy's frequent conferences and talks, we have only two feelings: first, it proves that there are too many contradictions among the anti-Axis powers, and holding such conferences or talks is intended to mitigate the sharpening of these contradictions, avoiding division and conflict; second, it proves that the anti-Axis powers' war effort is insufficient, and the people are weary of war, hence the repeated holding of so-called conferences and talks to stimulate the will to fight and suppress the atmosphere of war-weariness. Moreover, another aim of Britain, the United States, and China is to deceive and rope in smaller countries, which is certainly not a waste of effort, but if weak countries and colonies overemphasize these conferences and talks, or harbor wishful thinking and reliance, they will inevitably be greatly deceived. Throughout history, the beginning and ending of wars, apart from various emotion-related actions, have always been centered on the issue of property. Human enjoyment cannot be separated from property, and the activities, fights, crimes, and even various internal strife, large-scale domestic wars, and world wars that arise from human enjoyment are inextricably linked to the issue of property. Looking at the crux of the current great war, firstly, in Asia, Japan's progress in the hundred years since the Meiji Restoration and its economic development have been deeply constrained, with almost all parts of Asia restricted by the power of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. The September 18th Incident was Japan's helpless attempt to seek development in Manchuria. Instead of considering lifting the restrictions on the entirety of Asia, Britain and the United States only knew how to instigate China's resistance against Japan, vainly hoping to profit from the sidelines. As a result, the war's expansion eventually became uncontrollable. Secondly, in Europe, Germany, after its defeat in 1914, was burdened by the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, leaving Germany impoverished and without a way out. In contrast, the wealth and superiority of Britain, the United States, and France highlighted a stark contrast, with some drowning in wine and meat while others starved by the roadside. If Britain and the United States had respected humanity and justice, they should have thoroughly corrected this long ago. But in fact, they first wanted to use Germany to restrain the Soviet Union, then wanted to suppress Germany, and finally even allied with the Soviet Union to eliminate Germany. However, we know that if Germany is truly eliminated, the situation in Europe will be even more unimaginable. The expansion of Soviet power will, in less than ten years, lead to a third world war that is even broader and more tragic. If the property issue is not resolved, if property contradictions are not eliminated, and if the rich and powerful do not restrain their special interests, the oppressed will inevitably resort to bloody struggles for survival. Thus, war after war will never be eliminated.

Regarding the contradictions of property, we certainly do not recognize the views of communism, because the Soviet Union's wage system and private property system still exist, proving that certain systems of capitalism are not venomous snakes but are necessary for a practical society. However, when property becomes excessively self-serving, contradictions will sharpen, expanding until war becomes inevitable. If property can focus on its public nature, limiting individual self-interest and emphasizing the overall public good, the contradictions of property can be mitigated or even eliminated. To distinguish between the public and private nature of property and to limit private interest while promoting public interest, Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, included the provisions of "equalization of land ownership and regulation of capital" in his Principle of People's Livelihood. China does not need to adopt a proletarian revolution to confiscate the property of landlords and capitalists, but it must limit the self-serving nature of this property and promote its public benefit. Therefore, with the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, property will have no internal contradictions, and there will be no external wars.

The San Francisco Conference, convened following the Dumbarton Oaks talks, is discussing "proposals for a general international organization after the war." In any international negotiation, the opinions of large and small countries always create a conflict. Large countries are often preparing for further war, while small countries hope to maintain peace forever. In the Dumbarton Oaks talks proposals, the Chongqing government proposed the establishment of an international gendarmerie by the League of Nations, international administration of specific colonies, and the establishment of the principle of racial equality, all of which were opposed and shelved. If we sincerely demand peace and eliminate war, these three proposals are all necessary. In particular, the international administration of colonies and the establishment of the principle of racial equality are of great relevance to the promotion of the public benefit of property. However, British and American capitalists are determined not to abandon their superior views, and even want to acquire new special interests. Britain and the United States' traditional policy is that in times of war emergency, they will not hesitate to say the sweetest words to small countries and colonies, but once the war ends, they immediately turn ruthless, not hesitating to adopt any means to protect their national property. At this time, they naturally abandon the public good of the world and only rely on the self-interest of their own few financial giants. Therefore, it is futile for the Chongqing government to talk to Britain and the United States about racial equality and the rational management of colonies.

Regarding the nature of property in various countries of the world today, in the Soviet Union, important property is in the hands of the state, which naturally enables it to better promote public benefit and suppress private interest; China, in its economic principles, emphasizes equalization of land ownership and regulation of capital, and if successfully implemented in the future, will naturally also promote public benefit and suppress private interest. In addition, in totalitarian states like Japan and Germany, the state's power to control property is increasingly advanced, making it easy to suppress the private interest of property and promote its public benefit. The problem lies with Britain and the United States. The former is an old empire of centuries, with colonies all over the world, boasting that "the sun never sets on the British flag." The latter laid a startling foundation during World War I, and while the world was mired in war, the United States took advantage of the war to reap huge profits. The focus of the world's property lies in Britain and the United States, and they are intoxicated by the unrestricted expansion of property, and will never consider the nature of property, let alone promoting public benefit and suppressing private interest. They have not even dreamed of it.

For Britain and the United States, which occupy a historically superior position in the world's property, it is a dream to expect them to restrain themselves without suffering defeat. Roosevelt convened the San Francisco Conference to build his international leadership position through the conference. To forge this international leadership position, he may listen to the grievances of various countries with the greatest patience, but he is definitely not inviting a group of opponents to discuss prices and add a kind of restriction to himself. Unfortunately, while the San Francisco Conference was in preparation, Roosevelt suddenly passed away. Although the conference schedule was not delayed, it was devoid of spirit. At best, it would be a perfunctory end to a public matter. Originally, even if Roosevelt had not died, we believed that this conference could not solve the problem of property contradictions, and could not solve the problem of war. Now that Roosevelt is dead, the conference, while preparations were enthusiastic, will naturally end hastily, and the attending representatives will surely come with excitement and leave with disappointment!

### Complex and Subtle Relations Between the United States and the Soviet Union Towards Chongqing

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, returned to the United States on the 2nd. In his first meeting with reporters, regarding the Allied policy of assistance to Chongqing, he stated, "The United States only recognizes the Chongqing regime. Military, political, and economic assistance is only provided to the Chongqing regime. Therefore, military supplies cannot be provided to the Chinese Communist Party, which is only a political party." This statement aroused great resentment from the Chinese Communist Party. For example, the CCP's official newspaper, Xinhua Daily, carried a statement saying, "Hurley's statement will inevitably cause division in China and create internal strife." Public opinion in the United States towards Chongqing is divided, with some welcoming it as a defender of democracy, while others criticizing Chongqing for being dictatorial and unable to achieve unity. Some so-called China experts in the United States, such as Lattimore, regard the CCP as the "most progressive party." Therefore, the United States sent Hurley to mediate between the Chongqing and Communist parties, attempting to promote the establishment of a new unified regime based on democracy. However, due to the fundamentally different positions of both sides, it ended in failure. The United States' goal in assisting Chongqing is primarily to strengthen the war against Japan, which is extremely obvious. However, providing military supplies to the CCP would be tantamount to recognizing the CCP as a political party and government, further dividing the two major forces and wasting combat power. Therefore, although the United States knows that Chongqing is facing many difficulties, it still regards the Chongqing regime as the only political power and spares no effort in assisting it. If the CCP does not receive assistance from the United States, it will actively draw more people and resources into the Soviet sphere of influence, and the relationship between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing will become more complex and subtle on the Chinese mainland.

### America's Anguish

— Matsudaira Tadahisa

This time, Truman was honored to become an occupant of the White House, but I am worried about him. Roosevelt had twelve years of presidential experience, and he had the qualifications of a congressional politician, adept at rhetoric, and skillfully managed the difficult-to-handle Congress. But what about the new president? Truman is just a politician from a rural background. What qualifications does he have to be president? So, it is conceivable that he will find it quite difficult to handle national affairs. Now, let's try to compare the new and old presidents to draw an outline.

Conditions for Roosevelt's Success

Roosevelt came from a distinguished family and grew up in an environment suitable for becoming a great politician, accumulating the necessary experience to become a great president, and possessing all the conditions. He served twice as the notoriously difficult Governor of New York, and became president at the age of fifty-one, and has been so for more than twelve years. If he hadn't died, he would have been destined to be the master of the White House for another three years. Only Roosevelt has been elected president four times in the United States, from which it can be said that Roosevelt was an outstanding person. Roosevelt had a beautiful face and was also a first-class speaker. In particular, his voice was full of sexual power, making women feel inferior. When we look at the photos of the Tehran Conference and the Crimean Conference, Roosevelt is in the center, with Stalin on the right and Churchill on the left. Perhaps this is because Stalin and Churchill received huge amounts of military supplies and food from the United States under Lend-Lease, so they had to flatter him, but I think the reason is more than that. I am afraid it was Roosevelt's greatness that made Stalin and Churchill show respect.

However, the unknown Truman could not be found in the Who's Who published in 1937. Later, although Harry Truman was finally found in the newly published Who's Who, there is no record of what he did before the age of fifty. This is not the malicious criticism of an enemy correspondent, saying that he is a man who came out of darkness. It is already incredible that this kind of person could become the Vice President of the United States. He was nominated as the Vice President at the Democratic Party Congress last June, which even he himself did not expect. This time, the president's chair fell from the sky, which naturally surprised him a lot. According to the clear provisions of the U.S. Constitution, if the president dies, the vice president will be promoted. Even if Truman knows that he is not capable of doing the job, he is not allowed to resign at will. In short, what is done is done, and there is no way to undo it.

When I saw Truman's photo, I couldn't find the face of a president anywhere on him. When I opened the New York Times Magazine with his resume, I was even more surprised. Truman served as an army captain in World War I. After retiring, he ran to the gangster gambling city of Kansas, and was introduced by the local gangster Pendergast to become a court judge, doing this kind of rural political work until 1935. He has no education or experience to be a great politician, comes from a low background, and is even more unworthy of occupying the seat of president. According to himself, he will not attend the San Francisco Conference. Perhaps he himself does not want to show his ugliness in public! When an international conference is held in the country, all countries send representatives to attend. Roosevelt once said that he would attend both the opening and closing ceremonies, but this Mr. Truman said that he would not attend. Does this mean that he does not want to be embarrassed on such a large scale? Is this his own idea? Or are people worried about him? (The End)

### The Various Circles of Our City Held the United National Salvation Mass Meeting Yesterday; Secretary-General Luo Attended on Behalf of the Mayor to Deliver Instructions

The people from various circles of our city, in response to the wartime people's representative conference held in the capital, held a united national salvation movement mass meeting at the Great Light Theater at 10:00 AM on the 21st, simultaneously with various provinces and cities across the country. As Mayor Zhou was going to the capital for official business, he specially sent Secretary-General Luo to the meeting to deliver instructions. People's representatives from various circles in our city, including Baojia personnel, party members, student youth groups, and representatives of various people's organizations, were present. People from various allied countries in Shanghai also attended as observers, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows:

Meeting Situation: On the officials' side, those present included Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou and the city government, as well as bureau chiefs Su Chengde, Xu Jiang, Yuan Rongchang, Xu Lidun, Dai Yingfu, Zhou Yuyang, Liu Xingchen, Liu Dexuan, Gu Gangwu, Chief of Staff Xiong of the Municipal Security Command, and Chairman Liu Yangshan of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Secretary-General Gu Senchen of the New Life Movement Branch, and people's representatives Yuan Lü, Chen Bin, Chen Riping, Zhou Huarin, Lu Zongxun, Yu Ming, Bai Xiaolan, and others, totaling more than two thousand people. The meeting started on time, with Chairman Yuan Lüdeng of the presidium delivering the opening remarks. He was followed by Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, who delivered a speech. Then, people's representatives Chen Riping and Chen Binhe gave speeches one after another. The declaration of the congress was then read out, followed by a telegram of respect to Acting Chairman Chen. Slogans were shouted, music was played, and the ceremony was completed. A film was screened at the end, and the meeting adjourned at half-past eleven.

Chairman's Speech: Chairman Yuan Lüdeng of the congress delivered the opening speech: "Fellow countrymen, today our city is holding a united national salvation movement mass meeting, and at the same time, other provinces and cities are holding the same meeting. The United National Salvation Movement Mass Meeting, as the name suggests, is to ask us, the people, to jointly assume the responsibility of united national salvation. We must cooperate in implementing the established national policy of the country, increase production, and alleviate the suffering of the people. We should eradicate obstacles, such as hoarding and speculation, and report them to fulfill our responsibilities. This is the purpose of today's meeting, and I hope everyone will remember it. After the meeting, tell your relatives and friends that we must unite as one and take responsibility for our respective positions."

Secretary-General's Speech: Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, gave instructions, saying in brief: "Today, Shanghai Special Municipality is holding a united national salvation movement mass meeting. Saving the country is the duty of every citizen, but without unity, saving the country is hopeless. The people should achieve unity in action through unity in mind. The Shanghai Municipal Government is willing to shoulder this responsibility together with all the citizens, so as not to fail the meaning of today's united national salvation movement mass meeting."

Chen Riping's Speech: Chen Riping spoke on the united national salvation movement mass meeting. Secretary-General Luo has already spoken in detail about its meaning, so I don't need to say more. Recently, the capital held a people's representative conference of various provinces and cities, attended by more than 50 representatives from various provinces and cities. The conference lasted for three days and had many proposals, including detailed discussions on establishing security and improving people's livelihoods. This can already be seen in the newspapers. The most important things are no more than three: - Unblocking the source of materials to reduce prices. - Increasing raw materials to maintain the textile industry. - Dispersing the population to reduce the panic of food shortages. Following this conference, today, various provinces and cities are holding the United National Salvation Movement Mass Meeting at the same time, and its significance is even more important. At the same time, Shanghai has a public opinion institution, such as the Shanghai Special Municipal Municipal Advisory Committee. With this public opinion institution, public opinion can reach the top, and the political situation can be announced to the bottom. The people should cooperate with the government to eliminate obstacles and reduce the suffering of the people. I hope everyone will work hard."

Chen Binhe's Speech: Chen Binhe spoke: "The key to the 'light or dark' problem of unified national salvation lies in how to win 'popular support'. The late Chairman Wang once said, 'We must not forget the majority of our compatriots who are shackled in Chongqing. We must liberate them and make them stand with us.' I want to add one sentence, that is: 'We must not forget the majority of our compatriots who are shackled in Yan'an. We must liberate them and make them stand with us.' How to win popular support? This is a major responsibility of the National Government. We expect the National Government to make the oppressed compatriots in Chongqing and Yan'an unanimously return. To achieve this, we must first obtain the unanimous support of the people in the peaceful areas. How can we obtain the support of the people in the peaceful areas?

First, the political system must be enlightened. In other words, we must compete politically with Chongqing and Yan'an. We must not repeat the political failures of Chongqing and Yan'an that are opposed by the people. We must do what is beneficial to the people that Chongqing and Yan'an have not yet done first.

Second, we must solve practical problems, such as how to prevent production from declining further, how to prevent prices from rising further, how to completely eliminate profiteering and speculation, and how to avoid unnecessary wartime suffering, etc.

Third, we must allow the people to participate in politics, value public opinion, listen to the true voices of the people, and accept feasible suggestions from the people. At the same time, we must establish public opinion institutions to jointly lead the unified national salvation movement.

The above are expectations for the National Government. On the part of our people, we must also change our selfish, passive, and opportunistic attitudes. We must actively cooperate with the government to implement national policies, demand political participation, support the government on the one hand, and urge the government on the other. There are still some leading figures in Shanghai who maintain their selfish, passive, and opportunistic attitudes. They say they oppose Chongqing, but in fact, they use all opportunities in the peaceful areas during the war to seek exorbitant profits and engage in speculation. These people have no concept of the country or society. Not only do we have to exclude them, but Chongqing may not tolerate them either.

Speaking of the issue of unified national salvation, there must be a strengthened National Government to lead it. The strengthening of the National Government must start from three aspects at the same time. The first is the efforts of the leaders of the National Government themselves, the second is the support of the people, and the third is the cooperation of the allied country of Japan. Therefore, we hope that the allied country will implement its new policy towards China, implement the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and gradually strengthen the position of the National Government, while at the same time cooperating with our public opinion institutions to assist in promoting the unified national salvation work.

Finally, let's talk about the issue of Shanghai. In recent months, thanks to the efforts of Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and other officials, the municipal administration has been gradually progressing. We citizens should work together to make Shanghai a national model political zone."

Declaration of the Congress: We understand that the country and the people are closely related. The country has the responsibility to protect the people, and the people have the obligation to defend the country. The survival and development of the country depend entirely on the concerted efforts of the people. Mr. Gu Tinglin once said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country." Therefore, every citizen has a responsibility to the country.

Now, the situation has reached its most serious stage. The Greater East Asia War is not only a war to revive China, but also a war to liberate all the nations of East Asia. Only by pooling our efforts and working together to overcome difficulties can we break through the current difficulties. The people's representatives of various circles in the capital, in view of this, in order to promote public opinion and provide the government with reference for adopting various political, economic, and cultural issues, initiated the convening of a wartime people's representative conference of various provinces and cities in the capital. The significance is very profound and significant. The government authorities also deeply expect this meeting.

At the beginning of the return of the National Government to the capital, it used peace to strive for China's freedom, anti-communism to realize China's unification, and nation-building to consolidate China's independence. Standing on the position of the people, we must fully assist in the implementation of the national policy and allow no negligence. The convening of this meeting is entirely out of the people's awareness, based on spontaneous enthusiasm, to discuss the countermeasures for saving the country. Representatives from various provinces and cities are all reputable people in the society, gathered together to study carefully, how to seek independence and autonomy internally and externally, in order to gather wisdom and contribute to the government as a reference for policy implementation.

The most important of the proposals passed at this meeting are two: First, determine the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle, launch a unified national salvation movement, and all compatriots in the country should take this as the goal, gather all their strength to go, abandon party concepts, and have no regional prejudice, under the highest principle of the country and the nation, unite all parties and factions, all regions and all circles, and form a unity; Second, at the critical juncture of the country today, it is necessary to govern together to achieve success, so adopting public opinion is important, and officials and people are of one mind, and then they can use their strength to reform the system. The government promulgates laws and regulations to protect the people's freedom of assembly, and at the same time, the central and local governments establish people's organizations at all levels to organize the people to gather all their strength and express their opinions. The declaration issued by the congress stated the points that should be paid attention to in the three aspects of the nation, people's rights, and people's livelihoods in the future, and also sent a telegram to the people of all nations in the world with a heart of sympathy, calling for peace, and to the people of East Asia, fighting together for the common cause of loving East Asia.

Shanghai is the center of national politics, economy, and culture. It is even more important to encourage public opinion during wartime than in other places. In order to respond to the wartime people's representative conference in the capital, we specially convened the Shanghai Special Municipal United National Salvation Movement Mass Meeting today to awaken all citizens' thorough understanding of the current situation, help the government wholeheartedly, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, discuss unity, restoration, and seek freedom and liberation externally, so that the government and the people work together to strive for victory and complete the war. This declaration is hereby made.

### The Municipal Economic Bureau Set a Deadline for the Registration of Major Commodities; Failure to Register After the Deadline Will Be Punished as Hoarding

The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in order to suppress prices and curb hoarding, was ordered to register major commodities. From April 15th to May 14th, all merchants dealing in major commodities should register their inventories of designated major commodities within the deadline. The bureau also convened various trade associations of major commodities to explain the purpose of the major commodity registration and instructed the trade associations to urge their members to comply. Now, the associations have issued letters to their member merchants to handle the matter jointly. According to the reporter's inquiry to the bureau, if merchants have major commodities but fail to apply for registration within the deadline, they will be regarded as hoarding materials and punished according to law if discovered after the deadline. The association authorities will also be subject to appropriate penalties for member merchants.

Finance Bureau Supplements Business Registration: Recently, the Municipal Finance Bureau felt that the amount of special consumption tax collected by various merchants on behalf of the government was far short of the monthly collection amount in light of the current market situation. In addition to sending a large number of staff to strictly investigate and prosecute any concealment or evasion, it also found that the urban area was vast and it was difficult to investigate the establishment and closure of stores. Therefore, it requested the municipal government to issue a notice to supplement the business registration within a time limit. All stores in the city that have not yet filled out the application form for registration, as well as those who have not reported and paid the special consumption tax, should apply for registration at the competent branch within the time limit to avoid punishment.

### Household Oil Rationing Planned for Distribution at the Beginning of Next Month

According to sources in the oil and grain industry, the Municipal Oil and Grain Allocation Office, in view of the current chaotic selling price of cooking oil, which has a great impact on people's food, is actively preparing for household cooking oil allocation in order to meet the needs of people's food. The office has now reached an agreement with the relevant authorities to decide on the method of supplying a part of the allocation oil. The deficit will be supplemented by cooking oil vendors. It is expected to be distributed at the beginning of next month.

### Special Sugar Allocation for This Period Approved for Distribution

The Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association has adjusted the distribution of special rationed sugar, which is still distributed through the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office. The total amount for this period is about 900+ stones. The office has now notified various agencies to pay and receive the allocation according to the approved quantity from today.

### Minister Idebuchi Hosts Dinner for Newspaper Reporters

Minister Idebuchi of the Press Department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai hosted a dinner for reporters from various Chinese newspapers in the city at the Peace Hotel at 12:00 noon yesterday (21st). Minister Idebuchi arrived on time with Messrs. Maehara, Saka Yoshio, and Esaki. Minister Idebuchi answered in detail the recent battle situation on Okinawa Island and the future trend of land warfare. During the banquet, they toasted each other, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The host and guests enjoyed themselves until half past one.

### The Construction Bureau Plans to Build Highways and Bridges

In order to assist in the work of dispersing the population, the Municipal Construction Bureau has actively rectified the city's land and water transportation to facilitate the safety of travelers. It is planned to repair the highways connecting the city to various counties, such as the Xihu, Jialuo, Hutai, Luohuan, Suhu, and Shangsong roads, as well as bridges. After the bureau sent personnel to survey the results, it is now preparing a plan to submit to the municipal government for repairs in the short term.

Revised Building Permit Fee: The Municipal Construction Bureau previously revised the fees for various construction, installation of sanitary facilities, and renovation, repair, painting, demolition, and shed erection permits set by the former Works Bureau, which are now ineffective. After being approved by the municipal government, it will be collected according to the newly revised fee amount from the first day of next month. The adjusted collection fee includes a 3.5 to 6 times increase in various building permit fees, a 3 to 6 times increase in various sanitary equipment permit fees, and a 4 to 8 times increase in renovation, repair, painting, demolition, and shed erection permit fees. The industry association issued a notice to its members yesterday, and the implementation of the collection will be implemented on the scheduled date.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Held a Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its fifth joint meeting of all directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM on the 20th. More than 20 directors and supervisors attended, chaired by Chairman Yuan Lüdeng and Supervisor Wen Lanting. The report items included temporary relief bonds, industrial and commercial parity rice, and revenue and expenditure expenses. The discussion items included the resignation of Standing Director Qin Runqing due to old age and illness. It was resolved to continue to invite him to serve as a director. Director Zhang Shufang was elected to succeed him as standing director. In addition, issues such as assisting the development of industry and commerce, the treatment of the association's employees, a tentative list of labor dispute arbitration committee members, and the application of public store for membership were discussed and decided separately after careful exchange of opinions.

### Outstanding Police Officers Separately Rewarded and Promoted

Since Director Zhou took office in the Municipal Police Bureau, he has issued a plan to improve police administration, implement organizational adjustments, refresh personnel, and improve treatment, which have been completed in stages. Director Zhou is particularly concerned about rewarding outstanding police officers and improving police welfare. It is learned that the bureau has decided to strengthen its work and encourage outstanding employees. Those who have worked hard and achieved excellent results will be promoted regardless of nationality to encourage them. The measures have also been formulated and promulgated, and the heads of various divisions, bureaus, offices, teams, etc. have been ordered to truthfully select and report on the assessment. It is also scheduled to issue 3 catties of cheap cooking oil (priced at 490 yuan) and 20 cigarettes (each Kaimi 2 yuan and Shuangqiang brand 5 corners) to police officers and servants tomorrow (23rd).

### The Contribution Society Stops Accepting Contributions from the Entertainment Industry

The various entertainment industry associations in the city had previously made voluntary contributions to respond to the development of the city's New Life Movement work and other mass movements. The Municipal Party Department and the New Life Movement Association have a "Contribution Office Now Committee". Since the central government has planned funds for the above-mentioned work, there is no need to use public contributions. Therefore, the association has stopped accepting the contributions from April. If anyone collects money in the name of the above-mentioned items, the associations or merchants should appeal to the competent authorities.

### Restrictions on Residence and Passage of Third-Country Nationals; The Japanese Gendarmerie Authorities Revise the Measures

The Japanese Gendarmerie in Shanghai promulgated regulations on the residence and passage restrictions for third-country nationals in Shanghai on April 1, 1942. Those who violated the regulations were subject to severe military law punishment. It has been found that there have been many incidents of violation of the regulations recently, and the offenders have been subject to military law punishment. The Japanese Gendarmerie authorities have recently decided to strengthen the restrictions and reiterated the prohibition on the 21st, hoping that all third-country nationals in Shanghai will pay attention to it. The restricted areas for the residence and passage of third-country nationals have been changed from today. The application procedures have also been revised. All third-country nationals who currently reside outside the restricted area should immediately obtain a residence permit, and third-country nationals who currently reside inside the restricted area who want to leave the restricted area should obtain a passage permit in advance. The application procedures are as follows:

Anyone who wants to obtain a residence permit must present a residence certificate from the consular authorities of their country and three photos of the applicant to the Foreign Affairs Section of the Japanese Gendarmerie on Guangdong Road. Anyone who wants to obtain a passage permit must state the reason for the application to the Foreign Affairs Section of the Japanese Gendarmerie on Guangdong Road, and must be certified by the consular authorities of the applicant's country or other countries or individuals of the same status, and three photos of the applicant. Third-country nationals who want to leave the Shanghai area for travel should still apply for permission from the Japanese Naval Attaché or the Special Envoy of the National Government as in the past.

### Banks and Money Shops Will Suspend Savings Business

The Donglai and Yongda banks in the city have announced the suspension of savings department business and have notified all savings account holders to withdraw their deposits from today, otherwise they will be transferred to the commercial department for handling. The Central News Agency reporter learned from the financial circles yesterday that the savings business of various commercial savings banks has developed greatly in the past, and the amount of savings funds received is very large. However, in recent years, prices have risen, and it is difficult for banks and money shops to use the savings funds they absorb. The interest on savings accounts is also very low. In addition, speculation is rampant, and those who seek exorbitant profits are emerging one after another. Therefore, most depositors are withdrawing their savings one after another, so that the statistics of savings in various banks and shops have been reduced to more than 90% compared with the past. All savings departments seem to be nominal. In order to save expenses, there is a move to suspend the savings business. Not only the above two banks are like this, but other banks and shops are also preparing to suspend savings business. All unfinished matters of the savings department will be handled by the commercial department. It is expected that the commercial savings banks will focus on commercial business and receive deposits from depositors.

### Shanghai Branch of the News Association Holds a Current Affairs Speech Meeting, Inviting Three Allied Nations' Press Officers to Speak

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association held a current affairs speech meeting at the Waibaidu Bridge Cathay Hotel at 5 p.m. on the 21st. Press officers from the three authorities in Shanghai, namely Japan's Army, Navy, and Embassy, were invited to speak. Among those present were Army Press Officer Izubuchi, Navy Press Officer Matsushima, Shanghai Office of the Embassy Information Officer Matsudaira, Chairman of the News Association's Shanghai Branch Chen Binhe, Executive Directors Xu Liqiu and Chen Riping, General Secretary Feng, and over a thousand representatives from various circles. The meeting began with a speech by Chen Binhe, Chairman of the News Association's Shanghai Branch, followed by speeches from Officer Izubuchi, Officer Matsushima, and Officer Matsudaira. Finally, the German film "Unfinished Symphony" was screened. The meeting lasted three hours before adjourning.

Chairman's Speech
Chairman Chen Binhe's speech was as follows: "The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, in order to allow all sectors to understand the truth of the current situation, is holding this current affairs speech meeting. Today, we have specially invited the press officers from the three Japanese authorities, the Army, Navy, and Embassy, to speak, and we are extremely honored by their presence. Shanghai is the place with the most rumors. There are many people who create rumors, and there are also particularly many people who readily believe them. Why are there so many people who create rumors? Because Shanghai is an extremely complex society where people from all walks of life gather. Those on the enemy side create rumors with the aim of conspiring to sabotage and disturb people's minds. Speculators create rumors with the aim of stirring up trouble and profiting from the chaos. However, why do people generally readily believe rumors? Firstly, the authorities and the press lack correct explanations of current affairs. Secondly, the general public lacks common sense in judging current events, and their understanding is unclear, leading to the spread of misinformation. Thirdly, rumors often contain strange and peculiar elements. Those who only have a superficial understanding treat them as special news, embellishing them vividly, as if they were real, easily attracting audiences and spreading them from person to person. However, no matter what impact the spread of rumors has, it cannot be ignored at this critical juncture. Therefore, in addition to explaining the truth of the current situation in writing, we also hold current affairs speeches from time to time to prevent the abuses of rumors. Now, please listen to the speeches of the ministers."

Speech by Officer Izubuchi

Strengthening the Homeland Defense Posture
The Japanese Army authorities have recently formulated the "Homeland Decisive Battle Training," and the news of its promulgation to the entire army has already been reported. The greatest spirit expressed in this decisive battle training is to "carry through the belief that the divine land will never perish, abide by the Emperor's edict, defend the Emperor's residence, the sacred land where the spirits reside, to achieve victory. To achieve this goal, based on the spirit of reckless collision in the Japanese warrior tradition, we pledge to fight to the death, and if anyone invades the imperial soil, they will be exterminated, so that not a single person will survive. The military personnel believe that the 100 million people are the vanguard in completing the national war, emphasizing deep wartime friendships, showing the true posture of the Imperial Army, to fully protect the country." This is the fundamental spirit of the "decisive battle training." It is the essence of the spirit of the Japanese soldiers and officers, and there is no need to elaborate on it today. The current war situation has entered a major decisive battle stage related to the rise and fall of Japan and the entire Greater East Asia, and this decisive battle may even unfold on Japanese soil. In light of this situation, the Minister of the Army has clearly instructed the Air Force, together with the previously established Homeland General Command and the National Volunteer Corps, to jointly strengthen the homeland defense posture, which is to encourage all soldiers to bravely rise up at the time of the decisive battle for victory.

Practicing War Training and Fighting Bravely
Since the enemy forces began their general counteroffensive from Guadalcanal Island, they have continued to advance recklessly until today. However, the closer the enemy's offensive gets to the Japanese homeland, the greater their difficulties and the greater their losses will be. I assert that the key to destroying the enemy in this Greater East Asia War lies in one thing: annihilating the enemy's combat power, which relies on material resources to attack. In other words, making the American soldiers shed their last drop of blood, whether the battlefield is in the Pacific or on Japanese soil, is not a problem. In short, the Japanese Army and Navy soldiers on the Okinawa front are practicing the above-mentioned decisive battle training, fighting bravely, and inflicting great losses on the enemy. In the future, when the enemy forces invade the Japanese mainland or the continent, it will be when the enemy sheds their last drop of blood and can no longer rise again.

Enemy Propaganda Will Inevitably Fail
Recently, the United States fabricated false news of Japan's tyrannical behavior in the Philippines and publicized it widely. Halsey, in particular, is vigorously carrying out this kind of counter-propaganda, which is merely to conceal their tyrannical behavior of sinking the Japanese ship Awaji Maru, or to attempt to propagandize for the soon-to-be-closed San Francisco Conference. It is also because they have suffered increasing losses of people and materials as they approach Okinawa from Iwo Jima, making combat difficult and weakening the people's will to fight. Therefore, they want to boost their people's will to fight and incite hatred of the enemy as a means to be used. The Japanese Army has now promulgated the decisive battle training, because it believes that the key to victory lies in annihilating the American soldiers, reiterating its determination to win. It goes without saying that Japan's 100 million people also have the same understanding and determination. At the same time, the spirit and awareness of our allied country China and all our compatriots in other Greater East Asian regions are becoming more intense and stronger. I am extremely pleased to witness this.

Speech by Officer Matsudaira

Americans Insult the People of East Asia
Today, I will tell you about the history of the United States and the low moral education of the American people. It seems that there are fewer anti-British and anti-American people in Shanghai, and the worship mentality is stronger than before. The reason is that the understanding of British and Americans is not clear. Regarding the history of the United States, there is really nothing to worship since its founding. The European immigrants to the United States initially included those who were persecuted due to religious reasons, as well as the unemployed, fugitives, and uneducated people. Therefore, the level of knowledge was quite low, and disputes often arose. For example, the French went to Canada, the Spanish went to Central and South America, and Mexico is a place where people of mixed races gather, which later became a separate nation, and the same is true in South America. Later, after the British Anglo-Saxon people immigrated to the United States, they engaged in large-scale killings and eliminated other ethnic groups. This is the history of the United States not cooperating with other ethnic groups and always trying to conquer other ethnic groups with weapons. This situation shows that the American people are inherently barbaric. The same is true of their government. The same methods were used against Australia at the beginning, killing and conquering Australia. When I lived in the United States in the past, I had a better understanding of the situation in the United States. Taking the public bus in Washington, D.C. as an example, once I sat in the back of the bus, and a compatriot told me not to sit in the back, because the seats in the back were for black people, and white people all sat in the front row. Although there were no such signs in the bus, the American tolerance of black people had long become a habit. In train stations, or even elevators in urban hotels, black people were absolutely not allowed to enjoy them. Once, I went to a large hotel for a meal, and suddenly an American asked me if I was Chinese. If I was Chinese, I would not be allowed to enter. I said that I was Japanese and told him that I was serving in the embassy, so I was allowed to enter. However, at first, the Americans' feelings towards the Chinese were still acceptable, but not towards the Japanese. I was very surprised and tried to find out the reason. After the Americans explained, they said that they had no good feelings towards the Japanese because the Japanese resisted everywhere, while the Chinese were quite obedient. The Americans further used the metaphor of raising dogs to insult them very much. It can be seen that the Americans already have this mentality, which is an insult to the people of East Asia. The current situation of Americans in Chongqing is roughly the same, which is the inherent character of Americans.

The American Government Deceives the People
Secondly, the Americans are fond of women, such as listening to women's words, and having dances or illicit relationships with women are very common. About fifty years ago, it was common for young men and women to have affairs in the suburbs. The Americans themselves called that time the wild age. This phenomenon lasted for as long as twenty years. The other day, I read an American magazine in which it was written about women that the spirit of housekeeping among general women has been quite depressed recently. Most of them have affairs with others after their husbands leave home to serve in the military. Therefore, the number of divorce cases in the United States is increasing day by day. The responsibility for this weakness lies entirely with American women, and men should also bear it. At the same time, the government is most afraid of women's accusations. For example, there is an American soldier who has died in battle in the Pacific. The government did not inform his family of the facts. Later, the soldier's wife sent a letter to the Department of the Army to inquire about her husband's whereabouts and asked for an investigation to inform her. After the Department of the Army received the letter, it replied that your husband is doing well and is now serving in ××. Please don't worry. After three months, the woman did not receive a letter from her husband, so she rushed to Washington to directly ask the Department of the Army. As a result, they again made excuses that he was currently suffering from illness and was recuperating and would be cured soon, and tricked the woman back home. About a month later, the government sent a letter to the woman, saying that her husband had died of illness and not to be sad. From these various things, it can be seen that the American government is deceiving its people.

The American Education Level is Low
As for the low education level of Americans, an example can be given. The last time a B29 type aircraft attempted to bomb Japan, it passed through a certain place and was shot down by the Japanese army. The American soldiers landed by parachute and were captured by the Japanese army. Later, the Japanese military police interrogated the soldier about his ordered destination. The soldier did not know the geography and only showed the map, and the destination he pointed to was not Japan, but Manchuria. It can be seen that many American soldiers lack common sense, and their contempt for the Chinese is even more exposed. Once, an American magazine investigated the level of Americans' combat ability, and the result was that less than a quarter of them qualified, and most of them had no answer to the combat objective.

Therefore, I deeply hope that the Chinese people will not attach importance to the United States. The so-called American civilization and moral spirit cannot be compared with our East Asians. All our cooperation must be treated equally, but the United States does not treat the people of East Asia equally at all. In order to change the Americans' bad views, we can only educate them with this war. I also hope that you will cooperate in the war, change your views on Americans, and promote the completion of the Greater East Asia War.
