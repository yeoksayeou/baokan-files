### Echoing Okinawa Island's Fierce Battle, Japanese Air Force Continues Fierce Attacks, Sinking and Destroying Fourteen Ships Including Aircraft Carriers and Battleships

Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 18th: the Japanese Air Force, echoing the fierce battle of the defending forces on Okinawa Island, continued to fiercely attack enemy mobile forces and ships around the island. On April 16th and 17th, the Japanese side's confirmed combat results are as follows: five aircraft carriers sunk (including three regular aircraft carriers), one battleship sunk, two battleships or cruisers sunk, one cruiser sunk, four transport ships sunk, and one battleship destroyed.

Southern Islands Base, 18th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch - Enemy ships around Okinawa Island, due to the stalemate of land battles, are extremely irritable and continue to attack Japanese positions on land. As of the 17th, from the northern airfield of the island to the Nakagusuku Bay area, a semicircular sea area was counted with five to seven battleships, ten to thirteen cruisers, about twenty destroyers, about twenty minesweepers, and about eighty transport ships, constantly bombarding the land.

Southern Islands Base, 18th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch - The U.S. forces invading Okinawa Island have been fiercely attacked by the Japanese army for days, and their strength has visibly weakened. The enemy's land forces have made no progress in the face of the Japanese defense forces' fierce resistance. The northern and central airfields of the island have been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army, making it impossible for the enemy to use them. They have now changed their strategy, attempting to obtain air bases outside the island. Part of the enemy forces landed on Ie Shima on the 16th, and simultaneously landed on Manna Island, a small island to the south.

Japanese Special Attack Forces' Combat Results Statistics

Central News Agency Dispatch - The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Forces intercepted the enemy mobile forces attacking Leyte, and their spirit of self-sacrifice and dedication to the nation caused great consternation in the anti-Axis countries. On December 25th of last year, Special Attack Force Commander Lieutenant Yukio Seki first crashed into an enemy ship. Subsequently, the Army and Navy Special Attack Forces successively followed Lieutenant Seki's lead, achieving tragic and solemn combat results, which truly moved the entire Japanese nation. Since the U.S. forces occupied Iwo Jima and concentrated the anti-Axis navies to invade the waters of the southwestern islands, the Japanese Army and Navy air forces have all formed special attack forces to fiercely attack the invading enemy ships, achieving unprecedented victories in the history of warfare. As a result, the enemy has become extremely terrified of the special attack forces' attacks. Especially the enemy fleet near Okinawa Island retreats to the rear at dawn and dusk to avoid their offensive. The U.S. authorities, fearing that the activities of the Japanese special attack forces would affect their domestic situation, have kept silent about the news of the special attack forces since the Philippine campaign. However, the American people have recently begun to discuss the special attack forces due to the heavy losses of the U.S. military, which greatly embarrassed the U.S. Navy Department. Finally, when meeting with reporters, they admitted the fact of the Japanese special attack forces. The Nimitz Command also announced that "the attacks of the Japanese special attack forces have caused very little damage, only losing a few small ships." They also said, "From a military point of view, this type of attack method cannot be affirmed," which is nothing more than an attempt to deceive their own people. However, the American correspondents in front of Okinawa Island have repeatedly reported on the fierce attacks of the Japanese special attack forces, which greatly alarmed the Americans. The enemy's propaganda about the Japanese special attack forces is fragmented and unsystematic, which shows how significant the enemy's losses are. The enemy's counter-propaganda only serves to illustrate the magnitude of their damage and how much the enemy fears the Japanese special attack forces. Referring to the following statistics will make it clear. From October 25th of last year to April 18th of this year, the combat results achieved by the Japanese special attack forces are:

Sunk: 23 aircraft carriers, 13 battleships, 5 battleships or cruisers, 37 cruisers, 8 cruisers or destroyers, 23 destroyers, 71 transport ships, 11 large ships, 56 ships of unknown type, 17 landing craft, 3 minesweepers, 1 battleship or transport ship, 1 cruiser or transport ship, totaling 245 ships, with a loss of no less than 140,000 personnel.

Damaged and destroyed: 21 aircraft carriers, 12 battleships, 24 battleships or cruisers, 4 cruisers or destroyers, 21 destroyers, 56 transport ships, 58 ships of unknown type, 11 large ships, 1 cruiser or destroyer, 1 oil tanker or cruiser, 2 torpedo boats, totaling 220 ships, with a loss of approximately 191,500 personnel.

The above number of personnel losses is calculated as follows: 50% of the crew members for those sunk (the enemy calculates 75%), and 30% of the crew members for those damaged. This is the minimum calculation, but the actual losses are more than this. According to reports from the front, the Japanese special attack forces are still conducting general attacks, and there is no doubt that the enemy's losses will increase in the future. (Translated from the Continental New Daily)

### Three Japanese Braves Promoted Two Ranks

Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch - Japanese Army Lieutenants Daida and Wakui crashed into B-29 enemy aircraft in Nagoya on January 3rd, and Sergeant Suzuki crashed into a B-29 enemy aircraft in Tokyo on January 26th. They all died heroically. The Ministry of the Army has announced that Daida and Wakui have each been posthumously promoted two ranks to Major, and Suzuki has been posthumously promoted to Second Lieutenant.

### U.S. Ship Damage Unprecedentedly Huge, Reaching 393 Vessels

Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch - Since the start of the Okinawa campaign, the confirmed damage to the enemy U.S. forces has reached an unprecedentedly large number of 393 vessels. In addition, there are many unconfirmed combat results, which have dealt a great blow to the enemy. The types and numbers of enemy ships sunk are recorded as follows:

Ship Type  Sunk  Destroyed  Sunk or Destroyed
Aircraft Carrier  12  7  2
Battleship  10  8  1
Battleship or Cruiser  3  12  1
Battleship or Transport Ship  1
Large Ship  7  12  5
Cruiser  39  16
Cruiser or Destroyer  6  2
Cruiser or Transport Ship  1  1
Destroyer  31  22
Transport Ship  23  28
Oil Tanker or Aircraft Carrier  1
Landing Transport Ship  16
Unknown Type  63  55
Minesweeper  4  2
Torpedo Boat  2
Total  216  168  9

### Investigation of Aerial Combat Results over Southern and Northern Kyushu Yesterday Underway

Arriving in Nanjing, 18th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch - Approximately 100 B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands attacked the Kyushu region at 6:30 AM on the 18th, lasting about two hours. The main force invaded the southern Kyushu area from the vicinity of Toimisaki, attacking Japanese military aviation facilities in various places such as Kanoya, Miyakonojo, and Izumi. Another team invaded northern Kyushu from the Bungo Channel and the Tachiarai area, conducting bombing from high altitude in an attempt to destroy Japanese airfields and land facilities. However, they were intercepted by the Japanese land forces and air defense forces and fled in panic. The Japanese side's damage was minor. The results of the interception are currently under investigation, but it has been confirmed that one Japanese aircraft carried out a heroic manned attack in the sky above Mitsui County, Fukuoka Prefecture, taking down a B-29. The intention of the U.S. military to continuously bomb Kyushu is to echo the decisive battle on Okinawa Island, bomb the Japanese air bases in that area, hinder the dispatch of Japanese special attack forces, and cut off rear supply lines.

### Battles in the Amyinsson District of Burma Intensifying, Japanese Army Counterattacks on the Irrawaddy River

Burma Front Line, 18th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch - Enemy forces with significant strength began operations in early April from the Meiktila area, advancing south along the old Burma Highway. On the 10th, they invaded the Amyinsson district and are now continuing to advance with air force cover and armored units. Since the 12th, they have reached the southern Amyinsson area, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army stationed there. The enemy forces in that area have deployed hundreds of tanks and hundreds of trucks. The Japanese army is utilizing the terrain to counterattack, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. A portion of the Japanese army still holds a corner of Amyinsson on the night of the 12th, continuing to fight fiercely. The battles in the southern area are becoming increasingly intense. At the same time, the enemy forces in Meiktila, Thazi, and Wundwin (30 kilometers north of Thazi) in the rear are attempting to advance towards the Kalaw Highway and the eastern mountainous area. However, after the Japanese army counterattacked, the enemy's offensive has slowed down somewhat. The enemy's offensive on the Irrawaddy River is gradually becoming more active, echoing the offensive in the Amyinsson district. In the mountainous area east of Hsaw Kek Pyi, the enemy has deployed 30 tanks and 20 artillery pieces since the 11th to attack the Japanese front line positions. The main force of the Japanese army is constantly launching fierce counterattacks, hindering the enemy's advance. Furthermore, the main force of the East African 81st Division, which attempted to invade the Yangon area from Taungup on the southwestern coast, suffered heavy casualties under heavy fire of the Japanese army.

### Fighting Spirit on the Ryukyu Islands

In the days before the enemy U.S. landed on Iwo Jima, the Ryukyu Islands were filled with a surging and magnificent mood of preparation. The elite land and naval forces of Japan on the Ryukyu Islands were closely monitoring the movements of the enemy U.S. mobile units, and were waiting in full battle array for the enemy's landing attempts. Even the islanders were busy making bamboo spears and preparing hand grenades, determined to fight the enemy to the death. When the reporter visited the supreme commander of 〇〇, he deeply felt the passionate fighting spirit of the commander, which was compatible with his majestic appearance. I believe that the day the enemy lands on Okinawa Island will be the day the enemy is completely defeated. This is not a conclusion obtained by mathematical calculation, but a conclusion obtained by spiritual calculation. The Japanese residents on Okinawa Island are all determined to live and die with the island, and it is according to this spirit that the calculation is made. The islanders are walking barefoot in the cities, villages, mountains, and fields. This is because they have no clogs. They always make achievements in their work. They have changed the time for making clogs to making fortifications and bamboo spears.

Full Preparation

On February 〇〇, when a small fleet departing from a certain island was anchored on the edge of an island, it was attacked by enemy submarines. However, due to the commander's high morality and wisdom, the entire team escaped safely. The enemy submarine lit a beacon fire at 9:00 PM to observe the weather. This continued for two or three days. We finally got information that the U.S. mobile units had departed from 〇〇 and were heading north. At this time, we, who were watching the beacon fire, thought in our hearts about the price the enemy would pay, and our fighting will burned more fiercely.

Forts, machine gun positions, and anti-submarine aircraft began active operations.

〇〇 City suffered indiscriminate bombing by the enemy, which was truly tragic and outrageous. However, the islanders, carrying yams around their waists, were walking along. The military trucks of the army and navy were constantly running south and north. For the expansion of the airfield, the islanders also worked in shifts and voluntarily. They were all waving hoes, carrying burdens, and strengthening the island's defenses. There is no such thing as "sufficient" defense, only "better preparation," which is the goal of the joint efforts of the military, government, and civilians day and night.

Not Afraid of Difficulties

One day, I met a teenager with a large package around his waist, constantly waving his hand in front of the car. I immediately told the driver to stop. "Take us to ○ Village in the ashes!" So we took the teenager with us. This teenager was walking over mountains and fields for more than two hundred miles to meet someone on school business. When we arrived at ○ Village, the teenager said very happily, "Thank you! If you pass by S Village, please come to my house to play." After saying this, the teenager immediately walked south along the road with the approaching dusk with great spirit. Looking at this teenager, he is enough to represent the Japanese men, no matter what difficulties they face, they will go forward bravely to complete the task, even if they have to go through fire and water.

Killing Millions of Enemies

The news that the enemy had landed on Iwo Jima and was currently in fierce battle reached the Ryukyu Islands. All right, we will not refuse anyone who comes! The commander said loudly in the distance with a megaphone, "Please wait and see! We must make the enemy pay the price of one million casualties on that island." What came to my ears from behind was the sound of military training shouting "Kill! Kill!" Many islands under blackout were covered with dark black coats. All the soldiers on the island are determined like money, fully demonstrating the spirit of killing millions of enemies before they are willing to give up. The islanders also have intense emotions of hatred for the enemy, preparing to set an example for the people of the Japanese mainland. (Excerpt from the Ryukyu Newspaper, dated 29th)

### Increase Aircraft Production, Seize Victory, Director General Endo's Remarks

Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch - Director General Endo of the Army Munitions Ministry's Aeronautical Weapons Bureau, who recently returned from inspecting the Kyushu, Shikoku, and Kansai regions, stated: "In the Kyushu area, I visited the Okinawa Air Force and met with former subordinates. The soldiers are full of morale and will not be subdued by the enemy U.S. bombing. Moreover, the opportunity to strike at the enemy has arrived. We should seize this opportunity and increase aircraft production with all our strength, establish military prowess like the special attack forces on the front line, and seize victory. The only way to do this is to increase air power. The decisive battle on Okinawa Island is the key to determining the rise and fall of the Empire. If the enemy lands on our mainland, we must have the spirit to annihilate the enemy to the death. The real battlefield is on the Pacific Ocean. It is difficult to destroy land tanks, but it is very easy to destroy tanks on ships. Even if there are thousands or tens of thousands of soldiers on board, they are useless. In short, we must destroy the enemy on the Pacific Ocean. At this moment of success, how important is the significance of the decisive battle on Okinawa! Therefore, the enhancement of air power should be urgently pursued. The dedicated special attack forces are sometimes frustrated halfway due to the shortage of aircraft, leading to the loss of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Do not miss this heaven-sent opportunity. The responsibility for destroying the enemy rests on both the soldiers on the front line and the production forces in the rear. We must never allow any slack in aircraft production. We must fight to the end to win the final victory. The increase in aircraft production and the spirit of the special attack forces should be closely linked in order to achieve victory."

### Shanghai to Launch Agricultural Loans, Governor Ren's Impressions, Hoping for Response from All Sectors of Jiangsu Province

Central News Agency, Suzhou Dispatch - In order to develop rural production and establish small factories in the inland, the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee plans to raise 500 million yuan in Shanghai to launch rural loans. Jiangsu Governor Ren Yuandao issued the following statement: "I am very interested to hear that Shanghai is launching agricultural loans. Jiangsu Province is a rice-producing area, but the countryside has been quite dilapidated recently. It is a great responsibility for all sectors of Shanghai to be concerned about this and allow Jiangsu farmers to benefit directly, so that they can supply Shanghai with large quantities of grain after the autumn harvest. It is very beneficial to the vitality of the country and society that Shanghai's idle funds and the blood and sweat of Jiangsu farmers can be used together. Moreover, it is a very farsighted idea for Shanghai factories to plan ahead and establish small factories in the inland as soon as possible. In fact, this type of agricultural loan should have been fully implemented even when the situation was very stable. Now that the government is promoting increased production, it is an even more important plan. I greatly admire the enthusiasm and vision of the people in Shanghai, and I admire even more the strong strength of the people in Shanghai for this 5 billion yuan figure. In short, Jiangsu Province and Shanghai have always been closely related. I sincerely hope that all sectors of Jiangsu Province will respond to the gentlemen in Shanghai with a spirit of full cooperation, in order to complete the great cause of our nation-building."

社评

### 咸告有钱有力者

个人是社会的构成份子，社会的盛兴，即由于各个构成份子的力量所造成，社会的本身并不能决定盛衰兴替。家庭原是社会的雏型，每个家属各尽所能，在一家之内，各不推诿偷懒，这个家庭必然是盛兴。家庭如此，社会国家莫不如此，在原则上盛衰兴替的转移是一致的。

上面这一段理论，极为平凡，早应为一般人所了解，尤其是社会知识份子与领导份子。不过，目前社会上一部人的了解，其目光只及于家庭之间，而对于社会的盛衰兴替，不是漠视，便不关心。这种心理发展的结果，社会上只见自私自利。可是，到了整个社会充满自私自利的一天，社会必然由衰替以至于崩溃，国将不国，于是在这个社会里的各个家庭，无论怎样富裕，也必然同归于尽，绝对无法独善其身的。

我们更须认清公心公益就是保障私利，如果只知取之社会，而不知用之社会，虽富可敌国，只能称之谓守财奴而已。如以聚财传之子孙，更为不智，如子孙而贤，则子孙自有能力成家立业，如子孙不贤，则父祖遗财适足为虎添翼，助长其不肖为害。对于吝于公益而唯为儿孙聚财者，应可澈悟。

所谓社会公益，有范围广狭，积极与消极之分。譬如为救济少数人的慈善事业，是狭义的消极的公益，固须出力出钱。为社会大众为国家建设，是广义的积极的公益，更须出力出钱。狭义的消极的慈善事业，出力出钱的动机，还不免由于为个人为子孙积德遗福。广义的积极的公益事业，出钱出力的动机，乃由于为人人谋幸福为国家谋生存。前者固可称道，而后者更为崇高伟大。

本市自从去年警察局成立消费合作社开始，请各业公会，股富人士及热心公益人士，垫借资金，其后劝募军警赠金，冬赈经费，及最近之临时救济库券，不久又将募集复兴农村贷款资金。凡此种种积极的公益事业，有力有钱的社会人士，都有尽力的义务；各业公会会员中，年来营业致富者比比皆是，按诸分等摊派劝募的数目，客观上均应付裕如，而一部分公会主事者，因为重视公益的同情心不够，不是要求减等，便是要求延期。更有许多为一般人所公认是第一流殷富人士，总以不出钱为荣，而转辗商量，托人关说，逃避责任。这些都是漠视社会公益的代表者。最近救济库券认购名单，问不日全部公布，出力出钱，实为社会景仰，既不出力，又不出钱者，也必为社会所共弃。

我们认为殷富人士及社会有力者，对于社会公益，不但不应躲避推诿，而应自动的竭力响应。就自己的财产中提出一小部份帮助社会公益及国家建设，又何乐不为。俗语说：「敬酒不吃吃罚酒」，「上岸要财，落水要命」，事变以前很多在敲诈绑票之下，毫无办法，一诺无辞。以此例彼，又何苦不放远目光呢？

周市长所说的：「社会先于个人，公益重于私利」，我们会数次论列申说，盼望殷富人士深思熟计；在此非常时期，若辈责任最大，义务最重，决不能逃避，而社会亦不能原谅。如盟邦日本及其他参战国家，所有财阀已将财富贡献国家社会，绝不吝啬。只有我们中国尤其上海少数有钱有力者，国家到了如此危急之时，犹犹豫于私利，不愿公益，如不急速转变风气，则覆巢之下，决无完卵，慎之慎之！

### The New President of the United States - Truman (Continued)

(Excerpted and translated by the Central News Agency from "Time" Magazine in the United States)

Because he hasn't shed the habits of a country farm boy, he gets up very early in the morning; but a few years of city life have made him afraid to face the bed at night. He married his childhood sweetheart - Bess Wallace.

Truman's lineage is a mix of Missouri, Scotch-Irish, and Dutch. He worked as a timekeeper on the railroad, a newspaper delivery boy for the Red Star, a junior clerk in a bank, and was later promoted to bookkeeper at a salary of $115 a month. Suddenly, he returned to his father's farm to work.

In 1905, Truman joined the volunteer army. During World War I, he commanded a battery of artillery in France, fighting in areas such as Meuse-Argonne, and was promoted to major. After returning home, he opened a grocery store, but lost money, incurring debts of $15,000, which he has been paying off for the past fourteen years.

Bankrupt and disappointed, Harry Truman entered the political arena. With the support of fellow veterans, and relying on the influence of the corrupt politician "Tom Pendergast," he somehow obtained the position of a court judge, and conscientiously held it for ten years.

Kansas City, under the administration of that corrupt politician Pendergast, was the most licentious and unrestrained city in the United States. Silver dollars were thrown recklessly on gambling tables in dens, wine shops remained open all night, prostitutes were everywhere, in short, it was a city of mad revelry. Pendergast was the most influential figure in this city, and was once imprisoned for bribery, but during these times of corruption, Truman remained relatively clean.

How Harry Truman managed to enter the Senate in 1934 now seems to be a famous story in American politics. Truman was unwilling to continue in the judicial position that paid less than $6,300 a year, and he gradually became restless, hoping to obtain a tax collector position that paid $25,000 a year. So he sought the help of Pendergast, but unfortunately, Pendergast had already given the tax collector position to someone else, and therefore had to reply to him, "Harry! I have already used all my strength, and I can only get you a seat in the Senate." Sure enough, thanks to Pendergast's "soul voting," Truman was elected.

During Truman's first term, he remained silent. He expressed strong support for Roosevelt's "New Deal," but strongly opposed the re-election of Prosecutor Milligan, but the Senate at that time did not trust Milligan.

In 1944, Truman competed with the Governor of Missouri - Stark - for the leadership of the Democratic Party. Truman seemed to have no hope at all, but people were opposed to Pendergast's faction, and they both failed. As a result, Milligan won, which could be considered a blessing in disguise for Truman.

World War II was the turning point in Truman's rise to prominence. In order to save government spending, he made a self-funded trip of 35,000 miles to inspect the domestic military arrangements. After returning to Washington, he said with emotion: "What is the use of designing and reorganizing after the war is over? The most important thing is to find ways to improve and reorganize now." So he suggested in the Senate to establish the "Truman Committee," specializing in pointing out the inappropriateness of the US national defense plans, the poor management of the army and navy, and the abolition of the construction of modernized amphibious landing craft, and so on.

The "Truman Committee" gave Truman a stepping stone to the position of Vice President, but he became worried instead. Newspaper reporters in the Senate praised him, saying: "Besides the President, he is the only one who is most familiar with everything about the war." In Los Angeles, Truman discussed his own position, saying: "A politician is the most capable person in the government, and after he dies, people call him a statesman."

Social Services

### Yulin Society Sponsors Charity School

A letter from Mr. Qian Gongxia, editor of the Yulin Society: "Your newspaper's establishment of a free elementary school is admirable. The members of our society are mostly in the education sector, and we firmly believe that only education can save the country. The founding of Yulin also seeks to contribute to the cultural aspect. Although the content is not without works that cater to popular tastes, we are constantly striving for improvement. This time, your esteemed newspaper is soliciting donations, and we respectfully offer 5,000 yuan to express our support. In the future, as the sales of Yulin increase, we will continue to contribute our modest efforts." Mr. Qian's commitment to education for national salvation from the cultural sector and his donation to support this newspaper's charity school are commendable.

Students of the Shanghai West Elementary School initiated a campaign to collect old textbooks to supply this newspaper's charity school. In addition to collecting 177 volumes on their own, they also donated 84 volumes on behalf of the Huaide Elementary School, totaling 257 volumes. Their sympathy for those who cannot attend school is commendable.

### Zhenjiang Native Association Expands Small Loan Amount

The Zhenjiang Native Association in Shanghai offers small loans with the purpose of helping poor and unemployed fellow villagers. The original loan amount was very small, but now the loan amount will be expanded from 10,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan. In special circumstances, an application for 30,000 yuan can also be made, but it must be limited to those who support the lives of five or more people, and the head of the household must come forward to apply. Poor fellow villagers of Zhenjiang who lack funds to make a living can apply in writing to the office at 3 Zhizhi Road, Lane 2.

### China Deaf-Mute School Appeals for Donations from All Sectors

The main campus of the China Deaf-Mute School at 59 Shunkou Road and the North District branch at 34, Lane 610, Qipu Road, were founded by the Shanghai Deaf-Mute Association and have been established for many years. The school has always been dedicated to helping deaf-mute children who are unable to attend school. The school's teaching management is strict, and its achievements are excellent, so the number of students increases every year. However, in recent years, wars have been frequent, and the social economy has continued to decline, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of impoverished students. The school has no endowment, and with soaring prices and large expenses, the income from tuition and fees is limited and difficult to maintain. It is reported that the school's previous semester, in addition to the subsidy of more than 200,000 yuan from the school board, still had a shortage of more than 60,000 yuan, and the budget for this semester is even more insufficient, reaching about 1.7 million yuan. A fundraising campaign has been launched with a target of 2 million yuan for one month. It is hoped that benevolent people in the community will generously assist so that the string music of these unfortunate children will not be interrupted. This would be a blessing not only for the school but also for society. Donations can be made at the social service departments of the Xin and Zhong newspapers, Tongrun Money Shop on Tianjin Road, Quancheng Bank on Jiangxi Road, and Jinyuan Money Shop on Henan Road.
