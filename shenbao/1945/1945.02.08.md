### Japanese Main Force Units on Standby, Adopting Encirclement Tactics: Fierce Fighting Intensifies Across Luzon Island

Luzon Front, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Battles are intensifying daily across Luzon Island. Japanese forces in the central plains of Luzon are currently engaged in fierce fighting with enemy units advancing southward. Bayonet combat continues in the Clark Field area, preventing the enemy's advance. Near Shirousagi Bridge, eight kilometers north of Maromelet in northern Manila, Japanese forces ambushed two battalions of the advancing enemy, destroying over twenty military trucks and killing approximately one hundred enemy soldiers. Fierce fighting continues. In the Moni area, an enemy division launched an offensive on the 3rd under heavy artillery cover but was repelled by Japanese forces. In the northeast, near San Jose, two companies of enemy artillery, two companies of fifteen anti-aircraft guns, one company of ten anti-aircraft guns, one mortar company, twenty tanks, and one infantry regiment were all repelled by Japanese commando units. Additionally, in the Puto Gang Monides area, between the 1st and 3rd, the enemy suffered nine hundred casualties. Simultaneously, Japanese forces destroyed eight tanks, twenty-eight trucks, ten prime movers, eight self-propelled guns, eight mortars, and five rapid-fire guns. Furthermore, they captured five heavy machine guns, twenty-two automatic rifles, and two wireless radios. In the southern Manila area, enemy forces attempted to advance eastward from Nasugbu, but were stopped fifteen kilometers east of the town. Japanese main force units are currently suppressing the enemy's rear and flanks, awaiting an opportunity to encircle them. The enemy is significantly reinforcing their positions, making the situation on the Philippine Islands increasingly complex.

Philippine Front, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – On the 3rd, enemy forces on Luzon Island infiltrated the northern part of Manila City with tanks and armored vehicles. Simultaneously, airborne troops landed at Karookan Airport, north of the city, engaging in fierce combat with Japanese forces stationed near Santo Tomas University and Far Eastern University. Near Santo Tomas University, enemy forces on the north bank of the Sizuku River heavily shelled Japanese positions on the south bank, with flames reaching the sky.

A Certain Japanese Base on the Philippine Front, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Enemy forces in the Clark Field area continued to shell Japanese positions on the 6th and were constructing positions in front of the Japanese lines. Currently, Japanese forces are conducting nightly raids. As of the 6th, they had shot down twenty-two enemy aircraft, destroyed seven tanks and over ten other vehicles, captured numerous machine guns and mortars, and killed many enemy soldiers.

Japanese Night Raids Yield Results

A Certain Japanese Base on the Luzon Front, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Eager to retake Manila, the enemy has formed its offensive line into a semicircle, launching repeated attacks on the periphery of Manila regardless of cost. Part of their forces has infiltrated the city. Enemy forces at the northern entrance to Nasugbu have begun a general offensive against Japanese positions near Ayaka. Japanese forces, defending steep mountainous terrain, are preventing their advance. To break this stalemate, the enemy landed paratroopers near Ayaka and Tagaytay to reinforce their rear. However, they suffered heavy losses in a surprise attack by Japanese forces in the area. In the northern Bataan Peninsula, enemy forces encountered a Japanese counterattack at the eastern entrance to Subic and are currently stalled. The main force of enemy troops advancing southward from San Fernando infiltrated the Marololos area, attempting to cross the Banbanga River. They launched fierce attacks against Japanese forces defending the river line, but were repeatedly repelled, and fierce fighting continues. In Santa Maria, east of Marololos, some enemy armored units infiltrated from the north. Japanese forces immediately engaged in fierce close combat, killing over one hundred and fifty enemy soldiers and destroying over thirty tanks and armored vehicles. The assault continues. On the night of the 4th, over one hundred enemy cargo trucks, fully loaded with soldiers, were moving near Santa Maria when they were subjected to heavy shelling by Japanese artillery units, which repelled them. Enemy forces, desperately attempting to invade Manila with some forces of the American-Philippine military, infiltrated Manila City on the dark night of the 3rd. Japanese garrison troops bravely intercepted them, inflicting annihilating blows. At the same time, the enemy incited guerrilla units to infiltrate near Manila, starting fires everywhere and using bombs to destroy key bridges spanning the Shigge River in the heart of the city. On the 4th, fires broke out in various parts of the city, threatening to sacrifice the entire city of Manila to the cruelty and barbarity of the American forces. As a result, the citizens of the Philippines are extremely indignant. Meanwhile, enemy forces advancing eastward from the Luzon Plain to invade Monides, after intense shelling with considerable artillery and infantry forces, began pressing their infantry attack. However, Japanese forces, defending unfavorable flat terrain, fought fiercely, repeatedly repelling the invading enemy. While enduring enemy shelling, they quickly shifted from defense to offense at night. From the 2nd to the 3rd, their gains included the destruction of six M4 tanks, one armored vehicle, two artillery pieces, two mortars, the shooting down of one fighter plane, and the killing or wounding of over five hundred personnel. At the Dammol Dies base on the north side of the enemy bridgehead in Lingayen Gulf, the enemy continues to strengthen their defensive positions. Naval gun fire from within Lingayen Gulf continues. The enemy has not advanced, and the front line has seen little change in the past week.

### Status of Japanese Troops on Various Pacific Islands

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The United Press International frontline correspondent from the Omiya Island base reported on the 5th the following status of Japanese troops on various islands in the Pacific, both at the front and in the rear, in previous battles: The remaining Japanese units on various Pacific islands are well-armed and well-fed. According to reconnaissance reports, Japanese soldiers appear healthy and are using secretly imported excellent equipment. Their food and vegetables are self-sufficiently produced.

### High Morale Among Japanese Troops in Rabaul

Southwest Pacific Base, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – In the Rabaul area, there were 411 enemy aircraft raids in January. In the Albu Bay and Outer Albu Bay areas, 22 enemy aircraft raided on the 1st. Enemy aircraft are slightly more active in this area. Australia has recently been frequently coordinating with operations in the Southeast, suggesting a planned attack on Rabaul. Japanese air reconnaissance of the north and south coasts of New Britain Island found no enemy ships entering or leaving, and no signs of airfield use. The enemy's alleged new offensive in the Southeast is nothing more than propaganda. In any case, regardless of the enemy's plans, the morale of Japanese units in the Rabaul area is increasing, and the enemy's offensive will surely be crushed.

### Promoting Production Awareness, Strengthening Transportation Capacity: Contents of Japan's New Economic Policy Towards China

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – China's economy is of major importance to Japan's war effort. Japan has provided various forms of assistance to ensure China's economic stability. Shigemitsu, Minister of Greater East Asia, declared at the opening of this parliamentary session in the House of Representatives that Japan has proposed a new economic policy towards China to address the urgent need to improve the Chinese economy and is strongly promoting its implementation. In addition, questions have been raised by members of both houses of parliament, and the full picture of Japan's new economic policy has gradually become clear. The main points of its specific measures are as follows: (1) Establish a comprehensive guidance organization to implement the new policy locally. This new organization will be divided into the following two stages: A. The supreme guidance organization, composed of the ambassador to China, the commander-in-chief of the general army, and the commander of the fleet. This organization has the power to decide on the promotion of the new measures. B. Establish local promotion organizations, currently located at the embassy offices in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, serving as the centers for North China, Central China, South China, and Mengjiang (Zhangjiakou), respectively. These new organizations will be composed of the office director, minister, and representatives of the army and navy. (2) Unify material procurement plans. The procurement of materials will be carried out under a unified plan to improve coordination efficiency and avoid duplicate purchases. (3) Strengthen local transportation capacity. In addition to strengthening the transportation capacity of the North China and Central China railways, establish a procurement plan for inclusive transportation capacity to coordinate land and sea transportation capacity between Japan and the local area, in order to avoid material stagnation. (4) Maintain and cultivate the Chinese economy. Promote production awareness and improvement efforts in China to increase the production of food, daily necessities, coal, etc., and strive to restore local light industry. In addition, mobilize sailing ships, etc., to strengthen transportation capacity. (5) Support the existing currency system. The economic situation of Chinese currency appears to be somewhat inflated on the surface, but the Federal Reserve Bank of China notes and reserve certificates will be consistently supported. At the same time, adjustments to currency issuance, the recovery of remittances, and the adjustment of local funds are gradually being implemented. (6) Revitalize the economic activities of Japanese people in the local area. Urge the North China Development Company, the Central China Promotion Company, and various Japanese trading companies to recognize the fundamental spirit of the new policy in order to operate their businesses in a spirit of good neighborliness. Regarding the above new economic policy, a full agreement was reached at the meeting of the directors of the embassy offices in China in mid-December of last year, and was subsequently decided by the cabinet.

Editorial

### Reaffirming Public Interest Over Private Gain

Yesterday, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association convened leaders of various trade associations to jointly discuss raising funds for winter relief and donations to the military and police, resulting in a successful outcome (news reported on page 3 of today's newspaper). Observing the proceedings of this meeting, we have the following reflections:

First, the purpose of this meeting was entirely for the public good of Shanghai society, in response to Mayor Zhou's expectation that Shanghai citizens prioritize "public interest over private gain, society before the individual." In yesterday's editorial, we stated: "In the past, everyone unanimously condemned the extortionate behavior of the police. This behavior has now been eliminated as a result of the authorities' efforts to rectify discipline and improve treatment. From the perspective of us citizens, we should also show support for the government and encouragement for the military and police. Whether this suggestion can be realized can be seen as a litmus test for whether members of society can shift their character and prioritize public interest over private gain." According to the results of yesterday's meeting of the Citizens' Welfare Association, the enthusiasm shown by leaders from all sectors of society and the emphasis on public interest are cause for great rejoicing.

Second, the focus of the meeting was on how to allocate donations and how to provide advance loans. Leaders of various industries were able to enthusiastically pledge donations and advance loans. In particular, Mr. Zhan Peilin individually pledged one million yuan, Mr. Xu Guanqun individually pledged one million yuan in advance loans, and Mr. Zhang Baocun pledged one million yuan on behalf of his industry. We believe that wealthy businessmen with ample resources, such as Messrs. Zhan and Xu, are by no means few in the Shanghai area. We hope that they will spontaneously rise up with enthusiasm to prioritize public interest over private gain.

Third, the banking industry is the mainstay of the financial world. Although the banking business has not been as prosperous and profitable as the rising industries in recent years, the leaders of the banking industry are all people of status and prestige in society, so they rightly retain their leading position. In particular, the China and Transportation Banks have always been prudent and stable in their business operations. In fact, in the current economic society, if the sole purpose is to make money, it is relatively difficult to adapt to the environment, and several long-established banks are known as the hidden poor in the banking industry. However, for the sake of public interest, Mr. Tang Shoumin was particularly enthusiastic in undertaking a large amount of advance lending, which is also commendable.

Fourth, of the 130-plus industry association leaders invited, only 30-plus attended, accounting for only one-quarter. The fact that the majority of industry association leaders avoided attending is regrettable. Although some explained their reasons for being unable to attend, there were still some who neither delegated representatives nor explained their reasons for non-attendance, which is frankly a wait-and-see attitude. Strictly speaking, these people are selfish and unable to achieve "public interest over private gain, society before the individual." However, although they avoid attending, they cannot shirk the responsibilities that society imposes on them. Now that the allocation units have been decided, they can no longer maintain a wait-and-see attitude. From the standpoint of the media, we are willing to offer a warning and hope that they will quickly take on their responsibilities and not be regarded with contempt by society.

Fifth, the industry associations invited by the Welfare Association do not include all industries and businesses in the city. Many associations were omitted and therefore do not have a donation responsibility. However, we hope that all industry associations that have not been assigned will voluntarily make donations and jointly shoulder their due responsibilities, and not assume that they are exempt from responsibility simply because they have not been assigned. Only with a spirit of "public interest first" can the preservation of "private gain" be stabilized.

In short, we believe that the purpose and successful outcome of this gathering is a rare and significant event with far-reaching implications. It also proves that the spirit of "public interest over private gain, society before the individual" can still be revived among leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai. However, we in the media will unanimously urge and then sanction the few remaining wait-and-see elements in order to create the good atmosphere that Mayor Zhou expects of us.

### Japanese Decision on Decisive Battle Production Establishment Guidelines Approved

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japan's financial circles, recognizing the importance of various situations under the current state of affairs for overcoming the crisis, firmly believe that the original plans alone cannot solve the current difficulties. Since last winter, the results of discussions at the Important Industry Council and other gatherings have led to the final adoption of the Decisive Battle Production Establishment Guidelines at the Important Coordination Council on the 5th of this month. In addition, Ryozou, Eizō Nagasaki, and Saburō Chiba, three councilors of the Comprehensive Planning Bureau who came from financial circles, also conducted separate reviews on this matter, and their ideals are similar. Recently, the financial circles have also submitted opinions to the government and the army and navy authorities. In any case, the issue will unfold soon, and what the financial circles expect is a clear calculation of the minimum military demand targets for defense centering on the Philippines and the Japanese mainland. To achieve this goal, in the important industrial sectors of steel, iron, coal, oil, metals, aircraft, shipbuilding, and liquid fuels, establish powerful, unified operating organizations that can accommodate existing control associations and industrial associations. The government will grant these operating organizations the necessary powers for industrial operations, and local administrative authorities will be in a supervisory position. This will not only correct the unification of production rights, but also make it easier to complete emergency production.

### Japanese House of Peers and House of Representatives Temporarily Adjourn

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since the reopening of the Japanese parliament, deliberations have continued for days, and the deliberations in both houses are proceeding according to schedule. The House of Representatives will temporarily adjourn from the 8th, and the House of Peers from the 12th, in a state of readiness to respond to any eventuality.

### Japanese Hidesuke Yamamoto and Others Jointly Propose Strong Measures

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese Hidesuke Yamamoto, Tokutomi Sohō, Katsuo Yoshihisa, Matsunaga Hisao, Minagawa Haruhiro, Kurosawa Saizō, Shiōten Nobutaka, Kobayashi Junichi, Yokoo Sōzaburō and others believe that the way for Japan to overcome crises since its opening has been to dedicate the total strength of Japan's one hundred million people to war, and to unite the power of the government and the people to make strong policies with quick decisions, quick executions, and quick actions. On the 6th, they submitted to Prime Minister Koiso a ten-point concrete plan and a proposal for the urgent implementation of national policy, the gist of which is as follows: (1) The reason for all victory lies in quick decision and action. (2) The determination to fight to the death of the entire population of one hundred million should be thorough. (3) Wooden aircraft production should be urgently increased. (4) Important factories should be managed by the state, and labor management should be reformed radically at the same time. (5) Important military factories should be evacuated rapidly and thoroughly. (6) Thorough mobilization should be carried out immediately. (7) Middle school instruction should be suspended in principle, and education should be thoroughly implemented specifically for the cultivation of talent. (The rest omitted)

### Chongqing Confirms Loss of Nanxiong

Japanese Troops Have Advanced to Nan'an

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Reuters correspondent in Chongqing has acknowledged that Japanese troops, aiming to reduce the Ganjiang air base cluster, captured Nanxiong after the capture of Suichuan. His report on the 6th is as follows: Japanese troops occupied Nanxiong in Guangdong Province on the 3rd, so Chongqing lost another air base east of the Yuehan Railway.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Headquarters issued a battle report on the 16th stating that Japanese troops advancing eastward from Shaoguan, an important point on the Yuehan Railway, have now advanced to Nan'an (Dayu), an important silver mining area 95 kilometers northeast of the city, and are about to occupy the area.

### US Report Reveals Low Chongqing Production

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – It is reported here that the military, political, and economic departments under the Chongqing regime are all in a state of chaos, and the United States' hopes for Chongqing are also encountering various obstacles. The "Official Report on Chongqing" recently published by the US War Information Bureau in newspapers across the United States hints at the true situation described above, from which it can be seen that the United States is attempting to invade Chongqing. The main points of the report are as follows: After seven years of China's resistance war, 80% of its industry and railways have been lost. All roads except highways have been blocked, so imports have also been interrupted. According to Nelson's proposal, although countermeasures were discussed between Chongqing and the United States, the first things to be implemented must be an increase in imports by the United States, improvement of hinterland transportation organs, dispatch of American and American-trained technicians and workers to engage in industrial and transportation sector projects, and establishment of raw material and military production control bureaus and other institutions. Regarding transportation, due to a lack of trucks, reliance will have to be placed on large numbers of laborers and freight wagons in the future. 70% of the goods transported to Kunming are delayed for months due to the lack of complete local transportation facilities. At the second and third sessions of the People's Political Council, the CCP expressed dissenting opinions. Regarding other issues in Chongqing, such as the military warlords in various places not cooperating with Chongqing in the resistance war, this is a powerful obstacle to the united front in Chongqing. Aid to Chongqing based on the Lend-Lease Act has also had to be restricted due to the complicated situation in the hinterland of Chongqing, and the inconvenience of domestic transportation has further aggravated the difficulty. Chongqing has claimed to have completed more than 900 miles of highways last year, but they have been destroyed by Japanese military operations. The following three points were also pointed out regarding China's economic power: (1) Industrial zones, transportation organizations, and natural resources have all fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. (2) The blockade of the coast restricts the entry of military supplies. (3) The government's economic control power is quite weak, and inflation in the hinterland is a major obstacle to production institutions. Nelson warned in his statement to the previous Political Council that Chongqing cannot win the production war and that the current situation in Chongqing is bound to darken, and that the people's production efforts are the key to Chongqing's victory or defeat.

### Japanese Air Force Threatens Transportation in India, Myanmar, and Yunnan

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – After the opening of the Stilwell Road and the old Burma Road, a convoy of trucks loaded with military supplies from India arrived in the suburbs of Kunming on the 3rd via Myitkyina and entered the city the next day. According to a telegram from the United Press International correspondent in Kunming on the 4th, the convoy faced extreme difficulties due to attacks by Japanese air force units en route. The first motorcade from India's railway, passing through the Stilwell Road, and arriving in Kunming in China, was threatened by the Japanese air force twice en route.

### Wuhu Chamber of Commerce Donates Funds to Comfort the Military and Police

Wuhu, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce has voluntarily donated one million yuan to comfort the stationed military and police. The funds were submitted to the Qingxiang Special Office yesterday for distribution.

### Capital Price Stabilization Committee Arrests Extortionist: Mastermind Executed by Firing Squad

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since commencing operations, the Capital Material Price Stabilization Committee's inspection team has uncovered numerous cases of disrupting the supply and demand of materials. Recently, it arrested six criminals who extorted property from the people: Hong Zongyan, Xue Yuanlong, Zheng Guangcai, Huang Shiyu, Chen Jinfa, and Li Jifa. Hong served as a second lieutenant platoon leader in the communications team of the Second Garrison Division, and the remaining criminals were soldiers in the same team, stationed at Shuangzha, where they frequently intercepted cargo carriers and extorted money. The military law team of the committee easily conducted a military court trial of the case and decided to sentence Hong Zongyan to death, and Xue and Zheng to ten years of imprisonment, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The remaining criminals were acquitted. As for the Hong criminal, he was escorted by the Capital Garrison Headquarters to Yuhua Terrace outside Zhonghua Gate at 3 PM on the 7th, where his identity was verified and he was executed by firing squad.

### Manchurian Ambassador Lee Pays Respects to Lu Chih-ching Yesterday

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Lee Shao-keng, the newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Manchukuo to China, accompanied by Minister Miura and twelve other counselors, secretaries, and officers, visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 7th to pay respects and offer flowers at the tomb of the Father of the Nation.

### Soviet Troops Cross the Oder River; Fighting Reaches a Climax; Fierce Street Battles Unfold in Poznan

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Soviet troops on the Eastern Front continue their strong offensive, but German resistance is also extremely fierce, and the battle has reached its climax. Soviet forces, with a large army concentrated on the Oder and Silesia, launched an advance, crossing the Oder River on the 5th and reportedly securing two bridgeheads at Fürstenberg and 15 kilometers south of Frankfurt. There are no major changes in the situation at Lauban and Glogau. Large-scale mobile warfare is currently unfolding in the areas of Brieg and Steinau. On the one hand, Soviet forces successfully penetrated the center of Poznan on the 5th, and fierce street battles are continuing. The Soviet offensive south of Pomerania and west of Bromberg has yielded no results.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports: A military spokesman stated that after the Soviet offensive on the Oder River line on the Eastern Front tended to stall, the fighting mostly involved establishing or destroying bridgeheads. Many Soviet bridgeheads on the west bank of the Oder River have been forcibly reduced by German forces, but some have also expanded compared to before, such as the bridgehead southeast of Brieg, which has slightly extended to the northwest. The battles for Küstrin and Frankfurt have not diminished in their severity, especially the two major Soviet bridgeheads near Fürstenberg, south of Frankfurt, which are quite threatening. However, the German counter-offensive is gradually taking effect, and a small bridgehead south of Küstrin has been cleared by us.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports: Lieutenant General Dittmar stated in a broadcast yesterday: The Oder River has now become a river upon which Germany's fate depends. The Soviet vanguard gradually stalled after reaching the Oder River, but fierce battles will resume after the main force arrives. The main force of the Soviet vanguard still aims at Frankfurt and Küstrin, that is, at Berlin. The offensive in the Pomeranian area, although wide, has its focal point at the mouth of the Oder River, aiming to cut off the land connection between the German interior and West Prussia. The trend of the Soviet offensive in that area is a very important event. The enemy is now actively reinforcing in preparation for launching a new offensive. The German authorities should take countermeasures in all respects and avoid being hasty, lest the enemy find weaknesses.

### International Trade Union Congress Opens in London

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency reports, London news: One of the most important and meaningful events, the World Trade Union Conference, opened in London yesterday, attended by approximately 240 delegates representing 50 million workers. British Trade Union Chairman Isaacs was elected chairman of one of the three meetings. He stated that efforts should now be focused on rebuilding a large-scale trade union movement, and that unless trade unions can find a constructive policy, the future of humanity is very bleak.

### Makers of War Not Fit to Lavishly Speak of Peace; German Commentary on the Three-Nation Conference

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports: Dr. Tietley, Director of the German Information Bureau, received foreign journalists yesterday and commented on the Three-Nation Conference held near the Black Sea, denying that the anti-Axis countries are qualified to bestow peace upon the world. He stated that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, who claim to be the moral leaders of the world, have two major goals in this conference: to induce the German people to surrender, and to issue a promise to lay the foundation for peace for mankind. In the past few years, attempts to persuade the Germans to surrender have failed, so they are pursuing a policy of self-destruction, which will also fail this time. Regarding the anti-Axis countries' promise to organize global peace, Dr. Dittmar said that it is doubtful whether the three have the right to bestow peace upon the world.

### Moving Ideals Conceal the Medium of War

Regarding international societies, collective security, and world organizations, these are merely beautiful ideals, moving goals, and promises for the future. However, they conceal the medium of war and offer no guarantee of peace. The theory of indivisible peace was the fuse of World War II; the same danger still exists today, and on a larger scale. Today, the representatives of capitalism and Bolshevism at the Three-Nation Conference cannot be regarded as champions of lasting peace, because they harbor the seeds of war and are often centers of brewing war. The goal pursued by the conference delegates today is not world peace but perpetual war. In 1939, they spoke of an indivisible peace, and what resulted was total war.

### Ambition Unextinguished, Peace Ultimately Difficult to Expect

If they truly desire peace, then Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin should recognize their responsibility to all of humanity and eliminate the elements of war in the international community in order to achieve world peace. Only when the United States abandons its war-provoking economic imperialism can "peace on earth" be achieved. Only when Britain returns freedom and sovereignty to the oppressed nations, large and small, such as India and the Arab peoples, can world peace be achieved. Lasting peace is possible only when capitalism and Bolshevik slavery are eliminated. World peace is possible only after the financial groups and economic special classes are eliminated, and the status of workers and the nation is elevated at the same time. The Bolsheviks, whose destructive terrorist acts against the nation and ambition to conquer the world have not been extinguished, render peace treaties disappointing. Until the world hears such a peace declaration, the world will be betrayed by peace.

### New German Submarine Equipment

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports: London's "Daily Telegraph" reports: After technically improving German submarines, they have now resumed their powerful offensive activities. German submarines are now equipped with new equipment that allows the engines to continue running after submerging and to remain submerged for a long period within the fuel limit, so their combat power is quite noteworthy.

### Germany Manufactures Super Meteorite Bombs to Attack the American Mainland

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The German authorities, in view of the urgency of the war situation, have strictly ordered the military and civilians to defend the capital to the death and resist to the end. At the same time, they are intensifying the retaliatory attacks with more advanced weapons. Previously, neutral parties reported the launch of the V3. Now, the British Daily Express reported on January 26 on the details of the V4 under preparation, stating that the German army is planning to directly attack New York with the new weapon, the Super Meteorite Bomb V4, which has entered the production stage. According to a German technician of the V-weapon, preparations for attacking the west coast of the Atlantic have been completed. The technician recently stated when visiting Sweden that the speed of the V4 is greater than that of the V3, weighing about fifteen tons, with a speed of twenty-nine kilometers per second, reaching an altitude of over 190 kilometers. However, due to the recent urgency, it cannot be mass-produced. As for attacking New York, there are considerable limitations. The reason Germany does not use the V4 against Europe is that, at the final juncture, it will begin attacking American cities with it.

### Hays Succeeds as British Military Attaché in Chongqing

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency reports, Chongqing news: Major General Grimstead, the military attaché of the British Embassy in Chongqing and commander of the British Military Mission in Chongqing, will soon leave office and return to Britain. His successor will be Major General Hays, who arrived in Chongqing a few days ago.

### Greece Reopens Peace Talks

Geneva, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to the German News Agency, Athens news: Peace talks between the Greek government and the left-wing party broke down due to the left's demand for amnesty. They have now resumed on Tuesday. Greek Foreign Minister Sophianopoulos stated before leaving the meeting that he believes the negotiations will end in the next few days.

### Struggle for Key Western Front Fortresses Enters Decisive Phase

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The US First Army on the Western Front continues to overcome fierce German resistance, repeatedly attacking with elite troops, and on the 6th, it entered an area one kilometer east of Schaumern, Heyden, and Kempen. The Siegfried Line has entered the decisive phase of fortress warfare.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports, A German military spokesman stated yesterday: Although the fighting at Higny-en-l'Haye in the Upper Alsace region on the Western Front is becoming increasingly fierce, the overall offensive of the anti-Axis forces cannot yet be said to have been launched. The current actions of the enemy are merely to gain favorable starting points for the general offensive. However, the date of the general offensive is not expected to be far off, as Eisenhower's goal is to echo the Soviet offensive.

### Enemy American Military Production; Aircraft, Gun, and Tank Production Indices Plummet; Americans Deceived by False Propaganda and Public Sentiment War-Weary

Due to the many internal contradictions, the U.S. War Production Board had previously changed military production again. Therefore, some civilian production factories that had been banned from production since the start of the war were reopened and allowed to produce daily necessities. However, in early December 1944, all 103 major military production zones in the United States announced that military industries would not be allowed to change industries in the next three months. At the same time, they further announced that all civilian production would be suspended indefinitely. This was still not enough, so on December 17, an emergency decree was issued to temporarily exempt skilled workers serving in the military from military service and send them to military factories to engage in production. The U.S. authorities have boasted loudly: "The U.S. decisive battle system is the main factor guaranteeing the victory of the Allied powers." Since this is the case, why are they so flustered? It is truly puzzling. If we carefully observe the recent development process of U.S. productivity and the changes in the beliefs of the American people due to the changes in the world war situation, we can understand it clearly. Everyone knows that the U.S. has been actively expanding military production since the Pearl Harbor incident, and its speed of military production has risen sharply, reaching the highest level at the end of 1943. (According to the U.S. Preparedness Bureau's publication, taking 1935-1939 as the standard)

Combined Production Index, Military Production Index, Civilian Production Index

1941: 162, 32, 131
1942: 189, 107, 92
1943: 239, 195, 84

### False Propaganda
Since the U.S. military production, the source of the anti-Axis countries' war power, has been making such rapid progress, coupled with the rebellion in Italy following the North African operation in 1943, the American people were intoxicated by the dream of victory under the embellished propaganda of the U.S. authorities. In other words, smooth production and improved war situation led to the obvious conclusion that the war could be ended in a short period of time, which had almost become a common saying among ordinary Americans. By 1944, this optimistic sentiment had become an unshakable prejudice, due to the landing of the Allied forces in northern France in early June and the outbreak of the assassination attempt on President Hitler on July 20, which were unfavorable to the Axis powers. At the same time, Roosevelt's order to allow military factories to change industries in mid-August for the election and the successive convening of various international postwar United Nations conferences were like injecting too many drugs into the people, which not only did not take effect but also made them feel insensitive. The people's optimistic attitude towards the future of the war was constantly being incited. Therefore, the general public no longer worried about the future of the war but focused on postwar security. This is naturally excusable under the U.S. propaganda policy.

### Sudden Drop in Labor

Therefore, in order to avoid the risk of unemployment during the period of industry change, military industry workers continued to transfer to various civilian industries. In mid-1943, this transfer reached its peak. The number of workers in the military industry and working hours decreased sharply in 1944. The number of workers employed in March had returned to the level of February 1942, and the working hours had also fallen to the level of November 1942. Since March, the production index has been declining. This shortage of labor in the military industry and the general industrial field caused U.S. industrial productivity to immediately reverse and turn backward after creating the highest record since the start of the war in November 1943. The summer and autumn of 1944 were the lowest production periods since March 1943. Looking at the numbers of aircraft production (published by the War Production Board), it has gradually declined since reaching its peak in 1943.

January 1943: 1,000
March 1943: 6,000
June 1943: 7,000
September 1943: 7,598
December 1943: 8,802
January 1944: 8,789
August 1944: 7,939
October 1944: (missing)
November 1944: 6,747

The reduction in the number of aircraft produced may be due to the shift in focus to the production of heavy bombers such as the B-29 and B-32, but this is not entirely the case. Please see the production weight, which can also prove this point.

(In 10,000 pounds)

May 1944: 8,980
August 1944: 7,970
September 1944: 7,890

In addition, although the indices of ship production and various ammunition production have soared and increased compared to the production of 1943, the results of guns, tanks, and automobiles in the summer of 1944 were reduced to 80% of those in 1943.

According to the statement of War Mobilization Bureau Chief Payne, the most lacking items in the United States are heavy bombers, heavy weapons and their ammunition, large heavy-duty vehicles, attack transport ships, and landing craft. Among them, the production volume of heavy weapon ammunition necessary for the production of 1944 must be increased to one and a half times that of October in November and December.

### Contrary to Expectations

The U.S. overseas dispatch force has increased to 60,000 for both the army and the navy, and it is estimated that it will reach 7.5 million by the end of 1944. According to the U.S. Army and Navy authorities, the replenishment required by this group of soldiers is one ton per month for a soldier in Europe and eight tons per month for a soldier in the Pacific. From this, we can know how huge the transportation capacity and materials are needed.

Looking at the current East and West battlefields in the United States, Roosevelt is being forced by the optimistic sentiment of the people he has stirred up—in other words, the war-weariness caused by the relaxation of morale—and is deeply concerned about the division within the Allied camp. Therefore, Roosevelt has to try to end the war as soon as possible, which led to the launch of some reluctant wars since the summer of 1944. However, the result was the opposite. Neither the Pacific War nor the European War allows for optimism, and the difficult facts have clearly explained everything.

Therefore, the United States in 1944 is different from the end of 1943. Although the war is not known how long it will continue, the people have already jumped out of the war and are dreaming of postwar enjoyment. From this point of view, the U.S. war can no longer rely on the people's morale of hatred for the enemy. However, the only reliable large amount of materials is now in a desperate situation. Seeing that Roosevelt and other war leaders have been clamoring to increase production and expand savings every day recently, this is proof of the shortage of weapons and ammunition production in the United States.

### Encouraging the Spirit of Service: Fundraising for Military and Police Bonuses - Civil Welfare Association and Various Guilds Reach a Successful Resolution

At the end of last year, the Shanghai Civil Welfare Association, recognizing the urgent need for winter relief, planned to raise 50 million yuan to purchase and distribute relief grain. However, due to time constraints during the fundraising, it was decided to borrow 50 million yuan from the Central Reserve Bank. Simultaneously, the municipal government also established a Winter Relief Committee. The Welfare Association entrusted the winter relief work it had planned to the Municipal Government Winter Relief Committee for unified management and promptly allocated the borrowed 50 million yuan to the Winter Relief Committee. The loan was to be repaid in three installments, with the first installment of 15 million yuan soon due.

Concurrently, the Welfare Association, recognizing the positive impact of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo's efforts to rectify police conduct since taking office, believed that citizens should express their gratitude. Furthermore, to maintain the city's security, the responsibilities of the military and police would inevitably increase in the future. Therefore, coinciding with the end of the lunar year, it planned to raise funds as bonuses for the military and police to encourage them. The association specially convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Kangrong Restaurant, inviting leading figures from various industrial and commercial guilds in the city to discuss fundraising methods.

### Reader's Scholarship News

Responding Quickly to the March 1st Movement

This time, the Xin Shen Er Bao and the Girls' Christian Association initiated the "Charity Bazaar," with the proceeds used to assist children who have dropped out of school. The "Charity Bazaar" will open at the Eight Immortals Bridge Christian Association on the 3rd and 4th days of the lunar calendar. The students from various schools who are participating are actively promoting it for the preparation of the Charity Bazaar. Everywhere you can see students running around in groups of three or five. They are unusually excited and full of energy, making it hard to believe.

Recently, there has been the launch of the "111" Movement. Not only should the student community be enthusiastic about this initiative, but all compatriots can also enthusiastically help. Therefore, there is the One Person, One Item, One Thousand Yuan Movement. Although it is only one person, one item, and one thousand yuan, if many people participate, small contributions will add up, giving everyone the opportunity to do their part. Furthermore, it can demonstrate the spirit of unity and can complete the grand undertaking of holding this Charity Bazaar. Today, we have already received so many goods donated by enthusiastic comrades in response to the "111" Movement. It is hoped that those who have not participated will also quickly respond. May the "111" Movement be a complete success!

Acting as an Agent for Fundraising, Enthusiastic About Helping Students - Mr. Wang Yang of the Dahua Silk Industry Company wrote: "Respectfully, your newspaper is enthusiastic about helping students and spares no effort, which is admirable. Having been entrusted to participate in donating, I dare not but contribute a little, and I respectfully act as an agent to raise a team's worth, totaling 20,000 yuan, and I personally subscribe for a team's worth, totaling 20,000 yuan, with two checks enclosed. However, these small sums are merely a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem, but they are just a small expression of my sincere intentions."

Various Schools Establish Free Tuition Quotas

(1) The Far East Industrial School offers courses in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, and General Studies. In response to the Xin Shen Er Bao's call to rescue youths who have dropped out of school, it has specially established 40 free tuition quotas for each department and 30 free tuition quotas for the attached middle school. The school is run by the president of a well-known university's School of Science and Engineering in this city and is based on the principle of strict teaching. The current tuition and fees are set at 6,000 yuan for the attached middle school and 8,000 yuan for the specialized courses. Those wishing to enter the school can register at No. 183 Nanyang Road (near Xiaoshadu Road).

(2) The Private Peiben Middle School is run by alumni of Daxia University and Datong University. Its aim is to rescue those who have dropped out of school, so tuition fees are waived, and only miscellaneous fees of 800 yuan are charged. Those with financial difficulties can still apply for exemption. In response to the Shen Bao's scholarship program, each grade can guarantee the admission of ten students. Registration for new students in all grades of junior high school and elementary school starts immediately. Class time is from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day, and from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM on Saturdays and Sundays. The examination date is February 15th. The school is located inside the Shangqing Elementary School at the intersection of Qingdao Road and Xinchang Road. All students from poor families can register for the exam.

### First Batch of Low-Priced Rice Sold: Over 33,000 Yuan per Stone - Business and Industry Purchase 18,000 Stones, Private Schools Purchase 10,000 Stones

The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce recently undertook the Municipal Government's distribution of low-priced white rice to the city's business and industrial sectors. This rice will be transported to Shanghai in four phases. In the first phase, the business and industrial sectors will purchase 18,000 stones. The Chamber of Commerce has agreed upon the following measures:

(1) The price for the first phase is 33,750 yuan per stone. (2) Each industry guild can purchase 75 stones of white rice. If it is a factory industry guild, it can purchase 150 stones of white rice, with the principle of transferring it to poor workers in shops and factories. (3) Industry guilds that decide to purchase must collect the rice purchase certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce before 12:00 noon on the 8th of this month. Overdue applications will be considered as voluntary abandonment. (4) The rice payment must be made before the morning of February 10th, presenting the purchase certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce directly to the Fuxing Bank on Hankou Road. (5) This batch of rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 15th of this month. The industry guilds will pick up the goods from the warehouse themselves at that time upon presentation of the certificate. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce will issue a separate notice once the date is confirmed. (6) Rice bags (gunny sacks) must be returned to the original warehouse in their original state within five days after receiving the rice. (7) Due to the urgency of time, the member of each industry guild did not have time to notify their member, member of the industry guilds who have not been notified should directly contact the respective industry guilds for registration. (8) For any unclear matters regarding these measures, you can inquire in person at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

Low-Priced Rice Sold to Private Schools

Regarding the distribution of low-priced rice to private schools in the city, the Municipal Government has allocated 10,000 stones of rice to be distributed to private educational institutions in the city. The Municipal Consultative Committee has recently notified the various schools. This rice will be delivered in four batches, with the first and second batches accounting for 3,000 stones each, and the third and fourth batches accounting for 2,000 stones each. The price of the first batch of rice is set at 33,750 yuan per stone. The rice is produced in Suzhou. In addition to the allocation to faculty and staff, if there is a surplus, the council will deliberate and decide whether to use it for students' meals. Private schools in the city that have been operating for more than three years and wish to purchase low-priced rice can obtain application forms from St. John's University, Chongde Girls' School, Nanyang Middle School, Jinde Girls' School, and Aiguo Girls' School in this city. The applications must be submitted to the council before 12:00 noon on February 10th. When making the payment, applicants must present the council's notice directly to the Fuxing Bank. Failure to pay by the deadline will be considered as abandonment. As for the rice sacks, they must be returned to the original warehouse in their original state within five days after receiving the rice.

### Central Reserve Bank to Issue New 100 Yuan Notes Starting Today

In order to regulate the needs of the market for cash, the Central Reserve Bank previously issued two new types of banknotes, 500 yuan and 10 yuan, starting on the 29th of last month. It is now known that the bank will also issue a new type of 100 yuan note from the 1943 edition starting today (the 8th). The front is decorated with blue patterns, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the center. The upper left and right corners are printed with red Western letters, and the lower left and right corners are printed with the seal of the bank's President and Vice President. The back is decorated with green patterns, with a circular image of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum in the center. The lower left and right corners are printed with the Western signatures of the bank's President and Vice President. This 100 yuan note is universally accepted with all types of banknotes already issued by the bank.

### Personnel Changes in the Police Bureau

The Municipal Police Bureau is gradually reforming its personnel. Yesterday, it announced that Takahashi Teiichi, the Deputy Director of the West Hongkou Branch Bureau, was to be dismissed for poor service. His vacancy will be filled by Kote Yuukyuro, the Deputy Director of the Zhabei Branch Bureau, and Kikokudaizo, the Deputy Section Chief of the Fourth Division, will be transferred to be the Deputy Director of the Zhabei Branch Bureau.

### Prices Rise Again: Police Bureau Conducts Strict Investigation - All Economic Police Mobilized

Recently, commodity prices in the city have risen again due to the upcoming Lunar New Year, and unscrupulous merchants have seized the opportunity to act recklessly, disregarding the law, and raising prices without authorization. As a result, the price increase trend has become increasingly fierce, and people's livelihoods are severely threatened. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited the economic police authorities in the city. According to the person in charge, "The authorities are determined to thoroughly suppress commodity prices in the city. They have repeatedly warned people in various industries to abide by the law and absolutely not to seek profit at the expense of people's livelihoods. Unscrupulous merchants will be severely punished. As for the recent rise in commodity prices, it is still caused by some unscrupulous merchants arbitrarily manipulating and raising prices without authorization, which is extremely abhorrent. The bureau has mobilized all economic police starting today (the 7th) to actively and secretly conduct a comprehensive investigation, especially on the prices of daily necessities such as rice, oil, salt, meat, vegetables, coal briquettes, soap, matches, and sugar. If any unauthorized price increases or acts of hoarding and monopolization are found, they will be severely punished in accordance with wartime laws. Therefore, it is hoped that merchants in various industries will self-discipline and avoid violating the law. Citizens are also encouraged to report unscrupulous merchants to the authorities truthfully so that they can be investigated and dealt with."

### Motor Vehicle Permits: Deadline for Renewal

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has previously stipulated that the 16th term of motor vehicle driving permits in the city should be renewed starting from January 5th. More than one month has passed, and a few vehicle owners have delayed the renewal. It is now known that the bureau has set a deadline for renewal until the 12th of this month. Overdue applications will result in the suspension of the 17th term of permits, and the Police Bureau will be requested to seize the vehicles.

### City Traffic Division: Suspension of Season Tickets

The City Traffic Company has suspended the sale of three-month season tickets starting on the 1st of this month. However, state-owned and municipal government-affiliated institutions will continue to sell them with a 50% discount. As for monthly tickets, they will continue to be sold for the convenience of citizens.

### New Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association Hosts Farewell and Welcome Tea Party for Two Naval Captains; Event Filled with Warmth

Captain Shiota of the Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department, having been ordered to a prestigious new post, is soon returning to Japan. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, recognizing Captain Shiota's extensive cooperation and contributions to the Shanghai press community over the past two years, deeply regrets his departure. Therefore, they specially held a tea party yesterday (the 7th) at 4:30 PM at the Cathay Hotel to express their farewell. At the same time, they welcomed the new Captain Matsumoto. Press Chief Matsushima also personally attended, making the tea party exceptionally lively. Details are as follows:

A Distinguished Gathering

Press Chief Matsushima, accompanied by Captain Shiota and Captain Matsumoto, arrived punctually. Also present were Mr. Lin Junfu, Mr. Sakazume Seiichiro, Mr. Akita, Mr. Wang Bingnan, and Mr. Liu Zhennan, all trusted members of the Fleet Press Department, as well as Mr. Koike, a trusted member of the Japanese Army Press Department, and Chief Liu of the Shanghai Special Municipality Publicity Department (represented by Commissioner Zhu). Mr. Akahoshi and Mr. Sakurai of the Chinese News Association were also in attendance. Chairman Chen Binhe of the Shanghai Branch was unfortunately unable to attend due to an important meeting of the Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association, but he sent a representative to read a farewell address. Standing Directors of the Branch, Mr. Osaka Yoichi (representing Mr. Hidaka Kiyomaro), Mr. Xu Liqu, Mr. Jin Xiongbai (representing Mr. Lu Guangjie), Mr. Huang Jingzhai (representing Mr. Zhu Yongkang), Mr. Chen Riping, Mr. Yuan Shu (representing Mr. Weng Yongqing), Mr. Moriyama Takashi, Mr. Zhang Zhaoming, and Executive Director Mr. Lu Feng, along with representatives from various newspapers, totaling over two hundred people, were present, creating a distinguished gathering.

Speech by Chen Riping

Standing Director Chen Riping, as chairman, delivered a speech, saying: "Esteemed guests, today the News Association is holding this tea party, on one hand, to bid farewell to Captain Shiota on his prestigious reassignment, and on the other hand, to welcome Captain Matsumoto to his new post. Therefore, this tea party actually carries a double meaning.

Captain Shiota has been in office for two years and eight months. Under the tense circumstances of the Greater East Asia War, he assisted Press Chief Matsushima in shouldering the important responsibility of publicity and reporting, making significant contributions. I would like to express my deep gratitude on behalf of the News Association and the entire Shanghai citizenry for Captain Shiota's hard work and great achievements.

Furthermore, because Captain Shiota held the position of publicity and reporting, he maintained close contact with various cultural institutions in the city, especially with our press community, almost on a daily basis. Over the past two years, Captain Shiota's assistance in news reporting and business promotion has been truly significant. This is something that the entire Shanghai press community should gratefully acknowledge in unison. These two points address the public aspect. On a personal level, Captain Shiota has maintained excellent relations and warm feelings with people in the press community through prolonged contact. Therefore, just as we were eagerly anticipating Captain Shiota's continued guidance and assistance, we suddenly heard that he was leaving his post to return home. This is truly a loss for the Shanghai press community. So, from both public and private perspectives, we cannot help but feel regret and disappointment. However, Captain Shiota's prestigious reassignment means that he is leaving Shanghai to take on a more important position. Although we are temporarily separated, from the perspective of the entire East Asia, the mission and responsibilities that Captain Shiota will shoulder in the future, and the results he will achieve, will be equally significant.

We cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy at Captain Shiota's departure from Shanghai, but we hope that Captain Shiota will continue to keep the Shanghai press community in mind, so that even though we are in different locations, we can still maintain a spiritual connection.

Succeeding Captain Shiota is Captain Matsumoto, whom we are also welcoming today. It is said that Captain Matsumoto majored in law and economics at Tokyo Imperial University in his early years, and is both knowledgeable and well-qualified. In the future, he will shoulder the task of publicity and guidance for the Fleet Press Department in Shanghai, and he will certainly make outstanding contributions. This is something we deeply rejoice in. We believe that Captain Matsumoto will use his talents and knowledge to follow in Captain Shiota's footsteps and provide our press community with guidance and assistance in all aspects."

Speech by Chen Binhe

Next, Chairman Chen Binhe of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association delivered a speech (read by a delegated representative): "Captain Shiota, Captain Matsumoto, distinguished guests: Today we are bidding farewell to Captain Shiota and welcoming Captain Matsumoto. We are honored by your presence. I have known Captain Shiota for more than two years. Because Shen Bao is managed by the Navy, I have had many opportunities to interact with Captain Shiota personally due to my official duties. From a public standpoint, I can openly say that this is a model of Sino-Japanese cooperation. In official matters, Captain Shiota and I mostly shared the same opinions. Even when we had differing views, we were able to discuss them frankly and reach a satisfactory understanding. Therefore, all our work was done voluntarily, without any unexpected interference. That is why I say it is a model of Sino-Japanese cooperation. In the past two years, we have only discussed official matters, not personal matters, but our private friendship is also excellent. I admire Captain Shiota most for two things: first, his seriousness and dedication in handling matters. We often had matters to discuss as early as 8:00 AM, and even at 12:00 AM at night. He had no weekly holidays. This is his hardworking spirit. He is a young man, and generally speaking, young people love beauty. Captain Shiota also loves beauty, but sometimes when he is busy, his beard grows long and he doesn't trim it. His socks are torn at the back, his leather shoes are cracked, but he still wears them. His coat was stolen, and he didn't have money to buy a new one, so he relied on his spirit to keep warm. All of this demonstrates his hardworking spirit, which is worthy of admiration. Once, a Japanese friend working in a Chinese agency asked me what the Chinese side expected of the working spirit of the Japanese in China. I replied that I hoped that Japanese friends, whether working in Chinese or Japanese agencies, could serve as role models. In that case, Mr. Shiota is a representative. Second, he has a deep understanding of Chinese issues and a passion for Chinese youth. Now that Captain Shiota is being transferred away from Shanghai and Captain Matsumoto is taking over, we believe that Captain Matsumoto will certainly be as serious and enthusiastic as Captain Shiota. Finally, on a personal level, I feel very reluctant to part with Captain Shiota, both in terms of public duty and private friendship. I imagine that everyone present feels the same way. I wish Captain Shiota a bright future and good health, and Captain Matsumoto good health as well."

Speech by Matsushima

Subsequently, Press Chief Matsushima delivered a speech, saying briefly: "Today, I am grateful to the Shanghai press community for holding this grand tea party to bid farewell to Captain Shiota and welcome Captain Matsumoto. I am participating in this grand gathering to express my gratitude. In the past two years and eight months, Captain Shiota has given one hundred percent of his ability to the wartime publicity and reporting work. The former News Federation and the current News Association are to us like the sun and moon within the universe. What this means is that I am a weak moon, Captain Shiota is a radiant sun, and the News Association is the great universe. If it can be said that the publicity and reporting work in the past has been successful, then this is due to the radiance of the sun and the inclusiveness of the great universe. Although Captain Shiota is under my command, he is an extremely talented and capable person. I really feel sad to see him transferred this time. Captain Shiota has provided a lot of assistance in the establishment of the Chinese News Association and the Shanghai Branch. Now that the Association is starting to promote its work, Captain Shiota is about to be transferred. I believe everyone also feels reluctant. Fortunately, Captain Matsumoto is succeeding him. He also has a wealth of knowledge and is particularly confident in Sino-Japanese friendship. Therefore, I hope that everyone will assist Captain Matsumoto with the same enthusiasm as they assisted Captain Shiota. Although the war situation has shifted to Luzon Island and the base war is underway in Manila, we are not pessimistic. On the contrary, it is becoming more and more favorable. Last month, I returned to Japan and saw with my own eyes the completeness of the decisive battle posture. After returning, my conviction became even stronger. In the future decisive battle, gains and losses in local areas are not important. The most important key to victory in the decisive battle lies entirely in the genuine cooperation between China and Japan."

Shiota's Response

Finally, Captain Shiota delivered a thank-you speech, saying briefly: "Today, I am very pleased and grateful to be hosted by the News Association. On the one hand, I feel very depressed because I am leaving Shanghai and parting with everyone. When I came to Shanghai to serve, it was just four months after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At that time, there was little contact between the Shanghai press community and the Navy. Now, we have such contact. I know and have participated in the process in between, so I also feel very pleased. Although I am about to leave Shanghai and my very familiar Chinese friends, I will always have the opportunity to come here again. I hope everyone will continue to work hard and be active. I am grateful for the excessive praise from the Press Chief just now, but I really don't deserve it. Fortunately, Captain Matsumoto has super-excellent abilities. I hope everyone will continue to cooperate with the Press Department, with Press Chief Matsushima as the center, and launch a major offensive against the enemy for the common future of China and Japan."

Social Services

### Antang Hospital's Finances are Tight; Appeals for Help from All Sectors

A letter from Antang Charity Hospital states: "Respected Sir/Madam, our hospital was established 57 years ago, with the aim of providing medical relief to the poor and serving the community. In addition to outpatient services, we also have 80 beds. All meals and medicine are provided free of charge. At present, the minimum cost per person per day is 300 yuan, with daily expenses amounting to about 33,000 yuan, and monthly expenses around one million yuan. Before the incident, our hospital's expenses were primarily supported by overseas donations, but now these donations have been completely cut off. However, the hospital's expenses cannot be reduced for even a day. It is difficult to continue without resources. Moreover, most of the patients in our hospital are laborers or rickshaw pullers. These people already struggle to afford meals on a daily basis, and once they fall ill, they are not only unable to support themselves, but their wives and children are also on the verge of starvation and cold. As of today, the plight of our hospital has reached the point of survival or extinction. Therefore, we dare to write this letter to appeal to benevolent gentlemen and ladies to lend a helping hand with compassion, allocating funds for assistance or making monthly donations, so that not only can the lives of the poor and sick in the hospital be extended, but also the decades of facilities in our hospital will not be interrupted. This should be something that charitable people would be happy to support, right? Our hospital is located at 149 at the intersection of Rue Lupan and Route Cardinal Mercier. If you would like to visit and offer advice on improvements, we would be sincerely welcome."

### Second Batch of "Shi Si Long" Tablets for Charity Sale

A letter from Moore Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory states: "Respected Sir/Madam, our factory sent 500 pieces of 'Shi Si Long' tablets (specially for the treatment of all suppurative diseases) for charity sale last May, and the sale has been completed, with all accounts settled. The results are excellent and commendable. Now, in order to relieve the poor and sick, we are willing to offer another 500 pieces to continue the charity sale. However, due to electricity restrictions, production is inevitably slow, so we are sending 120 pieces first, and will send the rest in succession. However, raw materials have risen again and again, and various expenses have increased sharply. By calculation, even at cost, it would be at least over 1,000 yuan. But in order to give preferential treatment to the charity sale, we are disregarding the cost and pricing each piece at 800 yuan, still following the old practice of recovering half of the cost and donating half to your medical aid fund. This is just a small token of our sincerity."

Also, Mr. Shi of Moore Pharmaceutical Factory donated 40 masks, each priced at 50 yuan. All proceeds from the sale will be used for the local poverty relief fund. Thank you.

### Year-End Savings

A letter from Mr. Pan Yusheng states: "Respected Sir/Madam, I am saving on wasteful expenses at the end of the year, and I have saved 5,000 yuan in banknotes. I am donating 1,000 yuan each to your medical aid fund, poverty relief fund, orphaned children's aid fund, Yiyou Society, and Pushan Villa. A small stream of soil cannot supplement great depths, but it is a small token of my sincerity."
