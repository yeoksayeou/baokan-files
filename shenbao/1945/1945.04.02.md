### The Third Navy Day Was Solemnly Commemorated Yesterday; Acting Chairman Chen Personally Delivered an Earnest Instruction

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The first of the month is our country's Third Navy Day. Coming two days after the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, looking back, although the National Government was faced with devastation and a difficult environment after the return, it has been actively pursuing the construction of a new navy. Its scale is now taking shape and development is promising. At this time of total decisive battle, coinciding with a Navy Day of profound significance in the history of our country's naval reconstruction, we feel infinitely inspired. The Ministry of the Navy held a solemn commemorative ceremony in the auditorium of the Ministry yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., led by Minister Ling, with the participation of hundreds of officers from the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters and other affiliated units in the capital. Acting Chairman Chen personally attended and gave instructions, clarifying the National Government's determination to rebuild the navy, stating that talent should prioritize spiritual education, his words were extremely earnest, and all the officers who respectfully listened were deeply moved. In the evening at 7:00 p.m., Minister Ling also hosted a banquet at the International Club to entertain senior naval officers of allied nations to foster camaraderie.

### Minister Ling's Broadcast Speech Explains the Significance of Navy Day

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Navy Minister Ling Qing, with the theme of "The Significance of Navy Day," gave a special speech to the public. It is hoped that the public will have a sincere understanding of the navy, and further have a clear understanding of the importance of the navy. Because the Chinese people have a weak concept of the ocean, they regard the navy as insignificant.

The Origin of the Emphasis on Land and Neglect of the Sea Concept

According to historical records, since Emperor Huangdi established the nation, the development path of the Chinese nation has been to govern the Yellow River basin from west to east, and then gradually move south after the Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties, eventually settling and multiplying in the two major basins of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, and occupying the vast territory of today. Due to the historical development from west to east and from north to south, border troubles in the past dynasties were all in the northwest, which cultivated the Chinese people's concept of emphasizing land and neglecting the sea. Until the late Qing Dynasty, when Europeans invaded the East, the Opium War and the Sino-French War resulted in the loss of territory and indemnities. People with insight gradually realized the importance of coastal defense, which was more important than the northwest border defense. Therefore, the wise men such as Zeng and Li at that time strongly opposed public opinion and established the navy. After the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese people became indifferent to the importance of the navy again. After the founding of the Republic of China, the country was in turmoil. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, some people who talked about national defense even made the absurd argument that the navy should be abandoned and only the air force should be built. The Chinese people did not understand and echoed it, which was no different from choking on food and abandoning eating, or cutting off an arm to seek health.

Prudent Statesmanship and Naval Reconstruction

At this time and place, Mr. Chen, our Chairman, happened to be in the central hub of Japan, and had written articles to criticize its wrongdoing. It can be said that he was prudent in his statesmanship and had a unique vision. The reason why our country's navy was able to survive is thanks to this. In 1940, the National Government returned to the capital, and the authorities made great efforts to build a new navy. In order to make the Chinese people truly recognize the importance of the navy to a modern country, it was specially decreed in 1943 that April 1st be Navy Day. Its significance is very profound, not only to encourage the personnel of the new navy to strive forward and be able to shoulder important tasks, but also to make the Chinese people feel the importance of the navy and to advocate and assist it, so that it can be developed and carried forward day by day. Last year, the second Navy Day, all agencies and offices affiliated with the Ministry in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and other places held enthusiastic and grand celebrations. The people of the whole country also had a new look, and they all knew that the construction of our country's new navy has been roughly prepared. With this promotion, the national coastal defense can be consolidated day by day, changing the previous drawbacks of open doors. It is a great event.

Fulfilling Duties and Assisting Allies

This year, April 1st, the third Navy Day is approaching, coinciding with the tension of the Pacific War, and the holy war for the liberation of Greater East Asia has reached the decisive stage. The evolution of the navy's affairs is particularly obvious to the war situation. The allied nation, Japan, has a strong combined fleet, so it can be fearless, wait for work at leisure, wait for the most favorable time, and defeat the enemy in one fell swoop to annihilate the enemy and harvest the final victory. At this critical moment, how should all my naval comrades assist the Allied forces step by step and not give up their responsibilities at all? How should all Chinese people have a more advanced understanding of the navy, urge and advocate, so that the future of our navy will become brighter? This is what this Navy Day asks. I am the head of the Ministry of the Navy. I will abide by the national policy, supervise my subordinates, and gradually promote the various construction plans of the planned new navy. Now, human and material resources are extremely difficult. However, with the full assistance and guidance of the Allied countries, if we can pursue the matter with the spirit of perseverance, we will eventually succeed. I hope that the people of the whole country will extend their love for the country to love the navy, and do not hesitate to promote and assist from the sidelines, then the revitalization of the navy is truly dependent on it.

### Sweeping Across the Plains of Henan Province, the Japanese Army Occupied Nanyang; Simultaneously Breaking into the Laohekou Airfield

Japanese Army Base on the Henan Front, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The elite of the North China Area Japanese Army, sweeping across the plains of Henan and continuing to attack, after breaking through the resistance of the 6th Army of the Second Group Army in Fangcheng Erhe, approached the advanced base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing outside Nanyang on the dawn of the 27th. They cooperated with the rapid troops coming south from Nanzhao. On the dawn of the 17th, they attacked the fortifications fortified last year by the Chongqing army, such as the heavy artillery positions and mountain artillery positions, to make a final resistance. However, the elite of the Japanese army broke into the road at the northeast gate. By noon on the same day, Nanyang was completely occupied.

Henan Front, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is planning to actively advance its base in order to respond to the US Air Force's urgent air strikes against Japan. The various elite units of the North China Japanese Army have made full preparations for approaching the First War Zone Army under the direct descendants of Hu Zongnan of Daoqing along the Pinghan Road and the Fifth War Zone Army under Liu Qi. On March 22, they echoed each other with the Central China Japanese Army and suddenly launched operations in several columns from the west side of Pinghan Road, advancing southwest at the same time. On the 27th, they broke into the Laohekou airfield and completely occupied it. The Japanese army troops located on the northern foot of the Funiu Mountains, in order to drive out the newly formed 6th and 8th divisions under Gao Shuxun, the commander of the 39th Group Army, which were resisting in the mountain positions, captured Nantai (100 kilometers southwest of Zhengzhou) on the 25th. On the 24th, the mobile tank unit defeated the temporarily formed 36th Division of the Fifth War Zone near Fangcheng. The rapid troops drove away the 81st, 74th, and 29th divisions led by Cao Fulin of the 55th Army of the Fifth War Zone on the 23rd. After the Japanese army captured Biyang (220 kilometers southwest of Zhengzhou), they chased the remnants in one breath, broke through the defense of the 41st Army of the 22nd Group Army (Commander Sun Zhen), and broke into the Laohekou Airfield in Hubei Province, the advanced base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, at dawn on the 27th. They launched a fierce battle and completely occupied it this afternoon. They are now continuing to attack the city fiercely.

### Lieutenant Colonel Shimada Elaborates on the War Situation

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Lieutenant Colonel Shimada of the Japanese Dispatch Army Press Department met with Chinese reporters at the Japanese Press Club at 5:00 p.m. on the 31st to explain the battle situation of the Laohekou Campaign and the Okinawa Island as follows:

Laohekou Campaign

Since the Ganzhou Suichuan Campaign, Laohekou is the only remaining forward base of the Chongqing US Air Force. According to Laohekou, it is the forwardmost base of the Chongqing US Northwest Air Force Base Army (including Xi'an, Hankou, Ankang and other places). After the Henan War, the main task of the Chongqing US Northwest Air Force was to destroy the important transportation lines and facilities such as Pinghan, Jinpu and the Yangtze River in the west. Now that its forward base, Laohekou Airfield, has been captured, the Chongqing US Northwest Air Force Base Group has suffered a great blow. According to the report, the Chongqing army in the war zone has a total of seventeen or eight divisions. The troops defending Laohekou are Liu Zhi's troops. The Second Division in Nanyang and the 39th Division in Zhenping. Since the Henan War, the Chongqing army in the area has been actively reorganizing in order to restore its strength. At the beginning of the Laohekou Campaign, a part of the Japanese army set out from Lushan, Yexian, Wuyang, Suiping and other places with Nanyang as the target and moved forward. Another part of the Japanese army echoed this and attacked Xiangyang Laohekou from Jingmen and Hanshui. On March 27, the Chongqing army collapsed and retreated to the west bank, Zhichuan, Laohekou line. The 250th Army retreated, a part of which monitored Nanyang, and a part of which attacked Xinye. Its rapid troops broke into the Laohekou Airfield at noon on the 27th. The Chongqing US Air Force in the area had already advanced to Ankang on the evening of the 25th. After the Japanese army occupied the Laohekou Airfield, the Chongqing US Northwest Air Force Base Ankang, Hanzhong, and Xi'an were about 800 kilometers away from Laohekou. The occupation of the Laohekou Airfield is of great significance. It can be divided into the following two points: After the Chongqing US Air Force entered the inland, its activities were farther away from its target. The Chongqing US Northwest Air Force Base Group is the outer defense of the B29-type aircraft base. Laohekou is the front line of its outer base. Therefore, the loss of Laohekou Airfield can indirectly threaten the activities of B29-type aircraft. In addition, in the Pacific Philippines and Okinawa, the activities of the enemy's B29-type aircraft still rely on the protection of fighters on the Chinese mainland. Now that the US Air Force's major forward base has been lost, the activities of B29 in various eastern regions have also been severely hit. Furthermore, most of the enemy aircraft that have been attacking Nanjing recently are fighters that took off from Laohekou. The loss of Laohekou will also reduce the number of enemy air raids on Nanjing.

Okinawa Island

The war on Okinawa Island is now unfolding in the Kerama Islands. At the same time, the enemy troops are shelling the southern part of Okinawa Island with naval guns. The enemy's tactics are similar to those in the past Saipan operations, attempting to cover the landings with this. According to logical speculation, the enemy's attempt to invade the Kerama Islands is nothing more than to obtain a springboard to attack Okinawa Island. On this springboard, they will set up ship anchorages, supply bases, and military hospitals. Once this preparation is complete, they will attack Okinawa Island again. According to the report, when the enemy attacked Saipan, they used the air force as a springboard for the landing. Now, when attacking Okinawa, they use the land base as a springboard. This is the experience gained from the enemy's excessive losses in the Saipan operation. The Kerama Islands are only a dozen miles away from Okinawa Island. It is difficult for a large fleet to operate on this narrow sea. Therefore, the enemy troops divided their fleet into several groups and carried out naval gun shelling on the three sea areas in the southern half of Okinawa Island, so that the enemy ships were afraid of the Japanese army's special attack team for a long time, so their activities were limited to daytime (aircraft can be used for close surveillance in the daytime sky, and the night surveillance is different). The enemy's naval force in Okinawa is about 100 ships, and so far, it has lost one-fifth or even half of them. Although the enemy troops have suffered this loss, they still have a huge naval force in the Pacific. The Japanese army has two major air force bases in Kyushu to the north of Okinawa and Taiwan to the south of Okinawa, which can dispatch large air force units at any time to carry out attacks. In the Battle of Iwo Jima, the enemy lost more than half of its total strength. In the Battle of Okinawa Island, the enemy's losses will be even greater. Therefore, the success of the Japanese army in the future is worth noting.

### Governor Ren Yuan Dao Talks About the Security and Finances of Jiangsu Province

— Tang Yi

"The security situation in Jiangsu Province is neither good nor bad. In reality, the situation is definitely not as bad as rumored outside. We can immediately improve the security of a place, but as soon as the troops are transferred, it returns to its original state." When the reporter discussed the issue of evacuating the population of Shanghai with Governor Ren, he explained this way when talking about improving security.

"To restore the security situation before the incident, the problem is very simple, that is, to end the incident. Because of the incident, two kinds of thoughts have been produced. At present, there is undoubtedly a need for peace, but the advocates of resistance against Japan are trying to justify their arguments. The bad thing is that some cunning people are using this as an excuse to seek personal gain; those with weapons are raising the banner of resistance against Japan, and those without weapons are also taking the opportunity to extort. Some village chiefs and ward heads even hope that the security situation is bad, deliberately exaggerating their words in order to fish in troubled waters. Those who listen do not understand the truth, and spread it from one to ten, and from ten to one hundred, thinking that the situation is very serious.

"To eliminate this situation, it is not that there is no way, just kill, but since the establishment of the Reformed Government, I have always adhered to military power. Except for the unfortunate encounters on the battlefield, it can be said that I have never killed anyone. If I carry out large-scale killings, I can certainly improve the security immediately, but generally speaking, they are compatriots, and there is no reason to kill each other. Secondly, if the government's finances are abundant, it can raise a large number of soldiers and engage in suppression. If not, there are many positions to appease and accommodate these people who are raising the banner of resistance against Japan, which can also solve the problem, but in fact, it is not allowed.

"If the incident ends that day, eliminating the divergent thoughts, and cunning people have no excuse, the security can be restored to its original state that day." Governor Ren said here, with a smile on his face, seemingly full of confidence.

The reporter said: "Raising the salaries of civil servants is also an important issue."

Governor Ren said: "Yes, to maintain military discipline and increase the work efficiency of politicians, there is only one way, which is to raise salaries.

"However, we cannot only focus on raising salaries and ignore the people's burden. It is very difficult to increase financial income and raise civil servants' salaries without increasing the people's burden.

"Of course, there are other ways, such as reorganizing the current tax revenue. In the past six months, reorganizing the tax revenue and eliminating the results of corruption have increased the revenue by 100 million yuan, which is already a large amount. However, if it is used to increase the salaries of civil servants for half a year, it will only be more than 100 million yuan per month. In fact, we have already raised the salaries of civil servants, military police, and teachers in the province. Just raising a little bit will cost an additional 30 million yuan per month. However, there is still no way to curb the rise in prices. On the one hand, we have to consider the people's burden, and on the other hand, we have to enrich the financial resources to ensure the minimum living standards of civil servants. This work is very difficult, but I have this determination, and I hope that all civil servants will work hard to support the war."

Finally, the reporter mentioned Governor Ren's words in Shanghai about building three Shanghai-Suzhou highways. Governor Ren said: "It has already started. In terms of labor, there are no difficulties because each county is responsible for the projects within its territory. However, the construction funds of 200 million yuan are still waiting to be raised!"

### Soviet Union Launches Offensive on Germany's Southeast Border; Vienna is the Ultimate Goal

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Reuters: Germany's southeastern border area has become the focus of the Eastern Front in the past three days due to the Soviet Union's new offensive. At present, the Soviet Union's purpose in attacking the area is twofold: one is to advance westward, but there has been no progress recently; the other is to advance northward, with Neustadt as the target. The vanguard of the Soviet Union has already crossed the German border between Stainabrück and Görnitz, and turned northward, and has now advanced to the Rabb-Odenburg railway line. The Soviet Union's troops advancing westward north of the Danube River are now blocked in front of the German defense area between the Neutra and Waag rivers, that is, in the area west of Neuhäusel-Komorn. Therefore, the Soviet Union has made little progress in the Graz, Vienna, and Pressburg areas. If the Soviet Union still regards Vienna as the ultimate goal, fierce battles will break out in a few weeks.

The Situation in Silesia is Tense

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – German News Agency: The war in Upper Silesia is gradually becoming tense. Although the Soviet Union's attack on Loslau has collapsed, west of Radibor, the Soviet Union, with the assistance of strong tank units, has deeply penetrated the German line of defense, but it was later blocked by the German army.

### Situation on the Western Front

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency telegram) – Due to the rapid advance of the US First and Third Armies, the anti-Axis forces have controlled the central Rhine area from Paderborn in the north to Frankfurt in the east in the south.

### Mr. Wang Yintai Broadcasts to the Nation in Nanjing

"Commemorating the Return to the Capital and Completing Peaceful Unification"

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Wang Yintai, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, gave a broadcast to the national public at the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 31st, entitled "Commemorating the Return to the Capital and Completing Peaceful Unification," stating briefly:

The first thing I want to say is that the North China Political Affairs Commission is a local administrative organ under the National Government. The people of the north require unity and a belief in the revival of the motherland. I can represent everyone and explain this central belief here.

Self-Reliance and Revival

The compatriots in the north and the compatriots in the south are completely consistent and absolutely the same. In terms of the overall situation, although the current country is divided, compatriots in all aspects are thinking about the arrival of peaceful unification. The purpose of saving the country and saving the nation is originally consistent regardless of which compatriots are involved. China needs self-reliance and revival, completely using its own strength to improve the status of the country and the nation, and then it can cooperate with countries and nations that treat me equally. Then, just ask whether we have sincerity and determination. It can also be said that as long as we have such sincerity and determination, no matter what difficulties and obstacles there are, it is not difficult to destroy them one by one in the line of persevering and courageous progress.

Cultivating People's Livelihood

Secondly, I would like to talk about my feelings on the issue of public opinion. This time, I came to participate in the excitement of the central government commemorating the return to the capital. The meeting the day before yesterday must have gained very valuable and original harvests. We should, on the one hand, sincerely ask for the cooperation of our compatriots, and on the other hand, with Chairman Chen's determination to rectify officialdom, clearly recognize that "politics of the wise," or in other words, the issue of governing people, is what is most needed in this very time. Recognize that only by cultivating the people's livelihood can we enhance national strength and achieve the mission of seeking unification internally and liberation externally.

Encouraging the Future

We should honestly examine the past and encourage the future. Because we respect public opinion, we should go to the realization of public opinion and actively build the government on the people.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Kyushu

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Hundreds of B29-type aircraft from Enna attacked airfields and aviation facilities in Kyushu from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on March 31, attempting to echo the landing forces on Okinawa Island. In the future, the B29-type aircraft's air raids on Kyushu will become more intense.

Editorial

### On the War Situation in Ryukyu

Recently, following the operation on Iwo Jima, the enemy United States is attempting to land on Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands. The Ryukyu Islands are also known as the Nansei Islands, with Okinawa being the largest. Its capital, Naha, is 450 kilometers from Kagoshima in Kyushu, Japan, 510 kilometers from Taipei, Taiwan, 540 kilometers from Ningbo and Wenzhou in China, and 650 kilometers from this city [Shanghai]. The future trend of the war situation is worthy of our close attention. At the same time, the enemy United States is also launching a strategic offensive, creating various rumors in an attempt to disturb the people's hearts. In this situation, we should remain calm and not be misled by rumors.

The enemy United States' objective in launching an offensive against the Ryukyu Islands can be viewed from two aspects: First, in terms of political strategy, the enemy United States intends to gain an advantage in the upcoming San Francisco Conference scheduled for April 25th, in order to achieve its ambition of dominating the Far East in the future. This, of course, depends on the actual situation of its operations in East Asia. If it cannot achieve a so-called "operational advantage" before the conference, it will inevitably be questioned by the Soviet Union and other countries at the conference. Therefore, the enemy United States cannot but engage in greater military adventures. Second, in terms of strategy, the main objective is to seize strong air bases to strengthen the strategic bombing of allied Japan's wartime production, and at the same time, to use Okinawa Island as a center to strengthen the disruption of transportation and communication within 500 to 1,000 kilometers, covering China, Manchuria, and various parts of Southeast Asia.

Then, does the enemy United States have any hope of achieving this goal? Before making a judgment, we must recognize that the most important conditions for the enemy to achieve these political and strategic objectives are: 1. A quick victory: If the goal cannot be achieved before April 25th, the international war situation and diplomatic situation will change, and the enemy United States will have to admit failure; 2. Strong logistical support: If this cannot be done, its main fleet will inevitably be bogged down and depleted by the Japanese army. If the positions of attacker and defender are reversed, it will also inevitably fall into failure; 3. Neutralizing other Japanese forces: the enemy must neutral other Japanese forces to prevent the Japanese army from transferring troops from other locations and even force them to deploy troops elsewhere; otherwise, the isolated and deeply penetrated main attacking force of the enemy United States will still suffer heavy casualties and fail to achieve its political and strategic objectives.

Does the enemy United States possess these three necessary conditions today? First, regarding the point of neutralizing enemy forces, the dispersion of American forces in the Pacific can be understood by observing the vast distances between the islands occupied by the enemy United States in its counteroffensives. The difficulty of mutual support and cooperation between enemy forces will inevitably increase in the future. As for the enemy British forces, the offensives against Sumatra, the counteroffensive against the Malay Peninsula, and even the landing on the Indochina Peninsula and Leizhou Peninsula, are all just unfounded rumors. The Indian colonies are barely able to take care of themselves, and the airstrikes by a few hundred planes will not have much impact on the war situation. Secondly, the so-called "Chongqing counteroffensive" in response to the United States is even more unreliable, as the issue of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists in Chongqing remains at a stalemate. From this, it can be seen that the enemy United States does not possess this condition. On the contrary, the Japanese army's launch of the Henan offensive in China, the capture of Nanyang, and the penetration into Laohekou and the air raid on Changting, have achieved the effect of a counter-neutralization operation in the Pacific.

Second, in the landing operation in northern France last year, the enemy United States used 124,000 troops and 3,400 ships of various sizes. In the past landing in the Philippines, it used more than 270,000 troops and more than 1,000 ships. In the operation on Iwo Jima, it used 220,000 troops and more than 800 ships of various sizes. Now, in the battle for the Ryukyu Islands, the number of troops and ships used can be imagined. Furthermore, a large number of troops must be used to maintain each occupied area. Therefore, the condition of strong logistical support is not met.

Third, since the above two major conditions cannot be met, the condition of "quick victory" is even more out of the question. Therefore, they cannot but resort to strategic propaganda, creating all kinds of rumors to shake the morale of the Axis powers in East Asia, in order to facilitate the condition of a quick victory.

Therefore, we must point out that the enemy United States' offensive against the Ryukyu Islands does not possess any conditions for success. However, judging from the enemy's political and strategic objectives and the geographical situation of the new war zone, the crisis of a landing operation on the Chinese mainland and the invasion of the Japanese mainland are equally serious. The Chongqing National Government's public announcement on March 26th also stated: "Recent military developments indicate that operations against Japan will soon unfold on the Chinese mainland," which is also something we cannot ignore. We must use all our strength to oppose the transformation of China into a battlefield, resolutely eliminate all enemy rumors, and prepare calmly for the future decisive battle with a clear mind and a determination to win.

### Minister Matsushima Discusses the Okinawa War Situation: Japanese Troops Have High Morale and Strict Defense

Colonel Matsushima, the head of the press department of the Japanese Fleet in China, recently gave a speech elaborating on the current war situation in great detail. The content is recorded as follows:

More Than 100 Enemy Ships Sunk and Destroyed

The enemy fleet is still bombarding the Okinawa area with naval guns, and it has become increasingly fierce. The Japanese side is fully prepared, defending the positions to the death and preventing the enemy from landing. During this period, the Japanese air force has achieved results, as announced by the General Headquarters on March 31, sinking and destroying more than 50 enemy ships. However, including unconfirmed results, the total since the enemy's attack on the Nansei Islands has reached more than 100 ships. Based on the previous examples of Saipan, Leyte Island, Lingayen Gulf, Iwo Jima, and Zamboanga, the enemy usually conducts fierce bombardment for two days before landing, but this time it has been more than ten days since the 18th, and there has been no landing yet. This proves the strictness of the Japanese defense.

The Japanese Garrison is Fully Prepared

During this period, more than 90 enemy ships have been sunk and destroyed, both before and after. This will cause significant obstacles to the enemy's future operations. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the officers and soldiers on the front lines for their brave fighting. At the same time, we should work even harder to prevent the enemy from landing and annihilate the enemy on the beaches. However, judging from the situation in the last day or two, the enemy seems to be starting a landing operation. We believe that the attacks from the Japanese army, navy, and air force will surely cause the enemy heavy casualties. The Japanese army's ground garrison is fully prepared, adopting a battle method that does not allow any opportunity to be missed. This is purely a manifestation of strong self-confidence and a result of learning from many valuable lessons in the past.

British Navy Joins the Operation

Recently, the British Pacific Fleet led by Lieutenant General Rawling has joined the US Pacific Fleet. On the surface, this is of course a joint operation of the British and American Pacific Fleets in the Pacific. However, in fact, the US Navy abandoned its proud attitude and welcomed the British Navy to join the operation because the US fleet had suffered too heavy losses.

War Situation Evolution Requires Caution

The results of this battle are extremely significant, and the purpose is only to annihilate the enemy's invading forces. However, considering that the enemy still has a considerable number of ships remaining, we must be cautious about the evolution of the war situation. Recently, enemy aircraft in the Shanghai area have conducted reconnaissance operations again, which can be seen as a restraint operation against the Nansei Islands and a preparation for some kind of next-stage action. We must pay full attention. Today, we are in the most intense stage of the decisive battle. The morale of the officers and soldiers on the front lines is high. Our East Asian nations should also consolidate their confidence in overcoming all difficulties.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacked Shanghai Yesterday; All Repelled

At 2:13 PM on the 1st, several US P-51 fighters invaded the Shanghai area and dropped several bombs in the suburbs. However, the losses were minimal. The Japanese army counterattacked and repelled all enemy aircraft at 2:30 PM.

### Air Defense Training Institute Third Class Enrolls

The third class of students at the Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters Air Defense Training Institute held an enrollment ceremony at the former site of the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse yesterday (1st) at 10:00 AM. Director Zhou, who also serves as the director of the institute, was unable to attend and preside over the ceremony due to official business. Director Wu of the Baojia Office, who also serves as the honorary education director of the institute, delivered a speech on his behalf. Fire Chief Ide and Li Guohua, the police chiefs of various districts in the city, also attended on time. The honorary education director made a training speech, and Fire Chief Ide and others delivered speeches in succession, and the ceremony ended.

### Model Self-Defense Pre-Inspection

The Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Self-Defense Headquarters is uniformly organizing model pre-inspection of national staff in various districts. A large-scale joint pre-inspection will be held on the 3rd of this month. Some districts are holding preliminary inspections. Taishan, Lujia Hong, Changshu, Xujiahui, Xieqiao, Penglai, Yi Chao, and seven other districts in the city held a comprehensive pre-inspection at the Lingbao Road Zero-Dan University Square at 5:00 PM on the 1st. Section Chief Xiao Gang and Qiu Penmin from the District Headquarters were present to provide guidance.

### Mayor Zhou Concurrently Serves as Chairman of the New Shanghai Association

The chairman of the Shanghai District Branch of the New People's Society was originally appointed by former Mayor Chen. Mayor Zhou now serves as the chairman of the association concurrently. After Secretary-General Xi Peiwen resigned, Mr. Shen Qian has been appointed.

### Police Arrest Wire Thief

Recently, the exposed telephone and electric wires in the city have been frequently cut and interrupted. The Municipal Police Department has long ordered its subordinates to investigate and arrest the perpetrators. Last month, Detective Zhou Wenqing received a tip and arrested Wang Ah San, a thief from Yangzhou, who specialized in stealing these wires. He has committed 15 cases. Based on his confession, Zhang Shaowei, who received the stolen goods, was arrested on Rue Ratard. He bought and resold the stolen wires for profit. The investigation of the two criminals has been completed, and they have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with the law.

Sports
Public Basketball A Group A – Zhongbei Wins Championship – Hualiao Defeated in Yesterday's Final

In the Public Basketball League, A Group A, due to a tie between Zhongbei and Mu Lian in previous matches, a final match was scheduled to determine the champion. To maintain order, it was secretly held at the Ba Xian Qiao YMCA yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Few spectators were present. Hualiao's strength was greatly diminished due to the absence of key players Fan Qinggong, Quan Changchun, Zhang Xianlun, and Qu Xilin, who had gone north. Yesterday, they could only field Bo Tuo, Zhang Liangxiong, Chen Zuoliang, Xu Jusheng, Kong Guangyi, Wu Chengzhang, and others. Zhongbei fielded all players except for Shen Yugong, who was still injured. The first half was tense, ending with Zhongbei leading 21 to 18 by three points. In the second half, Hualiao scored again, narrowing the gap to just one point. Unfortunately, at 28 to 22, Xu Jusheng was fouled out, leaving Hualiao with only four players, which significantly weakened them. The final score was 53 to 34, with Zhongbei winning the championship.

Report released at 6:30 PM yesterday

### The Educational Beliefs of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport

Radio Address by Mr. Jiang Xiyuan on the Second Navy Day

Yesterday was our nation's second Navy Day. In this city, the Central Naval Academy held a grand parade. Furthermore, the academy's president, Vice Admiral Jiang Xiyuan, delivered a radio address to the nation from the Shanghai Radio Station last night, titled "The Educational Beliefs of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport." The main points are as follows:

New Mechanisms

The overall structure of the New Navy is a highly scientific and mobile entity. The Ministry of the Navy serves as the highest governing body, commanding the entire national navy. Important coastal locations, such as Nanjing, Guangzhou, Weihaiwei, and Hankou, have established key port departments or base departments. These departments are configured with base groups within their respective areas, forming a strong naval network. Furthermore, a hydrographic survey bureau has been established in Shanghai, using the Yangtze River as its base and gradually expanding to waterways along the entire national coastline. Significant progress has already been made. As for educational institutions, in addition to training camps attached to each key port department for refining naval soldiers, the Central Naval Training Center has been established in Shanghai as the national center for soldier education.

A Glimpse of Training

The national naval officer education is undertaken by the Central Naval Academy in Shanghai, located on Longhua Road. Naval cadets are selected from all over the country. The education they receive is not like the outdated and ineffective methods of the past. It is a vibrant and intense education that balances academic and military skills, spirit, and physical fitness. Every minute of every day is fully utilized. Academic lectures are held in the mornings and afternoons. Various sciences and specialized academic subjects are implemented over a three-year curriculum. Practical training is conducted in the mornings and after afternoon classes. Hand flags, signal lamps, bayonet practice, kendo, judo, national martial arts, dinghy sailing, knot tying, and land warfare exercises are included. In addition to various educational materials, training aircraft, cannons, and training ships are provided for the application of both academic and practical subjects. The most important aspect is the daily mental check-up, which establishes unwavering military will and posture. The weekly spiritual education draws from the three key elements of ambition, spirit, and body found in traditional Chinese learning. These serve as means to cultivate the virtues of wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and discipline. The aim is to shape our nation's traditional spirit and align it with the school motto of "wise, deep, brave, and resolute" to realize the historical mission of revitalizing China and safeguarding East Asia. Every winter, there is rigorous cold-weather training. Every summer, there is intense hot-weather training and swimming. During the three years, there are multiple shipboard internships and navigation exercises, as well as participation in fleet combat exercises. Upon graduation after three years, graduates are assigned by the Navy to various ships and units to begin their duties as junior officers. In terms of compensation, it is not particularly generous, and they must endure the hardships of wartime conditions in terms of clothing and food.

Simultaneous Endeavors

The New Navy mentioned above is a program closely aligned with new maritime transport. The Central Higher Merchant Marine School is located within the Central Naval Training Center in Shanghai. Merchant marine talents receive the same education and training as naval talents, representing a true embodiment of the new era's system. The parallel development of the New Maritime Transport and the New Navy can be anticipated in the near future. The recruitment of students for the Higher Merchant Marine School is conducted simultaneously with the recruitment of naval students. However, the duration of study for Higher Merchant Marine students is two years. Upon graduation, they are assigned to positions on merchant ships.

Three Beliefs

With the rapid development of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport, we, from an educational standpoint, have developed the following three beliefs: First, the construction of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport is a development appropriate for the Greater East Asia War. On the one hand, new construction experiences are gained from the war, and on the other hand, the new construction must contribute to the victory of the war's future. Second, the strengthened alliance between China and Japan enhances the spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation and increases the efficiency of new construction. This is especially evident in the two programs of the New Navy and New Maritime Transport. Third, we believe that the training ground is the battlefield, and the battlefield is the place of moral cultivation. We also believe in the great legacy of loving one's country, loving one's neighbor, and loving East Asia. This deeply aligns with our nation's traditional methods of self-cultivation and the demands of the times, especially in its perfect harmony. This is the focus of our school's education and training. We hope to start from this point to follow the supreme leader and dedicate everything to the revival of China's national destiny and the liberation of the East Asian peoples.

Social Service

### Enthusiastic Advocacy for Charity Schools – Generous Donations from All Sectors

Mr. Qian Youguan, principal of the Shaoxing Native Middle School in Shanghai, has strongly supported the charity primary school organized by our organization. In addition to generously lending the premises of the Third Primary School of Shaoxing Natives in Shanghai to serve as the Third Charity School and assisting with enrollment matters, he generously donated 10,000 yuan to the charity school yesterday. His enthusiasm for charity education is truly admirable.

A letter from the Sino-Japanese Buddhist Temporary Disaster Relief Association states: "The Association held a charity Peking opera performance, and after deducting all expenses, all donations will be allocated to various charitable organizations in the city to handle poverty relief work. The allocation is as follows: 165,000 yuan to the Shen Bao Compulsory Education Committee, 165,000 yuan to the News Daily Social Service Department, 150,000 yuan to the Zhong Jiao Daoyi Association, 150,000 yuan to the Buddhist Infant Protection Institute, 150,000 yuan to the Jingye Rehabilitation Center, 150,000 yuan to the Ren Ci Charity Association, 150,000 yuan to the Liji Society, and 50,000 yuan to the Production Conservation Group, totaling 1,130,000 yuan. Starting today, all organizations can prepare documentation to claim the funds."

A worker named Lin Shaoxiang wrote: "I am doing hard labor in Shanghai. In my spare time, I read your newspaper and beneficial books, and I feel that I do not know enough characters (I am a senior primary school graduate). A few days ago, I saw in your newspaper that you were founding charity primary schools and managing the 'Charity School Fund.' I felt that the general poor and out-of-school children's parties were getting the opportunity to study, which was very interesting. Now I am sending a sum of money, totaling 10,000 yuan, that I have saved from my daily life to donate to the "Charity School Fund," please check and accept. I will continue to save in the future, and when I have accumulated a considerable amount, I will send it again. Although this amount is small, in a place like Shanghai with a large population, if everyone can save some money, gathering it together, the amount will definitely be considerable!"

Teachers and Students Cooperate in Donating Money and Books

The entire fourth-grade class of Dehua Primary School wrote: "When the first lesson of this semester started, Mr. Miao told us about the Shen Bao founding ten charity primary schools and Mr. Xie Lilin initiating the "Charity School Fund." He also read many letters from donors to us, which made us feel ashamed and touched. Then the teacher encouraged us: 'To do the following three things with the spirit of donating school funding last year: Save money yourself and ask your parents to donate; Donate old books you have read; Tell out-of-school children in the neighborhood to enroll. But our parents are all very poor, and many students rely on student aid to afford books. Finally, after two days of hard work, we, the entire fourth-grade class, managed to collect 5,000 yuan. Mr. Miao also donated 1,000 yuan, totaling 60 yuan. In addition, we have 95 old books. The remaining 215 books were jointly donated by students in the sixth grade.'"

In addition, we deeply appreciate the donation of 100 copies of covenant books from all the male students of Class A in the fifth grade of Renzhi Primary School, and 300 old books, half a dozen exercise books, and ten pencils from all the teachers and students of Peiming Primary School.

### Yongnian Tai Chi Class – First Session Ends

In order to promote physical education and develop national martial arts, our organization established a Hui Zhong Fitness Class on October 1st of last year, temporarily setting up a Yongnian Tai Chi group. We invited Mr. Chuan Zhongwen, nephew of the modern Tai Chi master, Yongnian Yang Chengfu, to serve as a volunteer instructor. Since the beginning of the class, for a period of six months, the first session was completed at the end of March. In addition to the old students continuing to practice for further improvement, the second session will soon begin enrollment. Mr. Chuan has been re-invited to teach voluntarily. Registration forms are currently being printed, and we will announce them as soon as they are ready. The location will still be the courtyard of the Zhong Jiao Daoyi Association on Nantu Road, Zhanyuli, and it is completely free.

Low-Price Market Opens Today

In view of the rising cost of living and the difficult lives of ordinary poor students in the city, the YMCA of Shanghai will hold a low-price market at the YMCA of Baxianqiao on April 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. All proceeds will be used to fund worker lectures. All the goods will be transferred from the relief market for dropouts that is sponsored by four organizations, so the prices are especially low. Special preferential tickets are issued, each sold for 500 yuan, but 600 yuan worth of goods can be purchased. They are already on sale at the YMCA information desk.

### X-Ray Check-Up Privileges for the Education Sector

The China Health Association has initiated X-ray defense check-ups. According to current fees, each film requires 1,400 yuan. However, in order to provide preferential treatment to the education sector, the old price is still halved to make it more popular. These check-up tickets will only be effective with the school's affiliated seal. The ticket fee can be paid when attending the check-up, saving procedures. However, this service method is limited to only one month, until the end of April this year, and will not be continued in order to end the program. We hope that the education sector will not miss this preferential opportunity.

Free Dental Treatment from the Director of the China Dental Protection Institute, Ying Yongfeng wrote: "In previous Children's Days, our hospital provided free treatment for children's dental diseases. This year, we will still uphold our original intention and provide free diagnosis and treatment of dental diseases from April 1st to 10th for those with "Residential Certificates." No registration fee will be charged. Address: Ningbo Road, Jiangxi Road, Dinhongda Heng Building, 3rd Floor."
