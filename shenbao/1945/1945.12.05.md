### The National Army Has Obtained Airlift Support, Advancing in Multiple Routes to Panshan and Beizhen

[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] Chinese aviation personnel, making their first flight over the Northeast, landed a C-46 American aircraft at Jinzhou Airport today, carrying two and a half tons of ammunition for Du Yuming's rapid deployment forces. It is reported that these rapid deployment forces arrived today at Panshan, 75 li south of Goubangzi. Reports indicate that more planes, flown by Chinese personnel, will successively arrive in Jinzhou. Vice Admiral Barbey, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, concluded two days of discussions in Jinzhou with Chinese government leaders yesterday and has returned to Huludao. It is rumored that the discussions concerned the continued advancement of the National Army into North China and the Northeast. Chinese newspapers report that one route of the National Army has reached Panshan, between Goubangzi and the Yingkou railway, and another has reached Beizhen, 69 li northeast of Goubangzi. The National Army, having occupied Dahushan, is reportedly advancing eastward in two routes, one rapidly heading towards Xinmin, 129 li northwest of Dahushan, and the other advancing towards Liaozhong, 144 li southwest of Shenyang.

[United Press, Jinzhou, 4th] Northeast Security Commander General Du Yuming announced today that eleven Curtis transport planes, flown by Chinese pilots, arrived yesterday carrying over 20 tons of supplies. With the air support, the National Army's morale is greatly boosted. The vanguard of the National Army has broken through to within 90 li of Shenyang, while the main forces are 390 li away. However, according to Du, the National Army will not immediately enter Shenyang until the Soviet forces have completed the occupation negotiations or confirmed their withdrawal, and only after the Communist forces within the city have been eliminated.

[Additional Dispatch] Yesterday, the National Army suddenly launched a surprise attack on insurgents at the nearby airport, seizing seventy airplanes previously held by the Japanese. At the time, the aircraft were in a state of readiness, as the Communists intended to utilize them, and the National Army launched a sudden attack. Meanwhile, according to news from Harbin, the Chinese Communist forces still possess more aircraft and are planning to use them to attack General Du Yuming's forces. Du's forces continue to receive reinforcements from the National Army landing at Qinhuangdao, but they lack air power. When reporters inquired about this, Du replied, "Why use a butcher knife to kill a chicken? The current battle is like killing a chicken; there's no need for a butcher knife."

[United Press, Beiping, 4th] Shi Zhiren, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Transportation for the Beiping-Tianjin Area, recently returned from an inspection of Shanhaiguan and reported that the National Army is advancing smoothly towards Shenyang along the Beining Railway. Passenger and freight transport between Qinhuangdao and Jinzhou, 300 li north of Shanhaiguan, has been fully restored. However, due to a shortage of tires, there is only one round trip per day for the time being.

### British Construction of Airport in Kowloon Causes Great Concern in China

[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] The British construction of a large-scale airport in Kowloon has aroused great concern among Chinese circles here. Semi-official Chinese sources indicate that modernized long-range bombers based at the airport would be able to fly to any location in China.

### Current Task of the Textile Association: Taking Over Enemy and Puppet Factories, Some to be Handed Over to Private Management

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 4th] A responsible person from the Textile Industry Management Committee stated: The current task of the Committee is to directly manage and take over enemy and puppet cotton yarn, American wool, silk, and textile businesses. As for the takeover of enemy and puppet factories, it is planned to hand over some of them to private management, but a transitional period is required, as the work of pricing machinery and conducting technical reviews is quite time-consuming. It is also learned that there were 57 textile factories during the war, 32 large-scale and 25 small-scale, with a total of 270,000 spindles. Full operation could produce 182,000 bales of cotton yarn annually, with monthly output of over 10,000 bales. During the war, due to a shortage of raw materials, only 140,000 spindles were in operation. Currently, the furnace system has been liberated, but the use of costs is too high, and there is no sign of improvement.

All legitimate taxes will be paid as usual, and it will not monopolize various raw materials. If it is necessary to negotiate prices, an evaluation committee will be formed, inviting private enterprises to participate in the negotiations.

### Editorial: An Advice to the Chinese Communist Party

A few days ago, Minister Wu of the Central Propaganda Department told a Reuters reporter, "The Communist Party has the intention of dividing China into two." At first glance, we seem unable to believe it, yet we cannot help but believe it. As the declaration of sixteen cultural groups in Chongqing rightly states, construction comes first, nation-building comes first; support unification, oppose division. We believe that as long as someone is Chinese, they would all desire this. Moreover, the Communist Party often calls for democracy, peace, and unity, so to say that they intend to divide the hard-won victory of China into two seems contrary to human nature. However, observing the Communist Party's military actions in recent years, especially in recent months, and inferring from the talk of Communist Army Chief of Staff Ye Jianying preparing for ten years of war, what Minister Wu has surmised may not be entirely unfounded. The country belongs to everyone, jointly owned by the people; it is neither the exclusive possession of the Kuomintang alone, nor is it for the Communist Party alone to divide. At this critical juncture, we wish to stand in the position of the press and offer a few words of advice to the Chinese Communist Party on behalf of the people with complete goodwill.

First, political parties can have political disputes, but they must not have military disputes. This is the common practice of democratic countries. Moreover, China needs to grow in the cradle of democracy, and the people after the war yearn for rest and recuperation. At this time, the first priority of any political party is nothing more than how to enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, abandoning peaceful political disputes and embracing armed rebellion, no matter how many good-sounding terms are used, will never win the support of the people. The Communist Party's style in Jiangxi before the war and the remnants of their 25,000-li flight have made the people turn pale at the mention of "Communism." It was not easy for the opportunity to resist Japan to arrive, and the Communist Party voluntarily united to resist the enemy. The government was also able to be magnanimous. During the eight years, although there were inevitably some frictions, they were able to barely tolerate each other for the sake of the country because of the great enemy at hand. The Communist Party also somewhat regretted its past mistakes, loudly proclaiming "the Sinicization of Marxism-Leninism," and striving to win the sympathy of the Chinese people in terms of political measures and ideological propaganda. We, the people, originally had no prejudices. From the people coming and going from Yan'an, we also somewhat acknowledged that the Communist Party had some vitality and some new methods, and therefore pinned our hopes on it. For the Communist Party's sake, the victory of the war against Japan was a great opportunity for them to win national sympathy. The Kuomintang had already announced the abolition of party branches in the military as a preliminary implementation of the nationalization of the military. The Communist Party should have seized this opportunity to release its military power and return the army to the country. Arguing about how many divisions to reorganize already seems narrow-minded. Moreover, the previously agreed upon Three-Man Committee to study the reorganization of the Communist army was delayed for months due to Mr. Ye Jianying's late arrival, achieving nothing. How will they explain this to the people? The Communist Party abandons its strengths in political disputes and prefers to use its weaknesses in military disputes, so that even if the people had some sympathy for the Communist Party in the past few years, they will now lose it all. This is most regrettable. It must be known that the Chinese people, on the surface, are the most gentle and powerless, but in reality, their sense of right and wrong is the strongest and most powerful. We, the common people, have always been generous and can forgive other disputes between political parties, but we will certainly consider those who willingly undermine unification and divide China as public enemies of the people and criminals of the country. Mao Zedong may have understood this intention of the people during his stay in Chongqing, so he loudly called for supporting the National Government and supporting Chairman Chiang. But why, as soon as he returned to Yan'an, did the Communist army everywhere obstruct the National Government from sending troops to accept the surrender, and everywhere obstruct the implementation of Chairman Chiang's orders? Such acts of separatist rebellion do not seem like something done by a large political party that wishes to build a democratic China, and it will never gain the widespread and sincere love of the general public. Therefore, even if not for the sake of the country, but only for the sake of the Communist Party, the Communist Party should change its course, hand over military power, abandon military disputes, and devote itself to competing with the Kuomintang in ideological propaganda and political measures. Only then can it have a future. Otherwise, the Communist Party will isolate itself from the people!

Second, a government cannot stand without the trust of the people. Whether in ancient times or today, whether in China or abroad, in order to accomplish something in the position of government, one must first gain the belief of the people. This is true when a political party is in power, and it is no less true when it is in opposition. "Even thieves have a code of conduct," let alone a political party? The value of a political party should not be judged solely by whether it is in power. Those in power are not necessarily all right; those out of power are not necessarily all wrong. If those in power can fulfill their duties in power, and those out of power can fulfill their responsibilities of oversight, then political governance will be enlightened, and they will complement each other. Therefore, from the perspective of the Chinese people today, it would be better for the Communist Party to temporarily settle in opposition and exercise fair and impartial oversight, rather than insist on jumping onto the stage and joining the ranks of those in power. This would benefit the country and be welcomed by the people. If, because of not having a share in power and failing to compete for it, they resort to taking risks, raising troops and making trouble, then that is a re-enactment of the old drama of warlords splitting the country in Chinese history, and not a new style of political parties in modern democratic countries. This is truly the worst strategy. Moreover, for a political party to gain the trust of the people, it is most important to honor its political promises. It is difficult for the people to see through whether the blank checks issued when a party is in opposition will be cashed in the future, so it is easier for an opposition party to develop than a ruling party. Today, the Communist Party in China happens to be taking advantage of this. Unfortunately, the Communist Party does not know how to take advantage of the situation and first establish its own credibility. The Communist Party today is issuing checks on the one hand and bouncing them on the other. The more bad checks, the more the people will suspect and dislike it. The Communist Party clamors every day that the National Army is launching a civil war and that they are liberating the people. But the people are not all simpletons, and the eyes and ears of the world cannot be covered by one hand. Who is obstructing the orders of the Supreme Commander? Who is attacking the National Army that is ordered to accept the surrender? Who is attacking the National Army and seizing cities and towns everywhere throughout the country, from eastern Guangdong in the south to Suiyuan and Chahar in the north? As General Fu Zuoyi said, who is hitting whom and who is being hit can be easily discerned on a map. The Communist Party denies that it is an armed political party on the one hand, but on the other hand, it demands the expansion of armed forces in every negotiation, and calls it the army of the people. The Communist Party shouts loudly against civil war on the one hand, but on the other hand, its chief of staff publicly declares that it is preparing for ten years of war. How can this gain the trust of the people? It has been said that the elders in Jiangnan tell a joke that the Communist Party and the Communist Army have so-called "three things" wherever they go, that is, the people initially "nod their heads," then "shake their heads," and finally "kowtow" (or they may be killed if they don't kowtow). Therefore, the actions of the Communist Party in various places are still inseparable from the means of first inducing and then coercing. It is not difficult to imagine that the people in the so-called "liberated areas" have not been "liberated" from their suffering. We believe that instead of using their minds and efforts to compete with the government for the size of territory and the number of troops, the Communist Party should suddenly wake up, "lay down the butcher knife," and compete with the people for sympathy and belief. It must be known that if sympathy accumulates, and belief lasts for a long time, then the day of winning a political dispute may come. If one does not think from this fundamental point, and only knows how to occupy territory with troops, one will inevitably not escape the fate of "those who go against Heaven perish."

In short, China today does not allow any party or any person to undermine unification and destroy the fruits of victory. Fortunately, the Political Consultative Conference is about to be convened. Whatever brilliant ideas the Communist Party has, it can be taken to the conference by its representatives for discussion and voting. It must not be perfunctory at the conference and cause trouble on the battlefield. Westerners often say, "Put your cards on the table." We hope that truly patriotic and reasonable Communists will also learn from the style of political parties in these democratic countries, and immediately order a halt to military operations in various places that attack the National Army and obstruct the surrender. All issues will be left to the Political Consultative Conference for a fair resolution. Whether the future of China is a blessing or a curse, and whether the future of the Communist Party is a gain or a loss, all depends on the thoughts of the Communist Party leaders and their followers at this time.

### Western Lake Sculpture

— Xu Changlin

Beyond the mountains, green mountains; beyond the buildings, more buildings.
When will the hatred of eight years be over?

I grew up by the West Lake since I was little. For over twenty years, I have never left her nurturing. When the War of Resistance broke out, I moved to Sichuan. During the eight years of living in a foreign land, I missed the lake and mountains every day, hoping they were safe and sound.

This time, with the arrival of victory, I came to Shanghai. Without telling any friends, I quietly returned to my hometown alone to visit her after eight years of separation. As I gradually approached her from Yingzi Road, the joy in my heart was beyond description.

She was still so calm, so beautiful, and so bright. But who would have thought that she had suffered eight years of enemy trampling?

Like a highly cultivated saint, even if she suffered humiliation every day, her appearance was still serene. But when you get along with her carefully, you will find that her damaged and insulted heart is so sad!

The following is what I heard from her during a week of being with her:

In the past, her beautiful skirt hem—the Lakeside Park—is now desolate. Many trees have been chopped down, and the bright and tidy cream-colored light bulbs on the street lamps have disappeared. There are overgrown rocks and weeds. The statue of Martyr Chen Yingshi is rusty. Although the Martyrs' Memorial Tower still points heroically to the sky, the boatmen told me that the statue of the martyr had been buried at the bottom of the lake for eight years, replaced by a "East Asia Peace" bell. Since the recent iron reality shattered the dream of "East Asia Peace," the souls of the martyrs were rescued from the seabed by the hands of the National Army and the hands of the people, and re-established on the glorious throne.

In the past, the "Emerald Embankment in Spring Dawn," with its red peach blossoms and green willows, has had all its peach trees cut down. The remaining cypress trees are also broken and bent. "Broken Bridge with Lingering Snow" has actually become "Broken Tiles and Broken Walls." The magnificent gates and bridges of the Expo are nowhere to be found, so tourists can no longer enjoy the pleasure of strolling from Gushan to the West Lake Auditorium.

Speaking of the West Lake Auditorium, it is really sad. Except for the marble steps in front of the door, everything else was demolished by the Japanese army.

Yue Fei's tomb is still intact, and the horizontal plaque of "Loyalty and Patriotism" is even more striking in front of tourists. The body of Qin Hui, who will be infamous for ten thousand years, is even more broken and rusty, and the surroundings are stinky. The traitors of the past are even more ashamed to raise their heads in front of the loyal soul of Yue Wu Mu. The essence of Lingyin Temple, the Arhat Hall, has been reduced to ashes. Pious men and women can no longer explore their fate in front of the fifty Arhats. The insects on Feilai Peak are piled up, and the One-Line Sky is full of spider webs. The fish in Yuquan Pond have been shot and killed by the Japanese army, so there are no fish to watch at "Flower Harbor Viewing Fish." On the Tianzhu Road, which used to be full of incense candles, pedestrians are rare, and there are few monks in the temple, but many beggars.

The ancient trees towering into the sky in the Li'an Temple, and the bamboo-lined Yunqi, have all been shaved into monks' and nuns' heads. Only miscellaneous trees and weeds remain. Pedestrians are even more rare in Jiuxi and Eighteen Streams, and the waterways are mostly silted up. Weeds entangle the feet on the roads in the Shiwu Cave and Water Music Cave areas, which shows that very few tourists have visited in the past eight years. The pavilions where lovers used to come and go in Santanyinyue are no longer visible, only the Gongyuan Mound and Huxin Pavilion stand alone in the heart of the lake.

The Inner West Lake and Xiaonan Lake are blocked by weeds, and boats have to cut grass to move forward. For eight years, the enemy army has blockaded the Inner West Lake, and machine guns have been placed under the six bridges on Su Causeway (namely: Dongpo Bridge, Yadi Bridge, Wangshan Bridge, Yingbo Bridge, Kuahong Bridge, and Suolan Bridge). Pedestrians are occasionally shot and killed if they are not careful.

As for the famous villas on the lake, such as Liu Zhuang, in Zhuang, Jiang Zhuang, and Kang Zhuang, not only were the doors, windows, and walls removed and burned as firewood, but even the lawns in the villas have been gnawed by enemy horses for eight years, and seedlings can no longer be regenerated.

The thorns and weeds on the tomb of Master Manshu are taller than a person. There are few visitors in front of "A Heart on Lonely Hill" and "Releasing Crane Pavilion."

Looking around the West Lake, the scenery is completely different. Only the lights and candles in the Wealth God Hall on Gushan are shining brightly, completely renewed. The gold ingots in the hall are piled up, all of which have been offered by the new dignitaries in the past eight years.

Spending a week with the West Lake, I heard her mournful complaints every day, and my heart was cut like a knife. Now that the lost land has been recovered and the lake and mountains have regained their glory, but when I think of the enemy bandits and traitors who ravaged the holy land and Buddhist kingdom for eight years, they are still at large and have not received due punishment. I cannot help but quote an old poem:

Saying:——

"Beyond the mountains, green mountains; beyond the buildings, more buildings.
When will the hatred of eight years be over?"

Chen Qida confessed that he was induced by the communist Jiang Kai with money and official positions, and was given hand grenades to follow his command. Liu Youzhi confessed that he was lured by Chen Qida. Another Chen Yunlou was also an unemployed soldier and was also bewitched.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Hold Meeting Today to Publicly Hear Important Report from Hurley; Thorough Investigation of State Department Personnel to Be Conducted

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided to hold a public meeting on Wednesday to hear evidence from former US Ambassador to China Patrick Hurley on the attacks on US career diplomacy. It is expected that Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson will also attend. According to the committee, after Hurley presents his evidence, if necessary, the new US Ambassador to China, General of the Army George Marshall, may also be invited to present evidence. Afterwards, Hurley will also attend a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] US Senator H. Alexander Smith said that before General of the Army George Marshall goes to China to take office, he may be asked to announce in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee what he intends to do in China.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] US Representative Karl Mundt, a member of the US Congressional Committee to Investigate Actions Against US Interests, said that after hearing Hurley's report, the committee will begin a full and comprehensive investigation of the State Department. The method of investigation will depend on what Hurley tells us about the situation of the communists in the diplomatic community. We want to know who Hurley is accusing, and we especially want to know how these people are undermining our foreign policy and what methods they are using. Mundt personally believes that the saboteurs of foreign policy (pro-communist personnel) may be lurking among the lower-level personnel of the State Department. We suspect that these pro-communist diplomats are intentionally changing the reports sent from overseas before submitting them to higher-level personnel. Mundt said at the end that the reports that General of the Army George Marshall previously sent from China had apparently experienced the above situation.

[United Press, Kansas City, 3rd] Former Commander of the US Air Force in the China Theater, Major General Claire Chennault, said today that the matter of former Ambassador to China Patrick Hurley's accusation that permanent diplomatic officials were obstructing US foreign policy should be thoroughly investigated. When asked whether General of the Army George Marshall's appointment as special envoy to China could make China unified and prosperous, Chennault replied, "The most capable people have done their best on this issue, but they have failed."

### Future of the Pacific: US Navy Must Be Prepared; Defenses Are Being Strengthened Across 60,000 Miles

[United Press, Manila, 4th] The military activity off the coast of the Philippines proves that the United States does not want to fall into a state of unpreparedness again, at least in the Philippines. Although the naval plan is still secret, discerning people can see that a series of bases stretching 60,000 miles from California across the Pacific to the Asian border are being deployed. Commander Cothron, Commander of the Philippine Sea Defense, agrees to discuss the elimination of countless smaller bases, but the Naval Engineering Corps is expanding other bases. The Navy has relocated the entire city of Olongapo to a new location in Subic Bay on the northern tip of the Bataan Peninsula. Naval equipment and engineering in Lingayen Gulf and San Fernando have also begun. The largest naval facility in the Philippines is said to control the two main routes through the Gulf from Tagantaban to the central Philippines. How the former Japanese naval bases Davao and Cebu will be used has not yet been revealed.

### US Army Chief of Staff: General of the Army Eisenhower Assumed Office Yesterday

### General of the Army Mountbatten Calls Generals Meeting to Discuss Dutch East Indies Issue

[Reuters, Batavia, 4th] Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, Lord Mountbatten, summoned Dutch East Indies Allied Commander General Christison and Rear Admiral Patterson to Singapore on Wednesday for talks. Deputy Governor-General Van Mook of the Dutch East Indies may also participate. Negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia may also be held here soon.

### Iranian Prime Minister Prepares to Hold Separate Negotiations with Soviet Union; 30,000 Soviet Troops Currently in Northern Iran; Withdrawal Not Possible Until March of Next Year

[Reuters, Tehran, 4th] The government of Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi is in a precarious situation under the pressure of internal and external affairs. It is learned that Prime Minister Hakimi intends to hold separate negotiations with the Soviet Union on the Soviet Union's requests for concessions to oil exploration rights, the dismissal of anti-Soviet cabinet members, and the expulsion of anti-Soviet political party leaders. Senior political figures believe that if these demands are implemented one by one, it will be a major victory for Soviet diplomacy, and British and American diplomacy will inevitably be humiliated.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] The US State Department announced that the Soviet Union has rejected the US proposal for the complete withdrawal of Allied forces from Iran two months ago. However, the Soviet response stated that it would fulfill the guarantee it made in the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty, which stipulates that the deadline for foreign troops to withdraw from Iran is March 2 of next year. According to well-informed sources here, Tehran hopes that the troops sent to northern Iran will not exceed 1,000, and even if the original 6,000 troops stationed in northern Iran are included, it will be no more than 7,000. Moreover, the former Soviet troops stationed there numbered about 30,000, and this small number does not seem to be a sufficient reason for the Soviet Union to increase troops to northern Iran.

### Japanese Overseas Assets; Estimated Value of 110 Billion Yen; Will Be Used to Compensate War Debts

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Former Japanese Finance Minister Ishizuka told reporters today that, according to his estimates, Japan's total assets in the Northeast Nine Provinces of China, Mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, South Karafuto, and various regions of the South Pacific are worth approximately 110 billion Japanese yen.

### British Government to Announce Policy on India; Delegation to Be Sent to India for Inspection

[Reuters, London, 4th] British policy on India will be announced this afternoon by Lord President of the Council Herbert Morrison and Secretary of State for India Lord Pethick-Lawrence in both the upper and lower houses of Parliament, respectively. It is expected that what will be announced this time is not a new policy, but a statement of existing policy. However, it will state what steps are planned to be taken after the elections in India in order to advance constitutional issues. No one has yet suggested a debate on the Indian issue. However, after the government releases its policy today, questions may still be raised. If the public wishes to submit the matter to debate, the government will also consider it. Political figures expect that the government will recommend sending a delegation of representatives from various parties in Parliament to India for inspection, possibly during the Indian elections.

[Reuters, New York, 4th] British Labour Party Chairman Harold Laski said at a dinner here last night: "The British Labour Party government should not only declare its desire to see a free and autonomous India, but should also create the conditions necessary to realize this desire. I admit that this is a rigorous test of the sincerity of the British Labour Party government."

### International Judge Selection Issue Resolved; Australian Representative's Suggestion Rejected

### Trial of Japanese War Criminals: Keenan Flies to Tokyo; Mutaguchi and Toyota Both Admit Responsibility for the War

[United Press, San Francisco, 3rd] Joseph Keenan, the US chief prosecutor for the trial of Japanese war criminals, is scheduled to fly to Tokyo today with 22 prosecutors and 18 clerks. Keenan will divide Japanese war criminals into the following three categories: (1) Those responsible for launching the Pacific and China wars. (2) Those responsible for military crimes in violation of the rules of war. (3) Those responsible for the abuse of prisoners of war. According to Keenan, the initiation of the war began with the attack on Pearl Harbor, US territory, so the war criminals will be tried in accordance with US criminal law.

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Former Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Forces Mutaguchi Renya told United Press reporters today: "During my tenure as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China, I was responsible for all combat situations. I had anticipated this, and I am also aware of my responsibility for the war."

Konoe Cannot Escape Legal Sanctions

Another dispatch: Asahi Shimbun reported today that former Commander of the Combined Fleet Toyoda Soemu told reporters, "The Pacific War was an extension of the China Incident. I am truly one of those who should be held responsible for the war." Therefore, it is best not to speak about the responsibilities of others. But what can be said is that if the Tojo cabinet bears responsibility for the Pacific War, then the Konoe cabinet must bear responsibility for the China Incident. The China Incident happened two weeks after I returned to Japan. I still regret it to this day. Japan fell into the quagmire at that time."

### Kim Koo Government Formed, To Be Considered Legal Government of Korea

New Research by American Scientists: Generating Atomic Energy with Cosmic Rays

[US News Agency, New York, 3rd] O'Neill recently wrote in the New York Herald Tribune that "scientists are now exploring a method to extract large amounts of atomic energy from light gas." O'Neill stated: "If this method succeeds, the amount of atomic energy obtained from light gas will be a thousand times greater than from other sources. Light gas is the raw material that sustains the incandescence of stars and the sun, and it is the most abundant substance in the universe."

Scientists hope to discover a method to completely convert light gas atoms into "energy." If one pound of transformed gas atoms is completely converted into energy, it can generate the equivalent of 113.5 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

"The method of transforming light gas into atomic energy seems to attract more attention than the method of extracting atomic energy from 'uranium.'"

Professor Wheeler of Princeton University, who actively participated in the "uranium" project, recently reviewed the problem of utilizing light gas. He believes that the key to converting all light gas material into energy lies in the protons in the atom. Protons are the core of light gas atoms, surrounded by a large number of electrons, but these electrons do not hinder the work of transforming matter into energy.

"Dr. Wheeler plans to use cosmic rays as a tool to break through the core of light gas. There is a particle in cosmic rays called 'meson.' 'Mesons' are emitted when a cosmic ray radiation (photon) impacts a proton. However, 'mesons' often disappear before reaching the ground, and the reason for their disappearance has not yet been discovered.

"Cosmic rays that produce 'mesons' have a voltage of tens of millions of volts. According to Dr. Wheeler, this voltage is sufficient to transform matter into energy and more."

Overseas Chinese Casualties in Surabaya are Numerous

[Central News Agency, Surabaya, 1st (Special Telegram)] The deaths and injuries of innocent overseas Chinese in Surabaya due to the war are extremely numerous. This tragedy has now ended, and law and order have been restored. However, the Allied forces' power in other areas, such as Bandung and Semarang, is not uniform and are beyond reach, and similar losses will still occur. Two days before the Allied forces launched their offensive, most Dutch, Europeans, and some Indians and Arabs were evacuated by sea and air, but no overseas Chinese were evacuated. Around noon on November 9th, Allied aircraft dropped warning leaflets, which did not mention asking overseas Chinese to evacuate Surabaya. Neither side in the fighting suggested establishing a non-combatant safe zone. In the initial shelling by Allied forces in early June, overseas Chinese suffered heavy losses. After representatives of overseas Chinese explained the situation on November 15th, the Allied artillery fire gradually decreased.

### Southwest Associated University News: Seeking Knowledge from a Miserable Environment; Preparing to Restore Schools After the End of the War

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] After the end of the war, the universities that moved inland are preparing to restore their schools and return to their old sites eight years ago. Some have already returned to their original locations. This ancient cultural country has unfortunately been devastated by the war, but the youth's spirit of seeking knowledge, despite hunger and poverty, is still maintained.

Joint Organization

Kunming Southwest Associated University was formed by the joint efforts of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University in Beiping. School affairs are managed through consultations between the presidents of the three universities. The president of Peking University is Hu Shi, the former ambassador to the United States. Mr. Hu is currently in London and is expected to return to China in March next year. Zhang Boling, the founder and president of Nankai University, is currently in Chongqing and serves as a senator. Mei Yiqi, the president of Tsinghua University, graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the United States.

Long Trek

These three universities moved inland in mid-summer of the 26th year. Thousands of students walked south along dusty highways, carrying only a few textbooks with them. In early October of that year, their first batch arrived in Changsha after walking more than 2,000 li, and a temporary school was established there. After three months, the Japanese army invaded, and they had to move again, and then trekked to Kunming. Another large number of professors and students went to Vietnam by detour. In August of the 27th year, they finally opened classes on the Kunming plateau and were no longer afraid of the Japanese army's invasion.

Simple School Buildings

It is difficult to describe the simplicity of the school buildings of the Associated University. Even today, the walls are still temporary and the ground is all dirt. Students disregard all kinds of difficulties and seek knowledge in such a miserable environment, which can be said to be unprecedented. However, the school still maintains extremely high standards. Those who come to study are all excellent children.

Will Return to Original Sites

The schools of the Associated University plan to return to their old sites in the spring or mid-summer of next year, respectively. During the war, they were occupied by the Japanese army and used as convalescent homes for wounded soldiers. Peking University was robbed by the enemy and puppets and renamed Peking University. The buildings of these two schools have not been damaged. However, the Nankai University school buildings in Tianjin have been completely destroyed by enemy aircraft. Currently, the most difficult thing for the schools is to re-purchase the instruments, equipment, and textbooks lost during the war. The central government will provide assistance in the form of loans or gifts.

### Nanjing-Shanghai District Guidance Committee Handles Educational Restoration

[This City News] The educational and cultural institutions in the recovered area urgently need to be taken over and reorganized. It is learned that the Ministry of Education has decided to divide the country into six districts and establish educational restoration guidance committees to be responsible for handling the matter. This has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Jiang Fuzong has been appointed as the special commissioner of the Nanjing-Shanghai District Educational Restoration Guidance Committee, and Xu Bingkun, Zheng Zhenduo, Ma Xulun, Liu Guojun, Liu Shaozhong, Ye Fenghu, Zhou Junshi, and Xie Feng have been appointed as members to handle the takeover and restoration of educational and cultural institutions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other provinces and cities. Local military and political leaders in the guidance area will provide guidance and assistance.

### Municipal Education Association Rectification Committee Assists in Educational Restoration

[This City News] The Shanghai Municipal Education Association Rectification Committee is actively carrying out the rectification of education associations in various districts. It will soon handle the registration of members and solicit new members, hoping to establish the municipal education association in the shortest possible time. It is learned that the association is also assisting the authorities in the city's restoration and is actively promoting the schools. Recently, it has also launched a loan movement to rescue out-of-school children. Recently, due to disputes over school buildings, the progress of educational restoration has been hindered. The association has led the way. For example, the private Mingde Girls' Middle School, whose school buildings were occupied by a traitorous Han traitor, has been ordered to move out by the bureau, but it has ignored the order. The association has investigated the truth and supported the authorities, requesting that the occupying traitors be brought to justice as soon as possible and ordered to move out of the school buildings so that the school can be restored as soon as possible and benefit the revival of education. As for the use of the school buildings of the Municipal Gezhi Middle School by the Health Bureau and the use of the school buildings of the Municipal North Middle School by the Central China Railway Management Committee, they have not been returned to this day, so that the school cannot be restored as soon as possible, and more than a thousand students have sacrificed their studies. At this time, when the country is just beginning to be built, education is the most important thing, and such a phenomenon should not occur. The association also pays great attention to this and hopes that the authorities will make proper arrangements as soon as possible to resolve it reasonably.

### Basketball Friendly Match: Youning A Team Defeats US Military Police; Haiqing Forcefully Takes Youning B

The Sino-American basketball friendly match held by the Municipal Party Headquarters was held in the Zhongqing Basketball Hall last night, and the audience was extremely large. In the first game, the US Marine Corps fought Youning B. Youning B was a prototype of the Green Forest. In yesterday's battle against the Marine Corps, it was able to use its characteristics to deal with it. Although the overall result was that the Marine Corps defeated the Green Forest by 43 to 40, the closeness of the score showed the intensity of the competition.

The second game was Youning A against the US Military Police team. The US military's strength was only average. Youning A was the foundation of Chengyou, with the addition of the famous player Ma Canxi. After the start of the game, Youning A took the lead, winning the first half by 28 to 20. In the second half, the US military police tried to counterattack, but Youning A's steadiness was not taken advantage of, and they were finally able to overcome the US military police team by 51 to 47.

### Three Methods Should be Implemented in University Education

— Huang Heqing

Recently, I read Mr. Hu Xiansu's "Political Transformation and Educational Transformation" article, which vividly describes the shortcomings of China's current education system. His arguments are very insightful, and the transformation plan he proposed for schools at all levels is also worthy of review by those who care about education, and is not comparable to those who are merely passive critics. Now, I will introduce his relevant parts of the university education.

Mr. Hu believes that there are three methods that must be universally implemented in university education:

(1) University students should generally be divided into ordinary students and high-achieving students. The same course. If high-achieving students are willing to study further, they must be given special guidance by professors. In British and American universities, in addition to ordinary university students, there are also some who choose "honor" courses. The content of their reading and research, and the standards for assessing their grades, are much higher than those of ordinary students. Their graduation diplomas are specially marked with honor words, such as Cum Laude and Magna Cum Lauo, to encourage them. This system is extremely effective. If there are unusually outstanding talents, the country must give them special education.

(2) There is also a "free elective" system, which is also practiced in European and American universities. Anyone who graduates from a qualified middle school, or who is too old to need a degree, can enter the university to freely select courses.

(3) Universities should run correspondence or broadcast education to prepare for those who cannot or do not want to enter the university due to various reasons. They can also consider giving correspondence students graduation certificates to help them find employment. Soviet universities pay great attention to enabling workers to take university courses in order to popularize university education. Universities in our country should also imitate this.

According to the above three methods, the "free education" system is adopted. The first method can enable students with superior intelligence to fully receive the guidance of good teachers, and will not be allowed to advance and retreat with mediocre students who are not satisfied, and bury their extraordinary talents. The second method can give older students the opportunity to study further. The third method can give those who cannot enter the university due to space and time constraints the convenience of studying. In the ancient Taixue and the academy system since the Song and Ming Dynasties in China, these flexible teaching methods were still able to cultivate many famous scholars and political leaders. If universities today can adopt these methods, then compared to merely using graduation diplomas as a stepping stone to advancement, or imparting rigid knowledge in a monotonous classroom life, the effectiveness will be more than doubled!

### Property Forcibly Seized by the Enemy and Puppets Can Be Registered with the Handling Bureau for Return After Verification

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Since the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau began receiving and handling the property of the enemy, puppets, and German expatriates, a large number of people have come to register and apply for the return of their property. All property belonging to the enemy, puppets, and German expatriates will be confiscated entirely by the Handling Bureau. It is currently being sorted and categorized before being entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and fourteen other agencies for safekeeping and management. As for property belonging to citizens that was forcibly taken by the enemy and puppets, citizens can register with the Handling Bureau with evidence, and it will be returned after verification. However, the handling methods for real estate or other property that was forcibly purchased from citizens by the enemy and puppets are still under investigation. It will be determined whether to return the property or not based on a comparison between the market price of the property at the time and the selling price. If the whereabouts of items such as automobiles cannot be traced, citizens can register at the special office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, providing detailed information about the vehicle's engine and cylinder numbers to identify the current owner and negotiate for its return.

It is reported that the investigation of German expatriate property is being conducted very accurately. They have all prepared detailed registers to be submitted to the Handling Bureau for processing. Any German expatriate property that has not yet been taken into internment camps will be handled in the same way after they enter the camps.

The real estate received by the Central Trust Bureau will be leased and sold according to various circumstances. In addition to central government agencies having priority, ordinary residents can also request to rent or buy.

Furthermore, the enemy and puppet property received by the Third Front Army Headquarters has now all been handed over to the Bureau for handling, and no further separate processing will be conducted.

### Deliberations Underway for Reasonable Measures for Recognizing Enemy and Puppet Factories

The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee held its sixteenth meeting on [date], passing twenty proposals. It is reported that reasonable measures were discussed regarding preferential treatment for rear-area industrialists who contributed to the war of resistance to participate in the bidding for enemy and puppet factories. Consultations will be held with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Wartime Production Bureau to implement these measures. Furthermore, the price of goods in the city has been falling daily since the Handling Bureau supplied a large number of goods at reasonable prices several times. It has now been decided to quickly clear the materials stored in sealed warehouses and continue to sell them at reasonable prices. The fourth batch of fabrics and the second batch of matches, among other goods, will be supplied at reasonable prices in the near future, with prices expected to be even lower than before. In addition, factories resuming operations are allowed to use their existing raw materials, except for coal, which is under the unified control of the Fuel Management Committee. However, each factory must prepare a detailed register and submit it for approval, undertaking to comply with the prices approved by the government in the future. Finished products in the factories are also allowed to be sold, with government agencies having priority in purchasing. The proceeds from the sales will be deposited into a special account at the Central Bank. It is reported that the Handling Bureau will simplify the processing procedures by individually interviewing applicants and having legal advisors and representatives from relevant agencies participate. This way, application cases can be resolved immediately, avoiding delays caused by official correspondence.

### Stored Good Materials Are Frequently Stolen

Recently, alarming incidents have occurred in the warehouses taken over by the city. For example, customs personnel have been stopping [illegible], or privately removing materials, and there was even a strange fire in the North Station warehouse, among other incidents. At the sixteenth Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee meeting, a certain committee member reported that a major theft occurred in three warehouses that had already been taken over in mid-last month. On the night of the eleventh, armed thugs even broke into one of the larger warehouses with machine guns, stealing materials stored there. It is hoped that the authorities will promptly investigate and severely punish such incidents.

### Military, Police, and Gendarmes Working Together to Maintain Public Order and the People's Defense Corps Could Reach 10,000

The recent frequent occurrences of robbery cases in the city have caused great anxiety among citizens. The issue of public security during this winter season is extremely important. This newspaper's reporters have interviewed various military, police, and gendarmerie agencies in recent days and have obtained much news that can reassure readers. This news is presented below:

Post-war Shanghai, like other recovered cities, faces the challenge that large numbers of firearms left among the people, as well as the activities of scattered gendarmes, can disrupt and undermine public order at any time. Of course, the increase in unemployment and the inability to control prices also affect public security.

The Songhu Garrison Command is the highest authority responsible for maintaining public order in the city. After several days of consultations with relevant police parties, it has already decided on the steps to be taken. Deputy Commander Li told reporters, "We not only want to make the urban areas peaceful, but also the surrounding areas. To strengthen our forces, we have decided to coordinate with the newly established [illegible] General Corps. I believe this force is sufficient to deal with everything. As for civilian firearms, those used for legitimate defense can be licensed. If they are deliberately [illegible], they will be punished by military law once found. I hope the press will urge citizens to go to the police station for registration as soon as possible. Finally, Li also told reporters that the headquarters has organized a joint military-police-gendarmerie patrol team, divided into five zones, patrolling daily and nightly in shifts. Anyone encountered who is acting suspiciously or whose uniform is not proper will be questioned, inspected, or arrested at any time."

Shen Wanqian, commander of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment, told reporters, "This regiment will do its best to assist in maintaining public order within the scope set by the Garrison Command. However, I hope that addressing the root causes is even more important than addressing the symptoms. However, such work is indeed difficult at present."

Although robbery cases occur from time to time, the police bureau has solved many of them and quite quickly. However, for the convenience of the authorities' investigation, it is not appropriate to disclose them here. Recently, the police bureau has been intensifying efforts to improve the Baojia organization. The city is divided into 33 districts, and there will be a major investigation of the population during the period of enemy and puppet occupation and recently. This reporter believes that this investigation will be of great help to public security.

Here, the reporter will introduce the newly established People's Defense General Corps. The current commander, Rong Youlue, is a famous general who bravely defended Weiyang for 46 days. Since the corps was prepared and established by the Shanghai Municipal Defense Committee, it has been divided into two types of members: regular members and volunteer members. Volunteer members include former Baojia members from before the war and members of the merchant corps from the former concessions, who have been investigated, reviewed, and admitted to the corps. There are currently 2,000 to 3,000 people. By the end of this month, combined with the regular members, there will be about 10,000 people. However, they are entirely people's self-defense organizations, and their mission is only to assist the military and police in maintaining local public order.

Finally, a piece of good news for the people in the suburbs of the city: the Zhejiang-Shanghai Garrison Command has begun to work with the garrison troops, coming to your area. "L"

### Over Two Thousand Men and Women Leave Shanghai as the First Batch of Japanese Repatriates Return Home Yesterday, the "Meiyu Maru" is Expected to Sail to Shanghai Again Around Mid-Month

The first batch of 2,185 Japanese repatriates were concentrated at Shanghai University the day before yesterday to undergo inspection. They began boarding the Meiyu Maru yesterday morning at 8:00 AM to return to Japan. Large luggage and women, children, and the sick and weak were transported by truck to the Qiujiang Wharf.

Zou, Deputy Director, Inspects the Japanese Prisoner-of-War Concentration Area

The Shanghai Japanese Repatriation Office, having been ordered to also handle prisoners of war in the Beijing-Shanghai area, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Director Wang specially sent Deputy Director Zou [illegible] to inspect the Matsui headquarters in the Japanese prisoner-of-war concentration area on Jiangwan Road. They were greeted by Japanese Commander Lieutenant General Matsui and Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Doi. Zou [illegible] inquired in detail about the concentration situation of prisoners of war along the Beijing-Shanghai line and gave many instructions on the issue of education for the concentrated prisoners of war. According to Doi, the department has been ordered by the Chinese government to strictly prevent soldiers from escaping, so each concentration camp still maintains its original organization and hierarchical control. They also requested that the hundreds of [illegible] soldiers in the department be managed separately. It is learned that our Japanese Repatriation Office has decided to convene the original unit commanders of the prisoners of war on the Beijing-Shanghai line for a briefing within the next few days and issue a control plan, assigning personnel to be responsible for management.

Summary of Commander Tang's Address

Commander Tang attended the Japanese Self-Government Association yesterday morning and delivered an address to the Japanese who will be returning to their country one after another. He stated, "Over the past eight years, from the Lugouqiao Incident to the Japanese surrender, the pain we have suffered is beyond the imagination of the Japanese. The erroneous idea of the so-called 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' should be thoroughly corrected. In the future, we should jointly maintain world peace with truth, faith, benevolence, love, and peace."

The first batch of over 2,000 Japanese repatriates set off yesterday, carrying luggage and queuing up to board the ship.

### US 315th Supply Squadron to Set Out to Return Home Today After a Ten-Million-Mile Journey and Receiving Five Medals

The US Air Force's 315th Supply Squadron, which transported giant US B29 bombers to China, is scheduled to set out to return home today. Commander C. O. Righter announced the squadron's work from 1942 to today. The squadron's members left the country in the fall of 1942 and, in 40 months, [illegible] provided aircraft and supplies to the 9th, 12th, 14th, and 20th Air Forces across the three continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia. At the outbreak of the war with Britain and Germany, it was the only US Air Force supply squadron to assist the British Air Force. It came to China in 1944 and was stationed in Chengdu. At that time, the B29 aircraft used by the 14th Air Force to bomb Japan were supplied by the squadron. They had worked in England, Egypt, Sicily, and Italy, traveling tens of millions of miles and earning the reputation of being a traveling air force squadron. The squadron received a total of five service medals, three of which were for their achievements in fighting in the Middle East, and the other two for their work in Italy and supplying the Flying Tigers (i.e., the 14th Air Force) and B29s. Now, this historic work has come to an end. As Colonel C. O. Righter said, "We have achieved victory in the most difficult circumstances. Today we can return home as we wished."

### Gas Allowance Limit

It is expected that once the new measures are implemented, fuel savings will be considerable, and the prices of coal, firewood, and other goods will tend to fall accordingly.

### The Minlian Ship, Encountering a Dispute in Zhenjiang, Finally Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, with Some Passengers Disembarking in Nanjing

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Minsheng Company's Minlian ship arrived at the Bund Wharf here yesterday at 2:30 PM. It is reported that it carried over 1,000 passengers, most of whom were employees of the United States Information Service and their families. Some passengers had already disembarked in Nanjing. The Minlian ship sailed from Chongqing to Shanghai on the 22nd of last month, taking a total of 13 days. Regarding the dispute that arose in Zhenjiang, the truth is as follows: The Minlian ship sailed east from Chongqing without incident until it reached Zhenjiang, where some naval personnel wanted to approach the ship. There were already military police escorting the ship, and it was nighttime, making it difficult to distinguish in the dark. For defensive purposes, an order was issued not to approach, or they would be shot. However, the naval personnel ignored this and continued to advance, so they were shot at from the ship, injuring a certain deputy captain. At four o'clock the next morning, as the ship was about to set sail, it was inspected by a large number of naval personnel who wanted to detain the ship. After repeated explanations of the misunderstanding by the ship and the responsible parties of the US Information Service, a resolution was reached. That evening, it docked in Jiangyin, so its arrival in Shanghai was delayed until yesterday afternoon.

### The New Fourth Army Runs Rampant in Jiangnan

Zhao Quan, the Communist "district chief" of the suburban area of Wuxi County, believing that Zhu Tukui, the township chief of Chaoyin Township in Dongting District of the county, was ineffective in collecting military grain and lenient, sent three Communist soldiers on the night of November 21st to drag Zhu Shikui out of his home and shoot [illegible] him in a wheat field. In addition, the Communist Party's Chaozhou County Government of the Sixth Administrative District of Suzhong, because the people in its jurisdiction were not cooperating with the Communist army and the Loyalist Salvation Army, which was active in the area, was constantly attacking, forced the formulation of the most vicious Baojia joint liability measures. "Whoever harms the lives and property of military and political personnel of the 'New Fourth Army' and their families, the individual, their family, and the jointly liable Baojia households will be punished. In serious cases, they must compensate for life and property." It attempts to use high-pressure tactics to stabilize the "controlled area". In addition, Qian Bosun, the puppet county magistrate of Changshu, Chen Zhenhua, the head of the county police corps, Ling Xiuying, the secretary, and Zhao Quanzhi, the head of the section, led over 300 demobilized soldiers and robbed huge amounts of grain, coarse cloth, cotton, etc., and transported them to northern Jiangsu. Before leaving, they also killed Zhang Zhiyun, Zhao Keqi, Hu Yuezhen, Pan Xinguang, and Xu [surname], among others. It is reported that Zhu Ying, the deputy commander of the puppet guard, and Jiang Qisheng, the people's movement instructor, are still secretly active in Dongxiang, Changshu.

### Many Still Hesitant About Land Registration; Authorities Explain Significance of Consolidation; Unclaimed Properties Will Be Managed on Behalf of Owners After Deadline

Since the Municipal Land Administration Bureau initiated land registration work last month, a considerable amount of time has elapsed. To understand the progress of land administration work, our reporter interviewed Mayor Qian and Land Administration Bureau Director Chen, who made the following statements:

#### Mayor Qian on the Significance of Consolidation

Mayor Qian stated: "This city has suffered years of disturbance by enemies and puppets, leading to a collapse of discipline, particularly in land administration. Since the Land Administration Bureau began consolidation, it has, last month, initiated land registration for ownership, transfer, alteration, and other rights in the six districts of Huangpu, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Hunan, Caojing, and Fahua. Simultaneously, to address land registration disorder in other areas, changes in land rights, and the loss of documents, we are implementing land transfer tax collection. The essence of initiating this registration and collection work is to consolidate land registration and ensure the property rights of owners. If registration is not completed by the deadline, the Land Administration Bureau will, according to the law, manage the properties on behalf of the owners. We hope citizens will not neglect this. Furthermore, regarding real estate used by municipal administrative, military, and police agencies, municipal public properties, and properties of various charitable organizations, we hope that all will be registered with the Land Administration Bureau to gradually consolidate land ownership, achieve equal land rights, and allow citizens to share in the benefits."

#### Chen Shiquan on Registration Procedures

The reporter then interviewed Director Chen Shiquan, who stated: Since the land registration work began, many owners have enthusiastically applied for registration, but many remain hesitant. The reason, it seems, is a lack of understanding of the registration procedures. When the reporter asked about the registration procedures and the points requiring registration, he received the following detailed answers:

(1) For ownership registration, transfer registration, alteration registration, and renewal of ownership certificates, properties located in the former Special District One (i.e., Huangpu District), Yinxiang District, and Zhabei District should be applied for at the First Registration Office at 66 Zhapu Road. Properties located in the former Special District Two (i.e., Huangpu District) and Fahua District should be applied for directly at the Second Registration Office at 71 Zhongzheng West Road (i.e., Daxi Road). Properties located in Hunan and Caojing Districts should be applied for at the Third Registration Office at 72 Shangwen Road.

(2) Provisional registration, cancellation registration, objection registration, and collection matters outside the registration area should be applied for at the bureau's office on Madang Road.

(3) For land in the aforementioned six districts for which ownership certificates were obtained before the war, and where there has been no transfer of rights, and those who obtained land occupancy permits before the war, with no disputes or transfers, there is no need to register; they can directly apply for renewal of their land ownership certificates.

(4) Those who did not obtain ownership certificates or occupancy permits before the war, and those who registered before the war but whose rights have been transferred, as well as Chinese citizens holding perpetual lease contracts or Dao contracts in the names of foreign firms, with attached right certificates, must apply for ownership and transfer registration within two months.

(5) If there are surface rights, easements, perpetual tenancy rights, pawn rights, or mortgage rights established before applying for ownership registration, registration of these other rights should be applied for during the public announcement period.

(6) All registrations and documents issued by enemy puppet organizations during the occupation period of the city are invalid and must be re-registered.

(7) For land or permanent structures in districts outside the above-mentioned registration areas, all transfers should be subject to transfer tax collection. If documents are completely lost due to the war, or if documents are lost, a guarantee can be obtained and, after verification and survey, a replacement contract can be applied for to manage the property.

### American Military Vehicle Causes Accident

Xiang Yong, of the Third War Area Press Liaison Group, was waiting for a tram at the Paobujiaochang tram stop on Nanjing Road at approximately 6:00 PM last night when he was struck by an American military truck speeding by. He fell to the ground, and the wheels ran over his back, causing severe injuries. He was subsequently taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by garrison troops.

Also, at approximately 7:00 PM last night, an American military jeep, number 8839, was traveling west on Xinzha Road from the east. When it reached the entrance to Da Tong Road's Sisili, it struck a rickshaw due to excessive speed. The entire rickshaw was destroyed, and the rickshaw puller, Mei Fa, suffered severe abdominal injuries. At the same time, six street vendors and coolies, namely Xu Chunyuan, Ji Laosan, Dong Xiaozhu, Zhou Ruichun, Huang Sanbao, and Zhang Er, were also affected and injured. Garrison police summoned an ambulance to transport them to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the Xincheng Branch Bureau, together with the American military police, went to the scene of the accident to investigate the cause of the accident for further handling.

### Ten Robbers From Gaodun Street Transferred to Prosecutor's Office for Prosecution

At the end of last month, five or six robbers armed with weapons broke into the home of Zhao Houfu, a Zhenjiang native living at 64 Gaodun Street in Nanshi, robbing gold jewelry, counterfeit money totaling five million yuan, etc. The police were notified and pursued them. The next morning, Li Ruiguo, Wang Jinbao, and Dai Zongheng were arrested at the Waitan Observatory Wharf. They confessed that their accomplices were Li Changyu and He Rongshan, who were also arrested. It was then learned that the main criminals, Zhang Mengquan, Xie Fangqing, and Yan Acheng, had not only robbed Zhao's residence but had also robbed the Hongda Cigarette Paper Store at 26 Yanhai Road on the 19th of last month, stealing a large amount of clothing and accessories, and had also robbed the Anlin Department Store at 170 North Sichuan Road, stealing gold ingots and diamond rings. Cai Ligong and Gu Yindi (wife of the main criminal Zhang Mengquan) were arrested separately. Subsequently, Yu Hongchuan was arrested at the North Station. He confessed that he had entrusted Yun Minsheng to sell gold chains and gold ingots. You was then arrested and brought out one tael and seven qian and three fen of gold ingots and one gold chain (three qian and four fen). Finally, Gu Erdu and Wan Deming, two accomplices who had helped to sell the stolen goods, were arrested. Apart from You Minsheng, who was allowed to be temporarily released on bail pending summons, the other ten male and female robbers were investigated and yesterday transferred to the prosecutor's office for prosecution on charges of robbery.

### Ordering Large Quantities of Telephones Not Timely At Present

Recently, rumors have been circulating in the city that the Shanghai Telephone Company has ordered a large number of telephones from the United States. The company has issued a statement stating that this is not entirely accurate. The company is currently working hard to improve the installation and service of telephones. Within the possible scope, the company will consider taking appropriate steps to purchase from overseas, but the time is not right at present. As for the rumored 900,000 sets and six-digit numbers, this is clearly hearsay.

### Wanhe Trucking Company Robbed

Seven or eight robbers broke into the Wanhe Trucking Company at 4 Tongzhi Fang, Taoyuan Road, at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 3rd). They threatened people with guns, first locking the people downstairs upstairs, then tying up the owner, Wu Wanyu, in a chair, and arbitrarily searching and robbing.

### Social Services: Fundraising for Student Aid with Sino-American Basketball Game; Preparations Complete

Our newspaper and Tongde Medical College are jointly organizing a Sino-American basketball game to raise funds for student aid. All preparations are largely complete. The game dates are scheduled for December 12, 15, and 16, three days, with two games each evening starting at 7:30 PM, at the Zhonghua Sports Ground on Albert Road (formerly known as Huiliqiu Ground). Invited teams include Allied American Military Police Team, Navy Team, and Air Force Team. Our teams are the Hualian Team and the Zhongqing Team. Mr. Zhang Weixiang has been running around contacting them for days, taking great pains. It is said that the persons in charge of the Allied teams very much support the charity game for student aid. In order to help the students, they are willing to show their skills and do their part for the poor students. This kindness, I know, will be greatly appreciated by the thousands of students who will be helped!

Tickets for the charity game are divided into two types: 400 yuan and 3,000 yuan. The former will be sold at the door, while the latter will be jointly sent by our newspaper and Tongde to enthusiastic people from all walks of life to do their best to purchase them. We also ask students from various universities to actively promote sales in the hopes of obtaining more ticket funds and saving more students who have dropped out of school, which is also cultivating more talents for the country. I believe that those who understand the general principles will definitely provide great assistance.

### Talking About Painting From Outside the Door

— Zhang Shifang

Although I am not an insider in painting, I am, like most knowledgeable people, quite interested in looking at paintings, especially cartoons. As the world has become more and more slippery, I have deeply loved them for many years. Later, I had the opportunity to often view the works of European and American cartoonists, and I became even more deeply aware that they were sharp spears against the darkness, and I developed from an interest-based love into a reverence for weapons of justice.

I believe that the reason why cartoons have failed to exert their power in the course of the Anti-Japanese War is not only because the cartoonists' skills and knowledge are not enough, but also because the cartoonists are shoddy in their work and technically lazy and opportunistic.

I have found the biggest shortcomings in many drawings. For example, the people drawn in the paintings really cannot make people call them "people" - even a cow or a dog on the screen will make people unable to recognize it as a "cow" or a "dog". Because the heads of those people are often rectangular placed horizontally on the so-called necks, and the hands are like two pieces of wood straight. What kind of art is this? I think it should be A drawing by a child.

This kind of cartoon sometimes makes people feel nauseous. When some friends talk about Chinese cartoons, they often point out this shortcoming. I think cartoonists are definitely not incapable of drawing people like people, but they just want to create them arbitrarily, perhaps thinking it is to be unique, but what impression does it give the reader besides bad? In addition, when creating a cartoon, they are unwilling to put in a little more thought, which leads to stereotypes and uniformity. This has caused a fatal injury to the still weak cartoon.

In order to hope that it will not only not die young, but will also grow strong from now on, I want to write down two external opinions on cartoon authors.

(1) You must draw people like people. To take a step back, you must always draw a person who is not too far away from the human race. This requires cartoon authors to work hard on their skills and abandon the bad habit of creating arbitrarily.

(2) You need to think more. Think more about the composition, the meaning, and the subject matter. Cartoons are a kind of art that needs to be mixed with deep meaning. This cannot but require cartoonists to cultivate various kinds of knowledge other than painting.

Finally, what needs to be specially mentioned is that the low cartoon fees should be a major objective reason why cartoon authors have to produce shoddy products. How to make the reward for a work completed by a cartoonist in one or two weeks or even one or two months enough to maintain life for one or two weeks or even one or two months? This is what I want to appeal to loudly for cartoonists.

The times have changed again, and at the same time, we are very concerned about the direction of the cartoonists' pens in the future. Some people may feel that this direction is difficult to choose, but there is one sentence that I think can still be applied, that is, "the country first" and "the people first". If all our cultural workers can stick to these two sentences, the direction of our "pens" and even "debating skills" will not be wrong.

### Debating "Going to the Public Hungry"

— Shi Dongshan

Brother ××: I have read your opinion and I agree with it in general; it's just that I disagree with the "sermon" about "civil servants should not care about treatment under the current prices". It is impossible to "serve the public" when "hungry". For example, with a burden like mine - three sons of secondary school level must continue to study, a young daughter who has just been weaned, and an older daughter fostered in the distance, how can I have enough money every month? It's too far off. You want to separate people's hearts from material relations and forcibly pull them from the good side, but on the other hand, there is a practical force that pulls people's hearts back, and you cannot resist it. Therefore, a wise writer never fights nature hard. Fortunately, this is not the theme of your work, and the reader will forget it after reading it. Otherwise, you will be cursed.

I believe that except for people who are subjectively unsound and who deserve to die, no one can escape the influence of the objective material environment. Psychologists of any school have to admit the formula of "stimulus-perception-thought (or emotion, feeling)".

My opinion may be wrong, because I just drank a lot of wine and I am a little excited.

### Su Wu Tune

— Gu Yiqiao

For ten years I held the Han scepter, sent to distant lands, my heart longing for home as the sun sets, my sorrow entrusted to herding sheep. The north sea wind is cold and tight; the snow on the Tianshan mountains flies high. Mountains and seas separate me from central China, my thoughts linger endlessly! When rams lose their wool, the wool grows back again, but the tassel of my scepter withers day by day, falling and breaking my heart. The ram leaves its flock, secretly pours out its heart, who grieves for the lost traveler? I look around in confusion, the bright moon shines, I look up and down in boundless vastness, I do not see the flow of the Jiang and Han rivers, but only see the clouds soaring. The four seasons change again and again, new frost adds to my temples, I sadly think of my homeland, when will I see my king? Year after year I guard the Han scepter, far away in distant lands - my heart longing for home is cut off by the setting sun, herding sheep in the desolate borderlands. I drink cold ice shavings when thirsty; I eat cold snowflakes when hungry, when will this wandering end? Tears wet my clothes!

### Our Whereabouts

— Hu Yuzhi

We are troubled by not knowing the situation of our relatives and friends in China, so we ask you to disclose this letter for contact. Our communication address is: 24 North Bridge Road, Singapore. We hope that relatives and friends in China will call or write to the above address. Jointly announced by Hu Yuzhi, Shen Ziji, and Wang Renshu (November 12)

### About Bai Wei

— Meng Yun

Editor: The news about female writer Bai Wei must be noted by the people of Shanghai. Indeed, she has not met the people of Shanghai for many years, like Bing Xin and Bing Ying. At least, her works have. Bing Ying has now left Sichuan and is compiling a supplement to the Peace Daily in Hankou. Bing Xin still lives in Chongqing. As for Bai Wei, actually even the people of Chongqing have not been very clear about her situation for many years. This is a misfortune. I firmly believe that she is simple and genuine, only that her works have been less in these years, and everyone seems to not pay attention. There are also people who do not understand her and have some misunderstandings about her, but I like Bai Wei, this writer, this flower-like character.

Also because of loneliness, her life is indeed poorer than other female writers. I cannot describe her. In the future, she will eventually have an autobiography that tells the world in detail. There is only one sentence that can be reported to everyone: that is, although she is poor, her pride is more genuine than those writers who shout slogans. Therefore, she refuses all kinds of writer relief funds. Once she even angrily tore up a 5,000 yuan check in public. Bai Wei, I like her!

### Broken Wing

— An E

The broken wing of a "red plaster" machine, sits limply on our land. It is said that this is the wing of an enemy plane that was shot down last time. The fuselage is still being searched for. From its broken scars, we can know that the people inside the plane have long dreamed of returning to their hometown! But do we think this is worth being proud of? No! We, the peace-loving Chinese nation, have never been willing to kill people, but can I not kill him? Can we let him run rampant in the sky, bombing our cities, villages, soldiers, and compatriots? If we tolerate this, we are traitors to the nation, traitors! We are unworthy of the blue sky and white sun above, and unworthy of the suffering ancestors below; therefore, we must do our best to eliminate them! Drive them out of China, even out of the world! We do not allow such demons in the human race with sincere hearts and hot blood!

Conversely, if our national soldier is killing the enemy in the air, and we on the ground are unintentionally hindering him, then what should we call this person? There are countless examples like this in the Anti-Japanese War.

As long as we think of the hardships of those soldiers in the sky and on the ground, as well as the tragic situation of tens of millions of compatriots who have been trampled on by the Japanese devils, can we still remain indifferent? It is certainly gratifying to shoot down the enemy's plane, but the blood and sweat of our soldiers must also not be forgotten! We mourn the death of our soldiers, but at the same time, we hate the Japanese warlords for ruining the crimes of their people! We hate even more those national scum who intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly, help the enemy!

### Beyond the Flying Goose Claw Doctrine

— Wu Renzhi

Ancient poets liked to make free and easy words. The world likes elegance, and mistakenly believes that elegance must be free and easy. So the free and easy poisoned people, deeply and severely. In recent years, this trend has subsided slightly, but occasionally because of the love of rhetoric and the use of allusions, it is inevitable to fall into this set without realizing it. It is common to see the cover of photo albums and name lists titled "Snow Mud Flying Goose Claw," which is one example.

Su Shi's poem: "Where is life like? It should be a flying goose stepping on snow mud. Accidental footprints are left on the mud, where will the goose go again?"

The origin of "Snow Mud Flying Goose Claw" originally comes from this. This poem is unrestrained and beautiful, and many people love to chant it, but if you savor the meaning of the words carefully, its irresponsibility in dealing with the world is fully expressed in the words "accidentally where will it go again"! If you comment that "it has poisoned all living beings, who would say it is not propaganda?"

Someone said that the strange fires in the warehouse two days ago are also a great manifestation of the "Flying Goose Claw" spirit. I could not help but nod in agreement. However, after careful review, it is not so. The generation of "Flying Goose Claw" doctrine is free and easy and irresponsible. And the person in charge of the warehouse is desperately clinging to it but still irresponsible. Or call it "Beyond the Flying Goose Claw Doctrine", which is almost it!

"Beyond the Flying Goose Claw Doctrine" abounds, so it is said that "it has poisoned all living beings". And the victims are millions of citizens, so it is also said that "it has harmed all living beings". Alas, all living beings, will there be no one left?

Commercial News

### Gold Price Continues to Fall

The various rumors reported yesterday had not been confirmed in the press as of this morning, so the market initially seemed stable. However, intense competition between bulls and bears ensued mid-session, leading to price fluctuations. Ultimately, the bulls were unable to sustain their position before the noon close, sparking panic and breaking through the 700,000 mark, reaching a low of 686,000. Subsequently, some bankers took the opportunity to buy at the lower price, allowing the price to stabilize. The bears also covered some of their short positions. In the afternoon, the price rebounded above 700,000, eventually settling around 700,000 with some margin. The final result was a decrease of 22,000 compared to the previous closing price. Silver ornaments were priced at 76,000, standard silver at 650, and silver dollars remained at 450-460. However, due to the lackluster performance of other commodities, they also appeared weak. The underground money market saw even fewer inquiries due to recent losses for those engaging in transactions, with rates settling around 10-13 cents.

Foreign currencies continued to weaken, but many sought to buy at the low prices, and influential investors were also absorbing them. The market was stable at the beginning, but later, trading houses and merchants began to sell off, increasing the pressure of actual goods. This ultimately suppressed buying interest, pushing the price below the 1,200 mark again. A major player, having previously bought a large amount of US dollars that were now unfrozen, no longer needed the physical currency and aggressively sold off, causing the price to drop to a low of 1,145 yuan. Later, with the rebound in the gold market, buying surged again, and the price eventually fluctuated around 1,180 yuan. The final result was a decrease of 35 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Hong Kong dollars once weakened along with US dollars and gold. Old banknotes fell to 190 yuan, and new banknotes fell to 62 yuan. However, they were able to recover some ground by the end of the day. The final result was a decrease of 10 yuan for old banknotes and 2 yuan for new banknotes. The buying price for Australian gold pounds fell to 2,600, and rupees to 222.

Government bonds were almost entirely one-sided yesterday, with outside retail investors painfully closing out their positions. The result was a further decrease of 65 yuan to 95 yuan compared to the previous day. Chinese stocks fell in tandem with gold bonds, and many long-term holders also sold off. Retail investors were unable to resist, resulting in a final loss of over 10%. Foreign stocks showed weakness with some stability. Although all declined, the drops were not significant, and strong investors absorbed a considerable amount at lower prices. With the listing of foreign exchange approaching, foreign merchants are becoming increasingly active, suggesting a potentially vibrant trend.

Grains: Yesterday, prices for all types of grains remained depressed. White japonica rice and white indica rice both continued to decrease by a small margin of 200-300 yuan. Lower-grade indica rice decreased by 500-600 yuan. White glutinous rice also fell by 600-700 yuan. Flour sales were sluggish, with a further decrease of over 200 yuan. Oil prices fell by a small margin of 1,000 yuan, as deliveries continued to surge and Shanghai factories also sold off. Soybeans were stagnant, continuing to decrease by 600-700 yuan. Soybean cake also decreased by a small margin of 200 yuan. The liquor market remained inactive, with prices decreasing by a small margin of 500 yuan, indicating a continued downward trend.

### Yarn and Cloth

Cotton cloth plummeted along with the gold price. Amidst a chorus of selling cries in the market, prices continued to decline. 20-count and 16-count fell by 30,000-40,000, and 42-count fell by 100,000. Buyers remained hesitant, resulting in very few transactions.

Dyes: There were many sellers, but customers were still expecting prices to fall further. Non-industry speculators, though painfully cutting losses, still saw buyers remaining hesitant, resulting in very few transactions. Auxiliary materials for dyeing exhibited a complete collapse, as orders for caustic soda and hydrosulfite were about to arrive in Shanghai. Sentiment was exceptionally weak, and the market is expected to decline further.

Coal Market: The coal market is gradually stabilizing, as prices have fallen sharply in recent days. Wealthy individuals are buying at lower prices, especially high-quality anthracite dust for factory use, which is in high demand. Although anthracite coal is arriving, it is only supplying public utilities. Demand for residential and factory use has not been met. The supply of firewood and charcoal continues to arrive, and traders are attempting to maintain original prices to account for costs.

Southern Goods: Because of increased arrivals, assorted dried longans (桂圓) saw sluggish sales and market prices have repeatedly loosened, decreasing by an estimated 30-40%. Yesterday, the opening price for more common dried longans was only 32,000 yuan. Even premium dried longans were very weak, with high-grade opening at 43,000 yuan and second-grade at less than 40,000 yuan. There were also offers of 35,000 yuan. The future market is still difficult to predict optimistically. It is also reported that there have been shipments from Wenzhou, so maintaining capital will be hard.
