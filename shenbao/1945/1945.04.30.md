### Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Coordinate Operations, Fiercely Attack Okinawa's Fleet, Enemy Casualties on the Main Island Reach 15,000

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – Enemy warships near Okinawa's main island currently consist of approximately 4-5 battleships, 10 cruisers, 15-20 destroyers, and 40-50 transport ships. Japanese special attack units are still fiercely attacking them. Japanese land artillery is also taking the opportunity to shell enemy warships. On the 27th, an attack was launched on enemy fleets west of Kadena, destroying and burning two large enemy transport ships, and a battleship was hit with bombs. Due to the coordinated attack by Japanese air and land forces, enemy naval artillery fire has gradually decreased. Furthermore, both the central and northern airfields have been hampered by Japanese air force and ground artillery fire. Previously, the enemy had 150 aircraft, but on the 26th, there were only about 60. Consequently, enemy naval and air power has weakened to an extent not seen in past Pacific campaigns. Moreover, since the enemy landing, the confirmed land battle results on Okinawa's main island alone, up to the 23rd, show that enemy troops suffered 15,000 casualties, and over 269 tanks were disabled and burned.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces in the southern part of Okinawa's main island launched a new offensive starting on the morning of the 26th. On the morning of the 28th, approximately 500 infantry and 20 tanks launched an attack on the area east of Kochi. Japanese forces destroyed four of their tanks, killed or wounded over 200 infantry soldiers, and repelled them. At approximately the same time, 500 enemy soldiers and over 50 tanks advanced westward towards the area between Maeda and Nakagusuku, encountering fierce resistance from Japanese forces and suffering heavy losses. On the sea, Japanese special attack units repeatedly attacked. On the 27th, at a little after 5:00 AM, a successful raid was launched on enemy warships, but the results have not yet been confirmed. Furthermore, at 9:45 PM that afternoon, a special attack unit that penetrated the waters off Kadena sunk a battleship or cruiser and three other ships of unspecified type. At 12:40 AM on the 28th, another transport ship was sunk near the Kerama Islands, and a cruiser and a transport ship were damaged. Naval special attack units also coordinated in the fierce attack. On the night of the 27th, a large 10,000-ton cargo ship fully loaded with tanks, vehicles, and other military supplies, which was part of an enemy transport convoy that penetrated the waters off Kadena, was sunk, along with about ten small boats floating among the cargo. In addition, a destroyer was sunk.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 28th, Japanese air force units attacked enemy land positions in the Kerama Islands, destroying tent camps and burning one flying boat. In addition, there were four major fires at the central airfield.

Ryukyu Islands Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – After the weather improved on the 28th, Japanese air force units, centered around special attack teams, continued to fiercely attack the enemy fleet around the main island, expanding their achievements. Details are still unclear. However, one unit of the air force that charged into the enemy fleet at dawn on the 28th destroyed two aircraft carriers, one battleship, and one transport ship.

### Weekly War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The following is a record of the war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia this week:

Mariana Islands Area: The enemy air force in the Mariana Islands is now completing its tactical air force, mobilizing small aircraft from Iwo Jima, and its sole mission is to restore the preparation capacity of its Kyushu bases, which have been attacked daily.

Philippines Area: Enemy forces in the Saraksak mountain range have suffered heavy casualties since February due to intense fighting with Japanese forces, but continue to attack stubbornly. Since the 21st, they have attacked Japanese positions southwest of Mount Imogan, east of the Saraksak mountain range. Japanese troops fought bravely and skillfully, crushing the attack. Furthermore, fierce battles are currently unfolding in the Balete mountain range and along the east-west line of the Minuli mountain range. Part of the enemy has invaded Japanese positions, and the Japanese garrison is engaged in fierce fighting with them. There are no major changes in other areas. Japanese forces are forcing the enemy to bleed through advancing assaults. The enemy is gradually expanding its territory in the central and southern Philippines in an attempt to establish bases and prepare for the next phase of operations.

Burma Area: The enemy armored units advancing south from the Mandalay Road passed through Pinmana on the 18th and advanced south. A portion of the enemy, possessing about 30 tanks, reached Myauk U on the 21st, and another portion appears to have entered Toungoo. At the same time, enemy forces on the Irrawaddy River front, in coordination with this, have also launched offensives since the beginning of the month. One part advanced eastward and reached Magway on the 19th, and invaded the Alanmyo area on the 20th. Japanese land forces are engaging in interception attacks and continuing to fight valiantly. The Japanese air force is also coordinating, attacking enemy armored units on the Mandalay Road, and destroying 180 vehicles on the 21st and 22nd.

Southwest Pacific Area: Enemy aircraft attacking the Borneo resource area repeatedly bomb and reconnoiter in formations of 20-30 planes. The enemy's intentions in this area require vigilance.

Okinawa Area: In the battles in the southern region, since the morning of the 26th, the enemy has concentrated intense ground artillery fire and naval gun fire on the vicinity of the central highlands. The enemy, possessing tanks and strong forces, began an offensive, but due to courageous counterattacks by Japanese forces, the new offensive was thwarted by the evening of the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, the enemy launched another offensive in the Kochi area west of the central highlands, the site of the previous day's fierce battle. Japanese units in the area engaged in interception attacks, smashing the enemy everywhere. East of Kochi, the enemy attacked from the Onaga area, approximately four kilometers northeast of Shuri, with about four tanks and 70 infantry soldiers at a little after 11:00 AM. They were met with intense machine-gun fire and assaults from the Japanese, suffered numerous casualties, and retreated to the area north of Kochi. West of Kochi, near Maeda and Nakagusuku, the enemy's offensive intensified. On the 27th, a part of them advanced south of Maeda and began to construct positions in the Maeda area due to Japanese counterattacks. Also, on the west coast, the enemy attacked the vicinity of Chatan with 2,500 to 3,000 infantry soldiers and over ten tanks, but their offensive was completely blocked by the courageous counterattacks of Japanese units. Currently, the total strength of the enemy on the front line is approximately 5,000 tank infantry.

### A Certain Warrant Officer Returning from the Front Lines Discusses the Fierce Battles of Okinawa's Military and Civilians

Soon after the American enemy landed on Okinawa's main island, they captured the northern and central airfields around April 5th. However, the Japanese garrison's fierce hand-to-hand combat did not abate in the slightest. Their courage in battle caused American soldiers to tremble; the intensity of their resistance caused the American army to bleed profusely. How are the Japanese forces defending Okinawa, and the island's residents, so resolutely repelling the American army, which relies on material quantities, amidst naval gun fire, air raids, and the rampage of heavy tanks? According to a certain warrant officer from Okinawa's main island, the situation is roughly as follows. The warrant officer left the island before the American landing for official business. What follows are the warrant officer's words:

Silence returned to the position. The sea and sky were dyed crimson, and the rising sun ascended from afar. It was morning. The naval gun fire that had lasted all night had finally stopped. It was a strangely quiet morning. The comrades who had been on alert all night were now sleeping soundly in the caves. The aerial warriors who had fiercely attacked enemy warships hours before were also resting peacefully, as if there had never been a fierce battle. This island is protected by this group of calm and daring warriors. Thinking of this, my chest burned with passion, and I could not help but bow towards the east. The heroic figures of these magnificent warriors are still clearly etched in my mind.

Naha City had already been reduced to ashes by the strafing of aircraft from the Grumman ships on October 10th of last year. The citizens, having undergone this trial, immediately utilized war training and fully armed themselves in both body and mind, preemptively preparing for the enemy's invasion of the Nansei Islands. Sure enough, on March 1st, a total of approximately 900 enemy carrier-based aircraft flew in to attack the entire island. The strafing and bombing that day were even more intense than on October 10th, but the island's residents were safe thanks to complete air-raid shelters. On that day, most of the island's anti-aircraft weaponry remained silent. Because after opening fire, even if dozens of enemy aircraft could be shot down, it would allow the enemy to discover the location of our positions. For this reason, we had to grit our teeth and endure without opening fire with anti-aircraft guns and fortress guns, waiting to unleash our power when the enemy landed.

On March 31st, when enemy forces landed on Kami Island and Mae Island, Okinawa's main island also came under intense naval gun fire. Having already experienced bombardments of 500-600 shells a day on several occasions, the island's citizens had long prepared how to deal with the enemy's landing operation. From morning to night, Grumman carrier-based aircraft relentlessly attacked the airfield and Naha City, strafing frantically. Shells fired from enemy warships constantly landed on the southern part of Okinawa Island. The rumbling of artillery fire continued from day to night, seemingly about to overturn the ground. However, in this tense scene that seemed to turn the world upside down, the soldiers and residents responded calmly and fought bravely.

Since October 10th of last year, all of the island's residents had devoted their full strength to assisting the military authorities, turning the entire island into a large fortress. Whether it was fortress positions or caves, they were all built by the residents one spadeful at a time, one basketful at a time. The women cooked yams in makeshift stoves and delivered them to the soldiers and labor service teams. Okinawa produces many yams, which can supplement the shortage of rice. Among the soldiers on this island are students from ○○ First Middle School, Second Middle School, ○○ Third Middle School, and ○○ Prefectural Agricultural School. Under enemy strafing and concentrated naval gun fire, the male students shouldered the important task of liaison, busily running back and forth. Female students from ○○ First Girls' High School, ○○ Second Girls' High School, ○○ Third Girls' High School, and ○○ Showa Girls' High School, all with white cloths wrapped around their heads, engaged in intense labor with hoes, spades, and baskets. Because most of their homes had been destroyed and many of their clothes had been lost, they each wore whatever clothing they could find and no longer wore uniform uniforms as before. However, their efforts remained the same. Moreover, they believed that eating white rice would affect military rations in an emergency, so they switched to eating yams. The fortress positions and caves built through the cooperation of the military and civilians became strongholds from March 31st, causing the enemy to bleed profusely. The shells fired from enemy warships had the same power as 25-kilogram bombs when they exploded, but there were hardly any deaths or injuries as a result, thanks to the strength of the caves.

On the airfield, under the command of a certain lieutenant colonel, special attack units had been dispatched for several days to fiercely attack enemy mobile units approaching the coast. When departing, the team members hoped to wrap white cloth around their heads, but unfortunately there was no cloth. And the farewell feast was only a bowl of soup and yam rice. However, no one felt dissatisfied. All were happy to sacrifice themselves for the country, smiling as they departed, and even thanking the friendly forces responsible for cover, saying that they were troubling them to come along. Sergeant A, who sunk an enemy aircraft carrier on the 28th, was one of the special attack unit members. Now, although enemy forces have invaded the northern and central airfields, the aerial warriors continue to sortie from other bases, establishing the great results announced by Imperial Headquarters.

Because I was ordered to leave Okinawa before the enemy landing to handle official business, I did not have the opportunity to participate in the interception battle. Today, that verdant island of Okinawa must have become a tragic battlefield. However, the military and civilians on the island must be fighting with all their might, and the hand-to-hand combat units will especially display their divine power. The hand-to-hand combat units are rigorously trained, organized into squads of several men, infiltrating enemy positions, using powerful explosives to obliterate key enemy points, and then launching a fierce attack on the panicked enemy troops, slicing and dicing them with steel swords and bayonets. This training in killing enemy soldiers has been going on for a long time. Even the island's residents have been directly instructed by the military in bayonet techniques, rigorously trained with bamboo spears. With the entire island of Okinawa becoming a fortress, and with such elite troops and islanders, it will certainly not fall into enemy hands easily. Moreover, there will be fierce typhoons in Okinawa in April, May, and June, so the opportunity to annihilate the enemy is before our eyes.

### A Perspective on the European War Situation

The European war situation in the past week has shifted rapidly, centered around the Battle of Berlin. Notable aspects include the Soviet encirclement of Berlin, the meeting of British, American, and Soviet forces on the Elbe River, and the changes in the northern Italian war situation, with Allied forces occupying cities such as Genoa. However, on the whole, the strategic significance of all these tactical movements for the entire European war is not as significant as most observers imagine. We should point out that these tactical movements have caused the European war situation to enter a new phase, but we should also point out that these movements do not mean the end of the European War.

First, looking at the battle for Berlin, the anti-Axis forces harbor an ambition for a quick victory, hoping to realize the meeting of British, American, and Soviet forces in Berlin, as decided at the Crimea Conference, and occupy it with a tripartite control commission. However, this plan has not yet been realized. British and American troops are still far from Berlin. With an unwavering determination to seize it, the Soviet army is advancing on a large scale, throwing 1.5 million troops from the two major fronts of Byelorussia and Ukraine into the fire pit of Berlin. In the overall strategy of the Allied nations, it is certainly not necessarily the final success, because it is questionable whether the Soviet army can make concessions to the British and Americans after suffering heavy sacrifices. Even from the Soviet army's strategy alone, the actual value of such a heavy sacrifice, and the adjustment and replenishment of forces on other fronts in the future, are also major problems. Moreover, the German forces in Berlin are still resisting, determined to shed their last drop of blood for the capital and never surrender.

Second, looking at the southern German front, although British, American, and Soviet troops have achieved a meeting, both sides are tired. On the front lines, there are many disputes over the division of operational areas and cooperation between the three armies; in the rear, German "Werewolf" units and the like are launching guerrilla warfare everywhere in the occupied areas. The anti-Axis forces that have penetrated deep into Germany may inevitably discover a day when they "cannot come back." As for the war situation in northern Italy, since the anti-Axis forces reached the banks of the Po River some time ago, rebels have occupied cities in Milan, Genoa, and other places, which of course cannot be counted as a victory for the anti-Axis forces. Moreover, northern Italy is mountainous and densely forested, and future operations will tend to be protracted.

Third, looking at the entire European war situation, the anti-Axis forces have had their forces divided everywhere in northern Italy, the German-Austrian region, and western and northern Germany. In each region, they must retain a large number of troops in order to maintain their occupation. Moreover, because the German people in the occupied areas are all long-trained and resist the enemy anytime and anywhere, the anti-Axis forces must continue to pay a large amount of supplies to support the occupation of these areas. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces must continue to pay a huge war effort to Europe, and their own power will inevitably weaken day by day. Even if a political and strategic split does not occur immediately among the three countries, their future is hardly optimistic.

Conversely, Germany, in the current situation of the enemy's deep penetration, has not shown signs of discouragement. Even if Berlin is occupied, the Germans will never lay down their weapons. Germany still has almost one-third of its territory, continues to maintain industrial zones with considerable combat power, coasts and harbors, and allies such as Denmark and Norway, and still has the conditions to persist in the war, making the enemy pay a double price for every inch of land. Therefore, it is too early to say that the European war situation is about to end.

As the European war situation enters a new phase, two points are particularly noteworthy: First, because the European war cannot be resolved quickly, the Crimea Conference strategy of the British, American, and Soviet nations can be said to have largely broken down, and the leaders of the three countries will inevitably gather again to discuss a new global strategy. Second, because the British, American, and Soviet nations must continue to pay war efforts to the occupied areas in Europe in order to maintain their occupation, no one can withdraw a large number of troops to other theaters. If the British and Americans want to withdraw troops to the East Asian theater, it is not even a possibility at this time. Not only that, but they must also continue to supply supplies from their own countries to maintain the occupied areas.

The entire world war situation is not trending towards an end, but towards a protracted war. Only those who can complete the total mobilization of the nation, concentrate all physical and mental strength on the decisive battle, can win the final victory. This is the direction in which we East Asian people should strive together today. Our country and people, in particular, should eliminate all illusions, face reality, and strengthen our struggle!

### Continuing Notes from the San Francisco Conference

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Reuter's report: United Press reports: The San Francisco Conference, under the guidance of the four foreign ministers, has begun its work. It is said that the U.S. delegation will propose revisions to the postwar treaties and the wartime political decisions regarding Poland. This is likely to be opposed by the Soviet Union. Currently, the Polish issue has been temporarily shelved, and the Soviet Union's request for three votes has been approved. Discussions on Argentina's participation in the conference have begun. The British delegation suggests the conference be limited to a maximum of one month. The establishment of the four foreign ministers' council has caused considerable surprise, as it was generally believed that they would hold informal meetings.

Their tank units are advancing towards Milan in two directions, so it is reported that Milan will be occupied soon. It is reported that US forces are approaching the city of Bergamo (50 kilometers northeast of Milan), and the important airfield near the city is also reported to have been occupied. The Milan radio station, controlled by rebels, claims that Turin has been liberated.

### Europe on the Hunger Line

Due to the extreme shortage of food, all parts of Europe are issuing distressed groans, especially in the occupied countries. These countries—namely France, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, etc.—are trapped in a state of deep hunger, pregnant with a very terrible crisis.

France's Food Shortage

Let's take a look at the situation in France first. According to the Reuters Paris dispatch of March 21st, Parisians have not been able to obtain a drop of oil for the past three months, and no one has been able to eat a slice of meat in these three weeks; although sugar ration coupons have been issued this week, it is still not possible to buy it. Citizens say that they fear that even bread will be gone in the near future. Most French families have been relying on cabbage and small amounts of potatoes to fill their stomachs for the past three months. The milk needed daily for infants, mothers, and patients in Paris is at least 500,000 liters, but the actual milk produced is less than 300,000 liters. Seven months after France was occupied, it has encountered the biggest food crisis since the start of the war. In order to overcome this increasingly deep and widespread hunger crisis, extraordinary measures are absolutely necessary. But worse, the current situation does not show any light in future predictions.

To endure this insufferable pain of food shortages, 5,000 women in Paris held a demonstration on March 20th, parading in formation. This situation is not limited to Paris, and has also affected major cities such as Lyon, Grenoble, and Annemasse. The tense state of domestic political affairs in France at that time was due in part to this.

Belgium and the Netherlands

The situation in Belgium is similar to that in France, but the current situation in the Netherlands is even worse. The Netherlands has not only suffered from war, but also from floods due to the implementation of flood tactics, and the situation is very dangerous. According to the Prime Minister of the Dutch government-in-exile in London, "The Netherlands has insufficient food for the next three months." According to him, Britons can take an average of 2,600 to 3,000 calories of food per day, while the average Dutchman takes less than 700 calories.

Britain Feels Anxious

Comprehensive information from various sources shows that the current nutritional standards in European countries are slightly less than 3,000 calories in Britain, about 500 calories in France and Belgium, and Italy and Norway are also on the verge of the same dangerous state as France. In the face of this terrible food difficulty, Britain is extremely anxious and has become nervous. On March 19th, the British New Statesman and Nation issued the following warning:

"Disappointed European countries will betray Britain and the United States after the war. The war will not end when Germany is defeated, but only when the suffering of Europe's food difficulties is completely eliminated."

The Times also said:

"In the near future, the real enemy of the Allied powers will not be Germany, but the lack of food, clothing, and housing in Europe. Now is the time to seek emergency measures."

Political Confrontation Between Britain and the United States

Due to the complete failure of Britain and the United States to supply food to Europe, they have naturally greatly disappointed European countries. And deep political antagonism has arisen between Britain and the United States as a result, and the tone of Britain and the United States blaming each other is becoming louder and louder. In mid-March, Washington broadcasted: "Britain is storing 700 million tons of food," and claimed: "In order to avoid frustrating the morale of the American public and soldiers, the American food authorities do not intend to further restrict the food of American citizens, so they are considering completely stopping the supply of food to Europe and Britain." The claim that 700 million tons of food was stored greatly astonished the British public. Therefore, Churchill formally stated Britain's position on the 21st of the same month, and tried hard to argue:

"Contrary to what the United States said, Britain's current food reserves are actually less than 6 million tons, and will be further reduced to 4.75 million tons from today to the end of June. This amount is the absolute minimum quantity absolutely necessary to supply the British people under the current rationing system."

On the same day, the London correspondent of the Swiss newspaper further conveyed the British government's public explanation as follows:

"Re-strengthening the restrictions on meat rationing will make the British people and soldiers angry, and in order to maintain the current level, there is no other way but for Britain to completely stop meat exports to Europe."

In short, in response to the attacks from the United States, the British government, through Churchill and Food Minister Lewellyn, argued that "the fact that European countries are on the verge of starvation is not Britain's fault."

Because the US government announced that it would reduce meat supplies to Britain by one-eighth from April, the British government and people were very indignant. This is because the food situation in Europe will be more difficult, and at the same time they know that Americans eat three times more meat than the British public's meat ration.

In addition to meat, other kinds of food are also much more abundant in the United States. For example, the ratio of milk is 49 in Britain and 64 in the United States, chicken is 19 to 28, eggs are 23 to 41, oil is 38 to 44, sugar is 65 to 84, and vegetables are 75 to 206. Another report stated: "Compared to last year's meat ration, British soldiers get 150 pounds, the British get 107 pounds, while American soldiers can get 300 pounds each."

It is true that the US food reserves are slowly decreasing now. Especially in the past few months, it has decreased a lot. But from the perspective of Europeans, it is really not possible to say that there is a lack of food for American citizens in the current situation, just as the current situation in Britain cannot be called wandering on the "hunger line". But the Anglo-American dispute with European hunger as the background is a very important issue in world politics. The deep food situation in Europe, from a political point of view, is a fatal threat to Anglo-American policy now and after the war. In view of this importance, British Deputy Prime Minister Attlee investigated the situation in Europe and made a lively discussion in the House of Commons. And Labour Party leader Greenwood declared on the 29th:

"If Europe is not sufficiently supplied with food now, then the Allied countries will face the biggest problem in history that has never been seen before. This is the biggest historical problem that has never been seen even when the Black Death came to Europe."

Because of Insufficient Ships

The next question that can be thought of is why the United States stopped supplying food to Europe. Stopping the supply is definitely not beneficial to the United States, because hungry Europe is very easy to turn red. Fearing the occurrence of this fact, Britain and the United States drafted a dream plan to try to organize the Allied Relief Committee. The result of this plan was a pipe dream; this is enough to prove that Britain and the United States cannot supply food to Europe.

The United States claims that the recent decline in food production in the United States is entirely due to labor shortages and the prosperity of wartime industry, but in reality, we believe that the fundamental reason is the lack of ships.

### Trade Associations to Establish Registration and Investigation Groups: To Prevent Member Manufacturers from Hoarding Materials

In order to actively promote economic measures, the Ministry of Industry has not only instructed the competent authorities of various provinces and cities to strengthen the industry trade associations and increase their powers, but also recently instructed the municipal government to instruct the municipal economic bureau to order each industry trade association to establish a registration and investigation group within each industry trade association, so that it can specialize in the investigation and registration of the entry and exit of materials of member manufacturers of each industry trade association. This move has profound significance for preventing hoarding, suppressing prices, and stabilizing people's livelihood. It is learned that after receiving the order, the Municipal Economic Bureau has instructed the competent sections to instruct each industry trade association to comply, and the section is actively studying the working rules of the group in order to provide timely guidance to each industry and to implement it as soon as possible.

### After the Authorities Crack Down on Speculation, Finance Will Move Towards the Right Track

The Industrial and Commercial Market Situation Last Week Was Still Relatively Stable

Since the beginning of this month, the financial market situation in Shanghai has been caused by the tension in the international situation, resulting in fluctuating prices of Shasha bonds and Chinese stocks. Especially speculators took advantage of the opportunity to engage in activities. Therefore, they spread baseless rumors to confuse people and engaged in the usual tricks of absorbing and selling, manipulating market prices to skyrocket and plummet, disrupting the entire financial system. Although the relevant economic agencies of this city were ordered by the National Government to conduct thorough investigations and crackdowns last week, the market situation has not been able to return to its past stable state.

On Monday of last week, the authorities began to strictly inspect financial trading methods. People's minds suddenly softened at that time. The rising price of Shasha bonds stopped, and the price of silver also showed a downward trend. There was little change in the price of public bonds, and the trend of Chinese stocks was uncertain. Popular stocks such as Meyer, Wing On Company, and yarn factories fell sharply and rebounded slightly, but the price of small stocks rose more and fell less, and there were even strange phenomena of several stocks hitting the limit. On Tuesday, the market situation turned small and the base was still stable, but the stock market was sluggish. On Wednesday, the trend turned into a big drop. The falling price of Shasha bonds generally made people feel uneasy. The price of silver suddenly fell by 2,000 yuan. The price of public bonds fell sharply, and the stock market fell sharply due to tight positions. The retail investors of general high-priced stocks were panicked. On Thursday, rumors of some favorable news for the bulls spread again, and people's minds recovered. The market situation was still flat in the morning, and in the afternoon, the price of Shasha bonds turned from falling to rising, and the trend was firm. The price of silver and public bonds also rebounded, and more than 20 kinds of Chinese stocks hit the limit. On Friday, due to looser money, foreign capital suddenly came to absorb heavily, and Shasha also saw a peak again. The rising trend of public bonds and silver was flat, but the rising trend of stocks was even stronger. 90 kinds of popular stocks and small stocks hit the limit, and the goal of most speculators was to transfer to stock trading. On Saturday morning, the overall market seemed to be stabilizing, and Shasha bonds and stocks rose first and then fell back. The prices of public bonds and silver were both flat and low. It is reported that the financial authorities are determined to strictly manage the Shanghai financial market and crack down on illegal transactions, so as to enforce the law and punish illegal speculators. It is expected that the business situation will move towards the right track in the future.

As for the situation of industry and commerce last week, it was still relatively stable. The prices of rice, miscellaneous grains, oil, sugar, and other daily necessities rose and fell very little. This is because transportation has become slightly more convenient than before, and the circulation of materials has become smoother. Under the strict restrictions of the economic authorities, the market price is not easy to raise. However, it is hoped that the relevant authorities will severely investigate and punish illegal merchants who hoard and manipulate market prices, regardless of their class, with a spirit of impartiality, so as to prevent prices from rising for no reason.

### Education Funds for April Released Today

The Education Bureau finalized the allocation of the city's education funds for April yesterday. Director Dai immediately instructed the relevant personnel to expedite the procedures. The funds are scheduled to be released starting from the 30th, distributed daily according to the distance of each school and institution's location. It is reported that on the 30th, funds will be released to municipal primary and secondary schools, normal schools, and social education institutions in the central, southern, central-northern, and western districts of Shanghai, as well as salaries for Japanese language teachers of Japanese nationality. On May 1st, funds will be released to municipal schools in the northeastern, northwestern, and southeastern districts of Shanghai. On the 2nd, funds will be released to municipal schools in the eastern and northeastern districts of Shanghai. The Bureau has also requested banks to provide cash as much as possible to meet the needs of the schools and institutions. All schools and institutions can prepare the necessary procedures for claiming the funds and arrive at the Bureau on time to claim them. At the same time, Director Dai, wishing to understand the current situation of each school and institution in order to provide specific guidance, will also summon the heads of each institution at that time to inquire about everything.

### Yesterday's Friendly Football Match: Football Association Wins Against Referees

Four to Two, Halftime Tied One to One

The friendly football match between the Football Association and the Referee Team was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. Because both sides were veterans, there were bound to be many tricks, so many people went to watch, and the atmosphere was lively. At first, the referees, led by Dai Linjing, had a strong offensive. Zhang Le shot in the midst of the chaos, but Ma Shan'er kicked the ball to save it. He scored an own goal due to momentary carelessness, with the Referees leading 1-0. The referees continued to attack aggressively, and the situation was tense. Fortunately, Li Ning and Zhuang Youren arrived in time to turn the danger into safety. Meng Nuo went straight in from the side and hit the bullseye, making it 1-1 at the end of the first half. The veteran soldiers were ultimately lacking in endurance. In the second half, both sides adjusted their troops and continued to fight. Zhang Le missed a sure shot. The Football Association's luck turned for the better, and Ma Shan'er scored. However, during that time, Wu Shouheng, in a moment of desperation, used his hand to save the ball and knocked it out of bounds. A Dai enforced the law strictly and ruled it as a lost goal, making it 2-1 to the Football Association. Afterwards, Huang Fengzhu advanced his troops in the middle and attacked the enemy's stronghold, making it 2-2 again, a tie game. Ma Shan'er overcame obstacles and scored, making it 3-2 to the Football Association again. Then, referee team's E Sen fouled Shen Siliang at the 20-yard mark. Zhuang Youren scored. After that, the referee team repeatedly moved their troops in an attempt to turn the tide, but the Football Association's defense was impregnable, and they ultimately failed. As a result, the Football Association defeated the referees 4-2, avenging last year's defeat.

Football Association: Zhou Jiaqi, Li Ning, Jie Laiti, Qian Weilie (off), Le Xiurong, Zhuang Youren, Jiang Yimen (on), Le Xiurong, Meng Nuo, Xuan Zhengzhu, Shen Siliang, Ma Shan'er, Cheng Yize, Si Tugen.

### Investigation of Huangpu Baojia District

— Liu Feng

The area covered by the Huangpu Baojia District is: bounded by the Huangpu River to the east, Shanxi Road to the west, the boundary of the South City to the south, and the Suzhou River to the north. The district was originally named the Central Baojia District. After adding the Fifth Joint Bao of the former French Concession's Mailan District and the Sixth Joint Bao of Xiaodongmen in July of the 33rd year [of the Republic], it was renamed the current name. The district currently has six joint baos, forty-eight baos, seven hundred and ninety-eight jia, with a total population of approximately 110,000. The chief of the joint bao is Mr. Wu Yunzhai, and the deputy chiefs of the joint bao are Mr. Shao Leping and Mr. Xiang Shengwu.

The Huangpu District has always been a model baojia district. Its location is extremely important, as it is the essence of Shanghai's financial and commercial activities. The baojia work is carried out most smoothly (March 1st of the 31st year [of the Republic]), the uniforms of the police corps are the most complete, and the air defense training is the strictest. Moreover, the entire district is densely covered with police sirens, with installations at every intersection, totaling sixty-four. The joint bao office has six red lights connected to these sirens, and the police bureau has sixty-four red lights connected to them. In the event of an emergency, they light up immediately and take the necessary measures. In the past, when terrorist incidents occurred, the entire area was sealed off, which was too extensive and caused inconvenience to pedestrians. Now it has been changed to a joint bao blockade, which is much smaller in scope and more convenient for pedestrians.

The baojia district's baojia dues are collected as follows: 50 yuan for attached households, 100 yuan per month for second landlords, 200 yuan for shops with one storefront, 400 yuan for two storefronts, 600 yuan for three storefronts, and 5,000 yuan for monthly baojia dues for factories, banks, and major businesses, with the highest being 20,000 yuan. The total monthly baojia fee is approximately 3,380,000 yuan. Twenty percent is given to the baojia office, and the rest is used for staff salaries, air defense equipment, and stationery and printing. Currently, the joint bao office has a monthly expenditure of 145,000 yuan, each joint bao has a monthly expenditure of 25,000 yuan, and each bao has a monthly expenditure of 15,000 yuan. The joint bao office currently has two staff members and two messengers. Their monthly salaries are only 32,000 yuan, and they cannot enjoy the rights to priority rice and low-price rice because they are an intermediary agency and have an independent nature, receiving no subsidies from anywhere. Requests for salary increases have not been approved, and they cannot increase fees to the businesses below, so the lives of their staff are very difficult.

### C Group Football Finals: Xuanhui and Hualun Make Peace

The C Group football final round-robin match between Xuanhui and Hualun was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 4:30. The first half ended without any scores. After the restart, Hualun's Liu Zuru scored a direct goal from a corner kick. Not long after, Xuanhui's Xu Deming equalized the score. When the regular time ended, each team had scored one goal, sharing the spoils. During the 30-minute overtime, both teams failed to achieve their wishes. The C Group championship will be re-determined at a later date.

### B Group Basketball League

There were two B group Basketball League games yesterday. [Name of] Team forfeited, Nan You won without effort. In the other game, Qi Ren played against Da Peng. As a result, Qi Ren lost to Da Peng 27-21. Today's schedule is as follows: He De - Xin Lian (B1) at 4:30, You Bing - Lan Dui (B6) at 5:15.

### A Visit to the Wreckage of an Enemy Plane in Pudong

— Qichang

The day before yesterday (28th) at around 11 PM, two enemy B-29 type aircraft entered the airspace over this city. One of them invaded Shanghai from the southwest, flying low over the city area, and was immediately surrounded by Japanese searchlight beams. It was then hit and caught fire. Because it was too close to the ground, the people in the plane could not jump out and crashed to the ground, landing in a wheat field in the Xijiazhai area of Shengjiahang in Pudong. The nearby residents and houses were not damaged.

Yesterday morning, the reporter went to the crash site to see it in person. There were several people traveling with me. We boarded a small motorboat from the Tianjin Road Wharf, diagonally crossing the Huangpu River to the naval pier in Pudong. There were already trucks full of destroyed plane fragments being unloaded there. Machine gun bullets were being placed in baskets. There were also many charred pistols. The machine guns dragged out of the broken plane had turned completely black and charred, and the muzzle openings were filled with mud. In the pile of scrap metal, there were also pieces of torn clothing, cotton wadding, burlap, wireless radio parts, gas mask parts, scraps of paper, identification cards, maps, astronomical charts, food cans, medicine, and instructions for wound treatment.

The reporter and others climbed onto the truck carrying the debris and drove straight to Shengjiahang. The wind and sand were extremely heavy along the way, and the truck was constantly jolting. After about a quarter of an hour, we arrived at our destination. The truck stopped by the road, and after walking more than a hundred steps into the wheat field, we reached the place where the plane crashed. The coolies were carrying the debris, and dozens of soldiers were digging out the bombs that were embedded in the ground. There were two of these bombs lined up together, still unexploded, with a diameter of about one and a half feet and a height of more than four feet above the ground. According to a certain sergeant, each bomb weighed at least 500 pounds. Next to them was another exploded bomb, with a shell about one inch thick.

Most of the American pilots' bodies were completely burned, fragmented and broken. The flesh under the white skin had not yet congealed, and the fishy smell was overwhelming. Onlookers covered their noses. Their hands and feet were still discernible, but they were already swollen like boxing gloves. Another body had only the middle section, and the head and limbs were missing. There were eight or nine other corpses with bloody flesh, all incomplete. Several corpses still had plane parts inserted into the mud and were being excavated. These Americans were either pilots, radio operators, gunners, observers, or guides. Their cause of death was either burning to death in the air, being blown up by the bombs they carried after falling, or being killed by the fall. The total number was about thirteen or fourteen people, none of whom survived. This was all because they were flying too low and did not have time to use parachutes.

There was also an airplane wheel standing on the ground, reaching a height of seven or eight feet, with a rubber tire of about two feet in diameter. The rubber tire of another wheel had been burned away, leaving only the wheel disc and axle. There were four engines, scattered in several places, all burned and incomplete. The blades of the propeller were about three feet long and about one foot wide, painted a tender green color, which was very pleasing to the eye. There was also an oil tank that had been broken, but the partitions in the middle of the tank could still be faintly seen. Its size was as large as a small boat. It was estimated that it could hold at least five or six hundred gallons of oil.

According to nearby farmers, after the plane was shot down, a fire broke out in the sky, and then it crashed to the ground with a deafening explosion, as if the sky had fallen and the earth had split. Then there were a series of explosions, with more than a dozen fires breaking out on the ground, which lasted for a long time. The residents did not know what to do and could only resign themselves to fate. When the reporter visited, it was nearly noon, and there were still one or two places where the residual smoke had not completely dissipated.

### Hoping That Wealthy Merchants Respond to Hidden Poverty Loan Fund

I am a salaried worker whose income is not enough to support my parents or raise my children. I have many children, and the number of mouths to feed is large. Today, I saw in the newspaper that the Yuzhai owner is organizing a hidden poverty loan fund. I was deeply moved by this benevolent and righteous act. In this time of turbulent times and declining morality, the human heart is becoming more dangerous! The masses are competing for windfall profits. Those with long sleeves are good at dancing, manipulating and hoarding goods, and in the blink of an eye, they acquire tens of millions of assets. With profit in their hearts, where is benevolence? Those who are content and abide by the law, live in hidden poverty and high integrity, suffer hardships, endure hunger and cold, or even wander around the house in distress, looking up at the roof and sighing. Who will pity them, comfort them, and relieve them? Now the owner of Yuzhai has kindness in his heart and is determined to do good, organizing a hidden poverty loan fund, which is truly a beacon in the sea of suffering. There is no shortage of wealthy merchants in Shanghai, and some of them may be moved by this and rise up to follow suit. Only those who accumulate wealth can distribute it, and only those who distribute wealth will ultimately accumulate it. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to practice benevolence.

Picking Up and Donating Money for a Charity School

Mr. Zhang Shusen wrote a letter saying: "Last month, I picked up a lost savings check for 1,000 yuan that a flour customer lost. Now that I see that your place is establishing a charity school, I will add another 1,000 yuan to make a total of 2,000 yuan, which will be used as the "Charity School Fund". A small amount, but it expresses my feelings."

### Research on the Non-Toxic Bactericidal Agent "Neo-Penicillin"

Since the advent of sulfonamide derivatives, scientists around the world have been researching effective non-toxic bactericidal agents. Professor Fleming of the University of London discovered in 1929 a product of [Penicillium] notatum that is non-toxic and has a particularly strong antibacterial effect, which is the recently popular penicillin. This new drug was initially popular in England and the United States, and later adopted by the medical and pharmaceutical circles of various countries around the world, gradually becoming more popular than sulfonamide preparations. However, this antibacterial substance is produced in very small quantities, and its properties are very unstable, making it very difficult to refine and concentrate. The antibacterial potency limit of ordinary therapeutic "penicillin" can only be diluted to one million times, containing a large amount of unrefined impurities. Injections often have side effects such as pain, fever, and thrombosis. In 1942, British scholars Abraham and Chain, etc., invented a new preparation called "Neo-Penicillin," which is far purer than ordinary "penicillin." Even diluted to twenty million times, it can still fully exert its antibacterial power. According to experimental results, its ability to inhibit bacterial growth is hundreds of times greater than sulfonamides. It has strong solubility and is easily dispersed. Its difference from sulfonamides is that its activity is not limited by blood or pus, and it has no toxic effects on tissue cells and white blood cells. Since the successful manufacture of "Neo-Penicillin," all [other] penicillin preparations have paled in comparison. This is not only a matter of purity but also the standard and accuracy of the units cannot be compared. Therefore, "Neo-Penicillin" products have begun to be universally advocated by the medical and pharmaceutical circles.

This agent mainly treats various diseases caused by infections with Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Gonococcus, and Pneumococcus, as well as meningitis, diphtheria, empyema, syphilis, osteomyelitis, sepsis, puerperal fever, tetanus, scarlet fever, erysipelas, ulcers, gas gangrene, and all kinds of trauma, frostbite, burns, etc., all responding like an echo, with the disease disappearing with the medicine. It is undoubtedly a modern all-around chemical therapeutic agent. However, this agent cannot be stored for a long time. Only when stored in German-made yellow "Jena" ampoules will it not denature over time. Therefore, the refining technology and the preservation equipment have a great impact on the effect, which is not a small matter. It is said that there has recently been a Chinese-made "Neo-Penicillin" preparation on the market in this city. Its excellent performance meets the conditions that should be met by world academic students. Clinical experiments are quite satisfactory. Its contribution to the well-being of patients is not small.
