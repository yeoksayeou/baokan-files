Prime Minister's Address

What the Japanese Empire seeks is to eliminate the root of trouble that disturbs East Asia, and to build a righteous New Order in Greater East Asia. Germany's surrender has no impact on Japan's completion of the war. Based on the recent situation that has occurred in Europe, Japan recognizes the invalidity of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the Three-Power Treaty, and related anti-communist agreements, and has decided to act from a new perspective from now on. What is expected at this time is to strengthen cooperation with East Asian allies, especially between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, who should be united in spirit and purpose, take this as the core, unite to exert virtue, resolutely defeat the arrogant enemy, and ensure the stability of Greater East Asia. Japan's attitude and policies toward the mainland, especially its policy towards China, remain firm and unwavering. Regarding politics towards China, it is determined to complete the Greater East Asia War in accordance with Japan's consistent established policy, in order to achieve the stability of Greater East Asia. It is appropriate to renew our determination in various parts of the mainland, taking into account the progress of the war situation and internal and external circumstances, and to unite with Manchukuo and Korea, exerting comprehensive material and spiritual combat power, and striving to realize it with all our efforts.

### One Week of War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia this week is as follows:

In the Ryukyu Islands, the enemy mobile units, which are gradually advancing southward towards both ends of the archipelago, have repeatedly been reinforced by their fleet air force. They came to attack the Japanese mainland again on the 13th and 14th. Their actions show considerable value. The organization of the mobile unit shows a significant increase in specially equipped aircraft carriers, but the quality of the aircraft and pilots shows a marked decline. From this, it can be inferred that the enemy fleet air force has suffered very heavy blows. At the same time, the operation of air bases such as Okinawa Island, Kerama Islands, and Ie Island is also being actively carried out. Not only the north and central airfields on Okinawa Island, but other airfields are also being rapidly constructed with all efforts. The airfield on Ie Island has already been completed, and several small aircraft have started operating. At the same time, specially equipped aircraft carriers around the island are replenishing a considerable number of aircraft to these airfields. However, due to the scale of the airfield and the number of aircraft, enemy aircraft activity is very low-key. About 60 aircraft were mobilized on the 13th, more than 100 on the 14th and 15th, more than 200 on the 16th, and about 700 on the 19th, 340 on the 18th. Also, the Japanese special attack units and air force continue to fiercely attack the enemy supply lines. Their targets are enemy ships, airfields, and material warehouses. As a result, enemy airfields are on fire for days, and destroyed enemy ships and enemy corpses are drifting on the sea surface. This shows that the enemy's losses are extremely heavy.

In the Mariana and Ogasawara Islands, the B29 type aircraft that once advanced to the Kyushu area for tactical bombing later bombed cities again, and seemed to have switched to a strategic bombing of indiscriminate bombing. The small aircraft on Iwo Jima also attacked the Kanto area on the 17th. They also dropped magnetic mines along the coast of the Japanese mainland, seemingly the main strategy to defeat navigation along the coast of the Japanese mainland and hinder supplies.

The enemy forces in the Luzon and Narian Road area invaded Baguio on April 26. The enemy's main force is preparing to attack in the rear, and a part has entered the vicinity of Gikisburais, east of Baguio Town. The Japanese elite troops are still bravely attacking on the highlands east of Baguio Town. The war situation in the Saraksasara Mountain area in the east is gradually becoming active on the 5th. The battle on Luzon Island has become fully active.

The Japanese troops in the Mindanao and Davao area are still securing the key positions north of Davao. From the time the enemy landed until the 14th, about 2,500 people were killed or injured. The Japanese army also sank four enemy transport ships, destroyed 12 aircraft, six tanks, eight armored vehicles, and 73 vehicles. The enemy is now gradually reinforcing its forces and continuing to operate. The Japanese artillery in the northern Davao front is launching fierce artillery fire against it, destroying the enemy's main positions.

On Tarakan Island, the enemy continued to attempt to invade the airfield area, the water purification plant, and the oil field area, but were all repelled by the Japanese army. The battle line after the 11th is in a stalemate.

In the Burma area, the enemy troops who landed in the southern region of Yangon on May 1 were African soldiers, and the enemy troops who landed near the mouth of the Yangon River on the 12th were a part of the 26th Division of Reunion Island. On the 3rd, they invaded the city of Yangon and rapidly strengthened the nearby positions. It seems that the northern airfield of Yangon has been used since the 4th. The enemy going south along the railway passed Pegu on April 23 and gradually continued north to Yangon. The enemy going south along the Irrawaddy River passed Alon on April 30 and reached Frome on the 3rd. North of Mingla, in the middle of Yangon, they joined the West African 82nd Division, which landed along the coast of Arakan and invaded north of Tagab. Further campaigning to advance.

In the Indian Ocean, the enemy mobile units that were active in the Anam Islands and Nicobar Islands from April 30 to May 3 appeared again near the sea on the 13th, bombing and strafing them. Since the 16th, they have been active in the northern waters of Sumatra. The actions of the enemy mobile units in that area should be closely monitored.

### Burma Front Before the Rainy Season, a Standoff Occurs, Britain Announces Names of Warships in the Yangon Operation

Burma Front Base, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the enemy army forcibly advanced south along the Mandalay Road under the cover of superior air force, its armored units suddenly entered Yangon in early May. Afterwards, fearing a Japanese counterattack, it prepared and strengthened its formation. The Japanese army units gradually prepared their military strength, secured a strategic advantage, and resolutely counterattacked the gaps in the enemy front, launching a counterattack. As the Burma front entered a state of confrontation between the two armies before the rainy season, the enemy used the British 76th Division to advance from the north, and a part of the 19th Division to advance from the west, and the entire unit invaded the mountainous plateau area. At present, the two armies are engaged in small-scale battles in that area. It is reported that before dawn on the 18th, the Japanese launched a strong attack on about 600 enemy soldiers in Laukshak (70 kilometers northeast of Meiktila) and its vicinity, and encircled and attacked the enemy army. The Japanese army's battle results included about 90 enemy corpses left behind, and destruction of five pursuit cannons, seven heavy and light machine guns, and many other military supplies. Under the cover of artillery, other units launched a surprise attack on the enemy army 40 kilometers north of Garo (50 kilometers east of Meiktila) at dawn on the 20th, causing them to collapse, abandoning 50 corpses. The Japanese army captured a large number of ammunition. In addition, other Japanese army units launched a mopping-up operation against a 200-bandit group 30 kilometers west of Po Pa (about 150 kilometers east of Meiktila), capturing 60 submachine guns and a large amount of ammunition. Also, the enemy army that invaded Garo has greatly reduced its combat power due to the Japanese army's counterattack, and is now gradually replacing it with the first-line troops.

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Colombo, the Southeast Asian Military Headquarters announced on the 18th that the navy participating in the British army's landing operation in Yangon included the battleship Queen Elizabeth (36,000 tons), the French battleship Richelieu (35,000 tons), and the cruisers Saif Ceylon and Tromp, the destroyers Byan Paratrai, Lopak, Reuspaus, and Leto, as well as the Indian Navy's Sheelpo, Satlej, and Koari, and the British Navy's Felike, Tert, Loki, and Spey.

### Japanese Continue Fierce Attacks on Enemy Warships off Okinawa

Southwest Islands Base, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Air Force continues to launch fierce attacks on enemy naval forces in the southwest islands. On the night of the 18th, an aerial torpedo attack on an enemy special aircraft carrier in the Okinawa Sea caused a major fire. A cruiser or destroyer and a large transport ship were also torpedoed, causing great damage. Another unit dropped large bombs on an enemy transport ship and a destroyer, destroying them. Also, from late at night on the 18th to dawn on the 19th, an air raid on Ie Island airfield caused fires in several places, and continued to attack the northern airport on Okinawa Island and nearby facilities, causing fires in several places.

### Tarakan War Situation Gradually Becomes Fierce

Southwest Area Base, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The land battle on Tarakan Island, which has been in a stalemate since the 11th, has become increasingly tense since the enemy began preparing to attack. Since the 16th, the enemy has carried out naval bombardment on the eastern coast of Amar, attempting to land. At the same time, the enemy forces launched a general attack east of the airfield with artillery and naval gun cover, engaging in a battle for control with the Japanese garrison. The current line of confrontation between the two armies is from the north of the airfield, through the water purification plant, to the north side of the oil field area. The initial close combat since the enemy landed has gradually become fierce. The Japanese Commando Assault Team is becoming increasingly active, killing about 150 enemies, destroying three cargo trucks, three light machine guns, three barracks, and two material warehouses, killing a total of one-third of the enemy landing forces. Although the Japanese army is outnumbered, it still secures the main positions and crushes the enemy forces everywhere.

### Strengthening Fire Protection Facilities

Recently, fires have occurred repeatedly in this city. The scope and degree of damage have been relatively extensive. The fire on Yuyao Road not long ago, and the fire on Shanxi Road yesterday, are particularly disheartening!

Although the fire protection facilities in this city are relatively complete compared to other parts of the country, due to the dense population, the value of land, and the cramped living conditions of lower and middle-class families, any fire that occurs will inevitably involve and affect others. Therefore, fire protection facilities are already insufficient to meet actual needs in peacetime. Moreover, in wartime, enemy air raids and bombings are inevitable, and fire protection facilities must be especially strengthened.

Regarding strengthening fire protection facilities, in terms of the actual situation, some should be actively carried out mainly by the authorities, while others should be jointly undertaken by the authorities and the people, or prepared by the citizens themselves. Here are some of my observations for the attention and reference of all relevant parties.

In terms of what the authorities should pay attention to regarding fire protection facilities in the future, one is to raise regular light expenses, and to systematically improve and supplement public fire protection equipment; the second is to improve the service methods of fire department personnel during emergency periods, and to improve their treatment, and to determine reward and punishment methods. Those who have made special contributions should be rewarded with honor and material rewards. Those who are ineffective in their service or even have immoral behavior must be publicly and severely punished, in order to ensure that rewards and punishments are clear. The third is to establish a supervisory agency to assume the supreme supervisory responsibility for fire protection facilities and fire protection work during wartime, in order to unify and strengthen the city's fire protection work. And to implement rigorous training for firefighters.

In terms of what the authorities and the public should jointly promote, the first is to organize a fire protection design committee for emergency periods (assuming), composed of official representatives and civilian leaders, to combine the strength of officials and the public to carry out investigations, research, and design work related to fire protection in the city. The agency will be responsible for guiding and promoting fire protection work initiated and guided by the authorities that requires money and effort from the public. It is hoped that the city's Baojia organization can play a leading role in this regard, using the Baojia mechanism as a powerful auxiliary to the city's fire protection work in the future. Cooperation between the public opinion circles and the relevant authorities goes without saying.

Furthermore, in the future, the city's fire protection work will be directly related to the lives and property of citizens, and must be carried out with the automatic cooperation of citizens. The most urgent tasks today are: First, to universally dig wells and springs, so that when the tap water source is interrupted, well water can be used, so as not to panic at the last minute. Second, those who cannot afford to purchase fire extinguishers must prepare adequate fire-fighting sand and water storage in each household for use when necessary. Third, the necessary items for saving lives and treating injuries must also be adequately prepared, especially first aid medicines, which should be purchased as soon as possible within their means. The above three items are especially needed in the most crowded places, and it is hoped that the Baojia and knowledgeable people in the neighborhood will do their best to advise them.

Although the city has held many air defense exercises, citizens may still not be familiar with fire protection work during air defense periods, and may still panic in the event of an emergency. Therefore, we believe that more fire drills should be held in the future to enable citizens to fully understand how to avoid hindering the work of firefighters when an accident occurs, and to further understand how to assist firefighters in rescue work.

Fire protection facilities should be strengthened first in factory areas, bustling city areas, and poor people's living areas. Praise factories, shops, and houses with complete fire protection equipment to allow nearby residents to observe and emulate. Citizens and Baojia personnel who have contributed to cooperative fire protection should be adequately rewarded. It is firmly believed that if we can work hard along these lines, strengthen fire protection facilities, and increase fire protection power, it will not be difficult to make the city a model fire protection city and reduce the damage caused by fires.

### Current Situation in Dongtai County

— Huang E

Geographical Evolution

Dongtai County is located on the Fan Gong embankment, a thoroughfare for north-south travel. It belongs to Taizhou. It was separated and established as a county in the 43rd year of the Qianlong reign (Qing Dynasty). The Fan Gong embankment stretches from Nantong in the south to Gaoyou in the north, traversing the counties of Rugao, Dongtai, and Yancheng. It was built by Fan Zhongyan during the Song dynasty, originally to prevent seawater intrusion. Now, the sea has receded eastward, and the area east of the Fan embankment is more than a hundred *li* from the sea, finally bordering the coast. As a result, what were once just thatched huts and barren land for salt production are now mostly fields for planting beans, cotton, and corn. The transformation from sea to land, the shifting of valleys, is truly remarkable. West of the Fan embankment,

rivers and harbors crisscross, and ditches and canals are wide and interconnected, mostly fed by the waters of Huai and Hongze Lakes discharged from the canal. This is the so-called "Li-xia River" area, where irrigation is convenient, the soil is fertile, and production is abundant, long known as a land of fish and rice. Before the war, Dongtai County, apart from suffering from the major floods caused by the breach of the canal in the 10th and 20th years of the Republic of China, only experienced minor disturbances when Sun Chuanfang's defeated troops retreated north across the Yangtze River, with some looting by the disorderly soldiers. Otherwise, the city gates remained secure, and the capital was undisturbed. Although the historical Taiping Rebellion occurred, it did not affect the area. The people were prosperous, lived happily and contentedly, and officials serving in this area were said to be in "Golden Rugao, Silver Dongtai." The simplicity and timidity of the people's character can be seen here!

Public Security Situation

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Battle of Shanghai started the war. In March of the following year, the war spread to northern Jiangsu, and Yancheng was occupied. As a result, order in various counties collapsed. Vagrants rose up, seized civilian firearms, and levied exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. The suffering of the people was endured in silence. However, after 1940, the New Fourth Army crossed the Yangtze River and advanced northward from Jingjiang, Taixian, and Jiangyan. They first encountered and fought with the Fourth Security Brigade under He Keqian. He's troops retreated without resistance. Thereupon, the Nationalist government dispatched over 20,000 troops, led by the 89th Army Commander Li Shouwei, to encircle and suppress the New Fourth Army. In the Battle of Huangqiao, the entire army was wiped out, and Li Shouwei also died in action. After this battle, the New Fourth Army gained great momentum and advanced victoriously, capturing the three counties of Dongtai, Jianhu, and Dafeng. At that time, Huai'an and Huaiyin had already been captured by the Japanese army advancing south from Xuzhou. The Nationalist provincial government first moved to Dongtai, then to Xinghua, confined to a corner, extremely embarrassed, and unable to maintain the remaining situation.

In the spring of 1941, the Japanese army again attacked Dongtai and Jianhu from Tongzhou and Rugao, reopening the Grand Canal and occupying Gaoyou, and besieged Xinghua. At the same time, Li Changjiang, Deputy Commander of the Guerrilla Forces in the Jiangsu-Shandong Border Region, stationed troops in Taizhou and led his troops to participate in the "peaceful cooperation," thus expanding the "peaceful area." The New Fourth Army and the Nationalist government had no choice but to abandon transportation hubs and retreat to the countryside, and the rural people suffered greatly from the disturbances. Even remote areas could hardly escape misfortune. Dongtai County, bordering Yancheng to the north, Rugao to the south, and Xinghua to the west, was a vital transportation hub for all counties in northern Jiangsu, and naturally became a strategic point contested by military strategists. Moreover, during the period when the Nationalist provincial government moved to Dongtai, it was repeatedly bombed, resulting in collapsed walls and debris, and numerous deaths and injuries. Although the disaster was second to Yancheng, the severity of the suffering was unprecedented.

Heavy Taxes

Currently, important towns and areas along the land and water transportation lines in Dongtai County are under the control of the "peaceful area," within the reach of military and political power. West of the Fan embankment, a small number of Nationalist troops are stationed in three or four villages, while the rest is the active area of the New Fourth Army, covering a very wide area. Therefore, the people bear a very heavy burden, some having to pay to three sides, and some to two sides, depending on the area in which they live. As for the methods of collecting donations and taxes, for the general public, the Baojia system is used, with layers of control, and monthly levies are distributed among households. For those without property, monthly taxes are levied per *mu* (unit of land). For general industrial and commercial operators, the Chamber of Commerce and trade associations are used to distribute quotas proportionally among businesses, so that no one can escape. Suppose someone lives in Town A, but their department store and silk business are both located in Town B, and their farmland is located in Village C in the "peaceful area," and also in Village D or Village E within the range of the New Fourth Army and the Nationalist government, then, in addition to paying business tax, consumption tax, consolidated tax, income tax, etc., they must pay household donations monthly in Town A, donations levied by the Chamber of Commerce and trade associations monthly in Town B, military provisions and military grass monthly in Village C, public grain and land tax in Village D, and comply with the regulations of rent reduction of two-fifths and winter reduction, and in Village E, they must pay all the donations levied by the "Old Central." Under such circumstances, what kind of burden do the people bear? Moreover, donations and taxes increase month by month, without end, so merchants complain in the market, and farmers complain in the fields, with a great sense of not knowing "when their lives will end." Here is a list of the donations that the Anfeng Town in the Second District of Dongtai County was supposed to pay in April, to give a glimpse:

2,000 *shi* of military rice (to supply the ×th Front Army).

400 *shi* of military rice (to supply the garrison troops).

39 *shi* and 3 *dou* of military rice (to supply the Dongtai County Security Team).

131 *shi* of military grass (to supply the Dongtai County Security Team).

100,000 yuan for vegetable allowance (to supply the Dongtai County Security Team).

One pillbox.

Two underground bunkers.

105 *zhang* of city wall construction.

The above three items are related to the Dongtai city defense works, and are distributed according to the area for raising funds, with labor, materials, bricks and tiles, and forced civilian labor for construction.

Considering the current grain prices in Dongtai, the above figures are also quite substantial. For example, rice costs 27,000 yuan per *shi*, polished rice costs 50,000 yuan per *shi*, and grass costs 2,700 yuan per *dan*. How can the people, who have survived the war, bear this heavy burden? Such "draining the pond to catch all the fish" does not seem to be the way to govern the people. It is said that when the ×th Division was stationed in Dongtai last autumn, activities to "invite wealth" were rampant, with kidnapping and extortion, open negotiations, without any scruples! At that time, more than 10,000 people with some assets fled to Taizhou to avoid disaster! It was not until the unit was transferred to western Zhejiang and the 25th Division took over the defense of Dongtai that the refugees gradually returned home.

Our consistent policy is that so-called changes in territorial distribution must be implemented only after detailed discussions and heavy consultations between governments.

The International Tribunal mentioned in the statement is not the same as the War Crimes Committee currently located in London. The President's Press Relations Secretary explained that "The War Crimes Committee is a jury system that accuses suspects. The International Tribunal in the current organization is dedicated to trying major criminals.

### Lebanon, The Situation is Serious

Geneva, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Cairo: Political circles in Cairo are increasingly uneasy in view of the abnormal developments in politics in the countries of the Levant, especially Lebanon. Unconfirmed reports from Damascus say that the situation in Lebanon is becoming more and more serious. Fortunately, French Minister Plenipotentiary General Bénet has arrived in the area, causing the crisis not to explode immediately. When the pro-French faction demonstrated on Victory Day, they forcibly tore the Lebanese flag, and shouted the slogan "Greater Lebanon of Tegor." At the same time, there were also anti-French elements taking the same action. Lebanese citizens in Egypt claimed that the French troops who arrived in their country included most of the senior officers who arrived by plane, and this news could not be confirmed for a while. However, the fact that France would send a cruiser to carry General Bénet and his party to Lebanon in order to recall the French troops stationed there, and soon another cruiser carrying a large number of French reinforcements, is undeniable.

### British Mediation Ultimately Has Little Effect

The United Kingdom will do its best to mediate this dispute, but France is still increasing its garrison as before. At present, all sectors deeply hope that the British and Egyptian authorities in Cairo can immediately show good strategies, so that the dispute between France and Lebanon can be resolved. At the same time, Egypt, standing in the position of leader of the Arab League, is also eager to find a way to end this dispute as soon as possible, so that the countries of the Levant can make every effort to establish an effective alliance.

### Jiangsu Province Rice-Producing Area Agricultural Loan Syndicate Established

The 14th meeting of the Municipal Consultative Committee passed a proposal to organize an agricultural loan syndicate in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, and a subcommittee was set up to be responsible for promoting it.

The subcommittee convened meetings twice on April 23 and May 2 to discuss specific measures for organizing the agricultural loan syndicate, which was jointly organized by fifteen banks including China, Jiaotong, Huaxing, and Fuxing. The association held a tea party at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 20th) at No. 2 Albert Road, inviting responsible persons from various banks participating in the syndicate to discuss implementation measures. Secretary-General Luo, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Fudeng, Ye Fuxiao, Liu Ruxiang, Shen Erchang, Shen Jiufen, Xu Jianping, Xiang Shuxiang, Zhu Qingzeng, Huang Yuyi (representing Shen Changming), Tang Hanzhi (representing Liang Dingshu), Li Zuji, Chen Duoru, Zhu Rutang, Zhang Weiru, Zhang Zhuyu, Zhu Boquan, Sun Yaodong, Qian Dagai, Jin Xiongbo, Liang Zhongyi (representing Li Zuji), and Chen Binhe attended, with Secretary-General Luo presiding.

The meeting discussed the method of raising a total loan of 5 billion yuan, and given the imminent farming season, it was decided to implement the loan disbursement no later than early June. The loan disbursement work was decided to be fully entrusted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The realization of the agricultural loan is expected, which will help increase food production and benefit the food prospects of the city's citizens, which is worthy of anticipation, and the local social leaders, especially the leaders of the financial community, are keen to promote it, which is especially gratifying.

### Inspecting Public Places, Police Bureau Stipulates That Officers Should Show Identification Cards

The Zhabei Sub-Bureau of this city has discovered that recently there have been unscrupulous people wearing uniforms and impersonating police officers who have secretly gone to various hotels under the guise of inspections to privately extort money. If this is not stopped, not only will the people suffer damage, but it will also affect the credibility of the police bureau. It has been found that the same thing has happened in other entertainment places, so the sub-bureau has stipulated measures that, in the future, if any official or policeman goes to inspect, regardless of whether they are wearing a uniform or not, they should first turn in their identification card and hand it over to the business owners for review and registration before carrying out the work in turn. Otherwise, the business owners should immediately refuse the inspection and report it to the sub-bureau at any time, and send police to investigate. This will protect the business community and maintain order.

### Adjusting Office Hours from Today

The office hours of the City Police Bureau will be adjusted from today (22nd) to 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM, and the order has been issued to the subordinate departments to comply with it.

### Finance Bureau to Periodically Collect Summer House Tax

The Municipal Finance Bureau has determined that the summer house tax for Districts 1-8 and the Hubei District in this city will be collected in accordance with regulations starting on April 1.

### The Second Phase of Gold Certificates Will Be Issued Today, the Gold Certificate Market May Open Next Month

The first phase of the Central Reserve Bank's gold certificates was sold on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of this month, with good results. The second phase of issuance is scheduled to start today (the 21st) and end on the 23rd. The listed price of gold certificates is set at 830,000 yuan per tael, and it is expected that buyers will be even more enthusiastic than in the first phase. Regarding the gold certificate market, the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange is actively preparing it. The market is arranged on the eighth floor of the stock exchange, and speakerphones are being installed. All preparations are expected to be completed this month, and trading can begin in early June. There will be about 40 to 50 market brokers, and their applications for participation in brokerage have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review.

### Central Reserve System's Finances Are Gradually Loosening, Last Week Rice Prices Rose Sharply

The financial situation in Shanghai in the past week has not undergone drastic changes, although international turbulence continued to evolve. The issuance of Central Reserve gold certificates has shown a good trend, shrinking currency and suppressing prices, and has achieved initial results, so people's hearts are increasingly stable. The black market is quiet and calm, and speculators want to move, but the result is that there is no opportunity to take advantage of, so only on Wednesday and Thursday the price tended to rise slightly, and on Friday it returned to its original state, and the transaction was extremely leisurely. Public bonds and silver ingots were stable and did not move, and Chinese stocks fluctuated slightly, mostly because the bulls insisted on not lowering the price, so the footing was quite stable. The Central Reserve Bank was very enthusiastic about stabilizing financial transfers, so the financial conditions were relaxed last week, and the phenomenon of lack of cash gradually decreased. The payment of cash by various banks and companies to depositors has increased compared with the past, and the discount exchange rate has disappeared.

As for industry and commerce, there seemed to be a turning point in the past week, and factories were preparing to start work and resume production. With the efforts of the authorities, the difficulties in raw materials and electricity seemed to be resolved. However, due to the stimulation of rumors from all sides, speculators took the opportunity to hoard goods, causing prices to rise. In particular, the prices of rice, grains, oil, sugar, and fuel, which are major commodities, suddenly rose sharply, causing social and livelihood unrest. Although the main reason is that the source is gradually scarce during the transition period between the old and new crops, the speculation of merchants taking the opportunity to hoard and manipulate market prices is the greatest influence in driving up prices. The general public hopes that the economic authorities will further investigate the situation thoroughly to stabilize the people's livelihood.

### Baoshan Police Bureau Cracks Down on Counterfeit Currency Organization

Since the new director, Lu Peijie, took office in the Baoshan County Police Bureau, the police affairs have been completely renovated. Recently, counterfeit currency was found in the territory, and the detective team was ordered to secretly investigate. As a result, Song Guisheng was captured in Dushun Township, and more than 90,000 yuan of counterfeit currency was found. According to his confession, A Da was captured separately at No. 15 Hengmao Li, Ningxia Road, Shanghai, and a stone printing machine for privately printing counterfeit currency was found at No. 7 Mingde Li, Jinling Road. Zhou Zhongshan, Cao Yin die, and Cao A Si, three accomplices, were arrested at No. 34 Puyu Li, Penglai Road, and taken to the Shanshan Police Bureau for interrogation. They all confessed to privately printing counterfeit currency. All the witnesses were transferred to the government of the Shanshan County Government, which also handles judicial affairs. Director Lu arrived for less than a month before he first solved this major case.

### Huashan and Changning Districts Open Baojia Clerk Training Class

Next, Director Yao, Director Pang (represented by Director Guo), Chief Joint Bao Chief Zhou, and Ye De of the fourth section of the Changning Road Sub-Bureau all gave speeches of encouragement. The ceremony concluded at 12:30 PM. It is reported that formal classes will begin today.

### Planting Coarse Grains is Popular in Shanghai's Suburbs

According to a recent survey by agricultural authorities, the crops in the four suburbs of the city used to focus on rice cultivation, but this spring, most farmers, due to the heavy losses suffered from pests in the four suburbs last year, and the great destruction of the harvest, coupled with the high price of rice, which has led to a rise in the price of coarse grains, and the fact that the cost is low and the profit is high, have increased the amount of coarse grains planted in the four suburbs this spring by more than double compared to previous years.

### High Property Prices, Still Many Competing to Buy

The city's real estate business is not gradually decreasing due to high prices and chaotic market prices. On the contrary, the number of people in the industry and outsiders competing to buy is higher than before. Therefore, the number of times the land price has risen in the city center and the urban area is alarming. The land price survey of the city in 1938 and May of 1944 and 1945 is listed on the left:

The first item is the price in March of 1938, the second item is the price in December of 1944, and the third item is the price in May of 1945.

Nanjing Road: 300,000 yuan, 40 million yuan, 200 million yuan. Dashanghai Road: 150,000 yuan, 22 million yuan, 120 million yuan. Datong Road: 40,000 yuan, 12 million yuan, 50 million yuan. Xishan Road: 34,000 yuan, 14 million yuan, 70 million yuan. Hengshan Road: 20,000 yuan, 10 million yuan, 70 million yuan. Yuyuan Road: 20,000 yuan, 4.5 million yuan, 18 million yuan.

### Exhibition of Calligraphy by Pioneers of Asian Revival Opens Yesterday

Calligraphy by pioneers of Asian revival is related to the revolutionary deeds between China and Japan and has historical value. The Shanghai branch of the China News Association held an exhibition at the Rihua Club on Xianyang Road yesterday (the 20th) at 10:00 AM to allow citizens to view the handwriting of the sages. People from all walks of life who came to visit were very enthusiastic. More than 100 pieces of calligraphy by Chinese and Japanese sages were displayed, including Sun Yat-sen's handwriting presented to Japanese Junzaburo Yamada: "Sailing in the Same Boat" and "The World is for All," which contains the spirit of Pan-Asianism. The verses given by martyr Chen Qimei to Yamada, "Not afraid of death, not stealing life, a man's great integrity shines with the sun, the way of compromise, not afraid of cauldron cooking, Ran Ran Alone, Miles Afraid of Emptiness," are enough to see Chen's broad-mindedness and abundant spirit, warmed in words. There is also a couplet given by Hu Hanmin to Yamada, "Non-heroic undertakings are humanitarianism," which also shows Hu's revolutionary spirit. Yamada's four characters "Supreme Sincerity Consistent" are full of vigor, but their meaning is actually better than the characters. Other relics, such as those of Wen Tianxiang, Lin Zexu, Huang Xing, and Zhang Yipeng, and the handwriting of the allied general Senjuro Hayashi are truly treasures. Today (the 21st) is the last day, and citizens are welcome to visit to avoid regrets.

### Survey of the Rickshaw Industry in this City

— Jia Xi

The rickshaw in Shanghai has a history of more than 40 years. It was originally called a "Japanese-style cart" because it was modeled after the Japanese style. At that time, the wheels were made of wood and foreign iron rings. Later, it was gradually improved and gradually became the form it is today.

The current distribution of rickshaws in Shanghai is as follows: There are a total of 10,163 vehicles and 1,055 rickshaw companies in the former one to eight districts. The remaining districts of Hubi, Nanshi, Xucao, Huxi, and Pudong have a total of 8,451 vehicles and a total of 1,940 rickshaw companies. There are more than 50,000 rickshaw pullers who are registered and licensed, and another 40,000 to 50,000 who are not registered. Most of them are from Dongtai, Yancheng, Funing, Gaoyou, Taixian, Taixing and other places in northern Jiangsu, and a small number are from Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Rugao, Huaiyin, and Ying other places.

Before the war, most of the events were held in Hongkou, Zhabei, and the French Concession. After the war, they all moved to the French Concession, Huxi, and north of the Suzhou River. More than ten years ago, there were two rickshaw companies in Shanghai, Nanhe Company and Feixing Company, each with thousands of vehicles. Later, they were all sold. Now, well-known people from northern Jiangsu such as Gu Zhuxuan and Jin Jiulin also own a lot of vehicles.

Calculation of Rickshaw Rent

Rickshaw rent is the focus of the current labor-capital dispute. The principals calculate the rickshaw rent entirely based on the new price, but in reality, the vehicles they rent out are less than 30% new and are almost completely dilapidated. According to the union's calculations, the monthly cost of each vehicle includes: maintenance, painting, iron and wood repair, accident repair, body loss, wages and workshop, contractor's remuneration, license fee, union fee, mutual aid fee, accommodation fee, sundries, interest (official interest), etc., amounting to 105,669 yuan. This means that the average minimum daily expenditure per vehicle is 3,913 yuan. Now, according to the black market price, the daily rickshaw rent is 1,200 yuan, which is 32,400 yuan for 27 days. This seems to be a loss, but because of the difference between new and old goods, this calculation is of course very unreasonable. It is impossible to see profit or loss. It is said that according to past practice, the rickshaw rent must be agreed upon by representatives of both labor and capital before it can be implemented. Even if the capital side obtains the permission of the competent authority, it will not take effect.

Rickshaw Puller Life

Rickshaw pullers pull carts in the morning, evening, and night shifts. Because of limited physical strength, the morning shift is pulled for about 20 days a month, and the evening shift can only be pulled for 15 days a month. On average, they can pull 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per day. After paying the rickshaw rent of 1,200 yuan, eating at a food stall or buying sesame cakes for 1,500 yuan, and lamp oil costs of 200 yuan, and straw sandal costs of 200 yuan, it is very difficult to support a family with the remaining amount.

The most oppressed rickshaw pullers used to be the patrolmen who pried open their licenses at will and beat them arbitrarily. The French police also forced Chinese police officers to pay a certain number of licenses per month. This situation no longer exists after the recovery of the concession. However, they are still punished for not turning on the lights at night or for having lights that do not meet air defense regulations.

Rickshaw pullers are a type of coolie, and their lives are poorer than workers in any other sector. They wear old shirts and pants, which are patched again and again, or are torn in one place and hanging in another. Some are even unable to cover their bodies. In winter, the broken frames of their cotton clothes are exposed in pieces. They rarely buy a new piece of clothing in ten or eight years.

If they are single, they can barely manage to drink two bowls of porridge. If they have a wife and children, a family of four or five can only eat cornmeal, red beans, millet, and other coarse grains every day to get by, plus firewood and vegetable peelings, dried radish, salted fish, and other side dishes, which cost at least 3,000 yuan a day to eat. So, working one day is not enough to eat for one day.

About 30,000 rickshaw pullers do not have families, and they all live in rickshaw companies. The contractors build two or three-story lofts for the rickshaw pullers to live in. On the two-story lofts of each rickshaw company, 20 to 30 people live. In a three-story loft, 40 to 50 people squeeze in. They are arranged one by one in dirty cotton piles on the floor. The air is very dirty and smelly. Bedbugs and white ants surround them all day long. The floor is damp and filthy.

More than 20,000 rickshaw pullers live in shacks. They pay a low rent (or no rent) on empty land along the roads built beyond the French Concession in Huxi and build simple shacks. Hundreds and thousands of families are connected to each other. Now, it costs more than 200,000 yuan to build one. These shacks are most afraid of fire. A few days ago, more than 3,000 shacks were burned down on Singapore Road. There are really few who can afford to build new houses.

Water shortages are also what shack dwellers feel the most. Although some tap heads on the streets are open for two hours every morning, there are too many people. To fetch one or two buckets of water, you always have to walk a considerable distance and wait in line for a long time. Some shantytowns also dig wells, but they are actually just mud pits, but because the cost is low, the materials are saved, and the handlers want to take a cut, the wells are very shallow and the water quality is dirty and smelly and cannot be used as drinking water.

There are also some rickshaw pullers with families who live in rented houses in Huxi, beyond the French Concession, Dapuqiao, the end of Caishi Road, Lujiawan, and Xiejiao. Thirty to forty families live in one small house.

The general cultural level of rickshaw pullers is quite low. Eight out of ten are illiterate, and very few can read newspapers. They do not understand much about society and politics, and only know a little based on their own life experiences and people's oral accounts. Now, there are also some people with higher education who have changed careers to become rickshaw pullers. Most of these are temporary, because the income in this industry is, after all, more than that of teachers. Rickshaw pullers do not have any entertainment. Most of them play cards, pai gow, and mahjong for recreation. In addition, they go to teahouses to drink tea and listen to stories, or watch Jiangbei local operas.

Mutual Aid Organizations

The mobilization of collective work by rickshaw pullers sprouted in 1927. After the Northern Expeditionary Army recovered Shanghai, someone organized a labor union. After its establishment, more than 300 rickshaw pullers participated. The union's facilities included a tea room, a bathroom, relief work, and literacy education. Members paid a monthly membership fee of 3 jiao.

In the autumn of 1933, rickshaw pullers He Wushan, Xu Zhulin, Zhu Fengxiang, and Cang Gongwen in the Public Concession initiated the organization of a rickshaw puller relief association and obtained permission from the Public Works Bureau to establish it. They requested that the daily rickshaw rent be reduced from 1 jiao 3 fen to 1 jiao, and another 1 jiao be paid for the relief association's expenses. However, the Public Works Bureau also announced the establishment of the "Rickshaw Puller Mutual Aid Association" and stipulated that the rickshaw rent at that time was 8 jiao 5 fen, with 5 fen used for the mutual aid association's expenses. Now the mutual aid fee has risen to 600 yuan per month and is collected together with the vehicle tax. The Mutual Aid Association has twelve directors. In addition to the directors, there is also a custody committee, which is currently managed by Ji Wu.

The Mutual Aid Association has three departments: the Education Department, the Relief Department, and the Investigation Department. It handles education for rickshaw pullers' children, free medical care and midwifery, etc. In terms of relief: a funeral allowance of 20,000 yuan for the death of a rickshaw puller, a family pension of 20,000 yuan, a disability relief fund ranging from 50,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan, a small business capital of 10,000 yuan for changing careers, and a relief fund of 20,000 yuan for the death of a rickshaw puller's family member. Assistance funds for returning home (Yancheng, Funing, Gaoyou, Huai'an: 15,000 yuan. Nantong, Qichong, Rugao, Taizhou: 10,000 yuan. 5,000 yuan per family member). Fire and housing relief fund of 2,500 yuan.

On March 1, 1934, the Public Works Bureau, in order to limit the number of rickshaw pullers and plan to gradually eliminate vehicles, stipulated that 40,000 rickshaw pullers must register and be photographed at the Vehicle Affairs Office. Rickshaw pullers can only pull carts after obtaining a license. The current rickshaw puller registration is from May 1st to July 31st, and each card costs 300 yuan. The location is the Vehicle Affairs Office on Changxing Road, but the general rickshaw pullers are completely unaware of how to register and where to obtain a certificate. They often run four or five times, and it often takes several days to get a license!

### Extortion by Coarse Grain Merchants, Please Pay Attention to by the Authorities

There was originally a coarse grain market at No. 15 Edward Road in this city. After it was closed midway, merchants were not allowed to gather there without permission from the authorities. However, if retail merchants needed coarse grains and had no way to inquire, they would be accosted and interrogated in the vicinity of Caishi Street by two or three people impersonating detectives, dressed in Chinese and Western clothes, who would check passersby in that section of the road. If they saw someone with a coarse grain business residence permit, they would be dragged into a small alley to threaten and extort them. This has become commonplace. The industry has suffered a lot, so it is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention. I previously submitted a request to the municipal government to restore the original market in order to balance supply and demand and avoid corruption. All grain merchants in the industry hope for early approval. (Xing Zhigang)
