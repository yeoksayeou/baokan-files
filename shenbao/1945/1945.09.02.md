### Labor Strike on Two Railways Resolved After Mediation; Traffic Expected to Fully Resume Today

The entire staff of the "Central China Railway Company" suddenly went on strike the afternoon before yesterday, resulting in the suspension of afternoon train services on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line yesterday. It is understood that the "Central China Railway Company" has approximately 30,000 employees. Due to the impending closure of the "Central China Railway Company," they presented four labor demands to the Japanese side the day before yesterday:

Four Demands

Each employee should be paid a termination fee of 3 million pseudo-currency yuan. Salaries and due rations for September should be issued in advance. Before the "Central China Railway Company" is handed over to our government, all proceeds from ticket sales should be kept in the custody of the Chinese authorities to prevent further embezzlement and absconding by ticket sellers. All equipment in the railway bureau should be inspected and sealed by the Department of the Two Railways and relevant Chinese authorities to prevent theft. After this incident occurred, the Party Headquarters of the Two Railways immediately dispatched Commissioner Chen Fan-ke to the North Station the day before yesterday to mediate with the employees and the "Central China Railway Company," and also met with the Vice President and Director of the Administration Bureau of the "Central China Railway Company" to discuss solutions.

No Progress

As a result, no progress was made, and all employees immediately went on strike the evening before yesterday. Yesterday morning, Commissioner Chen went to the "Office Area" of the North Station again, convened a meeting of all employees, and instructed them that maintaining transportation was of utmost importance. He said that if they were serving the country, they could even endure hunger. All locomotives at the North Station are ready to depart. If our side has troop movements or the government has needs, the vehicles can be dispatched immediately and there will be no impact due to the strike. However, passenger trains will only resume service after the Japanese side has provided a satisfactory response.

Mediation Meeting

The Party Headquarters of the Two Railways convened a mediation meeting at 2:00 PM, inviting employee representatives and the person in charge of "Hua Tie." Director Shi Yushou, Commissioner Chen Fan-ke, and Commissioner Chen Fuhai from the Ministry of Transportation attended and presided over the meeting.

### Turning Sorrow into Joy

— Cheng

Mao Zedong responded to Chairman Jiang's invitation and flew to Chongqing. When we saw this news, we felt instinctively happy, because the clouds in front of us were gradually dispersing.

Why is that? At a time when the United Nations is handling the acceptance of Japan's surrender, and the National Government is unifying the acceptance of surrender and demobilization, Zhu De's telegram suddenly appeared. It is not necessary to consider whether our common people's views are theoretical or not, but at this time and at this moment, this phenomenon is always disappointing. Moreover, after eight years of hardship, once there is light, there is still this unexpected event. How can it not be disappointing?

Now that Mr. Mao can go there, it shows that there is a sincere intention for unity. Then all problems can be solved with sincerity and mutual understanding. Everyone enthusiastically celebrates the victory of the War of Resistance and national unification, turning sorrow into joy. How can it not be pleasing?

### Talking About the Northeast

— Rebirth

The war has lasted for eight years. The compatriots in the occupied areas have been struggling in hell every day for eight years. How can they not be surprised to be liberated today? Recently, they have also received comfort from their compatriots in the inland areas, which is extremely joyful!

But has the war only been eight years? Has our good country only been occupied for eight years? You are eager to say "yes." No, you must be surprised by my question. Then I have to cry out loud. Is there only eight years of national humiliation in the occupied areas? Compatriots, have you not thought that the real national humiliation has been fifteen years? That is seven years more than the eight years you are eager to say. The "September 18th Incident," you may have remembered it. The Northeast is also an occupied area, but it has been occupied for a full fifteen years.

The suffering they have endured in fifteen years is deeper and more bitter than yours. You are in hell, and they are in the sea of bitterness. But as slaves to a conquered nation, they will never abandon themselves because of this, but still have a spirit of lonely and unyielding resistance to give the enemy all kinds of blows. They are rich in silence and taciturnity. They do not shout loudly, but bury their heads to work and suffer. Therefore, the occupiers there are also most uneasy, and the means of suppression and brutality are endless. To give an example, the occupiers are doing a lot of defensive work there, trying to build the border into an impregnable fortress, surpassing the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line! So, every day, countless workers are transported by train. These poor people who were conscripted from Latvia are working day and night like horses and cattle until their muscles are exhausted, their blood is dry, and they can only silently lie down and enjoy eternal rest. How painful and heartbroken their relatives must be to lose their limbs and their flesh and blood. However, they endured and swallowed the sour tears. Thousands of people have only one heart—thinking about the motherland, and one belief—believing that "Poland" will not be destroyed.

Therefore, they would rather die than help the invaders achieve their dreams. On the contrary, there is only resistance. So, when the Allied forces invaded, many places were easily recovered, catching the enemy by surprise. On the one hand, it can be said that it is entirely due to the spirit of resistance achieved by the compatriots.

Three years ago, the author, with a certain mission, went to the puppet country to do some inspection work. For two of those three years, he was detained in a barren desert area on suspicion of something and listed among the conscripted workers under the guise of reformation, doing so-called defensive work. He ate chaff and soil, wore military uniforms, and drank mud water, living a hellish life that people could not imagine. He was often beaten and left in ditches when he was sick. The author escaped five times, and four times he returned to the tiger's mouth. The strangeness of the torture and the cruelty of the execution were even worse than the harsh laws of the Qin and Han dynasties. Although he suffered cruel torture, he was fortunate not to be fatally injured. With a breath of life remaining, he must be a bird of destruction. In the end, he relied on the blessings of heaven to escape the hell on earth. Thinking about it today, I still shudder.

### Victory

— Liu Zhizheng

The national flag flutters, the whole country rejoices; the victory of the War of Resistance, the whole world celebrates together; to get the sleeves, the revival of China; the country building must be thanks, the world is one big family! (Yet reward)
