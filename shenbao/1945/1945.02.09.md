### Fierce Street Battles Unfold in Manila; Japanese Army Displays Iron-Blooded True Form

Luzon Base, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Enemy troops, attempting to rapidly invade Manila, have now assembled a large number of Philippine bandits and approached the vicinity of Manila on the night of the 3rd. At this time, the Japanese naval landing force and army units, in close cooperation, launched an ambush in the east and north of the city, quickly unfolding a fierce street battle. At the same time, the lines of the station and the Malacañang Presidential Palace were secured, and fierce fighting with the attacking enemy troops is continuing. When the enemy troops repeatedly invaded Manila, they threw incendiary bombs everywhere in an attempt to burn down civilian houses. As a result, the Malacañang Palace and the bustling streets of Manila were surrounded by raging fires, presenting a tragic scene. The elite Japanese troops, in this raging fire, still firmly defended their strongholds and engaged in fierce battles, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy troops. On the other hand, a portion of the enemy's parachute troops and bandit groups attacked the south of Nichols Airfield on the afternoon of the 5th. As a result, both attacks were repelled by the Japanese army units in the southern region. On the same evening, a commando team jointly organized by the Japanese army and navy fiercely attacked the enemy's tank group and infantry positions, causing the enemy troops to collapse. In addition, the Japanese naval and army units in the Clark Field area cooperated and continued a fierce artillery battle on the flanks and backs of the enemy's main force, which was rushing south toward Manila, fully demonstrating the true posture of the Japanese iron-blooded marine corps. To date, it has been confirmed that a great victory has been achieved, with 20 enemy tanks and several armored vehicles destroyed, and 2,300 enemy soldiers killed.

Philippine Front Line, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A total of approximately 511 British, American, Dutch, and Norwegian prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camp near Cabanatuan in central Luzon Island fell into the hands of the United States on January 30. They are all disabled and incomplete.

Great Damage to the Enemy at Lingayen

Philippine Front Line, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy at Lingayen, divided into two groups, one advancing north along the Luzon Plain and the other detouring east along the mountains, has been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army and suffered enormous losses. The battle situation in various locations is as follows: The Japanese army in the Clark area still secures the high ground west of Bamban and engages in fierce battles with the enemy, even preventing the enemy from using the airfield. The enemy troops have suffered great damage from the accurate shelling and fierce attacks of the Japanese army's first-line assault teams. To date, the battle results have included 31 tanks aground and burned, 2 armored vehicles, 35 vehicles destroyed, 5 artillery pieces, 2 mortars, and many other machine guns and automatic rifles. Six vehicles, machine guns, 14 heavy and light machine guns, and two artillery pieces were captured. 3,264 enemy corpses were abandoned, and the enemy's losses have reached more than 7,000. The Japanese army at Muñoz, besieged by the enemy, resisted alone and still secured the position. Since the 4th, they have shelled the concentrated enemy, and the morale of the soldiers is extremely high. Umingan and Lohaos-San Jose, north of Muñoz, are currently under attack by superior enemy forces. On the 5th, the enemy's ten-company, which possessed half of the 150mm howitzers, attacked with artillery. Until noon, the enemy launched a large-scale attack on the Japanese army's first line and was once repelled by the Japanese army. At 2 pm, the enemy army attacked the foothills again, and a fierce bloody battle has unfolded. In addition, the front line on the front of Lingayen Bay has not changed much. The enemy army has also been fiercely attacking the Kampooan, a key point on the Baguio mountain road, but the Japanese army's position has not been shaken. The soldiers have been launching assaults for days, making life unbearable for the enemy. The battle results achieved by the mountain artillery team up to January 25 totaled 848 enemy soldiers killed. Other results included sinking two large landing craft, destroying one mortar, three barrack sites, and dozens of military supply accumulation sites, and capturing three machine guns and many ammunition.

### Common Sense about Air Raids

At a time when the frontline battles are extremely fierce, enemy aircraft are also bombing rear cities with increasing frequency. The following is an abridged translation of a conversation on common sense about air raids by Dr. Motoyoshi Takemura, director of Iidabashi Hospital in Japan, for the reference of air defense workers and the general public.

Incendiary Bombs and Fire Extinguishing

The incendiary bombs used by American aircraft are made of a mixture of flammable and easy-to-extinguish grease and non-flammable and durable raw rubber. During the air raid on Hamburg, the incendiary bombs dropped by American aircraft were filled with substances made by dissolving fragments of old car tires and the like in carbon disulfide and combining them with yellow phosphorus. When this type of incendiary bomb explodes, it spreads the burning raw rubber as much as possible in order to cause a fire. As for its weakness, the flame is quite weak, and its instantaneous maximum temperature is less than 1,000 degrees. Wooden things such as pillars, if wetted with water, will take 20 minutes to burn, and sometimes they will extinguish themselves without being extinguished. As for personnel, as long as they wear complete air raid clothing, even if they encounter the flames of this type of incendiary bomb, they will not be burned. There are many such examples. When this type of incendiary bomb falls, the key to fire-fighting activities is to prevent the flames from spreading. Where a fire has already started, try to wipe off the burning material. The appropriate steps for extinguishing a fire are: cool with water, isolate oxygen, and then it can be extinguished simply by stepping on it with your feet.

Bombs and Burial

Common Sense about Air Raids

After a 250-kilogram bomb is dropped, depending on the hardness of the soil, it can usually spray up a minimum of 100 cubic meters of sand and soil, creating a funnel hole approximately five or six meters deep and approximately twelve meters in diameter. The area within a radius of approximately six meters around it is within the "soil vibration power circle." The weight of 100 cubic meters of sand and soil is considerable, and it is by no means easy to endure when it presses down. Furthermore, the soil vibration caused by the explosion of the bomb is enough to cause the air raid shelter to collapse. Therefore, when building an air raid shelter, efforts should be made to consolidate its earth walls and minimize its depth and width.

Few people die immediately after being buried by the sand and soil excavated by the bomb. The reason why the general mortality rate is high is because there are still many regrets in the work of excavation, rescue, and artificial respiration. Therefore, tools for excavation must be complete, and in the case of hard soil, excavation should be concentrated in one place, and excavation should not be carried out from several points at the same time, in order to quickly connect with the air inside. According to known experiments, one person can survive in one cubic meter of air for two to three hours. In such a case, fresh air is more precious than blood, so smoking or burning fire, which increases carbonic acid gas, should be absolutely prohibited in the shelter.

If the person who is rescued still has body temperature, the mud in their mouth and nose should be removed and artificial respiration should be performed. Do not give up hastily if you do not see results. In short, it is important to know the correct artificial respiration method.

Burns and External Injuries

Most burns during air raids occur on the face. Simply wearing a helmet is useless, so do not forget to protect your face with a headscarf. However, a waterproof face covering is ineffective for preventing fire. As for women, they should be most careful about their hair catching fire during an air raid. If a head of black hair is unfortunately on fire, severe burns are inevitable.

There are four characteristics of injuries during air raids, namely: (1) the types of injuries vary; (2) many people are injured at the same time; (3) one person has multiple injuries; (4) it is unclean. When providing rescue, appropriate treatment must be given depending on the nature of the injury.

Similar to burns, more than 50% of external injuries occur to the head, and this part is most likely to suffer fatal injuries, so special attention must be paid.

When enemy aircraft attack, it is also necessary for those engaged in air defense, in addition to wearing helmets, to have a headscarf that can completely protect the head and chest. This is similar to the case of preventing burns. If the thickness of the headscarf is three centimeters, it can withstand fragments from anti-aircraft shells with a speed of approximately 50 meters per second.

In short, complete air raid clothing can fully prevent burns and external injuries. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, January 5)

Editorial

### The Enemy's Air Raid Strategy

Due to the tenacious nature of the battle on Luzon Island, the enemy is intensifying its aerial offensive in other areas in order to respond to the operation. The enemy has repeatedly carried out continuous air raids in Taiwan, South China, and even mainland Japan and some major cities in Central China, which has had a significant impact.

The main, direct military purpose is to attempt to contain the military strength of the Allied Nations, and to disperse the Allied air force in order to leave a part of the air force and air defense equipment to defend key rear areas of the Allied Nations, which have been subjected to extensive air raids, thereby weakening the defense force of the Philippines. However, in fact, the air defense forces of the Allied Nations are strong and well-equipped everywhere, and the air defense measures are very thorough, so it will definitely not affect the battle in the Philippines.

Secondly, the enemy's air raid strategy also attempts to disrupt the Allied Nations' reinforcements and supplies to the Philippines, and to intercept the supplies for the Allied forces in the Philippines. The reason why Taiwan has been subjected to particularly strong air raids is partly because the enemy believes that Taiwan is the most important supply base for the Allied Nations in the battle in the Philippines. Therefore, not only are the air raids strong, but the enemy has also dispatched mobile units to operate in the Bashi Channel south of Taiwan and the South China Sea. Most of the enemy aircraft flying to Taiwan, Okinawa, South China, Hong Kong, and other places for bombing are carrier-based aircraft from these mobile units. However, on the one hand, due to the activity of the Allied Nations' Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, the enemy's mobile units and enemy aircraft are unable to use their skills. On the other hand, due to the effectiveness of the escort by the Allied Nations' escort units, the supplies to the Allied forces in the Philippines have not been greatly affected.

Another attempt of the enemy's air raid tactics is to destroy our rear production. Therefore, more attention has been paid to the Allied Nations' military industry production areas. The enemy is extremely jealous of the Allied Nations' rapidly developing production power in recent years, especially the rapid progress in aircraft production, and must destroy it. However, the Allied Nations not only have heroic air defense soldiers, but also determined industrial soldiers, and no destruction can achieve its purpose.

In addition, the enemy is also attempting to use air raids as a nerve war and disrupt the peace and stability of our rear. The main purpose is nothing more than to shake the morale of our people in the rear, thereby affecting the frontline operations. In fact, the vast majority of people in various parts of the Greater East Asia have long had the determination to annihilate the British and American aggressive forces, and no nervous offensive can shake their determination.

Regarding the enemy's wishful air raid strategy, the Allied Nations' air defense forces can naturally cope with it militarily without any problems, but we must all recognize that the destruction of the people's lives in the rear and the destruction of the military strength of the front line are equally important in the enemy aircraft's air raid strategy. Of course, we have no fear of enemy air raids and deal with them calmly, but in order to ensure that the enemy's air raid strategy achieves nothing, we should make full preparations for possible air raids so that we can do our best to assist the Allied Nations in the war. Those who do not need to stay in Shanghai should make plans for evacuation as soon as possible. To resist the enemy's inhumane air raid strategy, all citizens must rise up spontaneously.

### German Defense Forces Counterattack on Both Sides of Frankfurt; Part of the Soviet Army Attacks Stettin

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - A German news agency dispatch: According to an announcement by local military authorities, the fighting on both sides of Frankfurt, downstream of the Warta River, has entered an extremely fierce stage, but because the Soviet army has not yet completed the concentration of its tanks, it cannot be considered a decisive battle. Soviet infantry are attacking on a ninety-kilometer-wide front, supported by motorized artillery. The enemy intends to gain a foothold on both sides of Frankfurt on the west bank of the Warta River, but the German army immediately counterattacked, driving the enemy into the icy river. German artillery suppressed enemy artillery positions, causing most of them to cease firing, and the German air force also strongly supported the counterattack. The German defense forces in Kustrin (east of Berlin) repelled a concentrated enemy offensive, forcing them to adopt a defensive posture. The Soviet army is preparing a large-scale offensive, and a part of it may attack Berlin from Frankfurt, while another part will attack Stettin and the mouth of the Oder River. The attack on the city of Stettin has already begun.

### Economic Bureau Uncovers Fraudulent Impostor

The Municipal Economic Bureau recently received a confidential report stating that there were criminals impersonating officials to commit fraud. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately dispatched personnel to secretly investigate. As a result, they discovered the Hongtai Feng Cloth Store at No. 379, Great Shanghai Road, where a young man named Li Shan claimed to be ordered by the Central Ministry of Industry to investigate price limits. Before leaving, he took away two bolts of white cloth. This was witnessed by an officer dispatched by the bureau, who immediately apprehended Li and brought him in for questioning. They found that he carried a forged employee ID from the Ministry of Industry. The official documents were stamped with a wooden seal of the “National Government Ministry of Industry,” and the minister's signature was completely different from the official documents received from the ministry. It was clear that he was an impostor committing fraud. The Taishan Road Police Bureau was immediately notified to arrest the criminal for interrogation.

### Central Reserve Bank to Issue 1000 Yuan Notes; Finance Minister Zhou Issues Statement

In order to alleviate the difficulty of a shortage of cash in the market and eliminate the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the National Government has specially approved the issuance of 1000 yuan notes by the Central Reserve Bank to stabilize the financial situation. Finance Minister Zhou issued a statement yesterday: For several months, the cash flow in the market has been insufficient, and merchants and people have felt difficult. They have repeatedly requested the issuance of 1000 yuan notes to meet the needs. At that time, the government insisted on prudence and did not lightly approve it. Recently, due to the Lunar New Year, stores and factories need cash to settle accounts and pay wages, so the cash shortage is even more severe, leading to premiums and numerous abuses. Commercial banks and companies have various restrictions on depositors withdrawing cash, which has a very shallow impact on finance. In order to eliminate the above-mentioned difficulties, eradicate the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, and smooth the currency flow, the government has specially approved the issuance of 1000 yuan notes by the Central Reserve Bank to stabilize the financial situation. This is a measure to alleviate the difficulty of a shortage of cash in the market, and all our merchants and people should be mindful of this intention. If anyone takes the opportunity to raise prices or disrupt the financial situation, they will be severely punished by law without leniency.

### Today is Air Defense Day; Hope for Serious Drills; Talk by Secretary Cao of the Air Defense Headquarters

Today (9th) is the 14th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters is expanding publicity about the meaning of air defense as usual and implementing various air defense training exercises. Citizens should seriously practice under the guidance of police and security personnel. Cao Jingang, the chief secretary of the headquarters, gave a speech stating: "Today is the 14th Air Defense Day. At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly critical, the implementation of this year's expanded training suddenly takes on a significant meaning, I’d like to make some remarks to inform all the citizens of Shanghai. According to the usual methods of warfare, whenever the war enters a decisive stage, the number of enemy air raids will inevitably increase day by day. If various air defense measures cannot be actively and thoroughly implemented, the result will inevitably be some unnecessary and extremely heavy losses. Past experience is sufficient to prove this, especially since the current era is an era of total war. The people, regardless of gender, and regions, regardless of front or rear, in other words, everyone is a soldier, and every place is a battlefield. Air defense work is the most important part of operations. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all the citizens of Shanghai will make every possible effort to assist the air defense authorities. Even if it is known to be an exercise or training, they must take a serious and active attitude. In this way, all aspects of evacuation and rescue work and skills can be mastered. In the event of an air raid, they will naturally be able to calmly cope, both avoiding unnecessary damage and contributing to social security. This is something that citizens should deeply understand and practice under the wartime system. In the past, during Air Defense Day, some citizens did not pay much attention to it. We firmly believe that those who suffer serious damage under air raids will inevitably be those who are usually indifferent to air defense. Therefore, we hope that starting from this Air Defense Day, with the joint efforts of the authorities and the citizens, we can awaken the awareness of air defense work among all citizens, which will be of great benefit to the defense array of Great Shanghai. Furthermore, the citizens should familiarize themselves with the current air defense regulations, so that their actions during training days or various alarms can be adapted accordingly without any inconvenience."

### Police Bureau Colleagues Hold Tea Party to Send Off Deputy Director Su

Mr. Su Chengde, the former Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, has been transferred to the position of Director of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau. All senior officials of the Police Bureau specially held a tea party yesterday (8th) afternoon at 5:00 PM on the seventh floor of the bureau to send him off. It was hosted by Deputy Directors Du and Lu, and more than 200 senior police officers, including the directors and deputy directors of various divisions, the chiefs and deputy chiefs of various sections, and the directors and deputy directors of various branches, enthusiastically participated. Mr. Su arrived on time. First, Deputy Director Du Zhenjian delivered a farewell speech, stating: "Director Su is honorably transferred to the position of Director of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau, and we are here today to send him off and express our congratulations. Looking back, after the return of the concessions, the merger of the One Three and Two Bureaus, and the merger of the One Two Bureaus, the complex police organization was unified. Director Su made twelve times the effort to improve the difficult police tasks, especially paying attention to the lives of the police and making painstaking efforts for the consumer cooperatives. He brought his past experience and his researched police knowledge to play as much as possible, for which we are deeply grateful. We were relying on Director Su's utmost guidance, but the government, for the sake of needing talent, honorably transferred him to the position of Director of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau, which is a pity. However, we expect Director Su to continue to develop. I, on behalf of all my colleagues, express my infinite respect to Director Su and wish him progress." Then, Director Su delivered a thank-you speech, saying: "Today, I am very grateful for your warm reception amidst the tension of police affairs. At the same time, it is a great pleasure to be back on the seventh floor of the Police Bureau today, 'reuniting' with my old colleagues again. Just now, Deputy Director Du has praised me, and since taking over the concession, I have received guidance from Deputy Director Du and cooperation from all my colleagues, gaining a lot of knowledge and learning a lot of experience, for which I am very grateful. The task of the Police Bureau is to maintain law and order, and the task of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau is to establish law and order, so the goal is the same. In the Greater East Asia War, the task of maintaining law and order in the rear is very important, and we can only cooperate and must achieve the same goal." After the speech, tea and refreshments were served, and the guests and hosts were in a harmonious mood. The party ended at around 6:00 PM.

It is reported that the Education Bureau is currently dispatching personnel to secretly investigate and stop the practice, and plans to submit the findings to the Municipal Government for review and action.
