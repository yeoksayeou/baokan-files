### Japanese Special Water Attack Unit Launches Operations in Okinawa Seas; Sinks or Destroys 32 Enemy Ships

Ryukyu Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Special Water Attack Unit, operating in the Okinawa area, has achieved the following cumulative results from March 28th to May 13th: Sunk one cruiser, six destroyers, two large transport ships, seven landing craft, and ten other ships; destroyed one landing craft (presumed sunk), one transport ship (believed sunk), one vessel resembling a minesweeper, two ships ablaze (unidentified), and one medium-sized transport ship.

Enemy central and northern airfields were also attacked by Japanese aircraft, with fires breaking out at four locations.

Ryukyu Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the night of the 15th, Japanese air units attacked enemy airfields on Okinawa Island, causing fires in several locations after hits. Enemy aircraft attacks on the Ryukyus numbered only about one hundred that day.

### American Aircraft Carrier Task Force Suffers Extremely Heavy Damage

Southwest Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a British aviation lieutenant shot down and captured by Japanese forces in the Yaeyama Islands area, the British carrier task force departed from Ulithi Harbor in early May to relieve the American carrier task force in the southwestern island group area, which had been heavily damaged by intense Japanese attacks, in order to strengthen its forces. The prisoner stated that the American carrier task force suffered extremely severe damage, losing 45 percent of its carrier strength and 49 percent of its other ship strength. Therefore, the British voluntarily proposed the replacement. The British fleet force departing from Ishigaki Island reportedly included two special carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and twelve destroyers.

Southwest Pacific Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At 10:00 AM on May 10th, Japanese aircraft discovered a large enemy submarine surfaced in the Southwest Pacific and launched a large-scale attack. The enemy submarine was hit by two bombs, and oil slicks appeared on the surface of the sea, indicating it had sunk. At 5:00 PM on the 11th, two enemy submarines were discovered navigating. Japanese aircraft attacked the submarine in the lead, hitting the conning tower, and it soon sank.

### Fighting Intensifies in Southern Okinawa

Tokyo, (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces on the Okinawa Island front are engaged in fierce fighting with enemy forces, who are attempting to break through Japanese lines north of Naha and Shuri. On the night of the 13th, numerous suicide squads charged into enemy lines in the Aza area north of Naha, throwing the enemy into a state of confusion. On the night of the 14th, a continuous and fierce offensive was launched against the entire enemy line, and the offensive continued unabated on the 15th, further intensifying the battle. Japanese forces in the eastern coastal area continue to secure their positions north of Yonagusuku, repeatedly repulsing attacks by the American 7th Division. Enemy forces have penetrated Japanese lines in several locations from the central highlands to the western coastal front. The enemy has penetrated from the heights north of Hirara-cho, a suburb north of Shuri, to the Uebaru area north of Yonagusuku, to the area north of Gushikawa, and from the Aza area to the Asato area northeast of Naha. In the area north of Naha, two battleships, two cruisers, and five destroyers approached the Naha coast, repeatedly attacking under the cover of naval bombardment. However, Japanese forces are securing their established positions, resolutely defending the Asato and northern Naha areas, and repelling the enemy's attempts, currently thwarting the enemy's plans. Since the enemy landed on the island at the beginning of April, the enemy force entering the southern area has reached as many as six divisions. Due to the brave fighting of Japanese forces, the 96th and 27th Divisions have lost their combat effectiveness and have retreated. Currently, the enemy's 1st Amphibious Corps, consisting of the 7th Division in the eastern coastal area, the 77th Division and the 1st Marine Division in the central highlands north of Shuri, and the 6th Marine Division, which has been transferred from the Nago Bay area to the north of Naha, a total of four divisions, have all suffered heavy casualties due to the brave and courageous fighting of the Japanese elite forces. Japanese units in the central part of the island are currently cooperating with local residents to continue their brave repulsion, putting the enemy in a difficult situation.

### Enemy Troop Casualties on Okinawa Island Increase Sharply

Central News Agency dispatch - The battle situation in Okinawa has now reached a fierce stage where every inch of land is contested. The enemy in the southern part of the island seems to have launched a full-scale general offensive, but despite the enemy's abundance of supplies, the repeated sinking of warships and aircraft by Japanese forces has forced them to reveal their pessimistic mood. The Nimitz communique often publishes how minor their own losses are. According to U.S. Army spokesman Major H. Elivar, although Japanese aircraft attack daily, American facilities on the Okinawa Island coast have not suffered any major damage. The U.S. military's tactics are to cut off supply routes and hinder Japanese resupply, so the enemy claims that the battle of Okinawa is not being rushed to victory. Since the enemy invaded Okinawa, their ships have been repeatedly sunk and damaged, totaling 80% of their total strength. The enemy's boasted East Asia return voyages have now been eliminated by Japanese forces, resulting in major chaos in the enemy's convoys. U.S. Tenth Army Commander Lieutenant General Buckner cabled that he cannot expect much success, and the New York Times editorial also stated that the Pacific War has already entered a direction of slipping away, and the fighting there is too fierce, causing heartache to our people, and because the war is a chaotic battle, heavy sacrifices are inevitable. According to intelligence, when the battle of Okinawa began, the enemy's main forces were the 96th and 27th Divisions of the 25th Army Corps. These two divisions have been completely wiped out by Japanese forces, and the other four armies have also been badly battered. In their anxiety to make a final stand, they have launched this general offensive. Since the beginning of the battle of Okinawa, 3,967 American soldiers have died, but this number is not complete. According to U.S. Tenth Army Medical Officer Colonel Frederick H. Horstweiler's announcement this month, in the war in the central Pacific, personnel losses were roughly 6% to 8% dead. According to the enemy, in the American war in Europe, the military loss rate, including both dead and wounded, was only 2.8%, indicating the heavy losses suffered by the enemy in this invasion of Okinawa Island. Regarding the reason for such an alarming mortality rate, Colonel Horstweiler said that due to the lack of field hospitals on the various Pacific fronts, as of this month, more than 6,000 American soldiers wounded in the battle of Okinawa have been transported by aircraft to the rear. This plan to transport the wounded is the largest in scale in this war in terms of distance. According to the Colonel, the need for military hospitals is great in the European theater, so medical work in the Pacific is being neglected, with only field hospitals for garrison units. The Colonel hopes that a base hospital will be established in the Pacific now that the European war has ended. He also said that at the beginning of the Okinawa operation, American losses were very light, but today they have reached a high rate of 200 to 300 people per day, but hospital facilities remain the same. The Colonel kept secret the mortality rate of combat personnel wounded since the beginning of the Okinawa battle, but said that since the beginning of this operation, more than 2,000 soldiers from the army and more than 4,000 sailors have been transported by aircraft to the rear, so 10 aircraft are dispatched daily to carry wounded and sick soldiers, and it is expected that this will increase soon.

Editorial

### Observations on the Enemy American Political Future

In terms of personal fate, Truman's succession to the presidency after Roosevelt is perhaps a piece of good luck, but in terms of the fate of American politics, it is truly the misfortune of American politics to have Truman as the wartime leader of the United States. This misfortune is caused by Article 60 of the American Constitution. Although American officials, congressmen, nationals, and frontline soldiers all know that this is a preordained "imperial robe addition" farce, they are helpless because of the provisions of the Constitution.

According to American political custom, the people avoid all criticism as much as possible during the first 100 days of a new president's term, so that the new head of state can embark on a normal track. Truman was naturally no exception at the beginning of his term, and because of the urgency of the world situation, in order to reduce the political impact after Roosevelt's sudden death, even the opposition party had to perfunctorily accept Truman's appointment. However, in fact, American citizens' political feelings had already been shrouded in darkness.

Although President Truman's term has not yet reached 100 days, we can predict from the situation in the month since he took office that his political future will be rugged and not very optimistic. The first test he encountered in politics was the opening of the San Francisco Conference. The nature of the American people is exaggerated and self-superior. They have unlimited expectations for the San Francisco Conference, believing that they can convene representatives of dozens of countries on a part of their territory to discuss issues that dominate the world. Therefore, they have even greater hopes for the activities of their own head of state. However, unexpectedly, Roosevelt died suddenly, and Truman was just an "ordinary old man growing out of the darkness", unable to play the role of director on this world stage, which made the American people feel universally disappointed.

Therefore, Truman's political future faces both an international political crisis and a domestic political crisis. On the international political stage, the experienced Roosevelt still had to be deeply vigilant in front of Stalin and Churchill, and Truman was of course difficult to stand on an equal footing, let alone lead. In this San Francisco Conference, the weakness of the American attitude and the strong statements of Soviet representative Molotov both showed Truman's lack of prestige and lack of political skill.

In domestic politics, Truman's mediocre ability is even less sufficient to control the army and navy, direct diplomatic figures, or deal with members of various parties and factions in Congress. Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the First World War, while Truman was only an artillery captain at that time; Roosevelt was elected four times and served as president for 12 years, while Truman was only elected as a senator in 1934. His qualifications are far from comparable to Roosevelt's. Recently, the Republican Party in Congress launched a fierce attack on the tariff reduction bill left by Roosevelt, which is a reflection of Truman's lack of political power.

Truman was trusted by Roosevelt because he served as Chairman of the Senate Military Production Investigation Committee in 1935 and achieved some success in military production. In this way, Truman seems to be able to be confident in the mobilization of American national materials, but now the American people are considering the post-war economic recovery. If Truman continues to implement strengthening wartime economic institutions, he will inevitably be fiercely opposed by the business community.

Truman said when he took office that he would take Roosevelt's policies as his own, but just like driving a carriage, although it is the same route and the same horse, because of the different skills and abilities of the driver, it is often either stumbling due to rushing or failing to reach the original ideal due to slowness. Truman is an ordinary driver. I am afraid that he will not be able to adapt to the environment and control himself.

In recent years, American democratic politics has been trending towards dictatorial politics because Roosevelt has concentrated political power as much as possible. The more it is in the form of dictatorial politics, the more talented the political leader must be. Truman is certainly not a suitable candidate, and the political power of the United States will inevitably be dispersed and lose its balance of power. The American people are very emotional, and public opinion is quite noisy. In the near future, Truman will inevitably encounter harsh accusations and strong criticisms, so the misfortune of American politics will become even more profound. Due to the domestic political crisis, it is very likely to affect the changes in the war situation. In short, because of Truman's political poverty, the tragedy of American politics will inevitably be exposed to the world soon.

### Nagoya Air Raid: Three-Hundred-Year-Old Historical Site Bombed and Reduced to Ashes

Nagoya, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Honmaru Palace and the five-story, seven-tiered main tower inlaid with golden dolphins, which embody the essence of Eastern architecture and classical splendor, were all historical sites with three hundred years of history. Unfortunately, they were reduced to ashes at 8:20 AM on the 14th of this month. At around 8:05 AM that morning, enemy aircraft dropped incendiary bombs, which were extinguished for a time. However, at 8:20 AM, a large enemy formation heavily bombed Nagoya. The Honmaru Palace, the main tower, the Otemon Gate, the Omote-nimon Gate, and the Kiyomasa Stone Gate, all known for their magnificence and luxury, were all reduced to ashes. The male and female golden dolphins, which had not been completely evacuated, also suffered fire damage. However, the national treasure paintings and artworks stored in the palace, except for the murals, were not looted because they had been moved elsewhere. The indiscriminate bombing of Nagoya Castle, which is known for its golden dolphins, is a barbaric artistic act by an enemy that boasts of culture but does not understand what culture is.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacked Southern Korean Waters Yesterday

Seoul, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Korean Army Administration Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 16th that from 8:30 AM to 2:50 PM on the 16th, two enemy B-29 aircraft and six PBM aircraft, each in formations of two, attacked southern Korean waters from the sea west of Jeju Island and then gradually fled to the southwest.

Fukuoka, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, enemy PB M-3 Catalina patrol bombers have appeared in the Korean Strait and the sea west of Kyushu, either individually or in pairs, aiming to disrupt Japanese transportation lines. At around 10:00 AM on the 15th, two invaded the sea west of Nagasaki Prefecture and blindly attacked ships, etc. After being discovered by Japanese air defense forces, one was immediately shot down near Ukujima Island. The other was hit and attempted to escape, but was also shot down.

### Damage in Taichung is Currently Under Investigation

Taipei, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 15th, approximately 90 enemy bombers, taking off from bases in the Philippines, attacked the Hsinchu area. A part of them attacked the Taichung area, and after 2:00 PM, they retreated south. Also, two B-23 aircraft invaded Taipei City that morning. The extent of the damage is currently under investigation.

### Japanese Suicide Squads Active in the Tarakan Airfield Area

Southwest Frontline Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy forces on Tarakan Island have subsequently attempted to attack the airfield area and the area around the Jojoike-Ikedadai area, conducting reconnaissance with small-scale forces. Japanese forces have inflicted heavy blows on them in front of the lines. Furthermore, suicide squads have launched night attacks to disrupt the enemy's efforts to reinforce their positions and mount an offensive. Due to the fierce attacks by Japanese forces, the enemy's losses have increased. Since the 11th, the battle lines have been deadlocked. The use of the airfield is out of the question, and even the oil field construction is impossible. Especially in the airfield area, Japanese suicide squads have engaged in desperate activity. On the night of the 13th, numerous suicide squads also launched attacks, killing or wounding more than 142 enemy soldiers and destroying and burning many of their barracks and supply depots. To guard against attacks by Japanese suicide squads, the enemy has hung alarm bells around their positions and campsites, lit them up brightly, and taken strict precautions.

### American Japanese Are Frequently Targeted by Snipers

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, as the fighting on the Pacific Front has intensified, antipathy towards American Japanese in various places along the Pacific coast has also increased. According to a statement released by the Washington Wartime Forced Relocation Bureau on the 14th, in the past four months, there have been two assassinations, fifteen sniper attacks, six attempted bombings, three arson cases, and five forced encounters in California. To cite more specific examples, it is reported that in California, thugs fired two shots at Mrs. Sekisaka Motosetsuko, an elderly woman of 61 years old, with a pistol. One bullet grazed the old woman's head and hit the wall. Also, in Tarbant, in that state, a group of thugs attacked a woman named Masuda.

### Southern Youths Receive Military Education

### Enemy Ships Sunk in Davao Bay

Frontline Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 15th, Japanese naval units attacked enemy ships in Davao Bay, sinking two transport ships.

### Associated Reserve Bank Issues New Hundred Yuan Notes

Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Bank of China Joint Reserve Bank issued new hundred-yuan notes on May 16th. The front side is orange-red and printed with a brown image of the Yellow Emperor. The reverse side is printed with images of the Summer Palace and other scenes.

### Municipal Canteens to be Established Throughout Beijing

Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Due to rising prices and the increasing difficulty of people's lives, especially for general civil servants, the Chinese and Japanese authorities in this city have decided to select suitable locations in many places to open municipal canteens, specifically for Chinese and Japanese civil servants to eat. The prices will be set at particularly low levels to help stabilize the lives of civil servants.

### Finance Ministry Official Explains Current Financial Policies: Gradual Success in Stabilizing Finance

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Finance Ministry official met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters in the capital at 3:00 PM on the 16th and provided a concise explanation of the current financial policies of the National Government. The main points are summarized as follows:

### Improving the Treatment of Civil Servants

(Question) Given that the cost of living is currently high, has the government considered improving the treatment of central civil servants? (Answer) The government has always been concerned about the issue of civil servant treatment, but it is limited by the overall financial budget of the National Government and cannot be compared with general commodity prices. However, within the possible scope, we are determined to seek improvement. Starting in the second half of the year, the wartime allowance will be considered for further increase to help stabilize living standards. Detailed measures are currently being formulated.

### Enthusiastic Subscription to Gold Certificates

(Question) What is the impact of the issuance of gold certificates on the National Government's finances? (Answer) The purpose of issuing gold certificates is to contract the currency supply and stabilize finance. After the first phase was issued, due to sufficient reserves, subscribers were unusually enthusiastic, exceeding the expected number and withdrawing more than 100 million in currency. The results were very good. The second phase is also being prepared for issuance, which will be of great benefit to the National Government's policies to stabilize finance. (Question) How have the results been since the wartime special consumption tax was changed to be collected by local governments in each province and city starting in January of this year? (Answer) The general results after the special consumption tax was collected by local governments have been good, but because this tax is very trivial and complicated, there are many discrepancies in the amounts submitted to the central government from various places.

### Difficulties in Salt Transportation and Sales

(Question) What is the current situation regarding salt transportation? (Answer) The current lack of smoothness in salt production and sales is not due to a reduction in production, but purely due to transportation difficulties. On the contrary, production is actually higher than before the shift. Because traffic cannot be smooth during wartime, transportation and sales cannot be smooth. The Salt Administration is currently actively consulting with all relevant parties on transportation issues and striving to improve the situation.

### The Exchange Rate Between the Two Currencies Remains Unchanged

(Question) Recently, there have been many rumors about the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes, causing black market prices to rise significantly. What are your thoughts on this issue? (Answer) Under the current circumstances, the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes will definitely not change. The rise in the black market is purely due to the actions of speculators.

### Preventing the Influx of Customs Gold Units

(Question) Customs Gold Units from the Chongqing side have recently been flowing into the "peaceful" areas. This will undoubtedly affect the financial situation of the government. Has the Ministry of Finance considered measures to curb this? The Ministry has also repeatedly heard about the influx into "peaceful" areas, mostly carried by individual peddlers, with the sole purpose of taking advantage of price differences in various regions to make a small profit, not deliberately disrupting the financial system. Furthermore, the amount flowing in is negligible, so the government has not yet considered specific measures to prohibit it. Strict inspections by local authorities should suffice.

### Current Situation of the Battle of Okinawa: Japanese Army Holds Absolute Advantage, According to Neutral Observers

Regarding the Okinawa operation, American reports have always been optimistic, so people in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, also believed that conquering Okinawa was only a matter of time. However, recently, the American news has reversed its previous attitude. In particular, the Nimitz communiqué repeatedly stated that "fierce battles" were taking place in all parts of the Okinawa front. Military experts are also criticizing the Okinawa war from new perspectives. According to a military expert in Stockholm, the recent counterattacks by the Japanese special attack forces have been very effective, causing the United States to lose a large number of ships, making resupply extremely difficult. This fact is difficult to conceal. He also stated that the battles in the next ten days will be extremely important and will have a great impact on the entire Pacific war situation, thus acknowledging that the Okinawa war is indeed a decisive battle.

What is even more noteworthy is that the Soviet Union has also broken its silence of the past and suddenly published an article entitled "The Pacific War" in the Red Star newspaper on April 18 (written by Navy Major U. A. Liabchuk). The article strongly stated that the Okinawa war is extremely important and will determine the future of the Japanese-American war situation. This indicates how concerned the Soviet Union is about the war situation in the area. An abridged translation of the main points is as follows:

"The American troops who landed on the main island of Okinawa had advanced to the east coast of the island by April 1, attempting to cut off the Japanese army. However, the recent resistance of the Japanese army has obviously increased, and the American advance has therefore slowed down. As of April 12, the American army had occupied a quarter of the island and was approaching Naha. However, the Japanese army dispatched reinforcements to Okinawa from the Amami Oshima area at night using small ships, and used the air force to attack American warships. As a result, fierce naval and air battles have broken out in this area between the Japanese and American forces, with both sides suffering heavy losses. In addition, the British Pacific Fleet has also joined the battle there. Because this battle is taking place within the operational zone of the Japanese Navy and base air force, the Japanese side has a far more advantageous position than the British and Americans. The distance from Saipan to Okinawa for the American army is more than 1,500 miles, while the Japanese side only needs a few hours from Kyushu to the Ryukyus. Therefore, the air power that the anti-Axis powers can rely on in the battle area is only the aircraft on ships and the air force from the land airfields that have already been occupied. In short, it is still difficult to determine the outcome of the war in the Ryukyus. However, it is clear that the British and American naval and air forces have encountered the courageous resistance of the Japanese air force and naval forces." (Stockholm Special Dispatch, April 24, Translated from the April 24 Yomiuri-Hochi)

### Random Notes on Nanxiang

— Zhi Cheng

Nanxiang is located north of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, in the western suburbs of Shanghai, and is one of the important towns in Jiading County. Before the incident, transportation was convenient, shipping was developed, and commerce was prosperous. Moreover, because land prices were low and the scenery was beautiful, many people from Shanghai bought land and built houses here. Today, it is threatened by artillery fire, rubble is everywhere, ruined walls fill the eyes, and commerce is depressed. However, it is a necessary route for transporting rice and grain from the inland (Tai, Kun, Chang, etc.) to Shanghai, so the market depends on it for support. Currently, there is a population of 37,965 people, which is still relatively dense given the town's current area.

### Scenery and Prices

In the past, Guyi Garden and Nanyuan were scenic areas in the suburbs of Nanxiang. The clear waters and lush trees inside were more than enough to decorate the area, making it a popular place for recreation. Now, it has been completely changed, all destroyed by artillery fire.

Returning to the town from the garden, rice vendors can be seen coming and going along the way, either carrying it on their shoulders or transporting it in carts, clogging the road. Asking about the price of rice, they say that it has been rising gradually recently due to the imbalance between supply and demand. Today (May 7), it is around 110,000. Facing the main street, shops are lined up side by side, with two or three teahouses among them, always full of customers, talking about nothing but the hardships of life. General prices are slightly higher than in Shanghai, probably because railway transportation is inconvenient, and they rely only on highways. After being exploited by multiple checkpoints, vendors can only raise prices to make a profit. Logically, vegetables should be cheaper, but in fact, during the market season, local produce is transported to Shanghai as much as possible, causing an imbalance in the supply and demand in the place of origin, and the price immediately rises, sometimes even higher than what is sold in Shanghai. This is also an abnormal phenomenon.

### Current State of Education

There are a total of thirteen primary and secondary schools in the town, with just over 1,600 students. In the northwestern suburbs, there is also the Nanxiang Rural Primary School, run by Jing'an Temple in Shanghai, with a total of over 100 students, all of whom are village children from the vicinity. Considering the number of school-age children in the town, many are out of school. According to educators, setting up more single-grade primary schools is the only way to remedy the situation, but the authorities can only barely maintain the existing schools. How can they create new schools? This can only rely on enthusiastic educators to find a way. Tuition fees are more expensive in private schools. As for teachers' salaries, county schools provide three dou of rice per month, plus a subsidy of 200 yuan. The travel expenses are far above this amount, so most teachers are unwilling to go to the county government to collect it. Private school teachers receive about 60,000 yuan per month including rice subsidy (excluding board and lodging), and primary school teachers receive 40,000 yuan. As for the teaching staff, due to salary issues, ordinary teachers are only junior high school normal school graduates. If they are high school graduates, they are already rare.

### Burden on the People

Most of the residents in the town are middle and lower classes who can barely make a living. They are extremely tired from coping with life because there are so many taxes and levies, such as: civil servants' rice donation, police rice donation, baojia expenses donation, business tax, income tax, field tax, field rent, and so on. There are also public expenses that must be shared by each household. The heavy burden on the people can be imagined. A small number of tenant farmers rely on smuggling for a living after the busy farming season, but extortion along the way is inevitable. The pitiful situation is beyond words.

### Market Conditions and Transportation

It is now the Lesser Bountiful Festival. In previous years, the town was bustling with activity, purchasing various goods. This year, it is far from what it used to be. In front of the local goods stores, there is a lack of customers. Let alone other stores. This reflects the exhaustion of the rural economy and the weakness of the people's purchasing power.

The local fields used to be "70% cotton, 30% rice," but in recent years, the price of rice has been much higher than that of cotton. Therefore, most farmers have converted cotton fields to grow rice in order to make a large profit, resulting in a situation of "70% rice, 30% cotton." The authorities, aware of this, have joined forces with the China Central Cotton Improvement Association to encourage villagers to plant upland American cotton and work together to increase production in order to reverse the downward trend and meet the needs of the war.

Next to the highway at the edge of the market, in addition to cars and rickshaws, there is recently another type of vehicle: rice vendors using their rice-hauling tricycles to carry individual passengers directly to various places. The price is cheaper than rickshaws, and the speed is faster. This is also a product of the times.

### Chongqing Strengthens Price Controls

According to a Chongqing broadcast by the Central News Agency: Recently, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Chongqing Municipal Government to strengthen price controls immediately. It is reported that the Chongqing Municipal Government, after receiving the order, has formulated eight management measures to set official prices for general commodities, and merchants are not allowed to raise prices arbitrarily.

### Ambassador Oshima and Others Detained by U.S. Forces

Zurich, 16th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from Paris stated that the U.S. Seventh Army Headquarters announced on the 15th that Lieutenant General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, and a group of 130 people are currently being detained by the U.S. Seventh Army and protected as a diplomatic corps.

### U.S. and Soviet Union Conduct Loan Negotiations

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington: Negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the payment methods for short-term loans to the Soviet Union had once stalled, but it is rumored that there may be a possibility of further negotiations recently. This short-term loan is intended for the Soviet Union's domestic reconstruction. The amount required by the Soviet side is still unknown, but the total amount hoped for is approximately several billion U.S. dollars.

### Australian Representative Attacks American Regionalism: Another Storm at the San Francisco Conference

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco: After first attacking American regionalism on the 14th, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt issued a statement exposing the American conspiracy against representatives from Central and South America, causing another storm at the San Francisco Conference. The statement stated that if the authority of the Central Security Council cannot be maintained, Americanism will emerge in an isolated form. The new international organization that will soon be created is bound to collapse. The American Security Protection System is merely planned by the United States alone, intending to place the Americas in its own pocket. The intention of the United States is none other than to use its qualifications as a permanent member of the Security Council to exert dictatorial power, allowing the American region to secede from international organizations and do as it pleases. The United States wants to separate American regionalism from international organizations and has repeatedly demanded that Central and South American countries abandon the proposal to increase the number of Security Council members from eleven to fifteen. If this is the case, the future of the international organization is unimaginable. The American advocacy of regionalism has been met with direct opposition from Australia, putting the American representatives in a dilemma.

### New American Proposal Gains Agreement from Three Nations

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to an American communiqué: U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius proposed yesterday, "We urgently need to draft a 'Charter of International Freedoms,' as this charter is an indispensable first step for the new international organization." At the same time, Stettinius told a group of reporters that he firmly believes that the Economic and Social Council in this new international organization should establish a certain standard of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.

### Secret Underground Structures in Berlin

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - A public statement from Moscow relayed by Reuters special correspondent described the situation in Berlin: Soviet forces examining Berlin's "underground city" have discovered deep tunnels, passages, basements, factories, supply depots, and other underground structures. Most Berlin residents were as unaware of the existence of these underground structures as outsiders. These underground structures were closely guarded by the German government or local authorities, and foreigners were prohibited from entering. Even the guards stationed at the entrances only knew about the nearby doorways, and officials who entered only knew about the parts they occupied. In addition, Soviet forces discovered the special bomb shelters of General Goering and Goebbels. Goering's shelter was equipped with steel walls that no shrapnel could penetrate. Goebbels' shelter was 60 meters deep and housed his family and close subordinates. It also contained a sophisticated amplifier that allowed him to broadcast his final speech of "perpetual resistance" to soldiers on the front lines from the underground shelter. The most elaborate underground structure was located near the Gestapo headquarters, where Soviet forces found a large number of firearms and ammunition in a steel-walled room.

Hamburg's pre-war mayor, Croment, remained in office after the British occupation.

### Financial Institutions Tighten Remittances to the Interior: Assist Authorities in Relieving Cash Shortages

Recently, the amount of cash in circulation in the city has been quite insufficient. The Central Reserve Bank, in order to coordinate the fellow banks' positions, provides as much cash as possible for withdrawal. Among them, some unscrupulous banks hold onto the cash and charge premiums. The general public suffers premium losses when they need cash. The Central Reserve Bank is aware of this and, in order to eliminate premium flow and stabilize finance, has ordered strict inspections to crack down on it. It is also reported that various financial institutions in the city are implementing tighter remittance operations to the interior in order to help relieve the cash shortage, refusing to accept unnecessary remittances from merchants to the interior.

### Food Rice Supply Gradually Smoothed After the Lifting of the Blockade

For years, most of the city's food supply has come from the areas along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, with the supply determined by the smoothness of transportation and the changes in the local management structures and supervision methods. Recently, the blockade organizations in various counties and districts of the city have been ordered to be completely dismantled, and all inspection work will be stopped starting from the day of the announcement. Therefore, the transport of food rice to Shanghai has gradually become smoother, and the supply seems to be increasing daily. According to sources in the rice industry yesterday, the daily arrival of rice has increased by about two-fifths compared to the past. At the same time, citizens are also not stocking up excessively and have stopped large-scale hoarding, so the supply and demand are relatively balanced. It is expected that the city's food supply can be maintained stably for a long time.

### Small Newspaper Federation: Executive Reporting Officer, Department Head Matsudaira, Attends and Delivers Speech

The Shanghai Special City Small Newspaper Federation held a reception yesterday at the Kangle Restaurant to welcome the Allied Japanese Reporting Officer and the newly appointed Propaganda Director Gu Senqian.

Chairman Wang Xue delivered the welcoming address, stating: "This is the first time that small newspapers have made such large-scale contact with the Chinese and Japanese authorities. In the past, small newspapers contributed little to society and the nation. Fellow professionals also acted independently, lacking unity. Now, propelled by the great era, the Small Newspaper Federation has been established, shouldering the responsibility of promoting culture together. We firmly believe that in the future, through common unity and effort, small newspapers will contribute their utmost to various cultural undertakings, welfare work, and cooperation in the Greater East Asia War for the nation and society."

### Matsudaira's Speech

Department Head Matsudaira then delivered a speech, stating: "Small newspapers already have a certain history. In the future, by uniting and exerting their strength, they will definitely make significant contributions to the promotion of national and social culture, as well as the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Small newspapers are important for cultural work done through side channels. However, cultural work through side channels is also important at present. There are many ways to propagate information, but newspapers have the greatest power and effect. Therefore, newspapers bear a significant mission. This time, under the guidance of former Propaganda Director Liu, the Small Newspaper Federation was established. We would like to express our deep respect to Mr. Liu. At the same time, we deeply appreciate the efforts of the leaders of the small newspapers who have prepared and established a sound organization. In the future, we will do our best to unite and work diligently in our respective positions, and we wish the Small Newspaper Federation a glorious future." After the speech, the guests and hosts toasted each other, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious.

### Fire on Yuyao Road: Generous Donations from All Sectors

The unprecedented fire on Yuyao Road in western Shanghai has left thousands of people homeless. This department has begun to collect donations to provide relief to the disaster area, which has aroused widespread sympathy throughout the city. Donations have poured in, totaling more than 1.8 million yuan in one day. An anonymous donor has also donated clothing and miscellaneous items, for which we are deeply grateful. However, the disaster is severe and the need for funds is great. We earnestly hope that enthusiastic members of the public will continue their efforts to provide generous assistance to alleviate the urgent needs and achieve significant results. We look forward to it!

### Temporary Relief Committee Promotes Work

Wu Quan and Yuan Jiping have been appointed as general managers, Guan Fu and Zhu Wenyao as fundraising managers, Wu Yongping and Huanzhang as accountants, and Song Jinyi and Wu Songquan as relief managers, actively promoting relief efforts. The local gentry and businessman Zhu Shunlin and others have expressed their willingness to actively solicit donations and have been added to the committee. As for the recent relief work, in order to improve the method of distributing food, an temporary population certificate for disaster victims has been printed in consultation with the Huashan Branch, so that the food can be distributed with the assistance of the Baojia chiefs. Benevolent individuals from all walks of life who wish to donate, whether in cash or in kind, can entrust the committee to handle it. In order to clarify the procedures, all donations will be transferred to the Social Service Department of this newspaper for collection. The status of food distribution in recent days is as follows:

### Calling for Better Treatment of Elementary School Teachers

The recent surge in prices has caused panic among the general wage-earning class, especially the impoverished elementary school teachers. They teach during the day and grade papers at night, toiling all day long without any free time. They cannot take advantage of their professional positions to seek extra income, nor do they have capital to invest. Superficially, the school authorities have increased tuition this semester to improve teachers' salaries. However, it is now common to see teachers earning 10,000 yuan a month without board. Although the Education Bureau, out of consideration for the teachers, has provided special rice subsidies, for some reason, these allocations are neither distributed on time nor according to the predetermined amount of three dou per month. Even if they receive the full amount, it is barely enough to maintain their own personal lives! As for supporting families, it is even more difficult to imagine!

As far as I know, the children of elementary school teachers suffering from lack of education are too numerous to count! Earlier last month, the daughter of an elementary school teacher in the same neighborhood starved to death because she had no food to eat. Such tragic situations are almost unbelievable unless one witnesses them firsthand. Yet, they do not lose heart. They are very clear about their position and the importance of their responsibilities. They not only endure hardship and work hard to serve the next generation conscientiously, but also manage to find time to continue their education.

We cannot stand idly by and remain indifferent to the hardships faced by these elementary school teachers who bear a sacred mission. It must be understood that although they have an outstanding spirit, they are still flesh and blood and cannot withstand so much suffering! If their health is affected or they even sacrifice themselves as a result, it will be a loss to society. Even without children, who would not want their children to be educated by good teachers? For the sake of one's own children and for the sake of the future society, I sincerely hope that enthusiastic members of the public, in the spirit of human mutual assistance, will quickly provide effective assistance to these elementary school teachers who are dedicated to education. - (Yan)

### Record of the Shanghai Representatives Visit to Jiangsu Province

— Ding Er

Motivation for the Visit: Shanghai is the economic center of China, and Jiangsu Province is the most fertile region in China. Whether in history, geography, or military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, Shanghai and Jiangsu have a necessary and close relationship. It can even be said that Shanghai is the heart of Jiangsu, and Jiangsu is the body of Shanghai. The administration of Shanghai should have close ties with the administration of Jiangsu. Businessmen in Shanghai should take a cooperative attitude toward the government and the people of Jiangsu for the sake of Shanghai and Jiangsu. A month ago, when Governor Ren of Jiangsu Province was in Shanghai, he strongly emphasized the necessity of future cooperation between Jiangsu and Shanghai at the welcoming banquet of the business community and hoped that the business community in Shanghai could often go to Jiangsu for inspection. The organization of this visit to Jiangsu by Shanghai representatives is based on this motivation, on the one hand, to respond to Governor Ren's kind invitation, and on the other hand, to express the enthusiasm of all sectors in Shanghai for cooperation with Jiangsu.

The main points that need to be discussed clearly with the Jiangsu Provincial Government are roughly the following four points: First. The wartime population evacuation problem; Second. The problem of the development of small factories in Shanghai to various parts of Jiangsu; Third. Shanghai's private lending to farmers in Jiangsu Province; Fourth. The issue of the construction of the Suhu (Suzhou-Shanghai) highway.

### List of Members

This visit was organized by well-known figures from all walks of life in Shanghai. The list is as follows: Yuan Deng (Head of the delegation), Advisory Committee member, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Chen Riping (Deputy Head of the delegation), Committee member, Population Evacuation Committee member, Deputy President of the Xinwen Bao. Xiang Kangyuan (Deputy Head of the delegation), Advisory Committee member, Population Evacuation Committee member, General Manager of Kangyuan Biscuit Factory. Wu Yue (Secretary General), Chief Editor of Shen Bao. Huang Jingyuan, member of the Population Evacuation Committee. Xu Guanying, Manager of Xin Ya Construction Company. Shen Changfu, General Manager of China Commercial Bank, Standing Director of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Wang Haiju, General Manager of Global Trust Bank. Wang Xiuzhen, Deputy Manager of China Chemical Industry Company. Pan Jueming, Chief Supervisor of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Head of the Sixth Section. Rong Ziyun, General Manager of Sanle Food Company. Shen Tongyi, Principal of Nanyang Model Middle School. Cao Youzhi, Reporter of Xinwen Bao. Chu Zhiqi, Reporter of New China News, etc.

### Itinerary

Day One (12th): 8:00 a.m., visit departs from Shanghai Station. Although the visiting group had previously contacted China Central Railway, after being received at the station by personnel from China Central Railway, an assistant named Mou rudely stopped them, highlighting the poor attitude of some staff at China Central Railway towards passengers. After the host explained in many ways, they were able to enter the station and catch the train. Arrived in Suzhou at around 2:00 p.m. Yuan, Director of Education of Jiangsu Province, Wang Maoxin, Chief of the Political Affairs Department, Chen Zhanru, County Head of Wu County, had been waiting for a long time, and there were youth groups from the Jiangsu business community lined up to welcome them, which was deeply appreciated.

In the afternoon, the delegation visited Governor Ren at the Provincial Government. First, Yuan, the head of the delegation, stated the purpose of the visit. Chen, the deputy head of the delegation, clarified the profound meaning of the integration of Shanghai and Jiangsu. Xiang, the deputy head of the delegation, warmly presented a plan to use Dongting Mountain as a population evacuation area. Governor Ren generally agreed with the opinions of Shanghai with an earnest attitude and gave detailed instructions on the local situation and practical steps.

In the evening, Governor Ren hosted a banquet at the hall of the Provincial Government. Jin Yuyu, Director of the Liaison Department, Xu, Commander of the Jiangsu Garrison, and Pan, President of the Chamber of Commerce were present. During the banquet, Minister Jin Jin expressed his welcome to the Shanghai business community representatives and sincerely expressed his intention to contribute to the cooperation between Jiangsu and Shanghai.

On the second day, after visiting various relevant government offices and civil organizations, they visited Mudu and Lingyan for sightseeing. On the morning of the third day, at 7:00 a.m., the visiting group took a boat at Wanshou Bridge in Xumen, Suzhou, and under the leadership of Chen, the County Head of Wu County, and Liu, the Director of the Police Bureau, they headed to Dongting West Mountain, the ideal evacuation area. It took three or four hours to travel from Mudu, Xukou, into the vast Taihu Lake to West Mountain.

### Inspection of West Mountain

The general situation of West Mountain can be briefly reported as follows:

Terrain: West Mountain is isolated in Taihu Lake, with an area of ​​72.5 square. The circumference is 90 miles, with small islands and undulating hills, a unique landscape.

Townships: West Mountain has two towns and eight villages, namely Donghe Town, Xiaoxia Town, Huili Town, Zhenxia Village. Lucun Village, Qixian Village. Qianwan Village, Dongyuan Village, Hanzhi Village, Tang Village. Each village and town is responsible for the village and town affairs.

Baojia (Neighborhood System): The entire area has a total of 72 bao, 716 jia, 7,319 households, and a population of 15,771 men, 13,272 women, a total of 29,043 people.

Public Security: Each township has a self-defense team of approximately 1,000 people, with outposts for liaison. In the event of an emergency, they can be concentrated at the district office within 18 minutes. The police have one patrol officer and twelve constables. The equipment is currently being prepared. There is also a backup Allied Force to assist in the police force.

Cultivated Land: There are 895 mu of cultivated land, 20,027 mu of open land, 42,617 mu of mountain fields, and 3,874 mu of bare land.

Products: The main products are fruits, especially the famous loquat and waxberry. The next is silk cocoon, about 2,000 dan per year. This year, due to last year's huge losses, farmers are mostly not raising silkworms. The tea is the famous Biluochun, with an annual output of 300 dan, and there are also green limestone (raw material for making lime), bluestone, and other products. Unfortunately, the local rice production is very small and mostly relies on nearby counties.

Baoshan and Shicheng coal mines are located at Tianwangmenkou, Nanxu Village, Donghe Town, West Mountain. Each company produces about 50 tons of coal per day. The mined coal is mostly supplied to Suzhou Power Company. However, the mining methods are all traditional and there is still much room for improvement.

Education: There are two district-established elementary schools, eight village-established elementary schools, and two private schools, with a total of 1,353 students. The number of school-age children enrolled is still small.

Transportation: There are steamers moored at Yangqiao, Suzhou, outside Xumen, Yong'an Lane, and Chichaguan Wharf. On West Mountain, there are the Qiuxian Village Houbao, and other shipping coal ships coming and going.

West Mountain belongs to the 13th district of Wu County. The district chief, Jin Baiqing, is a local of West Mountain and is quite capable. He has promised to cooperate with the evacuation work. West Mountain was once assigned by Hua Yanyun, director of the Suzhou Office of the Population Evacuation Committee, to Xu Xianzhang, Xu Lichang, Xu Xiang, Zhu Rongqing and others to be responsible for investigation and preparation. The village chiefs are all famous people, and the district chief is also the honorary consultant. A thorough investigation of the local public property and empty houses is currently underway, estimating the total number of displaced people that can be accommodated. A comprehensive plan for the import of food and the development of local production businesses is also underway.

### Gains of the Trip

On the fourth day (15th), Sun, Director of Jiangsu Province Construction, happened to return from inspecting Wuxi. A meeting was held at the Weihai Restaurant. During the banquet, Director Sun said that a new line of the Suhu Highway will be built soon, running parallel to the railway from Shanghai directly to Suzhou, shortening the original route by one-third. It is expected to be completed in late July. At that time, the connection between Shanghai and Jiangsu will inevitably become closer. After the banquet, the visiting group took a train from Suzhou Station and returned to Shanghai.

In summary, the gains from the visit of Shanghai representatives to Jiangsu Province can be summarized as follows:

The Jiangsu Provincial Government expressed full approval and assistance for the issues of population evacuation, development of small factories, and agricultural loans raised by the Shanghai business representatives.

The visiting group traveled through wind and waves, personally visited Taihu West Mountain for inspection, and demonstrated the spirit of practical action by representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai.

The Suhu Highway is about to start construction, and closer Shanghai-Jiangsu relations can be predicted.
