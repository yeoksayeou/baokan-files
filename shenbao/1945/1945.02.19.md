### Eighteen Enemy Ships Destroyed Near Iwo Jima; Four Enemy Landing Attempts Repelled

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 18th: (1) On the morning of the 17th, a Japanese submarine attacked an enemy task force in the sea west of Lingayen, sinking one aircraft carrier, one cruiser, and one destroyer. (2) Regarding the results achieved by Japanese air units and defense forces against enemy ships around Iwo Jima since the 16th, the following are added: three cruisers sunk, three ships of unknown type sunk, two minesweepers sunk, four landing transport ships sunk, one cruiser damaged, and five landing transport ships damaged. Furthermore, the results of one cruiser sunk and three ships of unknown type sunk have been removed.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – Since the morning of the 16th, enemy forces have been intensely bombarding Iwo Jima in an attempt to invade it. Around 11:00 AM, under the cover of artillery fire, they attempted to land using two transport ships, but were immediately repelled by the Japanese defense forces on the island. Subsequently, around 5:00 PM that afternoon, the enemy attempted to land four times, using twelve landing transport ships, around 2:00 AM and 10:00 AM on the 17th, but were all repelled by the Japanese forces, inflicting significant damage. Simultaneously, with the cooperation of Japanese air units, a fierce attack was launched against the enemy fleet near the island. As announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the 18th, the achieved results have been further expanded. On the 16th and 17th, 76 enemy carrier-based aircraft and 13 SBC-type aircraft were shot down.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The enemy task force around Iwo Jima attempted to land at Nigenhama on the southwest corner and "Mt. Kami Beach" on the southeast corner of the island around 10:30 AM on the 17th. They suffered significant damage and were repelled by the fierce Japanese counterattack. Afterwards, they released smoke screens in the Nigenhama area to allow boats to approach the coast, but the enemy's attempt was clearly just a feint for reconnaissance. Around 12:00 PM, the enemy ceased the boat activity and continued to position their main force south of the island, continuing to shell the Japanese coastal positions until 6:00 PM on the 17th. Not a single enemy soldier was seen on Iwo Jima. The Japanese defense forces continued a fierce artillery battle with the enemy fleet at sea, and the Japanese, holding a complete defensive position, suffered minimal damage despite the intense enemy shelling.

### Japanese Forces on Corregidor Launch Counterattacks; Japanese Forces in Manila Bravely Fight the Enemy

Luzon Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces are launching fierce counterattacks against enemy forces landing on Corregidor Island. On the 16th and 17th, they launched fierce attacks against enemy ships around the island, sinking one cruiser, one ship of unknown type, and one minesweeper.

Luzon Front, 17th (Central News Agency) – The street fighting in Manila is gradually expanding towards the mountainous areas northeast of Manila. Elite new units of the Japanese army, waiting for an opportunity, began a widespread counterattack from the night of the 14th, fighting everywhere under the cover of air support, causing increasing casualties to the American forces. In the afternoon of the 14th, enemy forces in the northeastern outskirts of Manila began shelling Montalban. On the night of the 14th, numerous Japanese commando units attacked Marikina in Rizal Province, taking the enemy by surprise and inflicting great damage. That same night, other Japanese commando units divided into two groups, infiltrated the eastern suburbs of Manila, Sampaloc, and launched attacks simultaneously from the first district of Diliman. By dawn on the 15th, they had driven out the enemy forces from the area. The Japanese defense forces have repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on enemy forces attempting to advance eastward from Bulacan Province. From the 11th to the 14th, the confirmed results of the battles include over 500 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 35 trucks and military vehicles set ablaze, and a large amount of ammunition and food captured. There have been no major changes on the northern front. On the night of the 12th, a unit of enemy forces attacked the Japanese positions in San Jose, resulting in a bayonet fight, after which the enemy retreated in defeat. Enemy forces in the Santo Tomas area are currently constructing fortifications. Furthermore, the enemy airfield in Lingayen, San Fabian, and Dagupan has approximately 330 aircraft of various sizes. On the northern front, the enemy has apparently begun using the Clark Airfield in the skies above the Japanese positions.

### War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia in One Week

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia in one week is as follows:

Japanese Mainland

In the Ogasawara area, the main force of the enemy naval force appeared on the southeastern sea off the mainland on the 16th, with a naval fleet including battleships and cruisers, leading landing boats approaching Iwo Jima, using naval gun fire. From morning to afternoon, the 58th Task Force commanded by Mitscher also launched attacks with a total of 1,000 carrier-based aircraft on airfields in various areas of Kanto. The attacks continued on the 17th. As the enemy landing boats approached the south of Iwo Jima on the evening of the 16th, their ambition to capture the island became even more evident. The purpose of the enemy's attack is to remove the Japanese forward line that threatens the Mariana base and attempt to obtain a small base to attack the Japanese mainland. There must be a considerable force waiting behind the enemy task force, so the development of the war situation in that area next week is of great significance.

Manila Area

Nimitz Headquarters stated that the B-29s invading the Omiya Island area are gradually increasing their air power, and the naval forces are also gradually increasing.

Morotai Island

Regarding the Morotai Island area, the Japanese forces in Morotai still maintain a strong defensive position in the jungle for prolonged bloody battles. Recently, they have repeatedly carried out bayonet charges, causing the enemy to suffer many casualties. Since the enemy landed, the confirmed results of the battles include 4,616 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 10 enemy cannons destroyed or burned, 113 enemy shelters and material storage sites destroyed, and a large amount of other weapons, ammunition, and fuel destroyed.

China Area

Xinyu was captured on the 7th of this month, and contact was established in the area on the 8th. The elite Japanese forces that annihilated the Suiqian base group are currently expanding their war results.

Burma Area

The main force of the Chinese Yunnan Expeditionary Army invading the area near Wanting in northern Burma has been advancing along the Stilwell Road towards northern Burma since early February, with the aim of defending the Japanese troops near Kunming and Nanpata. Since the 7th, they have been reorganizing their battle lines, and the 23rd Division of the newly formed First Army has appeared in the south of Nanka Bridge to attack the enemy. From February 20th of last year to February 5th of this month, the comprehensive war results in that area include 30,000 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 29 enemy aircraft shot down, 5 large guns and 1 tank captured or destroyed, 5 heavy trucks captured, and 377 heavy and light machine guns captured. The enemy forces in the Mandalay area have been intensifying their offensive against Mandalay. The fighting around the area has been quite fierce in the past week.

Arakan Area

The enemy's actions on the Kangaw front are quite active, and they are currently facing off against the Japanese forces at close range. The Japanese forces on Ramree Island are engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy forces in Yeu, achieving great results through repeated raids. Furthermore, on the 11th of this month, Japanese air units attacked enemy ships cruising in the northeast channel of Ramree Island, sinking one destroyer and damaging one cruiser. On the 12th, they attacked enemy forces gathered near the Irrawaddy River. On the 13th, they attacked a new enemy airfield in the jungle 50 kilometers west of Pegu, destroying five enemy aircraft on the ground.

Zhoupu Communication

### A Visit to the First District Administrative Inspector's Office of Shanghai Special Municipality

— Yifei

On the afternoon of January 26th, the weather was sunny, with only a few colorful clouds adorning the sky. Following the directions of a local, the reporter found the "First District Administrative Inspector's Office of Shanghai Special Municipality" and was soon led to the reception room upstairs. The room's furnishings were quite simple, and everything was very tidy. The most striking thing was the horizontal scroll written in Commissioner Zhou's own hand, "Integrity and Love for the People," which hung high on the wall. Soon, Commissioner Zhou's secretary, Mr. Ju, came out to meet me. The reporter and Mr. Zhou had been classmates at the London School of Economics and Political Science in England, and after twelve years, we met again in Zhoupu Town, which was quite gratifying. After exchanging pleasantries, I asked Mr. Zhou to briefly explain the work and current situation of the Commissioner's Office.

Organization and Motivation of the Commissioner's Office

The reporter first asked about the motivation for establishing the office and the internal organization. He replied, "As early as last July, during the tenure of Acting Chairman and Mayor Chen, in order to promote national policies and strengthen county administration, we first planned to start with the seven counties under the city. Since the seven counties are on the periphery of Shanghai, their administrative quality and the establishment of public security have a significant impact on Shanghai, so at that time, the seven counties were divided into two administrative districts: Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, and Shenjiang were assigned to the First District, while Chongming, Baoshan, and Jiading were included in the Second Administrative District. Each district established an Administrative Inspector's Office to be responsible for administration and supervision." At this point, the reporter asked if there was any precedent for this system in China's administrative history. He replied, "According to the Qing Dynasty, there were offices for provincial investigating commissioners and circuit intendants, and during the suppression of bandits in the seven provinces in the 21st year of the Republic of China, Administrative Inspector's Offices were also temporarily established, but they were all different in nature from the current 'Commissioner's Office.' The current organization of 'Commissioner' is a central government official, and his duty is to supervise the administration of the county governments. Therefore, he does not concurrently serve as the local county magistrate (according to the latest announcement from the Ministry of Interior, Administrative Inspectors can concurrently serve as county magistrates). He only carries out the intentions of the central government to supervise the administration of the county governments in the district." Then, speaking of the internal organization of the office, Mr. Zhou said, "What I can be pleased with is that before taking office, I had the determination to wash away the accumulated bad habits of the past officialdom and never employ a private individual. Moreover, all are hired locally. For example, the current inspector of the office, Wang Jingzhai, was the section chief of the former Shenjiang County Government; Secretary Fang Qian is from Nanhui County, and they are both very familiar with the local situation, which makes it easier to promote administration. The others all have specialized knowledge and years of experience in the education sector, or are graduates of military academies. They all have excellent views on training the people and establishing public security. As for the internal organization, it is divided into several groups, and each group leader is concurrently appointed by the office staff. Currently, there are ten office staff, six appointed and four concurrently appointed, two secretaries, and four inspectors.

Reasons for Restoring County Governance

The reporter asked, "When I came to inspect the Nanhui area a few months ago, I found many malpractices during the Special District Office era. Although there have been improvements in administration since the restoration of county governance, it has not yet reached the ideal state, and the problems still exist. I hope you can tell me a thing or two." He replied, "In the past, the organization of the Special District Office was nothing more than local branches of the Municipal Government in terms of administration, with no real power. For example, in terms of finance, all of the land tax revenue was taken away by the Municipal Government, and the office's own expenses were allocated separately by the Municipal Government, which often resulted in arrears. In terms of administration, the police were directly commanded by the Municipal Police Bureau, and the office could not interfere. Education administration was also controlled by the Municipal Education Bureau, and the head of the office could not intervene. Therefore, it often took a long time to handle a public affair, and the lower-level situation could not be reported to the higher-ups, so hundreds of policies were abandoned. The authorities, in view of this, in order to strengthen the power of the county government and increase its status, making it an autonomous unit responsible for communicating between the local and central governments, resolutely restored county governance in order to improve administration. However, the reason why county administration has not reached the ideal in the past six months is very complicated. In general, it is nothing more than the county government's financial difficulties and the inability to establish public security. I will tell you about these two points separately." At this point, tea and refreshments were served, and then the conversation continued.

Obstacles to the Implementation of County Administration

"At the beginning of the establishment of this office, we convened a district administrative meeting. At my suggestion, we established local budgets for the county governments so that hundreds of policies could be implemented. Furthermore, since the land tax is now collected by the counties, I also made the following recommendations on the distribution of its funds, that is, according to the percentage ratio, after 30% of the land tax revenue is submitted to the municipal government, the remaining amount should be divided into four departments, with the following proportions: (1) Public security expenses should account for 40% of the total revenue, (2) Education expenses should account for 20%, (3) Construction expenses should account for 20%, (4) Administrative expenses should account for 20%. This ideal expenditure plan was submitted to the municipal government for record, but unfortunately, it could not be implemented due to environmental factors. This is very regrettable. The reason why hundreds of policies have stalled is that everything is impossible to talk about unless the financial problems are solved."

Countermeasures to Ensure Public Security

"Looking back to the Qing Dynasty, when Li Hongzhang pacified the Nian Rebellion in the Central Plains, and more recently, during the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi, history and experience tell us that the best way to deal with roving bandits is to adopt a policy of gradual tightening of the encirclement. And the most effective way to implement this policy is to develop transportation lines in the rear and then establish strongholds along the lines, deploying heavy troops and cooperating with the local people to defend them. Each stronghold, depending on the importance of its position, should build large and small bunkers, so that in case of an alarm, it can advance to attack, retreat to defend, and wait for reinforcements. This policy could have been implemented, but it could not be thoroughly implemented due to financial constraints. With the exception of a portion of the highway that has been completed, the rest must wait for funds to be available before the project can be fully completed; and as for the bunker policy, only two bunkers have been built in Zhoupu Town."

The reporter asked, "In order to ensure local public security, in addition to the military, the cooperation of the people is very important. Has your office organized any work to train the people?" Mr. Zhou replied, "On this point, the office established a district and township leaders training center in December of last year. The total number of personnel to be trained from the four counties is 249. The first group consisted of 65 trainees, and the training period was two weeks, with purely military training. The main subjects included Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, Chairman's instructions, administrative plans, Baojia laws and regulations, official document formats, cooperative movements, agricultural production increase, self-defense group organization and training. As for practical subjects, there were infantry drills, air defense, counter-espionage, intelligence, transportation, and the inside story of the military. In addition to academic subjects, there were also group discussions on topics such as education and production increase, and celebrities were invited to give lectures at the center, instilling all kinds of knowledge in them. Afterwards, an examination was held, and 42 candidates passed the examination. The second group was temporarily suspended because the villagers valued the abolished Lunar New Year. It will be resumed in late February."

Education Funding Will Be Independent

Finally, the reporter asked again, "According to the actual situation, although the current government is working hard to govern, various plans are often hindered by the poor level of knowledge of the people, who cannot understand or accept them, which greatly hinders progress. Therefore, popular education is the most important thing. Does your office have any plans for this?" Mr. Zhou said, "On this point, I have repeatedly advocated that the education funds of each county should be independent, and that the custody of the funds should not be handled by the county government. A 'Education Fund Custody Committee' should be organized, which is semi-official in nature, that is, the head of the education section of the county government, the chairman of the county education association, and the director of the school management committee should be ex officio members, plus local gentry, businessmen, and people enthusiastic about education, to jointly organize it, with a number of about five to seven people, responsible for the planning of education in the county and the custody of education funds. This method has also been approved by the district administrative meeting, submitted to the municipal government for record, and ordered by the office to be implemented in each county. Only because of time constraints and the inherent strong influence of the past, which is not easy to eradicate at once, those who implemented it have not yet seen it. He continued, "After the education funding problem is solved, we can gradually promote compulsory schools, public education centers, organize mobile libraries, promote adult and women's supplementary education, and literacy campaigns, so that illiteracy will be reduced, and the knowledge of the people can naturally be improved, which is of great importance to the promotion of national administration."

An Alternative View

### Expectations of the Police Authorities – Speech at the Gift-Giving Ceremony on February 18th

— Chen Binhe

The Shanghai police were founded in the fourth year of Xianfeng during the late Qing Dynasty, and have a long history of ninety-one years. During these ninety-one years, Shanghai has experienced countless changes and upheavals, but each time it has been able to get through smoothly. The greatest reason for this should be attributed to the efforts of the police to maintain public security. The Shanghai police have a glorious history in the past.

The police have the closest relationship with the people, as Secretary-General Luo has just explained very thoroughly. When Secretary-General Luo was in charge of Anhui, he encouraged civil servants to say that in the current difficult period, it is not enough for civil servants to treat the people with just the word "service." Civil servants must serve the people with the spirit of children caring for their parents. I am now saying the opposite: the police are the parental officials of the people. Parents love their children, so children will also think of their parents. Therefore, when former Deputy Director Su proposed the establishment of a police consumer cooperative last year, the Citizens' Welfare Association advanced a loan of more than 3 million yuan. Recently, due to the Lunar New Year, and because police officers have low salaries, heavy responsibilities, and difficult work, there is this gift-giving initiative. Although the amount of both times is not much, the motive is very sincere. This is a sincere expression of citizens thanking their closest parental officials. Whether Secretary-General Luo says that the police should serve the citizens with the spirit of filial sons, or whether I say that the police should seek the welfare of the citizens with the attitude of parental officials, in short, the police and the people are one family. In other words, the military, police, and people should be united as one. If this is the case, then Shanghai's public security in the future can be guaranteed; the glorious history of the Shanghai police in the past ninety-one years will therefore be further developed and expanded.

Today, standing in the position of citizens, we have two expectations for the Shanghai police:

First, we expect the police of Chinese nationality. In advanced countries, the police also have the responsibility of educating the people, that is, with good police, there will be good people. If every police officer can be dedicated to his duties and abide by the law, then the people can also abide by the law. Therefore, we hope that the police can serve as a model for our citizens, and exert their greatest strength in every position.

Second, we expect the Japanese police officers. Whether in terms of training or in terms of duties, the police of the allied nation Japan have always been famous throughout the world. In recent years, the Shanghai Police Department has been fortunate to have the participation of allied police experts, which is really a matter of congratulations. Last year, a high-ranking Japanese official serving in the Municipal Government asked me what expectations the Chinese have for Japanese people serving in Chinese agencies. My answer was: I hope that they can play a model role among Chinese civil servants. Therefore, we not only hope that the police of Chinese nationality will be a model for citizens, but also hope that Japanese police officers can be a model for Chinese police officers.

Finally, there is one more point to request. Before the Greater East Asia War, during the period when the British ruled the concessions, all the regulations of the patrol room and the attitude towards the people adopted imperialist methods of treating colonies. Because of the long time, there are inevitable deep-rooted problems, and there are still a very small number of Chinese and Japanese police officers who are still using the old methods. For example, the way they treat thieves, the way they treat the business community, and the way they treat intellectuals, regardless of the seriousness of the case, there is not much difference, which makes the people afraid to approach the police and afraid to step into the police station, just like they used to be afraid to approach the patrols and afraid to step into the patrol room. Now the times have changed, the concessions have been recovered, China and Japan are allied countries, and the police are the closest parental officials of the people. Those old ideas and old methods are no longer applicable; I hope that our police authorities and allied senior police officers will quickly correct them, so that the police and the people can be united as one, and like a family, jointly take on the responsibility of defending Greater Shanghai.

### Ling Hai Chang Publishes His Views on the War Situation

(Continued from yesterday) Reporter asked: Please tell me about the actual progress of our country's new navy? (Minister replied) After the return of the National Government to the capital, based on a moral standpoint, the Allied nations successively returned coastal bases and naval vessels to our country, and cooperated in cultivating the new navy. Over the years, our navy has progressed from an embryonic stage to a new stage. During these years, this Ministry has actively trained naval officers and soldiers. Although the current strength is not yet sufficient to go out and attack the enemy, with the cooperation of the Allied naval authorities, the national coastal defense mission has been undertaken by our new navy. In the future, we will intensify the training of basic naval cadres in order to consolidate coastal defense and prevent the enemy from taking advantage of any gaps. In short, the construction work of our country's new navy has laid its new foundation. Recently, I went to Shanghai to inspect the Central Naval Academy, the Central Seamen Training Center, the Yonglu Survey Bureau, and other institutions. All the officers, soldiers, and students were full of energy and enthusiasm. After visiting the Allied naval authorities, they all expressed deep expectations for the construction of our new navy and were more willing to provide sincere assistance. Therefore, the future of our new navy is quite bright, which can be reported to the people of the country. (End)

### Soviet Forces Reorganizing, Preparing for New Offensive, German Counterattack in Upper Silesia

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports that the most important aspect of the current situation in the central sector of the Eastern Front is that the Soviet command is currently deploying its troops. This is true not only for the units surrounding Breslau, but also for General Zhukov's forces on the Warthe River front. For a week, the Soviet military's objective has been to seize the crossings of the Warthe River, after which a large-scale offensive on Berlin could be launched. However, the Soviet military has stopped the offensive during this period and withdrawn a large number of troops. The only explanation for this is that the Soviet troops involved in the Poznan area are facing transportation difficulties, making it difficult to transfer sufficient reinforcements. The Soviet command is also diverting reinforcements from the Warthe River to the Pomeranian front, and there must be an urgent reason for this special operation. The offensive fronts of Fürstenberg and Küstrin are very narrow, only about fifty kilometers long. If General Zhukov continues to advance towards Berlin, his flanks will increase by another fifty kilometers, putting the Soviet military at risk of being attacked from both sides. Therefore, General Zhukov is not daring to launch an attack on the Warthe River at this time. His basic idea is to prepare and strengthen his offensive line as a prelude to a large-scale offensive on Berlin. The Soviet military's current threatening offensive from Steinau towards the Bober and Queis rivers, as well as the westward pressure between Glogau and Grünberg, are all for this reason. Powerful general forces are intercepting the Soviet offensive in various places, forcing it to halt. The Soviet offensive near Beuthen-Anhalt has also been blocked by a German counterattack.

Finally, Mr. Chen Binhe delivered a speech (the speech can be found in the leading article on the first page). Details are as follows:

Opening Speech by Li Sihao

"Distinguished guests: Since Mayor Zhou assumed office in Shanghai and concurrently served as the Director of the Police Bureau, the rectification of police discipline has brought a refreshing change to the citizens' perception. Furthermore, since Chief of Staff Xiong has been in charge of the Security Force since last year, there have been many innovations. At a time when the stability of the rear area is urgently needed, the military and police personnel responsible for maintaining law and order are facing even greater responsibilities. The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, standing in the position of representing the citizens, expresses gratitude for the military and police's rectification of discipline and encouragement for the military and police's maintenance of law and order. In particular, in order to express our appreciation for the contributions of the police officers at various branch bureaus of the Police Bureau, as well as the guidance and service of the senior police officers from our Allied nation, Japan, we have specially presented a grant to the military and police. Although the amount is small, we hope to express our heartfelt intentions through this. We hope that in the future, the military, police, and civilians can truly become one and be as harmonious as a family, working together towards the goal of maintaining Shanghai's overall security. We are holding this grant presentation ceremony here today, and we are grateful for your presence. I would like to explain the significance of this, and I hope you will accept it. Peace and stability are greatly desired; the citizens are greatly blessed."

Farewell Speech by Yuan Ludeng

"Distinguished guests: Today, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association is holding a grant presentation ceremony for the military and police, and at the same time, we are bidding farewell to Deputy Director Su of the Police Bureau. Deputy Director Su came to Shanghai to take office when the concessions were taken over in August of the year before last. He made many contributions to the merger of the police bureaus and the unification of police administration, and we express our deep gratitude. He is now being transferred to the position of Director of the Rural Pacification Affairs Bureau. Although the title has changed, he is still shouldering the responsibility for a portion of Shanghai's security. Therefore, speaking of his departure from the Police Bureau, it is a farewell; speaking of Shanghai's overall security, it is still a welcome. In the past, the general public had a negative perception of the Rural Pacification Affairs Bureau. Now, we hope that Director Su will actively reverse these negative impressions with his work achievements after taking office, and fulfill his responsibility for a portion of the city's security. This is what Shanghai is most hoping for. We wish Director Su all the best in his efforts and health."

Report by Lin Kanghou

"In this critical period, during last year's winter defense period, under the command and direction of the new mayor and the chief, we safely passed the Lunar New Year's Eve, which shows that things can be accomplished through human effort. To rectify discipline, it must start with the upper levels, and only then can the lower levels follow. Currently, the discipline of the military and police has been strictly rectified and is gradually improving. This time, various business and industry people in this city are holding this grant presentation to express their gratitude to the hardworking military and police personnel. This grant was presented to Secretary-General Luo at the Municipal Government on Lunar New Year's Eve by Mr. Wen Lanting and Mr. Chen Binhe. Today, we are holding this ceremony to show the sincerity of the business and industry communities to the military and police officers. Wise officials can love the citizens, and the military, police, and civilians can become one. The stability of Shanghai can then be ensured, and the people place their hopes on this. On behalf of the business and industry communities, I express our sincere gratitude to the wise officials."

Response Speech by Secretary-General Luo

"Today, I am honored to be here on behalf of the Mayor and all the colleagues of the Municipal Security Force and the Municipal Police Bureau to say a few words. The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association has raised a substantial amount of money in a very short period of time to present to all the military and police personnel of the Security Force and the Police Bureau. We are deeply grateful in spirit and in our hearts. Originally, the state established the Security Force and the Police to protect local security. It is the inherent duty of the military and police to protect the local area and maintain law and order. The enthusiasm of the citizens of Shanghai gives us great encouragement, and the military and police personnel should work even harder to maintain law and order and protect the people, so that we can repay the citizens' deep love. Shanghai is a large city in our country, a large city in the East, and it can also be said to be one of the world's major metropolises. Therefore, doing evil in Shanghai is not only despised by the country and the people of the East, but also despised by the people of the world. We must be a role model for the people of the East, so that we will not be despised by the world. Our military and police personnel should fulfill their responsibilities with conscience and work hard to stabilize the security of Shanghai. In this critical period, the military and police of Shanghai have achieved some small successes in protecting the local area and loving the people, and the citizens of Shanghai have given us such encouragement. I am deeply grateful. When I was in the Anhui Provincial Government, I once warned my subordinates that it is not enough for today's military and police personnel to only serve the people. We must serve the country and society with the spirit of "sons being filial to their parents". Even when parents are critically ill, their children must still do their best to seek medical treatment and save them. Now the people are in deep water, and the people are the parents of the military and police personnel, and we should take on the spirit of children being filial to their parents, bear our responsibilities, relieve the people of their hardships, and strive to make the local area stable and the people live and work in peace. I represent the Security Force and all the personnel of the Police Bureau to thank the Citizens' Welfare Association and the citizens of Shanghai. No matter how things evolve in the future, our military and police colleagues will work even harder, regardless of success or failure. We have a clear direction and a firm determination. We will use our blood, sweat, and all our spirit to protect Greater Shanghai and do our best until the last drop of blood to complete the task of defending Greater Shanghai."

Response Speech by Deputy Director Su

"I am very grateful for the warm reception and farewell today, but I am unworthy of it. I have served as the Deputy Director of the Police Bureau for two years, and I am ashamed that I have not made any achievements. Although I am now being transferred to head the Rural Pacification Bureau, I am still responsible for ensuring the local security of Shanghai. Although the title is different, the goal and responsibility are still the same. In the future, all measures will be based on the motto of "public interest over private interest, society before the individual" that Mayor Zhou has shown us, and this will be our creed for serving and administering the government. Furthermore, at today's military and police grant presentation ceremony, I am reminded that when we planned to improve the lives of the police last year, the Police Bureau established a consumer cooperative. We deeply relied on the support of the people from all walks of life in Shanghai, especially Mr. Wen, Mr. Yuan, Mr. Lin, and Mr. Li. In a short period of time, we were able to succeed, and all the officers benefited greatly. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude on their behalf. Although I am leaving the Police Bureau, I will continue to work hard for the security of Shanghai, and I hope you will not hesitate to give me guidance at all times."

### Price Assessment Committee Approves Audited Commodity Prices, to be Announced and Implemented Within Days

The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, following the central government's decision to take emergency measures to re-evaluate the prices of general key commodities in the city, convened a joint meeting of the Price Assessment Committee the day before yesterday. Sixteen major commodities were put forward for discussion. The cost figures of various commodities reported by various trade associations were reviewed by specialist committee members, who then signed their assessment opinions. This task has been handled carefully and completed. The bureau convened a meeting of the Price Assessment Committee in the bureau's meeting room at 3:00 PM yesterday to make a final decision on the reviewed and approved prices. Committee members present at the assessment meeting included Yuan Junchang, Wang Deyan, Liu Xingchen, Yang Shi, Qin Tinggui, Man Qiwei, as well as committee members hired by the municipal government, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Ziyi, Luo Nazhai, Chen Binhe, Sun Zhongli, Chen Guoquan, Dai Ailu, and specialist committee members Cai Zhengya, Li Ze, Ling Pu, and others, totaling over twenty people.

The results were quite satisfactory, and the sixteen assessed prices were unanimously approved according to their opinions. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The assessed prices will be announced and implemented within days.

### North Station Branch Bureau Cracks Down on Police Officers Buying Train Tickets on Behalf of Others

The Shanghai Station Branch Bureau of the Police Bureau, in view of the fact that some police officers often take advantage of their positions to purchase train tickets from the ticket office of the North Station and various transportation companies, and then resell them at black market prices to single passengers, which affects legitimate travelers, deemed the situation to be hateful. Therefore, the bureau specifically notified the authorities at the North Station and various transportation companies in the city to refuse to sell tickets to police officers buying them on behalf of others and to report such cases at any time. Furthermore, the branch bureau chief, Liu Zhenzhong, secretly dispatched officers to investigate at various ticket offices. If the above situation was found, they were immediately brought to the bureau for investigation and prosecution. The aim is to benefit travelers.

### Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions in Shanghai Last Week, Sharp Rise in Prices of Daily Necessities

Last week, the financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in Shanghai were affected by the Lunar New Year's holiday, during which banks, businesses, and factories closed for year-end settlements. The market was only open on Monday and Saturday. Monday was Lunar New Year's Eve, the last day for banks to settle their accounts, and most external businesses were suspended. Securities and other markets had already announced their closure last Saturday. Therefore, there was little actual trading. On Saturday morning, the first trading day after the holiday, the situation was relatively good, and spot red copper, silver ingots, public bonds, and Shanghai stocks all trended upwards. Investors were actively absorbing funds, and trading was lively. Interest rates on interbank lending were quoted at six jiao, five fen lower than the previous week. In terms of industry and commerce, most factories were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday as usual. Companies and shops were also busy on Monday (Lunar New Year's Eve). Commodity prices rose sharply as merchants took advantage of the holiday season to raise prices, especially for miscellaneous glutinous rice flour and sugar. On Saturday, the first day of trading after the New Year, the market was relatively stable, and the price increases eased slightly because the municipal economic authorities were planning to take emergency measures to suppress prices and strictly crack down on and punish unscrupulous merchants who were speculating, manipulating, hoarding, and profiteering. At the same time, efforts were being made to dredge up sources of funds and adjust supply and demand, and there was considerable confidence in this.

The establishment and review ceremony was held at the Yongkang School Square on Yongkang Road at 11:00 AM yesterday (18th). Approximately 800 guests attended, including Captain Miyazaki of the Gendarmerie Shanghai South Team, senior staff officers from the Allied Army Department, Saito, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Bureau's Fourth Division, Deputy Chief Liu Wenzao, Director Shi of the Taishan Branch Bureau, Deputy Director Sugimoto of the Lujiawan Branch Bureau, the Chief of the Changshu District Chinese United Baojia, the chiefs of various United Baojia, and the Chief of the Changshu District Japanese Self-Defense Corps. Over 1,000 members of the Russian Émigré Self-Defense Corps, led by Corps Chief Gibertonsky, Vice Corps Chief Baoraofu, and Secretary Aimanofu, were reviewed by Chief Gu of the Police Bureau's Section A, Deputy Chief Okawa, Section Chief Hiraga of the Second Section, Branch Chief Yu, and Deputy Branch Chief Matsushita. The military music was sonorous, the marching was orderly, and the spirit was full. They also performed stretcher rescue, air defense, fire fighting, and other skills, which were praised by Chinese, Japanese, and Western guests. Finally, the reviewing officers gave speeches, with many warnings and encouragement. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 noon. It is reported that the Russian Émigré Baojia Committee hosted a dinner party at the Ankai Hotel on Fumin Road last night (18th) to commemorate the establishment and to connect with officials from the municipal government and the police bureau.

### Retailers' Remaining Sugar Must Be Returned by Deadline

The allocation of sugar for the 18th Rationing Period has ended. All retailers who have not sold out their sugar for that period should have it collected by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office for verification by the authorities. The office specifically notified all retailers yesterday that they must bring their sugar sales reports to the office to collect the Mobile Transfer Certificate before the 20th of this month, and then send the sugar, along with the original jars, to the Zhongfu Warehouse (the warehouses for collecting unsold sugar in the North and South Pudong districts will be notified separately by letter) for verification and acceptance.

### A Record of the Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting

— Mei Wen

The Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting, sponsored by Shen Bao, opened on the 16th at the Chinese Painting Academy on Chengdu Road. Because there were about three hundred pieces of calligraphy and painting on display, I didn't want to miss the opportunity to feast my eyes, so I went to visit. Although I am a layman, after appreciating so many calligraphy and paintings, I felt that I had gained something, and I thought it was worth introducing it.

There were many works in this exhibition, filling the Chinese Painting Academy's hall. The artists included those from ancient and modern times, from the North and the South, including Shi Tao, Liu Shian, Wang Wenzhi, Zeng Guofan, Wu Dazheng, Kang Youwei, Zhang Taiyan, Zheng Xiaoxu, Xu Shichang, and in recent times, Ye Gongchuo, Wu Hufan, Zhang Daqian, and Pu Xinyu. Quite a few gentlemen and ladies visited, making the小姐who signed people in very busy. However, the atmosphere in the venue was very quiet, because every guest was quietly gazing at each artistic masterpiece.

In the first room, Chen Shaomei from Tianjin and Ms. Bei Zhaoyu from Suzhou's landscape paintings were displayed prominently. Chen's achievements are very profound. The various paintings such as "Imitation of Qiu Shizhou's Green Mountain and Green Water" and "Winter Forest Picture" are all steady and balanced. "Old Man Fangxi's Small Piece" has a sparse and pleasing composition, with the remaining spirit of the Song Dynasty, and is truly a rare work. Next to Liu Shian's cursive script, I discovered Zhu Yizun's running script. Zhu's works are rarely seen. It had already been purchased by a gentleman. There are indeed people who know their value.

In the second row, the works of Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Daqian, Wu Hufan and others were hung. Ye Gongchuo's monochrome bamboo scroll, with its flowing brushstrokes, has a free and unrestrained trend. As for his huge running script, its momentum is majestic and its structure is rigorous. It has long been well-established in the contemporary art world. Wu Hufan's "Yan Tan's Spring Morning" hand scroll, displayed in a glass cabinet, with its beautiful springs and rocks and towering peaks, fully demonstrates his skill and can indeed be called a masterpiece.

The low price of this exhibition can also be considered one of its attractions. Especially in terms of calligraphy, the works of Zheng Xiaoxu, Liu Shian, Zhang Taiyan, Wang Wenzhi, Yu Quyuan, and Liang Qichao have always been valued by people, and almost all of them were only selling for four or five thousand yuan apiece. A couplet by Old Man Sanyuan was only selling for two thousand yuan. It is no wonder that most of them were purchased. In a corner of the last room hung a seven-character couplet by Yuan Shikai: "Willing to work hard and fight, do not judge success or failure by thirds." The price was marked at 10,000 yuan, but the calligraphy did not show much skill. Perhaps collecting this couplet has historical value in addition to its artistic cultivation, as it is Yuan Shikai's own account of his joys and sorrows.

Finally, I would like to specifically mention Pu Xinyu's small figure scrolls, Qian Shoutie's colored landscape paintings, Wang Yiting's Buddha statues, and Zhao Shuju's flower paintings, which each have their own style and are truly extraordinary.
