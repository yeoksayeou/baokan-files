### Enemy Attempts to Invade the Cagayan Plain; Fierce Fighting in Northeastern Luzon; Japanese Forces North of San Jose Inflict Heavy Losses on the Enemy

Luzon Front, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Enemy forces have broken through the Caraballo Mountains and are attempting to invade the Cagayan Plain in northern Luzon. Using three or four divisions as their main force, they are constructing roads along the treacherous mountain ridges, gradually approaching Japanese positions to launch a formal attack. From Nahabita, five kilometers southeast of San Nicolas, they are advancing northeastward in four directions. One route, as of the evening of the 9th, has been advancing from a point eight kilometers southwest of Minuli Kwon, south of the Balingit Mountains. Simultaneously, they are constructing eight highways along both sides of the national road from San Jose to Baguio, and another road is being built northwestward from the area northeast of San Jose towards Karanglang, gradually approaching Japanese positions. Near Sara-ir, northeast of San Nicolas, enemy vanguards have been attacking for several days, leading to fierce fighting between the two armies in the dense forests. A portion of the enemy forces even infiltrated Japanese positions. The Japanese forces launched a fierce counterattack, resulting in intense fighting from the 3rd to the evening of the 11th. After inflicting significant losses on the enemy, they were finally repelled. However, a portion of the enemy's main force attempted to circumvent the mountain slopes from the south on the evening of the 11th. The Japanese forces deployed rear units to attack them. At the same time, in the Changkeng area, 15 kilometers north of San Jose, Japanese garrison forces used a small number of troops to engage the enemy head-on, inflicting heavy losses on a division of enemy forces over several days. Japanese losses were also considerable. The Japanese forces, who were tenaciously defending the main positions on the northern highlands, continued to fight fiercely to prevent the enemy from advancing. Furthermore, Japanese units stationed on the western highlands of Karanglang, northeast of Pengkeng, were attacked by enemy forces carrying mortars on February 27th. After fierce fighting, they killed or wounded about half of the enemy troops and repelled them. On March 1st, they again ambushed 200 enemy troops, killing 60 and forcing them to retreat. Since then, although the enemy has launched attacks daily, the Japanese forces have still secured their positions. The enemy has hastily constructed a new motor road, desperately supplying it to advance the 105mm and 205mm howitzer and 155mm cannon positions. Shells are raining down, and Japanese forces are engaged in fierce battles day and night. Numerous guerrilla groups are using small paths in an attempt to attack the Japanese rear, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Moreover, the enemy is eager to break through the Caraballo mountain range, and the attack on the Cagayan Plain is fierce, with roads and bridges being destroyed, and major villages turning into scorched earth. Therefore, the battle situation is becoming increasingly fierce.

### Wu Songgao's Broadcast

### Shortage of Coal and Cotton Under Chongqing's Rule

Central News Agency reports that the CCP's official newspaper, "Liberation Daily," recently published an article titled "A General Overview of January Under Chongqing's Rule." According to the article, the shortage of coal and cotton in the areas under Chongqing's jurisdiction at the end of January was becoming increasingly serious. The production of heavy industries such as steel, machinery, power, hardware, and electrical equipment continued to decline, and some factories were unable to maintain operations and were put up for sale.

Industrial Depression

For example, the cotton inventory of the textile industry was only enough to last for one month. In addition, more and more shops in various industries were closing down, and several financial institutions also suffered misfortune (such as Chongqing Yongmei Hou Bank), causing turmoil in the financial sector. All of this was caused by the Kuomintang's big bureaucrats' monopoly of capital and the failure of control policies. At the same time, speculative capital has shifted from gold, US dollars, and bills to spot goods, causing prices to soar. Cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and Guiyang have experienced a surge of two times from mid-December to the end of January, and the purchasing power of the people has been extremely weak recently, so high prices have further promoted the crisis of industry and commerce, and the people's suffering is even worse than before.

Financial Crisis

In terms of finance, the Kuomintang adopted "a palliative measure" of alleviating the crisis, such as canceling the monopoly and instead levying a monopoly profit tax, and collecting taxes from January to March. However, 40 million piculs of land tax from last year have not yet been collected. Under these circumstances, it can be imagined how painful it would be for the local people to be burdened with such a large sum (a total of 25 million piculs of grain and 20 billion yuan).

In order to make up for the huge deficit, the Kuomintang authorities distributed all financial expenditures to the local areas (such as the youth army preferential treatment fees), reaching 40 million yuan in Shaanxi Province and 200 million yuan in Sichuan Province. However, flat-rate rice for government employees and teachers was not paid in goods, but replaced with cash, in order to reduce food expenditures as much as possible.

Currency Inflation

Therefore, the Kuomintang's finances still had to rely on the printing press to maintain itself. In the second half of last year, the amount of banknotes issued reached 30 billion yuan. It is expected that vicious currency inflation will become even more serious in the future. Under this situation, the industrial and commercial sectors have successively requested adjustments to official prices, reduction of burdens, and abolition of extortionate taxes, especially opposing the control policy. Furthermore, the export industry associations and the industrial giants of the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce demanded the abolition of unified purchase and sale, and the cotton textile industry also protested against the control of yarn and cloth.

Weekly Review

### An Ideal

— Zhou Yuying

I.

The number of public welfare and charitable organizations and temples in Shanghai probably cannot be matched by any other city in the world. Just counting those registered with the Bureau of Social Welfare, there are over two hundred public welfare and charitable organizations and over two hundred temples. In addition, there are undoubtedly many more that are not registered. Among these many organizations and temples, a few may be nominally existent, which is unavoidable, but most have considerable financial strength. If all these resources could be pooled together, the sheer magnitude of the sum would probably surpass that of any large enterprise or bank.

Because China has traditionally held moral principles in high esteem, "saving others" is often prioritized over "saving oneself." Therefore, public welfare and charitable endeavors, as well as religious temple activities, have flourished. This is generally the case throughout the country, but Shanghai, being the center of economy and culture, has developed even more prominently in this regard.

In any country or city in the world, the will of large capitalists can often influence politics. However, Shanghai is different. The so-called capitalists often hide behind certain prominent figures and rely on these figures to influence politics. The most important criterion for becoming a so-called prominent figure is "enjoying doing good and being generous." Even if one does not have money oneself, being able to persuade others to contribute, or finding ways to make others contribute, to achieve the goal or appearance of "enjoying doing good and being generous," is enough to meet the requirements of a prominent figure. This philosophy of prominent figures is only understood by the Chinese people of Shanghai. For a century, under the high pressure of British and American influence in Shanghai, only "public-spirited" and courageous prominent figures could come forward and say a few words, and their words carried the most weight. This has led to the development of public welfare, charitable, and religious endeavors in Shanghai.

The development of public welfare and charitable endeavors in Shanghai has undoubtedly greatly alleviated the suffering of impoverished citizens. The amount of money spent on relief efforts each year is shockingly large. Although, due to various difficulties, the government cannot strictly manage these endeavors, and many relief organizations are unwilling to disclose their financial situations, we can roughly estimate that these many relief organizations each have their own administrative staff, accountants, treasurers, and even service workers. In total, this probably amounts to no fewer than two thousand people. Although it is not as large as the entire municipal government, it is much larger than an ordinary bureau or department. With such a large administrative expense, the amount spent on charitable work is, of course, even greater. Is it not a blessing for Shanghai to have such a large sum of money for public welfare and charitable relief being used for impoverished citizens?

II.

Despite the thriving state of public welfare, charitable, and religious relief efforts in Shanghai, the city has not become a paradise. Tragic hellish phenomena are still visible everywhere. Beggars, vagrants, thieves, disabled people, and those without recourse fill the streets. There is also a consistent unemployment rate of more than two-tenths of the total population. These tragic phenomena are, of course, crises that have accumulated throughout history. We certainly cannot say that the existence of these phenomena is a failure of past relief efforts. If it were not for the various relief endeavors, Shanghai might be in an even worse state than we can imagine. However, it is undeniable that the relief efforts have not been fully successful, and thus have only saved a minority, rather than the majority or even all of the people in need.

I believe that no one in Shanghai would express dissatisfaction with the various relief endeavors and their responsible parties. However, the existence of various hellish phenomena implies that people have even greater expectations of the relief endeavors and their responsible parties. In a normal ideal, beggars, vagrants, and thieves would not be widespread within a country. Even if unemployment occurred, there would be an urgent effort to provide relief. Therefore, countries like Japan, Germany, and even England and America, have made unemployment relief very widespread. But in China, unemployment has long become a common and unremarkable thing. The so-called social relief work is overwhelmed just by helping those who are beggars, vagrants, thieves, disabled, old, and weak.

Unemployment relief is originally the most fundamental and essential element of social relief, as well as the most fundamental approach. In China's past social relief measures, some impoverished people were housed and provided for. When there was more money, they were given rice to eat; when there was less money, they were given congee. If it was "winter relief," they were even given cotton-padded clothes to wear. This approach, while good, cultivated a widespread dependence. If we can raise the goal of relief, focusing on unemployment relief, without hindering the enterprising spirit of "self-reliance" of the general public, then the burden on the relief providers can naturally be reduced, and those being helped can also increase their self-confidence.

In Shanghai society, riddled with problems, suddenly proposing unemployment relief would undoubtedly be seen as an illusion or a fantasy. With so many unemployed people and such weak economic power, what can be done with empty hands? For example, following the approach of general countries, with the government passing a huge budget to provide unemployment benefits to unemployed citizens, this would be fundamentally impossible in the current Shanghai. Furthermore, if we were to ask the various relief organizations to bear the responsibility of unemployment relief, they are already feeling stretched thin and facing extreme difficulties in helping those they have already taken in. How could they then go on to help the unemployed? But, in reality, the urgency of unemployment relief may superficially appear to be less than other forms of relief, because the unemployed are not immediately starving to death or immediately resorting to theft. But, in fact, they are only refraining from begging or engaging in other immoral behaviors out of a sense of shame. If we study the life experiences of the general public, the period of unemployment is often a most critical juncture. Despair over life during unemployment makes it the easiest time for people to fall into depravity. The so-called beggars, vagrants, etc., all once had jobs. Unfortunately, they experienced a period of unemployment, and for a time had no way to find employment again. Once they fell, the darkness of their existence obscured their ambition. Even if they were later offered a job, they would be unwilling to do it. Therefore, we can still save a person when they are unemployed. If we wait until they become "idle people," we will not be able to save them even if we try. Currently, the various relief organizations in Shanghai have exhausted their efforts in helping the orphaned, elderly, and weak. There are also many idle people such as beggars, vagrants, and thieves that there is simply no way to manage. Standing guard police officers can only watch them. The severity of the unemployment phenomenon will cause the number of these idle people to increase day by day.

III.

If society does not provide relief when unemployment occurs, it will inevitably decline and become unmanageable. Many progressive countries, although their public welfare, charitable, and religious relief endeavors are not as developed as those in China, are much more active in unemployment relief than China. They provide unemployment benefits to those who have difficulty finding a job despite their poverty. The government specifically sets up job placement agencies to provide people with job searches and employment guidance, spending huge sums of money on this each year. Because they provide relief for unemployment, people are prevented from falling into depravity and becoming so-called idle people. Therefore, the need for shelter and relief organizations of the charitable type is also reduced.

Because China has not addressed the issue of unemployment relief, many people have no choice but to sink into despair when they become unemployed. The elderly and weak become beggars and vagrants, while the strong become thieves and bandits. Once a layer of idle people has formed in society, it is naturally difficult to attempt to provide relief for them. The current situation in Shanghai is that everyone is spending great effort to provide relief for idle people, but as a result, the original idle people are not being completely saved, and new idle people are constantly emerging. Only focusing on relieving idle people is akin to "ladling boiling water to stop the scalding." If, in addition to relieving idle people, we also pay attention to unemployment relief, we can "remove the firewood from under the pot." The original idle people can be gradually relieved, and new idle people will no longer be created. At that time, even if Shanghai cannot yet be called paradise, the phenomenon of hell will at least no longer expand and spread.

The severity of the unemployment phenomenon in Shanghai makes it such that no one with great power or vast resources dares to lightly talk about relief. It seems that just talking about unemployment relief would not be enough, even with three or five large banks, or that the municipal government would have to add double or several times more to its budget. According to the general practice of cities in other countries, unemployment relief is one of the major administrative policies of the city. The local government of Shanghai has always attached importance to this issue. However, since there are no three or five large banks that can be used for unemployment relief, and it is impossible to suddenly increase the budget several times without overburdening the citizens, and there are no readily available resources, and the government cannot propose a budget, then the unemployment problem in Shanghai will continue to be left to its natural course, with no relief sought. The phenomenon of hell will continue to expand, and after a few more years, idle people will fill the streets, and shelter organizations and police organizations will be unable to accommodate or manage them. The entire Shanghai will truly become hell.

Unemployment relief in Shanghai is the central work of social relief, as well as the fundamental approach to social relief in Shanghai. However, the government has no pre-existing money, and it is not easy to propose a new budget to increase the burden on citizens. So, should we simply ignore the extremely serious problem of unemployment, which is deeply concerning to all countries in the world? After serving as the director of the Bureau of Social Welfare for half a year, I have gained a very profound impression from experience: although relief endeavors in Shanghai are particularly developed and numerous, they all seem to be passive, or even wasteful. —I am truly sorry to say these words to the many enthusiastic public welfare and charitable gentlemen who do good and are generous. They are working diligently day and night to relieve poverty, exhausting their strength and losing their voices, and yet I am here making light of their efforts, which is simply too cruel. However, neglecting the relief of the unemployed and focusing solely on the relief of the idle is ultimately passive, not active, in terms of the effectiveness of relief. Furthermore, that kind of "giving for the sake of giving," only emphasizing "merit" without paying attention to the effect, is also not commendable.

To start unemployment relief in Shanghai, a huge amount of funding is needed. The government has no pre-existing money and cannot propose a new budget to increase taxes. However, the social sector has a large amount of readily available funding, namely the various public welfare, charitable, religious, and other relief endeavors. Not only do they have huge amounts of donations coming in each year, but they also have large fixed assets. If these large fixed assets and regular donation income could be pooled together, reorganized, and managed, then while maintaining the existing relief endeavors, we could also take into account the urgent need for unemployment relief. Then the serious unemployment relief problem could be started. As long as the unemployment relief problem can be started and can attract the attention of the majority of people, it will be very possible to ask the municipal government to propose a new budget or raise temporary funds in the future. When society pays attention to the unemployment problem, but the unemployment relief problem itself is a tangled mess with no way to start, then of course the government cannot accept it, and in fact, no one can specifically bring it up.

Unemployment relief in Shanghai cannot be solved by simply issuing unemployment benefits and setting up job placement agencies like foreign countries. Because the government does not yet have the financial resources to issue unemployment benefits, and there are basically no production enterprises that need workers to set up job placement agencies, the former relief method is something that no one dares to imagine, and the latter will not be effective even if it is implemented. The biggest reason for the existence of unemployment is due to declining production. Therefore, solving unemployment still requires attention to developing production. And developing production requires capital. This again makes me think of the foundation of the various existing relief endeavors in Shanghai. If this existing foundation can be substantially developed, paying attention to the development of production enterprises or helping the improvement of existing production enterprises, then not only will the assets of the various relief endeavors not be chronically frozen or kept in the hands of so-called philanthropic crooks, but also every development and improvement of production enterprises will absorb a considerable number of unemployed people. This is to fundamentally save the suffering of the impoverished. In religious terms, it is the greatest "merit." A small number of so-called philanthropic crooks, wanting to take over the assets of the relief endeavors, often use the protection of public property as a shield to reject all improvement measures and refuse all inquiries from social figures and the government. In fact, as long as financial transparency is thoroughly implemented, public property can never be taken away by any private individual. Otherwise, the philanthropic crooks who shout about "protecting public property" only know how to freeze public property in their own name, but are unwilling to disclose the overall financial situation of the endeavors under their management to society. They nominally provide overprotection, but in reality, they have long been nominal rather than actual.

IV.

Now, I will briefly describe "an ideal" in my mind below. Call it a new opinion on social relief in China, or call it a small suggestion on unemployment relief in China. I hope that the public will pay close attention to it, and I would be very grateful for any frank guidance and criticism.

1.  Every citizen residing in this city, except for the elderly, disabled, or those still in education, should have a fixed occupation. Unemployed citizens or unemployed citizens should register for work at a place designated by the government. Residents who are unwilling to work or who temporarily do not have a suitable occupation may be required to provide their labor or pay a heavy donation by the government.

2.  All public welfare, charitable, and religious organizations in this city that have the purpose of social relief and have fixed assets should bear the responsibility of unemployment relief, that is, they should all organize production enterprises within their possible scope to absorb unemployed people. When necessary, they may jointly establish an unemployment relief committee to pool their efforts and work together on unemployment relief.

3.  The property of any public welfare, charitable, or religious organization in this city must not be frozen or stranded in an intangible form. The organization should publicly solicit and study methods of using the property for production, both to increase the organization's own income and to reduce panic from social unemployment. Citizens may report and accuse those who still hide and freeze or strand property, and the government should severely punish the responsible parties.

4.  Each public welfare, charitable, and religious organization may organize production enterprises to absorb unemployed people according to its nature and scope. For example, native-place associations and local guild halls may transport native products from their hometowns to Shanghai for processing, manufacturing, and sales, and absorb unemployed people from their hometowns; temples and churches may establish production enterprises near their locations and absorb unemployed people from among their monks, Taoists, and followers; industry associations and guilds may establish production enterprises or new pilot projects in their respective industries, and absorb unemployed people from their respective industries.

5.  The production enterprises run by each public welfare, charitable, and religious organization should aim to reduce unemployment through social relief, not to make a profit. Therefore, even if their enterprises suffer losses, as long as it is not due to fraud, embezzlement, or the fault of the managers, the losses can be made up with newly received donations. However, the operating status of their enterprises must be publicly reported on a regular basis and filed with the government.

6.  The municipal government should give special protection to and pay close attention to the production enterprises run by each public welfare, charitable, and religious organization. When necessary, the municipal government may lend working capital or provide special subsidies.

7.  The municipal government should regularly conduct registration of specialized talents, job placement, and vocational guidance, prepare to provide subsidies to the unemployed, and, when necessary, carry out major construction projects such as road construction, river dredging, and mining to provide relief through work. The government may also raise funds to run appropriate production enterprises and public enterprises. In order to promote unemployment relief, the government may increase its budget or temporarily issue public bonds and treasury bills. Because relieving the unemployed is a thorough and active relief, while relieving idle people is a temporary and passive relief. The former is fundamental relief, while the latter is putting the cart before the horse.

### Invalid Ration Coupons: Do Not Be Deceived

The Municipal Goods Rationing Office previously announced that the rationing method for rice allocated to civil servants of Grade A had changed, and that the already issued but unused 11th and 12th periods had been declared invalid. Recently, it has been heard that some people are privately transferring these discarded coupons, claiming that these rice purchase coupons can be used to ration 1.5 dou of rice per period, and that rationing will begin soon, which is entirely baseless. It is said that quite a few people have been deceived. In addition, it is understood that a new method has been established for civil servant rice purchase coupons, and that the same rice coupons issued by the office for the 13th to 18th periods will also be uniformly invalidated.

### Postal Remittance Bureau to Relax the Amount of Voucher Funds

The Shanghai Postal Remittance General Bureau is now promoting postal remittance business in various regions. The voucher funds originally issued for remittance in second- and third-class postal bureau areas were determined based on the amount of security deposit paid by the responsible personnel in charge of the bureau. However, recently, postal bureaus in various regions have frequently felt that they are insufficient for use, causing the remittance business to be affected and suspended. According to sources from the bureau, in order to facilitate the voucher funds used in various regions, the bureau has planned to implement a flexible measure to relax the amount of voucher funds, and is currently requesting instructions from the highest authorities.

### Silver and Money Industries' Capital Increase: Extension Requested

Regarding the capital increase of member banks and money shops of the Silver and Money Industries Association, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, it should be completed by the end of this month. Although all banks and money shops actively proceeded in accordance with the order in advance, they deeply felt that the procedures were insufficient. Therefore, as of now, the number of banks and money shops that have completed the capital increase is less than three-tenths for banks and less than two-tenths for money shops. It is understood that the two industry associations, considering the approaching deadline, have jointly requested the financial authorities for a three-month extension on behalf of their members. It is not yet known whether the authorities will allow it. According to sources from related parties, some banks and money shops in the silver and money industries, whose capital increase has not been completed, are planning to merge two into one. If the merger proceeds, there will be problems in the organization.

### Shanghai Branch of the Special Court: To Start Operations Next Month; Internal Personnel Determined

With the approval of the responsible section chief, the authorities decided to begin repairs within days to ensure the safety of travelers.

### Director Fan of the Land Bureau Answers Questions on Municipal Land Administration Issues: The Eighth Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday

The eighth regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Department was held in Room 139 of the Municipal Government Building yesterday (the 17th) at 2:30 PM. Director Fan Yongzeng of the Land Administration Bureau (Secretary Wang substituting) attended to answer questions raised by representatives from various newspapers. Details are recorded below:

Land Designated for Commercial Use

(1) (Question) After the incident, many pieces of land in this city were designated by the Allied navies. Subsequently, this land was converted to commercial use, with bamboo and timber yards established there. However, the owners have not been able to enjoy any rights for several years, nor can they reclaim the land for their own use. When consulting the owners of these bamboo and timber yards (who are Chinese citizens), they are always unreasonably rejected. Can your bureau provide appropriate protection for the rights and interests of the aforementioned owners? (Asked by the Chunghua Daily News)

(Answer) After the incident, if the Allied navies needed to use land in this city, they would inform the Municipal Government, which would then instruct the owners to complete leasing procedures. The bureau has no knowledge of the subsequent uses of the land. If the original owners of the land can clearly prove that it is occupied by ordinary commercial businesses, they can apply to the bureau, which will then inquire with the relevant authorities and handle the matter to provide basic protection.

Work After the Dissolution of the Housing Management Committee

(2) (Question) After the dissolution of the Housing Management Committee, it is said that the work will be taken over by the Land Administration Bureau. What is the recent progress? (Asked by the Central News Agency)

(Answer) After the dissolution of the Housing Management Committee, the bureau was ordered to take over. The bureau started receiving the files yesterday (the 16th). As for the future work, we intend to continue processing those that are definitely unregistered land and properties after receiving and sorting the files. For those already registered with the bureau, we will not conduct additional investigations and registrations.

Slow Application Registration Procedures

(3) (Question) The Land Administration Bureau is slow in processing various application registration procedures. What is the reason? (Asked by the Central News Agency)

(Answer) For various registrations handled by the bureau, such as transfers and mortgages, if the evidence is solid and the procedures are complete, they are processed immediately on the same day without delay. However, for old cases where property rights were disputed or involved in court proceedings, a detailed review of the files and maps is required, which inevitably takes some time. Furthermore, people often lack sufficient evidence or proper procedures, or their addresses are unclear, making it impossible to deliver notifications. This causes delays due to the people's own mistakes.

Very Few Land Reports

(Question) What has been the situation with land reporting in the city over the past year? (Asked by the Central News Agency)

(Answer) The Land Administration Bureau's land administration work focuses on surveying, measuring, exchanging certificates, and registration. Land reporting was a temporary expedient measure after the incident. After receiving the files, we are handling them according to the regulations before the incident. Land reporting is no longer emphasized. However, if people come to the bureau to report for some reason, we still accept it. Recently, there have been very few such cases.

### Reader's Support for Education News: Yuwen Education Fund Generously Donates a Large Sum

Mr. Zhang Yuwen, a business figure, is enthusiastic about public welfare and charitable in heart.

However, given these difficult times, we dare not indulge. We respectfully transfer 30,000 yuan of the congratulatory gifts to your esteemed newspaper's education fund, to bring blessings to our relatives and friends."

Women's Day Donation for Education

A letter from all female students from the seven counties of Shaoxing studying in Shanghai reads: "Editor: 'The problem of women is also the problem of men,' said one student. 'We are living a hard and difficult life. Can we consider this prancing, chattering, and joking as a commemoration of March 8th?' said another. 'Let's commemorate March 8th by intensifying our studies, tightening our belts, and raising money to support student loans.' This principle was unanimously decided.

In a few days, relying on everyone's hard work, the donation results have exceeded the original target of 50,000 yuan.

This is our payment accounting: 50,000 yuan donated to the Shen Bao Education Fund, 30,000 yuan to the Xinwen Bao Student Loan Fund, 30,000 yuan to the Shanghai Association of Fellow Villagers from the Seven Counties of Shaoxing, tuition fees of 30,260 yuan to help three male students who could not get student loans, and the remaining 27,260 yuan will be used for our public welfare expenses.

We spent Women's Day happily in this way."

Yesterday, we received education funds: 429,000 yuan from the Yuwen Education Fund, 30,000 yuan from Fei Youyuan, totaling 459,000 yuan. The remaining balance is 10,442,349.03 yuan.

### Mayor's Cup Football Semifinal: Tunghua and Overseas Chinese United Draw, Extra Time Fails to Break the Score

In the Mayor's Cup football semifinal, Tunghua faced Overseas Chinese United yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM at Yiyuan Stadium. The audience was very enthusiastic, a rare sight this season. As a result, both sides were unable to score, and the game remained a virgin score even after extra time. A replay will be scheduled. The referee was Xuan Gu Zhengzhu. In the first half, Tunghua's offense was very aggressive, but all attacks were cleared by McNitty. In the second half, the game remained a back-and-forth affair. Chen Mingzhe penetrated deep into enemy territory and collided with McNitty, Chen left the field injured. Adding to Tunghua's misfortune, Li Ning collided with Bao Jie while trying to intercept a dangerous ball. Li suffered a cut to his eye, bleeding profusely, and temporarily left the game. Shen Jinda filled the gap, and Chen Mingzhe also returned to the field. After this, Overseas Chinese United's offensive became quite strong, but goalkeeper Zhang Banglun was agile and avoided being ambushed. After ninety minutes, the two sides shook hands and agreed to a draw. In extra time, Li Yao of Tunghua took two long shots, both missing by inches. At twenty-five minutes, Sun Jinshun, with the help of Dai Linjing, took a fierce shot in the penalty area. Although the opportunity was good, the angle was inaccurate. After that, both sides were exhausted from the long battle, and the game ended hastily, with no score.

Tunghua: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning (up), Zhang Lin Gen (down), Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Keng Fuzhen, Shen Jinda (down), Zhang Lin Gen (up), Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Chen Mingzhe.

Capital Correspondence

### Key Rationing in Nanjing - Per Capita

The material rationing system has been adopted by various countries during wartime and has long been recognized as the best system for solving people's livelihood problems in the face of material difficulties. If it can be planned comprehensively and implemented carefully so that everyone can obtain reasonable consumption, it will be of great importance for saving materials and enhancing combat power. The rationing system in the capital city started two years ago, and recently there have been reforms in key rationing. The only two places in our country where key rationing has been implemented successively are Nanjing and Shanghai.

Distinctions in Rationing Focus

In Nanjing, the agency responsible for material rationing was initially the Municipal Economic Bureau. Later, the bureau was ordered to be abolished, and a "Nanjing Special City Material Rationing Committee" was established within the municipal government, with the mayor as the chairman and relevant officials as committee members, directly under the jurisdiction of the municipal administration to handle political rationing.

Before the implementation of key rationing, the rationing targets focused on the general public, using the household registration of the district offices as the standard, with approximately 700,000 people receiving rations based on their certificates. At the same time, civil servants, soldiers, police, schools, newspaper offices, and cultural groups also had the right to enjoy rations, but this rationing was subordinate to the citizen rationing.

In order to strengthen political rationing and enhance its effect, the rationing authorities planned to change to a key rationing system at the end of last year. Therefore, the main targets shifted from citizens to civil servants, soldiers, police, and cultural figures. The rationing quantity for these people would be more than that of the general public. Currently, approximately 100,000 people in the city enjoy key rationing, accounting for about 15% of the city's population. Among them, news reporters and school teachers enjoy relatively more, because these people are relatively poor.

Types of Materials Already Rationed

Rationed materials are currently limited to items such as sugar, salt, cigarettes, and flour. Rice rationing has been effectively stopped since the government implemented the salary rice system for civil servants and citizen rationing was changed to key rationing. Currently, it is limited to the food rice rationing for the residences of political officials of various agencies and the low-priced rationing for teachers of various schools. In February, the rationing price per stone was only 8,000 yuan.

The sugar rationing is one catty per person, sometimes half a catty. Currently, the rationing price is 900 yuan per catty, and the rationing date is uncertain. Flour is rationed very few times. The most recent time, the quantity was large, with the highest rationing quantity reaching half a bag per person, with each bag costing 4,000 yuan. The most frequently rationed item is cigarettes. To date, 29 periods have been rationed, almost at least once a month, with most being medium-grade cigarettes. Other daily necessities such as soap and matches are rarely rationed, and it seems that they are also, like rice rationing, biased towards senior government officials, such as the soap rationing at the end of last year, where specially appointed officials were allocated one box each, simply appointed officials were allocated twelve bars each, and recommended and commissioned officials were allocated one bar each. There is also winter coal rationing, but it is limited to specially appointed and simply appointed officials.

Preferential Treatment for Poor Cultural Figures

In addition, there is a special type of rationing that has recently been specially favorable to poor cultural figures.

Poor cultural figures, as the name suggests, are of course limited to a part of the cultural figures who live a poor life. Anyone who has a considerable reputation in literature, drama, poetry, and fine arts in writing, and who lives a relatively poor life, or who regularly writes and earns a living, and is certified by newspaper or magazine authorities, can also enjoy this privilege.

Although the total number of poor cultural figures in the city has not yet been counted, it is definitely not small. After review and qualification, there are already 66 people, including Wu Guan. The materials that have been rationed are flour and cigarettes, and the rationing price is the same as the general one. Items that are still being planned include soap, sugar, matches, coal, and other major food items. It is not a praiseworthy thing that the City is implementing key rationing with special rationing measures for poor cultural figures.

### Luzon Island: The Japanese Human Bullet Charge Units – A Great Wall of Flesh and Blood Resist the American Oil and Iron Torrent

Since the enemy's invasion of Luzon Island, a month and a half has passed. The battle line stretches 250 kilometers from Lingayen to Manila. The enemy has further landed fresh troops at both Nasugbu and Subic, as well as the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island. It is estimated that the American forces used on Luzon have reached twelve divisions, 200,000 men. However, under the absolute air supremacy of the American air force, which totals over a thousand sorties daily, the Japanese army and navy soldiers show towering ambition and great prowess, charging day and night in hand-to-hand combat. This has caused the Americans to bleed profusely. Since the landing, American casualties have reached 70,000. Under the overwhelming material offensive of the enemy, the Japanese forces on the Philippine Islands, overcoming all adverse conditions, bravely fight on. Their courageous acts are born of the Japanese army's belief in ultimate victory. Here are some past stories of bloody battles fought by the Japanese army on Luzon for the readers' edification.

Selfless Spirit

Worthy of special mention in this Luzon Island campaign is the "Human Bullet Charge Unit" devoted to serving the country. If "the Special Attack Force is the flower of the Battle of Leyte Island", then the essence of the Battle of Luzon Island is the Human Bullet Charge Unit. The Special Attack Force consists of select soldiers and officers. However, the Human Bullet Charge Unit consists of the entire ground force, regardless of soldier or officer, which is especially unique. It has been seen that a certain unit headquarters had only the unit commander and staff officers, but no orderlies. When asked why, the unit commander replied with a proud demeanor, "They have all gone out to charge! It will be our turn soon!" The entire ground force waved their precious swords and rushed into the enemy lines with bombs. American soldiers, shielded by aircraft, tanks, and artillery, attempt to advance. However, at night, it is the Japanese human bullet charge unit's turn. The soul-stirring, fierce hand-to-hand combat of Atzu, Saipan, and Tinian is being constantly re-enacted throughout Luzon today. These human bullet charge units, sometimes as small as three men, seize every opportunity to disrupt the enemy lines, establish meritorious service, and return. If there is a good opportunity, they attack again. Sometimes the entire unit charges, ensuring that the Americans bleed profusely. To call it magnificent is no exaggeration.

Therefore, although we would very much like to write about each of these brave warriors of the human bullet charge unit individually, when you grab one of them and ask for his name, these heroes, who are willing to be nameless, reply: "The human bullet charge unit is not just us. You should write about the anecdotes of the Special Attack Force that perished with enemy ships." This kind of selfless and grand spirit is truly moving. Every night, Luzon Island becomes the stage for these brave warriors, launching fierce night battles against the materially superior American forces.

American Wastefulness

Relying on gasoline, steel, and sheer quantity, the American tactical thinking in this Luzon operation has reached its near pinnacle. Although the Japanese Special Attack Force repeatedly attacks fiercely, the Americans still gathered 150 to 200 large and small ships at Lingayen before landing. For days, they carried out fierce bombing raids with hundreds of carrier-based and land-based aircraft, and conducted naval artillery fire, destroying all obstacles along the Lingayen coast before landing. After landing, they maintained their consistent style, not hesitating to use 200-kilogram bombs to bomb a single hut or a single person. American infantry never advance an inch without the cover of this steel torrent. A certain Japanese squad's position once received 2,000 rounds of gun and artillery fire from the front in a single day. The Americans even wasted dozens of shells on a single Japanese soldier. For example, the Japanese garrison in Manila received a concentrated barrage of over 10,000 shells in a two-kilometer defense zone in one day, and was also subjected to fierce bombing by enemy aircraft. Since the start of the Luzon operation, the Americans have used the airfields of Lingayen, San Fabian, and Dagupan, in cooperation with the air power based in Leyte and Mindoro, to constantly harass Luzon with B24, B25, P38, P30, P51, PBY, and A20A aircraft, attempting to control the skies with over a thousand sorties of aircraft. However, the Japanese soldiers on Luzon Island resolutely resisted under this material pressure, causing the Americans to bleed profusely.

Night Raids

While the Americans advance during the day under the cover of aircraft, tanks, and barrages, the Japanese launch night charges and engage in hand-to-hand combat, ravaging the enemy lines. The actions of just three or five Japanese soldiers can instantly overturn the American heavy artillery positions that roared constantly during the day, crush the American tank formations in one fell swoop, and establish results that the Americans cannot achieve even with hundreds of rounds of gun and artillery fire and dozens of aircraft. Therefore, even with the cover of thousands of aircraft sorties daily, the Americans have suffered over 70,000 casualties in a month and a half of the Luzon operation. This proves that the flood of oil and steel cannot easily wash away the Great Wall of flesh and blood built by the Japanese army.

Battle Situation

From the Battle of Leyte Island to the Battle of Luzon Island, the vortex of the war situation has shifted from south to north. As the landing at Lingayen turns into a battle in Manila and its surroundings, American propaganda is again calling for operations on the Chinese mainland or an invasion of the Japanese mainland. However, the Luzon battle is now gradually transitioning from preliminary skirmishes into a major decisive battle.

Since the American landing on Luzon Island, one part has invaded Manila, while the rest have crossed the northern Bataan Peninsula, advanced north from Nasugbu, and landed on Corregidor Island on the Bataan Peninsula, attempting to forcibly break into Manila Bay. On the other hand, a portion of the American forces is also gradually infiltrating the Santo Tomas, Biñan, and Taal areas in the southern part of the Central Luzon mountain range near Lake Lanao. According to American propaganda, the Japanese army has already been cut into four sections. But is that really the case? A careful review of their deployment reveals that the MacArthur army only relies on the cover of aircraft and tanks to secure a narrow strip of land along the highway in the Central Luzon Plain. The American forces gathered in the Biñan area consist of 15 divisions, of which two or three divisions have already been routed in the fighting around Lingayen and during their southward advance. The landing operations at Nasugbu and Subic are also slow to progress, and the American forces landing at Lingayen are gradually suffering fierce attacks from the Japanese army in the areas of Clark Field, Biñan, Orani, Moriones, and Manila, having already lost over 70,000 men. In other words, the elite Japanese forces, skillfully utilizing the mountains and terrain of Luzon to set up ambushes, are scattered behind and on the flanks of the Americans. If there is a good opportunity for an aggressive attack, they will cut off the American lines of communication from Lingayen to Manila in one fell swoop and encircle them. And the other American forces in other areas are also in danger of being defeated piecemeal.

The strategic advantages that the Americans possess are their superior air power of over a thousand aircraft and the logistical support of over a million tons of ships. In short, they are fighting solely based on quantity. To fight against such an enemy is not easy. However, the Japanese army is united in its belief in victory, and is compensating for the lack of steel with flesh and blood. Today, the Japanese army on Luzon Island is carrying out this spirit, striking the American forces as much as possible and causing them to bleed profusely.

Over 15 million people from the Soviet Union, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Greece have been deported in disregard of the Hague Convention. The total number of prisoners of war from various countries in detention centers or forced labor camps is no less than millions. 112,000 people have been shot as hostages, 15,000 have been tortured to death outside their home countries, 680,000 have died of starvation, 300,000 have been shot in forests, and 400,000 have been burned to death.

### Situation Map of the Southern War Zone

(1) The main force of the Japanese army in Burma has recently advanced north along the Irrawaddy River, and the Stilwell Road may be cut off at any time. (2) The enemy forces that invaded Tiddim, Burma, were heavily damaged by the Japanese army and retreated northward. (3) The Japanese army uses Haiphong, Hue, and Saigon in Vietnam as its main air bases to defend the South Seas Islands and threaten Kunming, the terminus of the Stilwell Road. This time, Japan resolutely undertook the task of defending Vietnam and gave the Vietnamese people independence and liberation. (4) Fierce fighting continues in Manila. The Japanese army still secures superior positions in the vicinity of the old city and in the Corregidor and Clark areas north of Manila, and fiercely resists. (5) The enemy forces at Zamboanga, the southeastern tip of Mindanao Island in the southern Philippines, continue to attack. The enemy suffered heavy losses after a fierce attack by the first unit of the Japanese army.

### The Pao-Chia System in Shanghai

— Gu Jiwu

In recent years, due to changes in the environment, social unrest, and unstable public order in this city, the Pao-Chia organization has arisen to adapt to the new situation. However, in an international city interwoven with individualism and Anglo-American thought, we ultimately feel that implementing an organized and disciplined Pao-Chia system is a very difficult task.

Under the principle of "mutual assistance in guarding and watching," the initial Pao-Chia work has already demonstrated its effectiveness. Assassinations, robberies, and all destructive terrorist acts in Shanghai's unique environment have gradually been eliminated. However, in the overall Pao-Chia administration, due to the diversity of laws and regulations and the lack of unified authority, it is still impossible to completely address the situation, leaving citizens at a loss.

After the recovery of the concessions, the Shanghai municipal government declared a landmark unification. The authorities deeply felt that in the construction of a Greater Shanghai and in ensuring public order, the Pao-Chia work should shoulder greater responsibility. Therefore, the Pao-Chia organizations of the former International Settlement, the former French Concession, and the areas beyond the boundaries of the Xuhui district were merged. At the same time, in order to actively implement the police-Pao-Chia connection, a Pao-Chia Office was established in the police bureau to specialize in this matter and strengthen it.

At the beginning of the establishment of the Pao-Chia Office, due to the fact that the Pao-Chia organizations in this city had historically been independent, with no fixed income and expenditure, and that the personnel were of mixed quality, it was quite difficult to carry out the reorganization work. Fortunately, with the sincere cooperation of the authorities and all parties, various facilities were gradually developed.

After the reorganization of the Pao-Chia organization began, the Pao-Chia committees of the former International Settlement and the French Concession Bureau, and the Pao-Chia Guidance Committee of the International Settlement Police Station, were merged to form the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau Urban Area Pao-Chia Committee, with relevant personnel from the police bureau, Lianbao chiefs, local gentry, and celebrities as members. Underneath this was the district committee, which became the advisory body for Pao-Chia at all levels, so that government orders could be quickly implemented and public sentiment could be conveyed upwards, and the authority of Pao-Chia was also moving towards unification.

Since Shanghai opened as a port a hundred years ago, there has never been accurate household registration statistics, and the general public has been like a sheet of loose sand. Some people have lived in the same house all their lives without interacting with each other, full of the "everyone sweeps the snow from their own door" mentality. After the establishment of the Pao-Chia, the first step was to carry out a thorough household registration check, so that petty criminals and all kinds of undesirable elements had nowhere to hide, and the citizens also restored the ancient virtues of mutual assistance and mutual support. This cannot but be said to be a small achievement in the Pao-Chia work.

The greatest task of the Pao-Chia is to organize the masses and guide the masses. Therefore, the Shanghai Self-Defense Corps has fully developed this point, practicing the traditional virtues of the Pao-Chia, guarding and defending themselves on the one hand, and assisting the military police in eliminating bandits and all criminal activities on the other hand. Recently, through active training and organization, the headquarters of the Self-Defense Corps has also been established, with Police Bureau Chief Zhou serving concurrently as the Corps Commander and the Chief of the relevant department serving as the director of the Corps Headquarters' command and supervision work, almost becoming one with the police bureau. At the same time, in the past, there have been Self-Defense Corps members who died in the line of duty and those who were awarded prizes for bravely capturing thieves. This is something we can be proud of and must encourage ourselves to do more of.

Regarding the income and expenditure of Pao-Chia funds, it is easiest to arouse the public's concerns. Because the Pao-Chia funds in each district are collected arbitrarily in different ways, either by soliciting donations from businesses or by attaching them to rent in proportion, each district governs itself. At the same time, it is inevitable that unscrupulous elements will exploit the good people. Therefore, the Pao-Chia Office has specially formulated a unified method for collecting funds, with 80% of the proceeds being used as Pao-Chia funds for each district and 20% being used for overall facilities, implementing the principle of "taking from the people and using it for the people" and making it completely public. Therefore, the situation of raising money in the name of Pao-Chia may be prevented in the future.

It is undeniable that the quality of Pao-Chia personnel is uneven, and because of the system and laws of the police bureau, the population is often relocated, and applications for residence permits and service in the Self-Defense Corps are often subject to coercion and retention. The authorities are troubled by the lack of information and evidence, and have no way to start. We hope that the public will understand and cooperate in reporting such cases, and at the same time, we must make the Pao-Chia personnel practice self-discipline.

The Pao-Chia organization is truly a bridge between the government and the people. The Pao-Chia personnel bear the responsibility of assisting in maintaining public order, supervising, and reporting all social crimes. Therefore, we deeply admire the spirit of the Pao-Chia comrades who bury their heads in hard work. At present, due to the high cost of living, the Pao-Chia Office has submitted a request to the authorities to include full-time Pao-Chia workers in the priority allocation, which has been considered by the authorities and will soon be satisfactorily answered. The comrades who are working hard in the Pao-Chia position can work with peace of mind.

The situation is becoming more urgent, and our work is also developing rapidly. In terms of air defense and police affairs, the Pao-Chia comrades bear the greatest responsibility. Recently, we will also use the power of the Pao-Chia to assist in the work of evacuating the population of this city. When citizens return to their hometowns, a "evacuated and returned" mark will be stamped on their transfer documents to prevent abuses. At the same time, it is absolutely forbidden to create any difficulties when applying for a move, and we will strive to find effective ways to ensure that the evacuation work proceeds smoothly.

In the past, Mayor Chen often taught us that in addition to autonomy and self-defense, we must also be self-reliant and self-strengthening, build an excellent system, organize the masses, train the masses, and make them have unity and discipline, and expand the concept of loving the local area to loving the country and loving East Asia. Now, Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo attach great importance to the Pao-Chia work and want our Pao-Chia comrades to assist the government, supervise and report on undesirable elements in society, and consolidate public order. Therefore, the responsibility in the future is even greater.

In order to achieve the unification of Pao-Chia administration and to strengthen the organization, the Urban Area Pao-Chia Committee recently invited Secretary-General Luo to serve as the chairman in order to provide guidance and leadership. At the same time, the Pao-Chia Propaganda Committee has also contacted the Shanghai Branch of the News Association and will be established soon, cooperating with the Health Committee and the Transportation Committee to jointly promote the construction of Pao-Chia.

We, the comrades who are at the forefront of the Pao-Chia work, have been working hard for several years, but at present, the Pao-Chia in Shanghai is still not as perfect as we would like. However, we have confidence and do not care about success or failure, praise or criticism. We will only work hard without asking for rewards, and under the leadership of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, we will open up our new world. However, in the current great era, we also hope that people from all walks of life will cooperate with us with a sense of shared destiny and move forward together.

### Evacuation and the Railroads

— Meng Huirong

Recently, Shanghai has been carrying out the evacuation of its population; however, the majority of the people are still hesitating. When we investigate the reason, we have to attribute it to the inconvenience of transportation. Even for single people, buying a ticket and getting on a train requires half a life. On the road, the yellow uniforms and black hats will also yell and shout. This is the case for those who are traveling light. If one is supporting the elderly and carrying children, and has some luggage, then they can only stop and stare in despair. Therefore, the majority of people have the attitude of "it's better to live one day at a time than to suffer immediately after returning home". Based on personal experience, taking the train does indeed have two difficulties.

Buying a ticket is the first difficulty: now there are fewer trains, and the number of tickets is limited; you have to fight your way to get a white market ticket, and there is no guarantee that you will be able to buy one. It is very problematic to make the elderly and children fight their way in the cold. Also, tickets are limited to being purchased in person, but the elderly and children do not have residence permits. If you buy a black market ticket, you will not only pay a high price, but it is difficult to buy one without knowing someone. It is difficult to buy all the tickets for the whole family, and it is difficult to determine the date. Even if you buy them, you are afraid of being ripped off. To return home, the difficult hurdle of buying a ticket is difficult to overcome.

Carrying luggage is the second difficulty: people who are evacuating to their hometowns to escape disaster must bring at least the clothes and some indispensable items for the four seasons. These items must of course be packed in luggage. However, recently, the luggage rooms at train stations have often stopped accepting shipments of suitcases and bedding. When you call to inquire, they say you can ship them, but when the shipment arrives, they will temporarily say that shipments have been stopped. I don't know how many people waste their money on transportation like this every day. If you don't bring clothes and bedding, you can't return to your hometown; people who have spent a lot of effort to buy tickets end up having to return halfway because of their luggage.

Let's say that you are lucky enough to have your luggage shipped; problems arise after you arrive at your destination. Not to mention giving tips, items are often missing. Recently, a friend who took a train from Shanghai to Bengbu had his luggage lost and was in a dilemma. He wrote in a letter: "...I went to the station to pick up my luggage, and when I opened it, half of my belongings were gone. I am unfamiliar with the place and have no way to negotiate". The black hats want money, and the red hats want things. There are so many obstacles to taking the train, and you must ask the transportation authorities to improve the current situation in order to evacuate.

### Schools Should Take Measures During Evacuation – Lu Xichen

Evacuating the population is essential today, but students often abandon their studies in the middle of relocation, which has a significant impact on their education. Therefore, I believe that school authorities should quickly take the following measures to suit the needs of the environment and remedy this deficiency. (1) Do not take a break this semester (stop Sundays and all other holidays) and continue teaching. (2) The semester should end no later than the end of April. In order to cooperate with the evacuation work, it is hoped that wise educators will discuss a good method. (Thank you)

### Red Buses Should Be Modified – Yi

The current red buses play a very important role in the transportation of this city. A large group of people is lined up at each station, and you have to wait at least half an hour to get on the bus. The company is certainly doing its best to maintain the service, and it is difficult to ask for more vehicles to be added. I have a method that indirectly makes the bus larger and carries more passengers: that is, ask the company to remove all the seats in the bus. This way, at least one-third more passengers can be carried. In other words, this would save each passenger more than ten minutes of waiting time each time.

The original intention of installing seats in the bus was to make passengers comfortable, but now it has become a burden for those who get on later; the back and waist are pressed against the horizontal handlebars of the seats, and people in front are squeezing desperately, making people sore and painful. This is the experience of the majority of people who get on the bus at the middle station.

Removing the seats is beneficial and has no drawbacks.

### The Island

— Yema

I was captivated by a brightly colored oil painting of an island.

"Do you love the sea?"

"Yes, when I think of islands."

"Islands?"

"Islands of eternal spring, beyond the sea."

"So you love islands more deeply than you love the sea."

"Some love the sea because of the tsunami during storms; some love the sea because of its color, and the brightness of the sea and sky; some love the sea because of the shells on the beach. A poet said, 'My ears are seashells, loving to hear the sound of the sea.' But I, it is because overseas there is the land of eternal spring..."

"The island in this oil painting..."

"Exactly, this is the scene of the island I saw in my dreams. You see, besides the white clouds, the blue sea and sky, and the reddish-brown rocks beside the beach, this island only has simple, lush greenery."

"Green is the color of life."

"However, green alone is not enough to express life. Simple green sometimes has its own special sense of sorrow. If it can express life, express youth, it is still because of the matching of other colors. Don't you see that if there were no clouds, sea, sky, and rocks, the colors of this painting would not be so bright!"

"You have fallen in love with the colors of this oil painting!"

"No, color can only be used as a means of expression. Only the fantasy of the actual scene of the island at the bottom of the oil painting is what I yearn for. Have you ever heard the story of a young man who sailed away and never returned for years? Some laugh at him as a fool because he had no goal in this journey, but having no goal is precisely the goal. The young man who sailed away will never be understood by the world. He went to find an island of eternal spring, a world of perpetual recording."

"Did he find it?"

"Who knows? Anyway, he never returned. A year later, a lovelorn girl was still secretly crying and missing him; five years later, some people still pointed to his sealed house and talked about him; ten years later, people were busy with life, and gradually forgot him in the midst of their toil. Twenty years, thirty years... The young man had completely disappeared from people's memories."

"So this young man never had any news after that?"

"Yes, that young man never appeared again. Until an uncountable number of years and days later, a broken, dilapidated boat drifted back from overseas. The boat ran aground on the beach. When an old man with a full head of white hair walked ashore, he opened his confused eyes and showed surprise. Many children gathered around to look at him, looking at this strange person. He walked to the former residence of the young man. Now the house had collapsed into a graveyard. He asked the names of one or two villagers. The children all claimed that they were their grandfathers and grandmothers who had died many years ago."

"Who is this old man?"

"Who is this old man? Not a single child, not a single young person could know. It wasn't until a paralyzed old man heard the children talk about the strange old man when they came home in the evening that he knew that he was the young man who had sailed away many years ago."

"Did he find the island of eternal spring?"

"Did he find the island of eternal spring? Who knows? In short, no one knows these things."

"Then your story...?"

"Yes, my story ends here. The old man disappeared again at dusk that day, leaving only the dilapidated boat on the shore."

After a pause, I heard a soft sigh.

"This is a lonely story."

"Lonely and tragic."

"...Oh, I know, you are the young man who sailed away in that story?"

"But my black hair shows my youth."

"Then..."

"Don't believe the story too much. The story is not necessarily true. In another story, the young man who sailed may have found the island of eternal spring he yearned for."

"..."

### Spring-Gazing Grass

— Lanyu

The story of the spring-gazing flower

Have you ever heard the story of the spring-gazing flower? The spring-gazing flower blooms in the season when spring has not yet arrived. When spring arrives, it quietly withers, accompanied by its own fading red in the spring light.

1.  Spring News

Pushing open the window, there is a patch of azure sky in the small courtyard.

A gentle breeze blows, bringing a different feeling.

It's about time, it should be spring.

I have spent many winters. In some long, cold days, I curled up in the dark old house, listening to the north wind shaking the bare plane trees outside the window. Looking at the swift-flying birds in the gray sky, I often couldn't help but feel some vigilance, some trembling.

"Have I already become stiff?" I asked myself in panic.

But the soul was asleep, and there was no answer. Only the north wind shook the window, whistling sharply...

However, I finally felt spring.

A pigeon flew in from the azure sky. It should be a messenger, bringing some spring news to the world.

"I also want to be a messenger," I said to the pigeon.

I told the spring news to the earthworms; to the weeping willows; to the green mountains and clear waters. Returning, I had a hard-earned dream.

In the dream, there were azalea blossoms all over the spring mountains, and orioles singing through the willow embankments; in the misty spring rain, there was a shepherd boy riding on the back of an ox wearing a straw cape, and I was vaguely that shepherd boy, although I couldn't play the flute, nor had I ever herded cattle.

When I woke up, I was still in the small room. Although it had started to rain outside the window sometime, there was no fragrance of flowers here, no song of birds. What I saw at the window was still the gray wall of the neighbor's house. After being rained on, it looked patchier.

This was just a dream. Spring night dreams are often absurd. My imagination went too far.

This is not a dream; this is a yearning.

It is a yearning caused by spring news.

2.  Green Shoots

The stone slabs in the courtyard were cracked, revealing strips of mud. In the past few days, some green sprouts have gradually grown.

Whose planting is it? - I should thank the planter. He planted spring in my small courtyard. Although the place is small, who says this is not a ray of life in this gray world?

Who knows when it grew, how it grew; was it dropped by a flying bird? Or the achievement of ants? For a whole winter, I didn't see a trace of it. The mud was frozen, coldly.

I cheered, I jumped, I found spring in my small courtyard.

I yearned to find a second pile of green shoots.

So I carefully, yearningly, searched every strip of earth like an earthworm.

But, no.

Disappointed? No, not disappointed at all.

I just regret that I don't have the strength, otherwise, I would move the stone slabs one by one. Underneath, I believe I will find more spring colors!

And the sky finally has some greenness.

I love these lovely little lives, I watered them.

An unknown bird flew over the wall and chirped.

Is it saying that the pile of green seedlings will bloom soon?

3.  Swallows

"Swallows return to build their nests."

The east wind has long blown, please ask the swallows to come back and build their nests!

But, until now, I have not seen a single swallow from those years return.

Every year, there are often two purple-clad swallows, picking mud and grass in front of the steps, accompanying me through spring.

Swallows fly in pairs in spring, I stand alone in front of the steps, and have also spent many spring days...

But, on a bleak autumn day, the swallows fluttered away.

Since then, there has been no news, and I have never seen them come back.

The owner waited patiently, waiting, but never saw the familiar shadows sweeping across the vast sky.

I miss them, I miss them uneasily.

I want to ask the clouds, ask the birds, ask the east wind, when they pass over the fields, have they seen my swallows?

I want to find them, I want to call out, towards the horizon, the ends of the earth.

4.  Withered Branches

The withered branches lost all their yellow leaves in autumn.

In the whistling of the north wind, they swayed their slender trunks several times, but they stood upright again several times.

Standing upright, standing upright, stretching their slender arms into the gray sky.

Yellow leaves filled the desolate garden, the desolate garden was deserted. The withered branches were also lonely.

Another winter was spent in loneliness.

Now, new tender leaves have grown on the withered branches.

New tender leaves, growing on the bare branches, tender and green, smiling in the spring sun.

Looking at their children growing on their own scars, doesn't the withered branch have a trace of joy?

It didn't wait in vain.

Do you say the desolate garden is still deserted? Weeds will grow quickly. "The spring breeze blows and brings them to life again," hasn't the spring breeze already blown?

Tomorrow, here, under the withered branches, there will be the footsteps of children carrying paper kites...

5.  Coda

The east wind, mixed with the fragrance of wildflowers, slowly blows, and I smell the scent of soil.

I have not forgotten the Buddha's words:

"If winter has already come, will spring be far behind?"

Yes, spring is not far away.

I also heard the cry of the dreamer Fang Zisheng:

"Look! It's the sun outside, it's spring."…

### Feelings

— Xia Jingyuan

Wandering on the other side of the lost paradise,

I curse the world.

Every night,

Stumbling like a drunkard,

Counting the cold stars,

The enthusiasm of the past rekindles.

I once envied,

The sharp eyes of the falcon,

And desired,

To soar through the sky for thousands of miles.

But I cannot forget the joys of youth.

Even if I possess,

The talent of Genesis, and have

An iron wrist and steel fist.

Just for a moment,

Erosion and obscurity settle like shifting clouds.

Like a broken-shelled snail,

A rusty sword.

The passionate roar is far away,

Gone with the wind.

The hero's dream, awakened.

Will youth ever return?

Every night,

Buying drunkenness in the streets.

I once had great ambitions, alas.

Only a cup of "Bai Gan"

The temples are turning gray.

### Suzhou River

— He Rong

Quietly flowing,

Suzhou River,

You are too cowardly.

Only knowing how to shed tears in grievance,

Accompanied by the boat girl's sorrowful song in the starry night

When the morning sun reaches out,

Unbuttoning the beggar's ragged shirt,

Suzhou River!

Last night's infatuated dream,

Still stirring your gentle waves

The spring grass on the shore,

Never cast a green shadow for you!

Sweat and mud,

Obscured your clear expression

The white tongue at the bottom of the Yangtze River,

Swallowed the boatmen's iron bodies,

Suzhou River!

Stirring you for a hundred years

But never seeing you,

Uttering a word of complaint,

Shattering the beautiful dream of life.

Beggars don't want to quench their thirst with you,

It's tears that have dirtied you;

Boatmen curse you—

Their ancestors, descendants,

Being dragged down by you for eternity.

Listen to the boat girl's lament!—

I detest the men fleeing to the city;

The sweet and delightful breath of spring,

Is actually mixed with your foul stench.

The huge waves of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River,

Roar in my chest;

Your color,

However, makes me decadent, wasting away.

Suzhou River!

Suzhou River!

Shake off the sober waves,

Don't sing lowly,

A song of muddy drunkenness and loss!

The spring sun is smiling,

Suzhou River!

Don't you feel it——

There is a warm current surging into your heart?

### Commentary on the Mayor's Cup Football Semi-Final: East China vs. Overseas Chinese United

— Bixian

The second Mayor's Cup semi-final between East China and Overseas Chinese United was held at Yiyuan Stadium at 3:30 pm yesterday. Yesterday, the spring breeze was gentle and the weather was pleasant, so thousands of fans poured in from Xianyang Road, making it the most ideal game of the season.

Looking back at the Mayor's Cup, last season was the first, and the right to decide the final was for the East China and Overseas Chinese teams. East China won the championship with a 6-1 victory, and this scene is still vivid in my mind. However, this year East China seems a little deflated, while Overseas Chinese United has been greatly reorganized. Therefore, it feels more intriguing, no wonder there is such a grand occasion.

Each With the Determination of a Last Stand

Before the game, I met with Mr. Cheng Bo'an, Mr. Ye Bohua, and Mr. Xu Zhimo, who are all related to their respective teams. One said that East China would win today, because at the beginning of the season, East China was indeed failing due to lack of practice, but recently, due to the suitability of the weather and the venue, there were many opportunities for training. With sufficient energy, the situation will naturally be good. East China's generals are experienced and can adapt to changes on the spot to deal with the weaknesses of the opposing team. Moreover, the restoration of their reputation this season depends on this Mayor's Cup, and the ambition to win must arise from this. One said that since the formation of Overseas Chinese United, its reputation has been broadcast, but it has not yet won any championships. This is the time to repay the owner's kindness with the most ideal lineup this year. Moreover, both teams suffered setbacks in the league this season and could not ask for a way out. Therefore, East China has the ability to restrain Overseas Chinese United. Overseas Chinese United also believes that East China can be deceived this year. Both sides believe that the opponent is meat on the chopping board, and they are determined to win this battle, and have the ability to win Jingzhou steadily in the final battle with the Shanghai Police. Listening carefully to the reasons stated, each has unique insights. The tension of this game was imagined here by the author. As expected, the two armies did their best, and there were very few mistakes. According to the statutory time, neither side gained anything and the game was extended. It was still a good and fierce battle that was difficult to distinguish. The highlights of yesterday's battle are briefly recorded, and the success and failure points of its battle are evaluated.

Wonderful Moments With Many Thrills

With the help of the wind, East China's offensive was extremely sharp. Within ten minutes, winger Chen Mingzhe lost two balls that could have been scored, which was due to timidity and insufficient experience. In the twentieth minute, Mingzhe's corner kick was just right. Sun Jinshun happened to be there, only about ten yards away from the goal, and no one was blocking him. Asun hesitated and failed, which was not expected for Asun's experience and quick feet. It is said that he did not expect Mingzhe to have such a wonderful kick, so the ball came suddenly and he was not prepared. This statement is reasonable, but losing this excellent opportunity made the audience sigh. In the thirtieth minute, Overseas Chinese United tried to attack, and Bama had the best through ball. Bao Jie and Yatuomali advanced side by side, but Zhang Banglun bravely jumped up from the two of them to catch it, which was a masterpiece. Afterwards, the two armies worked hard on defense, and although they recovered, they also closely followed their opponents. Zhang Lin and Bama had a small misunderstanding, but fortunately it was quickly resolved. In the first half, East China did not gain anything in the strong wind offensive, and ended with 〇 to 〇.

Difficult to Distinguish in Extra Time

In the second half, Overseas Chinese United moved after a long silence, and with the help of the wind, the offensive was not weak. In the third minute, Villa had the most accurate shot for the first time, which was extremely rapid. Zhang Banglun was quick-eyed and quick-handed, and hugged the ball to avoid disaster. However, East China fought back and became active again. Chen Mingzhe got the opportunity to enter straight along the side alone, trying to make a contribution, but he was ambushed by McNetti, and was injured before he could succeed, and Mingzhe fainted beside the field and was rescued by the medical officer. East China was not discouraged by this, and fought more and more bravely. Who knew that Li Ning's eyes were bleeding and he was seriously injured, and he retired one after another. Then the new force Shen Jin was added to fill the vacancy of Zhang Linggen. Linggen replaced the position of Zhuang Youren, and Youren supplemented Li Ning. Before long, Chen Mingzhe re-entered the field after treatment. In the fifteenth minute, Youliang got an excellent shooting position, lay on the ground and shot, which was an inch higher and more missed, which was quite a pity. From then on, Overseas Chinese United worked hard and had a strong stamina, and the offensive came out one after another. Banglun Fang hugged and snatched, full of wonderful moments, until the end of the game, neither side broke the goal, and the game was extended twice for fifteen minutes according to the rules. All the generals of East China were exhausted, and the Italian generals who were as strong as bulls were also hoarse. At the end of the game, they returned empty-handed, which was really a difficult battle to distinguish, and the right to decide the Mayor's Cup, in addition to the Shanghai Police, which had already won, East China and Overseas Chinese United will meet again to see the outcome.

The Focus of Success and Failure

East China's defense played its tacit roundabout tactics again in today's battle, with no loopholes at all. Therefore, Overseas Chinese United was less likely to score near the goal, which can be called an unexpected masterpiece of East China. The forward seemed to be too stagnant, and there were no generals to rush, so he could not break McNetti's goal, and Chen Mingzhe's right wing was not able to cut in, which reduced the offensive and was one of the reasons why he could not succeed. The most obvious shortcoming of the Overseas Chinese United team is that the forward cannot shoot, and the attack is aimless and becomes a pie in the sky. The cold arrows in the distance are not enough, and it is easy to save. In terms of defense, it is still laborious. Therefore, in summary, both sides have more than enough defense and insufficient offense. It is hoped that there will be an offensive development in the next meeting, so that there will be achievements.

Remembering Han Longhai Who Went Away

In this battle, East China fought with almost a partial army in the second half due to Li Ning's injury and Shen's supplement, but they fought to the end and drew the game, which was very commendable. Seeing Chen Mingzhe's weakness, he missed the opportunity. I can't help but think of Han Longhai, who is now far away from Shanghai. If Longhai was on the field, playing his whirlwind-like shooting, under the process of yesterday's battle, he would definitely be able to break or even break McNetti's goal again. Unfortunately, now that the general has gone, the big tree is dying, how can it not make thousands of fans feel sad!

### The Case of the Dispute Between the United and Portuguese Teams

Last week's game between the United and Portuguese teams, in the second half, due to Wu Qixiang's unauthorized departure from the field, and the entry of some ignorant spectators to commit violence, almost caused a great disturbance, which is deeply regrettable! Now, the Football Association has ruled that the United and Portuguese teams will choose a date to replay, and has punished Wu Qixiang and Qu Yongfu for their improper actions, which is quite appropriate. Some commentators have said that the two giants of Chinese football in Shanghai, East China and United, are called Liang and Yu of the same era, but the generals of East China can take into account sportsmanship at any time, while United acts impulsively and easily causes unpleasant situations, and Wu and Qu are often the culprits, causing the whole team to be ashamed, which is regrettable. Although this statement is inevitable to be too critical, if you examine the previous facts, it is also undeniable. The author can't help but regret for Qixiang. Qixiang is an all-round football player, suitable for both forwards and guards. His defense is even more intelligent and brave, and he is all-round. Looking around Shanghai, there is no one who can surpass him. If he can restrain his arrogance and abide by sportsmanship, and think about everything from a big picture, and not make an impulsive dispute, then wouldn't he become a football player who is excellent in both football skills and morals, and is loved and supported by everyone. Qixiang has been galloping on the green field for many years, but why hasn't he understood this principle, and still goes his own way and enters the wrong path? Now Qixiang has been punished to stop playing this season, and Yongfu has also stopped playing for two consecutive games. Although the United has the opportunity to replay with the Portuguese merchants, due to the absence of Wu and Qu, it is difficult to win. The good championship is given to the Hu people, which is really heartbreaking. After this, in the International Cup, Qixiang will not play, and the Chinese team will have one less tiger general in the defense, which will also be greatly affected. However, the past is gone, and the future can be pursued. It is hoped that Wu and Qu will learn from this setback, follow good advice, and change their past mistakes. When they rise again, they will bring a new look to our ears and eyes, isn't it a happy event!

Regarding the matter of players disobeying the referee, and even insulting the referee, it has been seen repeatedly before. Players with a quick temper are prone to commit this. Therefore, whenever there is a major game, they often regard being a referee as a difficult task. In fact, to be fair, the job of a referee is difficult and not easy to please. Sometimes the situation is between the two, and it is more likely to cause misunderstandings. And in the game, the process is tense, and the actions are extremely fast. In fact, it is inevitable that there will be errors. Players must not think that the referee is unfair because the referee has occasional errors, and give birth to resentment. What's more, the referee's judgment error is the referee's self-indulgence in his job, and the referee's intention to be partial is the referee's self-loss of personality. Everyone has eyes and can see, and the community will have its own public opinion. You can file a protest through legitimate means afterwards and argue on the basis of reason. If the players speak ill of each other, then the fault lies with the players. It is hoped that all players will pay attention to it, so that the future of the football world will be good.

Later authors have something that cannot be said enough. The Football Association's decision-making should be as decisive as this time in the dispute between the United and Portuguese teams, without any scruples, in order to show fairness.
