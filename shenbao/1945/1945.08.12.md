### Japanese Government Lodges Strong Protest with the United States via Switzerland, Demanding Cessation of New Type Bombs to Uphold Humanity

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) – On the 10th, the Japanese government lodged a protest via the Swiss government regarding the B-29 attack on Hiroshima on the 6th with a new type of bomb. At the same time, it instructed Minister Kase in Switzerland to explain the main points of this Japanese protest to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The gist of the statement is as follows: On the 6th of this month, American aircraft dropped a new type of bomb on the urban area of Hiroshima City, instantly injuring and killing a large number of citizens. At the same time, it completely destroyed most of the city. Hiroshima City is the same as ordinary cities and does not have special military defenses or facilities, and there is absolutely no possibility of constituting a military target. Although U.S. President Truman has stated regarding this bombing that "we should destroy shipbuilding factories and transportation facilities," the bombs dropped this time were attached with parachutes and exploded in the air, with a relatively large range of destructive power. It is absolutely impossible to limit its power to a small area. This is very clear, and the United States has long been familiar with the performance of these bombs. Furthermore, the actual damage situation is that all Japanese people residing in the affected area, regardless of combatants or non-combatants, and regardless of men, women, old, or young, were all innocently massacred. Not only is the scope of the damage extremely wide, but the tragic condition of the damage is also unbearable to witness. The fundamental principle of wartime international law stipulates that one of the belligerent countries is not without restrictions regarding the means of restraining the enemy, and it is explicitly prohibited to use weapons or projectiles and other weapons that cause unnecessary suffering to the enemy. Since the outbreak of this World War, the U.S. government has repeatedly stated that the use of poison gas and the adoption of other inhumane methods of warfare are considered illegal acts by civilized society. The widespread destructive power and the cruel nature of the new type of bombs it has used far exceed the previously prohibited poison gas and other various weapons. Disregarding international laws and the fundamental principles of humanity, the U.S. has blindly bombed Japanese cities on a large scale, killing and injuring many elderly, women, and children, and bombing and destroying numerous shrines, temples, schools, hospitals, and ordinary civilian houses. The use of this new type of indiscriminate and cruel bomb is a new addition of a criminal record to the history of human culture. The Japanese government hereby, in the name of the Japanese government and in the name of all mankind and civilization, strongly protests and demands that the U.S. government rectify its illegal actions, reflect on its actions, and immediately cease using this inhumane new type of bomb.

Weekly Commentary

### A Message to the Citizens of Shanghai

— Luo Junqiang

Since the evening of the 10th of this month, when various broadcasts reported the news of Japan's peace overtures, the citizens of Shanghai, who have suffered from eight or nine years of war, cannot help but be pleasantly surprised, which is only human nature and not surprising. However, as far as I know, on the 11th, some people's emotions were overly impulsive and they engaged in some excessive and immature actions. I am afraid that a few hooligans and thugs may also take advantage of the public's agitated emotions, deliberately causing trouble in the hope of muddling the waters and looting while the fire is burning.

Many enlightened people in this city believe that these phenomena should not exist and must be corrected. The Municipal Government, together with the Security Headquarters, mobilized all police, neighborhood association personnel, and self-defense groups, as well as security inspector brigades and special security corps, to strictly maintain order in different areas. They will correct any phenomena that should not exist in the city at any time and place. Even if some short-sighted citizens misunderstand or criticize us, we can only carry out our wooden duties with tears in our eyes.

At 18:30 on the afternoon of the 11th, I, representing Mayor Zhou, met with Commander Matsui of the Japanese army. He told me that as of the time of the conversation, he had only heard some broadcast news and had not received any instructions regarding peace from the Tokyo government or the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army. Let us think calmly: Can a million-strong army, on a long expedition abroad, rashly lay down its arms and stop the war without receiving correct orders from the highest commander in its home country? Citizens, you must know that "at this time" the state of war has not ceased, and "this place" is still an occupied area of the Japanese army. If you do not recognize reality and act rashly, can you avoid suffering an immediate loss? Moreover, the loss of a few people is a small matter, but the suffering of the majority is a serious matter. Can you not consider this?

Shanghai is a city with people from all directions and many rumors. I hope that every citizen will not increase the severity of the situation due to their own imprudent behavior. In particular, I hope that leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai will stand tall, take responsibility, and do their best to maintain peace and order in the Shanghai area.

### Returning from Nanjing

— Chen Binhe

Recently, for the sake of the rice and grain issue, I took the early train to Nanjing on the 9th of this month. In the train carriage, I could see the fields along the way luxuriant and green, and the farmers were busy cultivating, sweating profusely and working tirelessly. I got off the train at every stop to inquire and learned that there is a good hope for a bumper rice harvest this year.

On the afternoon of the 10th, I visited Acting Chairman Chen, who was busy with official duties but full of energy. He was very concerned about the people's livelihood in this city and frequently inquired.

Regarding the changes in the current situation, there was no excitement in Nanjing, and it was the same as usual.

I left Nanjing by the night train on the 10th and returned to Shanghai at 10:00 AM today (the 11th). Everything was normal along the way. However, when I arrived in Shanghai, the first thing that touched me the most was the prevalence of senseless rumors, and the second was the agitated actions of a few people. Therefore, at the meeting of the board of directors of the Citizens Welfare Association at noon that day, the senior members all sighed with emotion.

The more a country is educated and its citizens are trained, the more calm it can be in a very unusual and tense situation, the more it can endure patiently, the more it can abide by order and discipline, and the more it can accept the leadership of the government. All wise government leaders will never be happy to hear or instigate people to lightly listen to rumors and act agitatedly. The agitated behavior that occurred in this city yesterday may have been influenced by foreign hooligans, or it may have been due to listening to rumors and acting rashly.

I believe that the current international situation and trends should be discussed and decided by the government authorities of various countries. There is no need to speculate or be alarmed. Our task is to maintain the two aspects of public security in this city and stabilize people's livelihood. In terms of public security, this city has been better in the past four or five years than before the incident, and we cannot but thank the efforts of the allied military police personnel. In particular, the mobilization and service of the neighborhood association personnel has been helpful to public security. Therefore, in terms of public security, if we can jointly maintain it, there should be no problems. Secondly, stabilizing people's livelihood is equally important. I hope that leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors will take a long-term view, promote business as usual, and avoid hoarding goods.

Finally, I believe that in the past four or five years, a good friendship has been established between the Chinese and Japanese governments and between comrades in the peace zone, and it can be asserted that there will only be progress under any changes in the situation in the future. I am very sorry for the rash actions of a few citizens today and hope that they will be corrected immediately. I express my admiration for the calmness and patience of the Japanese residents and hope that they will continue to do so.

### Zhujiajiao and Zhangyan – Two Towns in Qingpu County –

— Ju Jia · Xihua

Zhujiajiao, formerly known as Zhuxi and colloquially known as Jiaoli, is a market town located about a hundred li from Shanghai, built on the eastern side of Dianshan Lake by rivers. In recent years, many people have moved here from Shanghai due to the dispersal of the population, so the townscape is thriving. I will now briefly introduce its current situation:

Water Transportation Routes

The town is located in a water town, and boats are the only means of transportation. The main route is to Shanghai, and there are two ways to travel: one is by the inland river steamer company's ships, which travel between Zhujiajiao and Shanghai every other day. The other is to take a steamer to Qingpu and then take a car on the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway to Shanghai. (The entire journey can be completed in three hours, at the slowest about five hours.) Secondly, there are routes to Kunshan, Suzhou, Songjiang, and other places. Originally, there were also steamers traveling to these places, but recently, due to the lack of gasoline, they have all been replaced by sailing ships. As for sailing ships traveling to other places, there are also more than twenty ships every day.

Since the incident, the town has not been washed by gunfire, and all the streets, houses, etc. are still as good as before, so business remains normal. Also, because the environment is in the countryside, the scope of business is the exchange of agricultural products and daily necessities, so the business objects of the various shops are also farmers. Currently, there are four oil mills, three flour mills, more than ten rice shops and rice milling plants, one spinning mill, and five money shops in the city. The other shops in various industries are visible everywhere, and the prosperity of its commerce can also be imagined.

Electricity in the town is supplied by the local Zhupu Electric Light Plant. The power supply time is from 7:00 PM to 12:00 AM. There are often cases of insufficient power or power outages, and the high cost of electricity is enough to scare people. For example, the electricity bill for July has reached 8,000 yuan per kilowatt-hour.

A Glimpse of Products and People's Livelihood

The fields belonging to Zhujiajiao Town are all paddy fields, so rice is the main agricultural product. Other products such as rapeseed, wheat, barley, soybeans, and broad beans also have considerable yields. However, this year, due to the high price of fertilizers and the low price at which the authorities purchased rice last year, most farmers cannot fully fertilize, and the harvest is certainly not good. If there are no relief measures such as loans, the bankruptcy of the countryside is probably imminent.

Now is the summer season, and there are also a large number of melons and fruits produced locally, such as watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and various other melons. Especially watermelons, the output is even greater. Recently, the price of each watermelon is about 40,000 yuan.

Also, because the area is a water town, the production of aquatic products is also abundant, such as fish, shrimp, and so on. The quantity transported to various parts of Shanghai every year is considerable.

Since the incident, the town has been garrisoned by the police and the security regiment, so incidents of open robbery are rarely seen. However, bandits in the countryside on all sides, under the name of "guerrillas," are everywhere, especially rampant this spring. Many merchants and residents in the town have been kidnapped or extorted. Since May, after the authorities' strict suppression, they have all disappeared. The folk customs are still considered thrifty. Due to the soaring prices and reduced income in recent years, the standard of living of the people has also been declining day by day.

Recently, the trend of rising prices is also strong. A stone of white rice has recently reached more than 700,000 yuan, meat is 10,000 yuan per catty, vegetable oil is 1.1 million yuan per dan, and rice straw is 500 yuan per bundle (each bundle is about four catties). Other items such as soap, matches, and candles are all transported from Shanghai, so the prices are about 20% higher than in Shanghai.

Education and Charity

The town currently has four county-run primary schools, one private primary school, and one compulsory primary school run by people in business, with about 2,000 students. However, in some of these schools, due to the low salaries of the teachers, most teachers cannot devote themselves to their duties and simply go through the motions, and the students' level is also gradually declining.

In addition, there are also two middle schools, one is the private Jiqing Middle School, which has been established for three years, and the other is the Yueguang Middle School, which has just been established. Tuition for the next semester is between five and six dou for junior high school and around eight dou for senior high school. Although the tuition is not large, it is still considerable, making those who want to study but cannot afford it unable to enter, and the number of people who have to give up school and seek business every year is also very large.

Before the incident, charity work included the Tongren and Jieying halls, which used a lot of land as a foundation. Since the incident, due to unpaid land rent and the neglect of the people in charge, now only the Tongren Hall still buries some ownerless coffins, and all other work has stopped.

The town is rich in products, convenient in transportation, sound in public security, and close to Shanghai. It is indeed a relocation destination for the families of employed people in Shanghai. I hope that those who have this idea but do not have a suitable destination will pay attention to this.

Zhangyan is a small town affiliated with Qingpu County. Due to its remote location, transportation is very inconvenient. There are only a few rowing boats traveling to Nanxiang, Huangdu, Songjiang, Jiaoli, Qingpu, and as far as Suzhou and other places. Apart from that, it can only be reached on foot, so transportation is extremely difficult.

Low Agricultural Production and High Prices

This group is a rice-producing area, and millet and wheat are also very abundant. Many people in the east of the town grow sweet potatoes, and the price per market is initially within 30,000 yuan, but now it is also less than 40,000 yuan. Most of them are transported by villagers by boat to Shanghai for sale. Recently, rice prices have been stable, but due to the tendency of sea rice price fluctuations, the highest record has also reached more than 700,000 yuan, and currently it is generally below 500,000. Before the war, a large amount of rice, wheat, cotton, etc. were exported every year, but this year is far from the past. Due to the impact of the authorities' purchases, there are very few crops, and most villagers are in danger of running out of food. Recently, many residents have been replacing rice with miscellaneous grains, such as grinding quinoa into porridge, and quite a few people are also using sweet potatoes to fill their stomachs. Such a situation in a rice-producing area is unimaginable in areas that do not produce rice.

In addition to all agricultural and local products, the prices of everything else must rely on Shanghai and be brought in by single-transport merchants, with daily necessities being the most popular. Most of the other groceries are brought by rowing boats, so all prices are more expensive than in Shanghai, and sometimes there is even a shortage of goods. Therefore, people's living standards are extremely high, and they bear a very heavy burden. There are also countless taxes and donations. Purchasing power is also very weak, and business is plummeting. Therefore, both the residents of the town and the farmers in the countryside have a feeling of "crying out in pain!"

The micro-rice collection is now mostly over. In order to reward the villagers, the authorities are giving daily necessities to those who pay more than 70% of the total amount, such as cigarettes, matches, soap, and a very small amount of soybean cakes for fertilizer. However, these items are all second-class goods and are very few.

Peace and Prosperity Have Yet to Be Achieved

The town hall in the town and the large slogans written high and large on the eye-catching walls say, "Complete the clearing of the countryside, live and work in peace and prosperity" and "Eliminate bandits." Although it has been a long time since these slogans were written, and the clearing of the countryside has long been completed, peace and prosperity and the elimination of bandits have yet to be achieved. On this day last year, bandits dared to rob the town in a large scale, and even pulled away the villagers' boats and looted all the goods in the town's shops and loaded them away. Sometimes they even beat the shopkeepers until their heads were bleeding. This happened five or six times, and the residents could only cry and wail, but there was nothing they could do, and they had to resign themselves to fate.

Teahouses Are Everywhere and Gambling Is Rampant

Most of the villagers are illiterate, so the level of education is extremely poor. There is only one primary school in the whole town, and middle school is only available in Qingpu city, so the general cultural level is indeed very low. Recently, due to the evacuation from the sea, the number of residents returning to their hometowns is increasing day by day. The writer is also one of them, and the number of citizens from other places moving into the town is also not small. Therefore, house prices have risen madly. The monthly rent for an ordinary city house must be more than 100,000 yuan, and as much as 300,000 yuan a month. Usually, a room costs about 50,000 or 60,000 yuan a month. Such high rents are truly staggering.

The establishment of teahouses in the area is no less than after a spring rain. In every shop, from morning to night, there are always gamblers filling the hall. Most of the villagers use teahouses as gambling places. Those who are mixed up are hooligans, thugs, and those from the lowest classes. They are calling and drinking all night long, which is truly regrettable.

Most ordinary young people depend on their families for a living because of their poor knowledge and lack of skills. They are very corrupt in their thinking, wandering the streets all day long or frequenting teahouses, indulging in gambling. Some specialize in seeking pleasure, while others, who are more refined, are very diligent in learning the erhu, flute, xiao, pipa, and other instruments. A few who can play and sing are very proud of themselves, fully demonstrating their depravity. (Relocate Rewards Scholarship)

### Baojia Personnel Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday - Decided to Cooperate to Maintain Local Order

The Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau believes that at this critical time, the Baojia Self-Defense Corps should make every effort to assist the authorities in maintaining local public security. Yesterday (the 11th) at 4:00 PM, it specially convened more than 600 people, including the heads and deputy heads of the 18 Baojia districts and all committee members of the district branches, at the Huangjin Grand Theater for an emergency meeting. Director Gu of the Baojia Office gave a speech, saying that Baojia personnel should have the ambition to be self-vigilant and self-defense, come forward to take on the task of maintaining local order and preserving the vitality of society. Then, Baojia personnel from each district proposed five points for discussion, which were unanimously approved by each district. After returning to their districts, they immediately convened all levels of Baojia self-defense personnel to convey the implementation.

Five Points Passed

Five points passed: 1. Many rice, firewood, and oil shops are not open, and prices are soaring, making it impossible or impossible for ordinary people to buy them. It was decided that each district should use each Bao as a unit to borrow from residents with surplus grain and concentrate it at the Baoan Office, and then distribute it to the poor citizens in the Bao separately, to be returned in the future. 2. Starting today, in addition to the original self-defense posts, each district will add self-defense corps members to patrol day and night. 3. All shops should be persuaded to open, and shop assistants should be persuaded to stay in the shop. 4. When serving, the self-defense corps should cooperate closely with the police and other security forces such as the Security Special Task Force. 5. Citizens should be earnestly advised not to be emotionally impulsive, and must work together with one heart and one mind for the sake of the local community.

Director Gu's Speech

Dear comrades: The current situation has taken on new developments, and we Baojia self-defense personnel who serve the local area have reached the stage of the most important responsibility. For several years, you have shed much blood and sweat, tirelessly working for local public security and the well-being of the people. However, you have not yet gained a thorough understanding of all citizens because of the environment, but the facts are still the facts, and there is no need to dwell on them. Today, although peace has been decided in principle, it is still a time of transition. Therefore, this period is the touchstone for our service to the local area and maintenance of public security. We must work even harder, regardless of how the situation evolves, and only ask that the citizens can get true peace and prosperity, and the country can maintain a vitality, and we will be relieved. I think the hard work we have put in these years will definitely get the sympathy of all the citizens in the future. Loving the homeland and loving the country can be said to be the nature of everyone, but we should deal with anything calmly and calmly, and never be arrogant and impetuous, because those who truly love the local area will never do frivolous things that hinder local public security, which will affect the peace of the entire city. At the same time, only by devoting our heart and soul to sacrificing the small self and striving to maintain the vitality of society can we be true patriots.

If a bit of precious effort is spent, there must be a bit of valuable effect. Although we have always held the principle of only plowing and not asking about the harvest, at least we have achieved peace of mind and are worthy of the country and society."

### A Visit to Jimin Hospital

— Jia Xi

Jimin Hospital at 240 North Xizang Road, in order to meet the needs of the current situation, has quickly and systematically organized a temporary relief committee for air raid victims, with Kui Yan-fang, Dong He-fu, Zhu Hong-yi, Le Ru-cheng, and twelve others as members, to broadly carry out the work. They have rescued hundreds of people from death.

They have indeed fulfilled the eight characters: "Free treatment for air raid victims." The hospital admits air raid victims with severe injuries for hospitalization, and all medical, pharmaceutical, and dietary expenses are completely waived. This is extremely commendable and truly a world apart from ordinary profit-seeking hospitals.

Different Painful Scenes

Guided by Dr. Mei Jin-liang and Dr. Han Hua-yin of the hospital, the reporter personally witnessed various painful scenes of injured victims. In the outpatient room, there is often a constant stream of victims with minor injuries coming for treatment, old and young, male and female. All of their medical records have the words "injured in air raid" added. Those with these four words are completely exempt from registration fees, consultation fees, and medication fees. Their injuries are relatively minor, and even if some have had surgery, they do not need to be hospitalized. They come to the hospital every day or every other day for treatment, dressing changes, wound cleaning, and injections, without interruption. Not only can these more than one hundred injured outpatients quickly recover their health, but also the thirty-four hospitalized severely injured patients have safely passed through the dangerous period and will soon be discharged from the hospital one after another to return to their original occupations.

Most of the injured come from Pudong, Northeast Shanghai, and North Shanghai, mostly farmers, vendors, boatmen, rickshaw pullers, and coolies. Almost all are impoverished and self-reliant people. In the bright wards on the third floor, each room has three to five patients lying down, each wearing short jackets of various colors. Some have whole pieces of white gauze bandages wrapped around their purplish-red or pale feet, calves, thighs, chests, heads, hands, arms, and shoulders. Some have had one hand amputated, others have their arms wrapped in white gauze, supported by wooden boards. Some are sleeping, some are sitting on the bed, some are lying diagonally, some are groaning, and some are staring wide-eyed. It includes men and women of different ages.

As soon as we walked in, Dr. Mei Jin-liang was constantly being called by patients, family members, and nurses: "Please change his dressing!" "I'm in pain!" "Can you help me have a bowel movement?" Dr. Mei comforted them, promised them, and instructed the nurses how to care for them. A middle-aged man named Gao A-chang in his forties was crushed by debris. Dr. Mei asked me to feel his chest and guess what was underneath the skin. There were small things moving under the skin. "Is it worms?" I asked. Dr. Mei smiled, "No, it's air. After the house collapsed, his lungs ruptured, and the air squeezed into the muscles and under the skin. It's on his chest and back. It needs to be slowly compressed out. He's not out of danger yet." A woman had a bullet enter her hip from the back and exit from the side, creating a fleshy hole. When Dr. Mei removed the bandages, gauze, and cotton layer by layer, a hole of mixed blood and flesh appeared before my eyes. The pale skin had already begun to heal, and everything was no longer a major problem. But pain was inevitable, so the doctor often gave her pain-relieving injections to reduce her suffering.

A Small, Fortunate Life

An eleven-year-old child, Shou Gen-sheng, runs around the hospital very lively and is familiar with Dr. Mei and the nurses. According to Dr. Ji, he was also injured in an air raid, and his condition was the most serious. When he first came to the hospital, everyone thought his life was beyond saving. It turned out that he had been hit in the lung by a bullet fragment, but because of his strong resistance, the bullet was encapsulated in his lung, posing no danger, and the wound was also healing. If this child had surgery to remove the bullet, there would be little hope. There was also a person whose ear had three-quarters fallen off, and everyone thought it would definitely fall off completely, but miraculously it grew back. The human body is so incredible. There was also a fifteen or sixteen-year-old child whose entire family, parents and siblings, had died, and he himself was severely injured. Everything was completely lost. It is unimaginable how difficult life will be after he is discharged from the hospital.

Dr. Mei instructed Shou Gen-sheng to go to the third floor for an X-ray so that the reporter could understand his condition. The child told his mother and then jumped and ran ahead. He is also an only child. Now that he has escaped from death, he is the luckiest person. Dr. Mei loves him as a kind father cares for his son, and the nurses smile at him when they see him. Through the X-ray, in the dark room, the reporter clearly saw a cone-shaped black bullet fragment lodged between his ribs. Turning him over and taking another picture, it looked even clearer. At this time, a fifty-year-old man was wheeled in on a hospital bed. This man, named Lei Bing-xian, is a rickshaw puller in his fifties. The reporter had seen him in his room earlier. He had had surgery on his calf, where a piece of shrapnel was removed. Dr. Mei asked him to show me the shrapnel. This man dug out a small leather wallet from under his pillow, carefully poured out a small piece of lead-like black material, about three fen long and one fen wide. This thing was very meaningful to him. After showing it to us, he treasured it back. Now he came to have an X-ray of his foot to determine the location of the shrapnel, in preparation for surgery. Under the X-ray light, a black object was seen lying between his toes. This must be removed urgently; otherwise, if it becomes serious, it may affect his overall health. So this man was immediately prepared to be wheeled to the operating room for surgery. Dr. Han said that without X-ray equipment, nothing could be done.

A Horrifying Scene on the Operating Table

This is a large, bright room. A surgical table lies waiting for surgery. Two glass cabinets hold many kinds of medical instruments, scissors, pliers, needles, and so on. Dr. Mei Jin-liang and Dr. Han Hua-yin, wearing white surgical gowns, white hats, and masks, walked in. Several nurses had already arranged the injured person, whose feet were wrapped up, leaving only the wound to be cut open exposed. To avoid the pain of the injured, Dr. Han injected Novcain (5% 3cc) into the rickshaw puller's spine. After the liquid was injected, drops of water dripped from the needle tube. It is said that that is spinal fluid. People who have had this anesthetic injection must have their head and upper body slightly tilted downward, because Novcain is lighter than spinal fluid. If the body is not slightly inverted, the liquid will rise to the brain, which could endanger life. After the drug permeated the lower body, Dr. Han forcefully pinched his foot several times with pliers. The man screamed in pain, and then calmed down, probably because his foot had gradually lost sensation. First, a long iron rod was inserted into the wound to probe the location of the shrapnel. Blood dripped down and into the lead bucket below, and the wrapping cloth was also stained red. To facilitate clamping out the shrapnel, several cuts were made in the skin around the wound. Then Dr. Han, wearing gloves, reached his finger into the wound of the foot, feeling the exact location of the shrapnel. A bright iron clamp was inserted deep into the fleshy wound and quickly brought out an object and threw it onto the cement floor, with a heavy thud. This was a piece of lead still attached with muscle and blood clots. At this time, the injured person spat out a liquid mixed with adzuki beans and rice porridge. He wasn't getting good nutrition either! He also groped in the fleshy hole for a while, and took out a white hard piece with fresh red blood on it. "This is a piece of broken bone," Dr. Han told the reporter. Four or five pairs of scissors were inserted into the wound hole. An electric hemostat was pushed over. The wire was connected to the scissors, emitting a spark, and the blood no longer flowed from the hole. After packing the wound with medicated cotton, all the procedures were completed. The person was carried out, feet high and head low, and the operating table was empty, waiting for another person to come.

Spare No Expense to Save Lives

Life is highly valued here. The doctors here truly treat each person as a person, without despising them because of their poverty. The Novcain used for the spinal anesthesia injected into that rickshaw puller is said to be worth 100,000 yuan per injection. At the same time, this person was also injected with morphine for pain relief and sedative tranquilizers. Glucose calcium, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, tetanus antitoxin, and Lai's leaves were also used. Adding gauze, cotton, adhesive plaster, and food expenses, it cost more than 3 million yuan on this person alone. Many medicines were not used just once, but injected every day or every other day. If they were a little careless, many leaves could have been saved and not used, but if that were true, the energy of the injured would be greatly depleted, and the resistance would be even less, which might cause more danger. In order to thoroughly save a person, they spared no expense to use some of the only medicines in their hospital. Tetanus antitoxin is only used for severely injured people, even those who are slightly injured. They value their work and the lives of the injured, and generously use valuable medicines to rescue these people from death. The hospital's direction of serving the community, and the kind doctors who care for every poor wounded with the utmost care and attention, are

Obviously, Jimin Hospital deserves our help. The various medicines mentioned above, as well as rice, cash, blankets, and straw mats, are what they urgently need. It is hoped that all parties will donate generously. At the same time, the reporter is willing to introduce this free hospital with the utmost trust, which does not neglect human lives.
