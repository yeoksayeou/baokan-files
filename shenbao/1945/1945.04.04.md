### The Battle of Okinawa Intensifies; Enemy Warship Losses Unprecedented; Total Sunk and Destroyed Reaches 177 Vessels

Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 3rd: The Japanese garrison on Okinawa Island is still bravely engaging in interception battles near the enemy landing points. The Japanese Air Force continues to fiercely attack enemy warships around the island, and the subsequently confirmed battle results are as follows: sunk one special-purpose aircraft carrier, one battleship, one battleship or transport ship, six cruisers, one destroyer, one transport ship, and two ships of unknown type. Destroyed one special-purpose aircraft carrier, eleven large warships including battleships, one battleship or cruiser, two cruisers, one cruiser or transport ship, and two transport ships.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese air and naval units are fiercely attacking the American mobile force engaged in landing operations on Okinawa Island. According to the battle results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 3rd, a total of 13 enemy ships have been sunk and 18 destroyed, bringing the cumulative total to 96 sunk, 9 sunk or damaged, and 72 destroyed, for a grand total of 177 vessels. According to enemy intelligence, there are approximately 1,400 enemy warships around Okinawa Island, and the Japanese side has so far sunk or destroyed 13% of them.

### Japanese Troops Fight Valiantly; Determining the Course of the War

Additional News - The battle of Okinawa Island is gradually intensifying. The American forces are relying on their material strength to conduct operations, while the Japanese air and naval units are resisting with a death wish. The fighting between the two armies can be said to be determining the course of the Pacific War and is attracting considerable attention. The American forces boast that they have mobilized a total of 1,400 warships and vessels in this area, but the Japanese army is sinking or damaging dozens of them every day, causing the American forces to be apprehensive. According to the American claim, the 1,400 ships and vessels are the maximum that the Allied nations can mobilize, including all landing craft of various sizes and supply ships in the rear. Only about one-third of them are capable of engaging in combat at the front lines. The Japanese army's continuous successes against large warships (see the table below) have already reached more than half of the US Navy's strength. Therefore, the American forces may be forced to change their operational strategy in the future, which is uncertain. During the Battle of Iwo Jima, the Japanese army exercised restraint and waited for future opportunities. This time, with the outbreak of the Battle of Okinawa Island, the Japanese army is pouring in all its combat power in order to break the current deadlock. Day after day, special attack units, who do not expect to survive, are constantly launching fierce attacks. The outcome of this will determine the future fate of Greater East Asia, which is a matter of great concern to the people of the country. Although the American forces rely on their large quantity of materials, their strategy may not succeed, and the daily heavy losses will inevitably lead to the frustration of their fighting spirit.

American Warship Loss Statistics

The following are the statistics of American warship losses inflicted by the Japanese army in the waters off Okinawa:

"Sunk": Two aircraft carriers, three battleships, twenty cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, fourteen destroyers, one minesweeper, three transport ships, twenty-one ships of unknown type, five large warships, sixteen landing transport ships, one battleship or transport ship, for a total of eighty-eight vessels.

"Sunk or Damaged": Two aircraft carriers, one battleship, for a total of thirteen vessels.

"Damaged": One aircraft carrier, one special-purpose aircraft carrier, three battleships, eleven battleships or cruisers, four cruisers, ten destroyers, ten transport ships, thirteen ships of unknown type, fifteen large warships, eleven transport ships or aircraft carriers, one cruiser or transport ship, for a total of seventy-one vessels. The above totals to one hundred and sixty-two vessels.

The American forces concentrated the British, French, and Italian fleets for a desperate operation, calling it the largest fleet in the world, but its losses are also the largest in world naval history. The losses of aircraft carriers are estimated at eighty-one, and among the twenty large warships, there seem to be several aircraft carriers. In addition, seven other battleships were sunk or damaged, and the number of cruisers reached more than twenty. Furthermore, there were more than 50,000 casualties, and coupled with the losses in land battles, the damage suffered by the American forces can be said to be unprecedented.

### B-29 Bombers Attack Tokyo; 45 Shot Down; Six Enemy Planes Invade the Seto Inland Sea

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - About 50 B-29 bombers from Mariana bases, from 2:00 AM on the 2nd for an hour and a half, at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 meters, in formations of one or two, invaded the western Tokyo area near Sumida, dropping flares, then bombing and dropping incendiary bombs. They also dropped time bombs over certain areas, but the damage was very minor, with almost no damage to important facilities and factories. The Japanese air defense units immediately bravely engaged and shot down a total of 15 planes and damaged about 30. Also, from 9:00 PM on the 1st to 2:00 AM on the 2nd, six B-29 planes invaded the Seto Inland Sea area, with one entering the Yamaguchi Prefecture.

### Japanese Army and Navy Special Attack Units Employ Kamikaze Tactics; Battle Results Expanding in Ryukyu Waters

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The battle results achieved by the Japanese Army and Navy special attack units in the waters off Okinawa Island up to the afternoon of the 2nd are as follows:

Kamikaze Special Attack Corps: The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and naval air units continue to launch repeated kamikaze attacks against enemy warships operating around Okinawa Island and near the Ryukyu Islands, and the battle results are gradually expanding. From the night of the 20th to the morning of the 1st, six fierce attacks were launched, and the enemy suffered heavy damage. On the night of the 30th, the Japanese naval air unit attacked an enemy transport fleet operating in the waters near Okinawa Island, hitting an oil tanker or aircraft carrier with a direct hit, causing it to be severely damaged and catch fire. In addition, one landing craft was sunk and one destroyer was damaged. On the morning of the 1st, the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps crashed into a group of enemy warships in the Ryukyu area. One of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps planes crashed into a large enemy transport ship, causing it to sink immediately. One crashed into a battleship, causing it to be heavily damaged. Two crashed into two transport ships, causing them to catch fire. In addition, two planes crashed into two enemy warships of unknown type. On the morning of the 1st, an enemy mobile force appeared near Ishigaki Island at the southern tip of the Ryukyu Islands. The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps immediately and fiercely crashed their planes into the enemy force, hitting an enemy aircraft carrier and causing it to catch fire. Another unit took the opportunity to launch repeated bombing attacks, causing it to suffer great damage.

Army Special Attack Corps: The subsequent battle results of the Japanese Army Special Attack Corps, which has been fiercely attacking enemy warship groups around Okinawa, have been confirmed as follows: In addition to what was already announced on the night of the 29th, one more cruiser was damaged. On the night of the 31st, one more transport ship was additionally damaged. From the night of the 31st to the morning of the 1st, eight Japanese Army special attack planes crashed into enemy warship groups in the waters southwest of the Kerama Islands, damaging one medium-sized transport ship. At the same time, four fires and pillars of fire were also confirmed. Also at that time, an enemy warship of unknown type was on fire and burning north of the Kerama Islands, which should be part of the battle results of other newly formed special attack units. From 4:50 AM to 5:00 AM on the 1st, two enemy cruisers were sunk in this area. At 5:50 AM, two enemy ships of unknown type were sunk in the waters south of Minatogawa, on the south side of Okinawa Island. At about 7:00 AM, two enemy transport ships caught fire and burned due to the kamikaze attack, which could be seen from land. At 8:25 AM, two enemy destroyers were damaged in the center of the sea, causing them to catch fire and burn. At about 10:00 AM, two enemy cruisers caught fire and sank. Since the enemy's landing on the island, the Japanese army's air, land, and sea forces have jointly launched fierce attacks against enemy landing transport ships. Up to now, a total of 16 of their warships have been sunk. In addition, regarding the battle results achieved in the attack on the enemy aircraft carrier group near the Kerama Islands on the morning of the 26th, it has been further confirmed that one aircraft carrier was sunk (or heavily damaged), and one large aircraft carrier, seemingly converted from a cruiser, was also sunk.

### Police Neighborhoodization, Neighborhood Police-ization

— Chen Bin

——Speech at the farewell dinner for Director Gojima by the neighborhood association

Today, the people of the neighborhood association of this city are giving Director Gojima a farewell, because Director Gojima will be transferred to an important position and will soon leave Shanghai. Therefore, the people of the neighborhood association are taking this opportunity to express their sorrow at parting. I am participating in this event as a neighborhood official and would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to express my respect.

Director Gojima has been working in an important position in the city's police bureau for a long time. His prudence and conscientiousness in handling affairs have always been admired by the general public, especially for his cooperation and contribution to the establishment and promotion of the neighborhood system.

The police are civil servants, and the neighborhood association is the representative of the people. Although the identities of the police and the neighborhood association are different, their goal of serving local security is the same.

We have repeatedly stated that the police are the civil servants closest to the people. The feelings of the police service are most likely to cause direct observation among the people. The people's belief in politics can be effective from the service efficiency of the police, while the neighborhood personnel participate in the service entirely in the identity of the people, assisting the police in performing security work and assisting the government in promoting grassroots policies. Therefore, the neighborhood personnel can be said to be a link that further connects the police and the people.

After the establishment of the neighborhood system, the task of the neighborhood personnel is not only to promote the connection between the police and the people, but also to promote the connection between the people themselves. As Secretary-General Luo said in his speech at the civilian celebration on the anniversary of the return to the capital: "As a result of the British and American colonial policies promoted for hundreds of years, the citizens of Shanghai have developed a habit of emphasizing private interests, with a selfish attitude of 'sweeping the snow in front of their own doors and not caring about the frost on other people's roofs', with very little mutual assistance spirit. Even if they live in the same house, the residents on the second and third floors do not interact with each other." Since the establishment of the neighborhood organization, they have jointly undertaken public welfare services, had the opportunity to contact and get to know each other, and developed a spirit of mutual assistance. Therefore, in assisting security, such as the reduction of terrorist incidents and theft cases, and in assisting government orders, such as the public's understanding of air defense knowledge, etc., it is sufficient to prove the complementary effect of the police and the neighborhood association.

However, in terms of a broader mission, we need to make further efforts to improve the tasks of the police and the neighborhood association themselves, as well as the connection between them. At the beginning of Director Zhou's assumption of office as Police Chief, he repeatedly expressed his sincere desire to revitalize the police administration. On the one hand, he raised the treatment of the police in order to stabilize their lives and ensure that they could serve with peace of mind. On the other hand, he reduced the size of the agency and adjusted personnel in order to increase efficiency. In recent months, the general discipline of the police has been initially effective, which can further prove that it does not lie in the difficulty of the environment, but in whether there is a determination to work hard to rectify it. As for the neighborhood association, at the current stage of increasingly tense situation, there is a greater need for people to cooperate. The more tense the situation, the sharper the enemy's conspiracies, and the more rumors and whispers emerge endlessly. How to distinguish and crush the rumors and expose the spies so that the people will not be confused? Our neighborhood personnel should also have considerable responsibility.

Director Gojima used to be in charge of the special interrogation office and the economic security office, which can be said to be the special affairs work of the police. We know that special affairs work is endowed with special powers. Generally speaking, when using special powers, it is most prone to abuse. Therefore, the most necessary condition for people engaged in special affairs work is to have morality and integrity. In other words, only people with the best morals can do special affairs work. Mr. Gojima is a model with the best morals and integrity. We hope that all police special affairs personnel should take Mr. Gojima's service ethics as a model.

Secondly, one of the main tasks of special affairs work is intelligence. The source of intelligence is based on the dynamics of all aspects. However, for the content of the intelligence, we hope that it can be used as an objective reference. If it needs to be treated as a fact, it must first be carefully judged, and then the truthfulness of the intelligence is determined. Therefore, people engaged in intelligence work must have a wealth of common sense and a fine judgment. In other words, only people with rich common sense can be competent for intelligence work. As mentioned above, under the current situation, rumors in Shanghai emerge endlessly, and neighborhood personnel must distinguish them. However, general intelligence personnel cannot use rumors as intelligence material. In the past, inaccurate intelligence caused much suffering to the people, but it has been reduced. Now that Mr. Gojima is about to leave office, we hope that the remaining serving officials will take Mr. Gojima's ability to lead and handle matters clearly as a model and not be influenced by anyone's intelligence.

In short, the task of both general police and special police is to serve the people and make them respect and love them as the only goal. And the task of the neighborhood personnel is also to assist the police in achieving their task as the goal. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the police neighborhoodization and neighborhood police-ization, so that the police, the neighborhood association, and the people can truly become one, without any gaps. I respectfully offer this intention to reciprocate Mr. Gojima's past efforts, and I encourage the police and neighborhood personnel together.

### German People in Occupied Territories Launch Freedom Movement; Resolve to Resist Unwavering

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a German report: The German Socialist Party Freedom Movement has been launched in the occupied areas on the eastern and western fronts. Its propaganda organ, the "Wulfel" radio station, issued a declaration to the German people for the first time on Easter Sunday, solemnly declaring that the men, women, old, and young in the German occupied areas are determined to continue fighting behind the enemy's lines and make the enemy pay for all the losses suffered by the German people, so as to preserve freedom and glory.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency: Although the success of the anti-Axis forces crossing the Rhine River and launching a new offensive towards the center of Germany is obvious, the German people's determination to resist remains unwavering. Now that the enemy has ventured deep into German territory, it must be difficult to transport supplies by land or air, such as the raw materials needed for tanks, for example. The German army will take advantage of the enemy's breathing time to organize new defense lines, attempting to encircle the enemy forces in the Ruhr area from the south and reach the Soest and Lippstadt urban areas. The defending forces are still fighting hard.

### British Armored Vehicle Convoy Deep in German Territory; Street Fighting in the City of Münster

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency: The British armored forces have crossed between Münster and Hamm and are now reaching the famous Teutoburg Forest south of Bielefeld. There is fierce fighting in the city of Münster.

### Soviet Union and Brazil Resume Diplomatic Relations

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency: The Brazilian Foreign Minister announced yesterday that Brazil and the Soviet Union have established diplomatic relations, but no mention was made of the candidates for the new ministers.

### Two Divisions of Hu Zongnan's Army Transferred to Yunnan Province

Guangzhou, this day (Central News Agency) - The so-called military foundation for the southwestern counteroffensive in Chongqing has not yet been completed, and various situations are not yet mature. At present, it is only a period of speculation. According to recent information arriving in the area, the 45th Division and the 8th Division of Hu Zongnan's elite troops, directly under Chiang Kai-shek, have been deployed to the headquarters of the Chinese Army and Air Force in Kunming and are under the direct command of the headquarters. The army is now assembling in central Yunnan. The purpose of stationing these "tiger cub" troops of Chiang Kai-shek in the area is purely to have the local troops stationed in Kunming and Baoshan directly supervised by Hu Zongnan. At the same time, in order to reorganize and integrate the local armies of Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan and centralize them, Li Zongren was appointed as the Director of the Hanzhong Command. In addition, the fact that Liu Zhi, the Commander of the Chongqing Garrison, was sent to the southwestern front line is also intended to promote the centralization of the defense forces in various places. However, these local warlords who have occupied the area for many years are not as willing to submit as imagined. Therefore, the preparations for the southwestern general counteroffensive are in a state of slow progress.

### Dreamlike San Francisco Conference

— Weiichi Kishi, Intelligence Director of the Japanese Embassy

Voting Procedures

Regarding the voting procedures of the council, Britain and the United States advocate for majority voting, while the Soviet Union insists on unanimous agreement for passage. The result will at least reach a compromise where the permanent council members are in agreement. However, when a permanent council member becomes a party to a dispute, the Soviet Union advocates for the disputing party to participate in the vote, while Britain and the United States advocate against it.

This issue is extremely important to the Soviet Union. The importance of the issue arises from the character of the international organization and simultaneously reflects the relationship between Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union internally. Among the so-called "United Nations," there are as many as twenty countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. It is well known that these countries all have anti-Soviet tendencies. On the other hand, the connection between Britain and the United States, as clearly shown in the plans for handling European problems, is a kind of political alliance against the Soviet Union. Therefore, when disputes arise among the three countries in the future (and there are already many possibilities for this to happen), for example, in handling issues such as Poland, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria in Europe, in handling issues such as Turkey in the Near East and Middle East, and in handling issues between Manchuria and China in East Asia, as well as the British and American issues concerning the source of goods in the South Seas, it is quite obvious that solutions most favorable to Britain and the United States will be made without Soviet supervision and substantial prevention. At this time, no matter how the issue is raised, the so-called public opinion of the anti-Axis countries will be unfavorable to the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union seeks to protect itself, it will lead to a state of affairs where war breaks out. At that time, the council will become the sole body for defining "aggressor nations," and the Soviet Union will inevitably be subjected to punishment. Therefore, the Soviet Union, as a member of the international organization, would instead receive the same treatment as the current anti-Axis countries give to Germany, which is inevitable. Therefore, the Soviet Union should carefully pay attention to the use of the council, which has strong power, to avoid being labeled as a criminal country under the ambiguous definition of "aggression" without its consent. It is said that during the previous Crimean Conference, opinions on the voting issue were completely unified. If Britain and the United States accept the Soviet Union's proposal, then the Security Council would naturally not be able to interfere in disputes between the three major powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and this system would collapse from its foundations.

So-called aggression and opposition to aggression are not inherent qualities of a country. When the development law of a nation or country that is constantly developing is suppressed, it immediately unleashes destructive forces. For example, the Vienna Conference mechanism collapsed after more than ten years, and the Versailles system also collapsed after twenty years. The concept of aggression and anti-aggression is that countries that maintain the status quo believe that their power is reliable. For a small number of countries demanding a change in the status quo, they adopt resolutions of "belligerent nations" by majority vote, and belligerent nations are judged to be aggressors. From this perspective, aggression is induced by the anti-aggression countries themselves.

In summary, aggression and anti-aggression are not based on actual concepts of events, but are nothing more than policy-based and relative concepts. The primary goal of the United Nations is to prevent aggression. Therefore, they determine that the use of force is the most effective measure. They fundamentally do not examine the substance of the world situation in which aggression occurs and seek to deal with it. Therefore, wars will break out one after another. After the end of the Second World War, the Third World War will occur again.

In conclusion, in addition to the superficial and institutional defects that prevent the United Nations from contributing to the maintenance of world peace, the fate of the San Francisco Conference, which will end as a dreamlike conference, stems from fundamental issues. These fundamental issues are what we should value and reconsider most, and should also be the subject of criticism. For the sake of world humanity, for the sake of the people of East Asia, and even more for the sake of the people of the anti-Axis countries who dream of achieving peace through this kind of institution, we must clarify these issues. Now, let's discuss this issue.

Fundamental Defects of the United Nations

When we make a historical observation of this issue, it is necessary to reflect once again on how the League of Nations failed. Originally, the reason why the League of Nations inevitably fell into a dead end was because of fundamental defects. This is not a question of the authority of the council and the general assembly, or the formal institutions such as the United States not participating. If we only view the reason for the failure of the League of Nations as the weakness and ineffectiveness of the League Council, the feeling of restraint when implementing sanctions, and the failure to take effective measures quickly, and do not understand its fundamental defects, then no matter how the League's institutions are revised, they will still be castles in the air.

The first fundamental defect of the League was that it was entirely a product of hostility. Therefore, it became an organization dedicated to upholding the Treaty of Versailles. At that time, the main intention of Britain, the United States, and France was how to prevent Germany from rising again, how to make Germany compensate for its losses, and how to punish Germany. They falsely believed that if these central issues were resolved, world peace could be expected, which was a shallow theory. There was no theoretical distinction between the League and the idea of building a world peace institution after the end of the war. While the League promoted the construction of human peace, it also solidified the situation caused by the destruction of war. It had no constructive ideals to contribute to the development of the new world and the prosperity of culture.

The second fundamental defect of the League was that the relatively progressive clauses left in its Covenant became completely nominal. Article 19 of the Covenant stipulated that "The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world." This provision was extremely ambiguous, because it is difficult to expect world peace to be based on the solidification of the status quo. Instead, the solidification of the status quo endangers world peace. Therefore, it hinted at conducting a review of this kind of international state in order to make peaceful changes. However, this provision was completely ignored because it did not clearly state under what kind of ideology the international state should be examined, and because of the historical character from which the League arose.

International problems that required changes to the status quo, such as the revival of Germany, the self-awareness of Italy, and the suppression of everything from the Manchurian Incident as a threat of aggression, and the development of internal national movements, were further led into the greatest crisis.

When we observe the Security Council, we can see that there is no reflection whatsoever. Just as Wilson praised the Fourteen Points as the blessings of the world, which resulted in the Treaty of Versailles, now they praise the Atlantic Charter and decided on the Crimean Conference. They recently held meetings in Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran. The ideals they wanted to maintain have completely failed. Only medieval ideas have suddenly re-emerged. A monster that treats the world as an enemy has been created under the beautiful name of world peace. It is predicted that the dark ages of modern times will reappear today. The idea that dominates them is to conclude exploitative treaties characterized by capitalist warfare, and the Security Council is the one that forcibly implements these treaties.

Secondly, the "peaceful change of international state," which was added to the Covenant of the League of Nations due to a moment of conscience, was not mentioned at all in this current United Nations. Their intention is clearly to maintain the status quo with international force and regard it as one and the same with world peace. Even if this kind of peace can be勉强 maintained in the shortest period, it cannot enable national advancement, and there is no development of art and culture. Because there is no development of art and culture, there is no progress of mankind. Since there is no progress of mankind, how can we seek happiness and prosperity? This is not peace, but stagnation and inertia, and its lifespan is extremely short. Because the nations and countries represented by the United Nations, in addition to having the same intentions as the United Nations, are constantly working hard to complete their own tasks. At the same time, among the group of countries participating in the United Nations, except for Britain and the United States, which are satisfied with maintaining the status quo, most of them are constantly demanding changes to the status quo. Therefore, suppressing these progressive trends in politics, economy, and culture is not something that collective force can do. Collective force will also disintegrate. Especially the First and Second World Wars have the effect of unfolding national self-awareness and the theft of a major movement. Therefore, various ethnic groups and countries welcome the world order that is about to be built. This trend is caused by history and is the normal path of human evolution. It is of course difficult to cope with the ideas after the First World War. In fact, the International County Union is from the beginning but a substitute for a rather tragic fate.

Conclusion

In summary, the conference to be held in San Francisco on April 25, which boasts of establishing world peace, is nothing more than a continuation of war. Apart from strengthening the means of war, there is nothing else. The true peace and cultural creation that mankind seeks can only be achieved by surpassing war. To transcend war, as Hu Liangcheng pointed out, is for each country to objectively and deeply study the historical facts and historical development that occurred due to war. On this basis, each country unfolds its own internal movement, resolves domestic problems separately, and independently guides the resolution of international problems. This matter has been explained by the fact that the current war is a total war, and under the national general mobilization warfare system. Since all ethnic groups participate in the war, they have to intervene in the resolution of the war. All countries and ethnic groups have the same goal and common ideals, which is a world order that allows any ethnic group to resolve its own national problems. In other words, it is nothing more than the idea of enabling all nations to get what they deserve and all people to live in peace. This idea can never be fulfilled by any treaty provisions. This has been revealed by the progress of facts. The new world order should adapt to the direction of this movement and stipulate the relations between countries. The San Francisco Conference has denied the progress of this law of human social movement, and has caused chaos and war.

He has also made many achievements in external police facilities. In particular, the establishment of the Economic Security Department was planned and promoted by Mr. Goshima with tireless efforts to promote the mission of economic policing. Moreover, Mr. Goshima's diligent and honest spirit is admired by the people of Shanghai. Now that he is about to leave Shanghai due to a transfer to an important position, we feel reluctant in our personal relations and even more so in our official relations. We respectfully wish Mr. Goshima a bright future and good health.

Goshima's Response

I am humbled by your warm invitation today. Now I take this opportunity to express my gratitude. I have been serving in Shanghai, and it has been over four years. During this period, I have always strived to promote the welfare of all citizens and the general society of Shanghai. Often, there may have been some points that failed to proceed smoothly according to ideals in promoting work, and I deeply apologize to the people of Shanghai and hope for your understanding. I will soon be leaving Shanghai due to my new assignment. When I was in office, I received a lot of help from celebrities from all walks of life and members of society to complete my mission, and I am truly grateful. I will continue to study and improve based on your teachings. In the future, if there is an opportunity to come to Shanghai to work again, I hope to continue to serve. At the same time, I sincerely hope that you will give the same enthusiastic guidance and assistance to the successor as you have given to me in the past. The current situation is severe, and I hope that you will further cooperate with the police to promote the smooth progress of Shanghai's police work. Finally, I wish you all good health and thank you for your warm hospitality.

During the banquet, everyone raised their glasses to congratulate each other, and the atmosphere was joyful and harmonious until after 8:00 PM.

Speech by Director Gu

First, Director Lai delivered a farewell speech, saying: "Today, the eighteen units of the Baojia districts in this city are here to send off Director Goshima's honorable departure. Mr. Goshima took the lead in establishing the Shanghai Baojia system, resulting in the scale it has today. Now that he is leaving Shanghai due to his honorable appointment, we cannot help but feel reluctant. In the future, we can only work harder to complete the mission of the Baojia so as not to let down Director Goshima's enthusiasm for initiating it. Although the municipal Baojia organization has a scale, we have always felt that the central leadership is not strong enough. Now we are fortunate that Secretary-General Luo of the municipal government has been specially appointed as the director of the Urban Baojia Committee. We are very happy that the leadership of the urban Baojia has been obtained. Finally, I ask everyone to raise their glasses and wish Director Goshima a boundless future."

Secretary-General's Speech

Secretary-General Luo said: "Today, Shanghai's Baojia personnel are here to bid farewell to Director Goshima. Director Goshima is truly the first contributor to Shanghai's Baojia. Now that he is about to depart on his honorable transfer, we cannot help but feel reluctant. I have attended the farewell to Director Goshima for the third time today. What I hope for today is, first, that Director Goshima will return to Shanghai as soon as possible, and second, that although Director Goshima is leaving, I sincerely hope that you will work harder in your respective positions and work for Shanghai Baojia as Director Goshima did when he was in Shanghai. I am now serving as the director of the Urban Baojia Committee, and we are colleagues. I still hope for your assistance at any time. Finally, I hope that all the Baotian personnel in the city will take 'Director Goshima's spirit of handling affairs' as a model and maintain it forever."

Goshima's Response

Director Goshima responded: "I am very grateful for your warm hospitality when I am about to leave the country due to this order. Secretary-General Luo's praise for me was too much, and I am very grateful. In the past, my work was made successful by the leadership of the superiors, the assistance of all colleagues, and the hard work of my subordinates. I will certainly work harder in my position in the future to meet your expectations. In the future, Shanghai's Baojia work will become even more important in order to adapt to the needs of the current situation, and I hope that you will work even harder."

### Shanghai-Suzhou Boat Investigation

— Investigation of Shanghai-Suzhou Boats

Currently, the only private company operating steamboats between Shanghai and Suzhou is Shengchang Shipping Company, located at 998 North Suzhou Road (east of Xizang Road Bridge), serving as the agent for the Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Company. The steamboats and coal are supplied by the Inland River Company, while passenger services are managed by Shengchang Company.

Currently, there is one sailing every other day. When the Inland River Company has surplus boats on other routes, temporary sailings are added. Small steamboats have 100 horsepower and can tow seven or eight passenger boats or company boats. Smaller tugboats can carry 100 passengers, while larger ones can carry over 200 passengers. Therefore, each boat can carry an average of 150 passengers, with a maximum of 1,200 tickets sold per sailing.

The ticket price from Shanghai to Suzhou is 1,500 yuan, but with incidental expenses and "small account" surcharges along the way, the actual selling price is 2,000 yuan per ticket. Tickets must be purchased by queuing up at the company entrance the day before departure. When purchasing, the residential address and name must be recorded on the back of the ticket. Currently, there is no black market activity. People purchase in an orderly fashion, and there is no scrambling. The company managers, Cao Guorong and Zai Pengling, are very strict with their employees, so the employees are very polite to the customers. When there are many passengers, they try to add boats, and tickets are also sold in appropriate quantities.

The departure time is 6:00 AM every other day. The actual travel time is only 16 hours, but inspections along the way delay it by 14-15 hours. Small pieces of luggage can be carried on board free of charge. For large items, the company must be contacted the day before to calculate the load capacity and arrange placement. The freight cost depends on the weight, generally 500-600 yuan per item, up to over 1,000 yuan. Due to the numerous inspections along the way, there are fewer individual traders on board. Meals on board cost 800 yuan each, and porridge costs 300 yuan each. If you want to save money, you can bring your own dry food. The entire route is 294 li, passing through more than 20 inspection checkpoints.

### Free School Officially Opens; Hope for Assistance and Guidance from All Sectors

The ten free elementary schools sponsored by this office have been enrolling students recently, and the situation is good. There are many applicants, and classes will officially begin tomorrow. Regarding the teachers of each school, the Voluntary Committee has selected and hired twenty teachers, whose academic qualifications and experience are quite excellent. Because the curriculum, organization, and teaching of the free school are different from those of ordinary elementary schools, this office conducted short-term training at the Xinguang Road Elementary School, with Mr. Shen Baiying, an expert in elementary education, appointed by the committee to be the main speaker. Scientific methods have been determined to achieve practical results in the teaching of free schools and to achieve perfect goals in moral education management, in order to obtain the highest efficiency in compulsory education.

Saving Breakfast Money to Donate to Scholarship Fund

Elementary school students Yao Jinfeng and Yao Jinming deeply sympathize with the free elementary school of this office because they previously felt the pain of being out of school. In their letter, they said: "We are elementary school students, and our family is not wealthy, so we have no extra money to donate to your newspaper. However, from the day when Mr. Xie Lilin initiated the Huaxuejin scholarship campaign until now, we have been going hungry every morning, saving our breakfast money, accumulating Zhongchu coupons worth 1,000 yuan, which we specially offer to your newspaper as a free school fund. There are also several old books to be used as textbooks for the free school."

These two children are willing to go hungry and save their snack money to donate to the free school fund. Although the amount is small, the sincerity of their motivation is great. There are countless people in society who have more power to help others than these two children, but do they not have the enthusiasm to help?
