### His Imperial Highness Prince Nashimoto Bestows Imperial Order on Veterans' Association

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – His Imperial Highness Prince Nashimoto Moriosa, upon assuming the position of President of the Imperial Reservists Association, summoned General Ikutaro Inoue, President of the Veterans' Association, on the 11th, and bestowed a special Imperial Order, instructing that in the face of this unprecedented crisis, they should renew their fervor and devote all their efforts to winning the war. President Inoue was fearful and grateful, respectfully accepting the Imperial Order, and made replies, also reporting on the current state of the association. At the same time, he instructed all members regarding their awareness of the current situation. The original text of the Imperial Order is as follows:

Nashimoto Moriosa, President of the Imperial Reservists Association, hereby informs all fellow veterans upon assuming this position. Looking back since the founding of this association, its affairs have expanded daily, advancing towards the fulfillment of its mission. Members have also each carried out their duties, enduring hardship and lack, striving to contribute to military strength. I am deeply pleased. Now, the Empire has reached a critical juncture, facing enemies on both sides, a major battle that truly determines its safety, prosperity, and decline. However, relying on material strength, disregarding divine power, abandoning righteousness, and merely indulging in brutality will not lead to ultimate victory. History has clearly proven this. To completely destroy formidable enemies on both sides, to support the eternal imperial destiny, I, Moriosa, observe the progress and changes of the war with deep emotion. Therefore, members who join the formations of troops and participate in direct combat should continuously train, further developing their military capabilities, and manifesting the righteous spirit of their ancestors' "loyalty and valor." Those who join the formations of troops should usually cultivate an increasingly elevated military spirit, actively increase the production of military supplies and food, and always stand at the forefront of the spirit of the community. Each should devote all their efforts to winning the war, to repay the gracious imperial favor above and to meet the trust of the great nation below, in order to complete the purpose of the holy war.

### Japanese Foreign Minister Tōgō Visits the Palace Again for an Audience

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Tōgō visited the Imperial Palace at 2:10 PM on the 13th to present matters under his jurisdiction to His Majesty the Emperor.

### Research on Atomic Bombs from a Scientific Perspective

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the American use of atomic bombs, the Yomiuri Shimbun published an article on the 13th entitled "Astronomical Explosive Power, a Tyrant Leading to the Extinction of Humanity." The gist of the article is that the new bomb possesses epoch-making power, and its inhuman act is far more intense than poison gas. The United States' use of this new weapon became known to the world after Japan lodged a protest with the United States. According to President Truman's broadcast on the 9th, this new type of bomb is the "atomic bomb" that the United States boasts of. Based on this, the cosmic rays that once caused a sensation in the world of science, i.e., the experiment of atomic nucleus destruction, have now become a weapon of slaughter in the history of mankind and have appeared in this great war. What exactly is an atomic bomb? Here is a quote from a certain doctor, an authority on atomic science: "An atom is the initial stage of the constitution of matter. Around the central nucleus, protons and neutrons rotate at amazing speeds. On the one hand, they are closely combined with each other, but ultraviolet rays and similar elements such as uranium, etc., separate neutrons from the nucleus in a natural state and fly into the air, changing into other substances over many years. This is what is called a radioactive element. When it comes into contact with a radium ingot that has radioactive properties, it can cause great harm. This is a recognized fact. By using a so-called magnetic resonance accelerator, this atomic nucleus can be artificially destroyed. The above method can accelerate the movement of neutrons and generate extremely high heat. Furthermore, if these neutrons are made to collide with the nuclei of atoms such as uranium, the nuclei can undergo a major change in an instant. Based on this principle, when the nucleus is artificially destroyed, the force emitted in all directions is so great that it cannot be calculated. The atomic bomb is manufactured by using this huge force. If the destructive power of uranium atoms is utilized, astronomical explosive power can be obtained, which is tens of millions or even a hundred million times greater than the explosive power of ordinary gunpowder or kerosene lamps."

### Eight Hundred Carrier-Based Aircraft Attack Various Parts of Kantō; Over Forty Aircraft Confirmed Shot Down or Destroyed

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to Japanese military sources, regarding the results of the enemy carrier-based aircraft that attacked the Kantō region on the 13th, investigations are currently underway.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Enemy mobile unit carrier-based aircraft persistently attacked various areas of the Kantō region from a little after 5:00 AM to 5:30 PM, blindly bombing urban areas in Fukushima, Niigata, and other locations, causing some damage to the Japanese side. The Japanese air defense forces launched a courageous attack against them. By 6:00 PM, the confirmed results were seventeen enemy aircraft shot down (including one PByS type) and over twenty-five destroyed.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Groups of enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Kantō region, the southern part of the Tōhoku region, and the northern part of the Kantō region from 5:00 AM on the 13th, mainly targeting airfields and military facilities.

Editorial

### The War and the Issue of Humanity

Internationally, there are regulations regarding the prevention of inhumane acts in the conduct of war and in the means of warfare. However, since the First World War, the belligerent countries have still occasionally violated humanitarian methods of operation and used inhumane combat tools. We cannot but express regret and protest against belligerent countries today that use weapons that are known to cause massive casualties to innocent lives.

In this war, in addition to our occasional hearing of belligerent countries using poison gas, resulting in non-combatants, and innocent civilians being affected by the massive bombing, although there have been new weapons used in various aspects, generally speaking, the use of poison gas has not yet been proven, and the latter actually has inevitable effects. In terms of the effectiveness of ordinary bombing, although the scope and extent of the harm cannot be said to be cruel, there is still a certain limit, and both sides of non-combatants also have evacuation and concealment methods, and sometimes, in order to end the war as soon as possible, in order to obtain lasting peace, large-scale terroristic, nervous-type bombing, may have significant value in strategic and political terms, but in fact any terroristic bombing can not have a decisive role in the war, many facts have been proved.

Now the enemy American side is using a new weapon called the atomic bomb in the war against the allied Japan. This weapon was used in the air raid on Hiroshima, resulting in huge losses to Hiroshima. Regardless of the status and value of Hiroshima, it must have been from this action, the use of this weapon, but according to the information we can get, Hiroshima is a peaceful small city, and as a result, all the dead and injured are innocent peaceful people, so, may I ask the American military using this atomic bomb with amazing and huge destructive power to turn the entire city into ruins, what exactly is the intention? The results of which are contrary to justice and humanity, how will the Americans justify themselves to the world in the future?

However, according to reports, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, commander-in-chief of the US military in China, actually announced to reporters on the 9th of this month that atomic bombs may attack Shanghai. We are even more puzzled as to whether this declaration is intended to intimidate the Japanese army in China or to demonstrate to millions of Chinese people in Shanghai? In fact, the killing and destructive power of atomic bombs cannot choose between people and soldiers, so the intention of this declaration can only arouse the indignation of millions of Chinese people in Shanghai! What the peace zone government led the people to resist was only the invading army of British and American imperialism, and the US commander-in-chief in China actually openly issued threats to the Chinese civilians. We can understand here who is fighting for humanity!

Regarding the inhumane actions of the atomic bomb, Japan has made an official protest to the United States, and many British people have also expressed dissatisfaction with this matter. On the 9th, the London Chronicle published a reader's request to quickly execute the scientist who flattered the demons who slaughtered mankind. We know that all protests may not be effective, but we hope that public opinion in all countries of the world will rise up and oppose this inhumane bombing.

### The Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Attacks the Mobile Fleet in the Nearby Seas, While Simultaneously Strengthening Its Interception Posture Day by Day

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American mobile fleet sallied forth in the waters east of Kantō on the 13th, launching an air raid on the Kantō region from the morning. In response, the Japanese Air Force launched repeated attacks starting that afternoon.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American mobile fleet, which had temporarily retreated from the Japanese coastline from the end of July to the beginning of August, has attacked again, attacking the Tōhoku region with approximately 1,700 carrier-based aircraft on the 9th, and again attacking the Kantō and Tōhoku regions with approximately 1,600 aircraft on the 10th. On the 13th, it stubbornly launched operations in the Kantō region from morning to evening. The current location of the enemy mobile fleet is in the waters east of Inubōsaki, and it can be estimated that its strength is approximately three groups. As of 10:00 AM, the number of attacking aircraft reached approximately eight hundred. However, recently the enemy has been gradually moving forces from the Leyte area, and it appears that the gathering of approximately four ships by the beginning of this month has been completed. At the same time, observing the actions of enemy submarines along the Japanese coast, etc., the enemy's attempt to invade the mainland is becoming extremely blatant. The Japanese military is seriously monitoring the enemy's actions, and at the same time, the posture of intercepting the enemy is also strengthening day by day.

Eight American Battleships Sunk

Forward Base, 13th (Central News Agency) – In early March of this year, the Japanese submarine unit destroyed an enemy battleship in the central Pacific region. Subsequently, it was confirmed that the battleship had been sunk.

Forward Base, 13th (Central News Agency) – From late July to early August, the Japanese submarine unit sank or destroyed three enemy transport ships and one destroyer in the waters southeast of Okinawa.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the US Army Department announced on the 11th that the US submarines USS Bushy and USS Callaghan have been lost. The USS Bushy had not returned to port last year and was considered lost. The USS Callaghan was sunk in the Okinawa area.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) – A Washington dispatch said that the US Navy Department announced on the 11th that the escort destroyer USS Underhill, 1,400 tons, sank off the coast of the Philippines, and all 112 crew members died in battle.

### A Glimpse of Haimen, Northern Jiangsu

— Yu Zhi

Haimen—this sandy land formed by the alluvial deposits of the Yangtze River and the sea—has only officially appeared on the map of China for a little over 180 years. In these hundred-plus years, immigrants have successively moved here from Chongming, Nantong, and other places. Through their long-term, arduous, and diligent efforts, they have transformed it into today's fertile land. It is located in the southeasternmost part of northern Jiangsu, bordering the Yangtze River to the south, the Yellow Sea to the east, Nantong to the north, and Qidong and Chongming Island to the southeast. Today, Haimen is one of the "cleansed countryside" districts in northern Jiangsu, with eight autonomous administrative regions, 147,309 households, and a total population of 653,924.

Security and Livelihood

Generally speaking, the current security situation in Haimen has significantly improved compared to before the "cleansing of the countryside." Previously, the county government could only enforce its orders in five administrative regions. Needless to say, the remaining three regions were guerrilla areas where the New Fourth Army entrenched itself. After the "cleansing," all of them have now been restored to peaceful villages. Measures such as Baojia census, self-defense training, blockade management, and tax adjustments have been implemented for nearly two years. At the same time, the armed forces responsible for the county's security include several hundred security guards, several hundred armed police, and over a thousand friendly army garrison troops, stationed in important market towns in various districts and townships. However, the New Fourth Army, which has always been a destroyer of peace and construction, is still active in remote areas, like embers flaring up again.

The people bear a heavy burden and are subject to numerous taxes, with various names. Land tax is collected in kind, with five catties of cotton and eight catties of Yuan wheat per mu. This is currently valued at around 3,000 yuan. Of course, national and provincial taxes are also levied, as is the case everywhere. In addition, there are so-called special levies, such as military and police supplies, Baojia fees, self-defense corps fees, expenses for district, township, and town offices, and even entertainment expenses for officials at all levels, which are cleverly disguised and passed on to the common people. Moreover, the New Fourth Army's "public grain" is prevalent, collected even more fiercely than government taxes.

Agricultural Products and Native Cloth

Haimen's main products are cotton and miscellaneous grains, with cotton being the most abundant, comparable to the famous cotton-producing area of Nantong. In its heyday, there were over 110 large and small cotton firms engaged in the collection and distribution of cotton. In the past year or two, as miscellaneous grains have become scarce commodities, production has been declining. The main miscellaneous grains produced are Yuan wheat, corn, and soybeans, which are the staple foods for most residents. Other grains, such as wheat, sorghum, millet, broad beans, peanuts, etc., are secondary. Rice cultivation is almost nonexistent. In the past, these miscellaneous grains were barely enough to supply the local population, and middle- and upper-class families mostly relied on imported white rice as their staple food. In recent years, due to poor transportation and difficulty in obtaining imported food, the cultivation of miscellaneous grains has greatly increased. It is now not only self-sufficient but also has a surplus to supply to Shanghai. In addition, due to the widespread production of cotton, there are many small-scale, semi-manual cotton spinning businesses. Furthermore, with the limited import of foreign cotton fabrics in recent years, the local native cloth has become a major export product. Recently, there has been the so-called improved native cloth, which is a very progressive product. Its appearance is similar to the "Freedom Woolen" produced by the Sanyou Industrial Company in Shanghai in the past, with several colors and yarn thicknesses. It is both elegant and economical, with a market price of 400 to 500 yuan per foot, and is very popular locally.

Drastic Price Fluctuations

Although Haimen can be described as a place of abundant products, general prices are also subject to the ups and downs of the Shanghai market, fluctuating drastically. Several major items, such as wheat, rice, firewood, oil, fish, meat, vegetables, and various foreign daily necessities, are all soaring in price. The most basic living expenses for an ordinary individual are at least around 40,000 yuan per month. This only refers to personal food, haircuts, and laundry, excluding clothing and rent. Although this area has not been affected by the evacuation from Shanghai, with few people returning to their hometowns, it is not easy to rent a decent house in the county or city. Even if you are lucky enough to find one, the rent is shockingly expensive. In terms of actual value, it is at least one dou of rice per room. Currently, the rent is 15,000 yuan per month, and the landlord still says, "What is such a small amount of rent? If I lent out the capital cost of the house, at a rate of two jiao per yuan, 500,000 to 600,000 yuan would yield nearly 100,000 yuan in interest per month!" (Note: "Two jiao per yuan" refers to earning two jiao of interest per yuan per month.) Living in Haimen is indeed not easy!

Culture and Education

Regarding culture here: the entire county has 120 to 130 county-run and private primary and secondary schools, with approximately 20,000 students enrolled. In the county seat alone, there are four middle schools and five primary schools, each with 300 to 500 students. In terms of content, private schools are superior to county schools. Among them, the private Xilei Primary and Secondary School has the best buildings and equipment, while Nengren Middle School and Haixia Middle School are considered the best in terms of academic performance. Private schools collect tuition and fees in the form of Yuan wheat, and the amount is expensive. Middle school students must pay one dan to one and a half dan, and primary school students three dou to six dou. Therefore, private school income is sufficient to be self-sufficient and have a surplus. On average, middle school teachers can earn 2.1 to 3.5 dan per month, and primary school teachers 1.1 to 2.1 (currently, the price of wheat is 45,000 yuan per dan). This salary is higher than that of county school teachers and general lower- and middle-ranking civil servants, who earn only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan per month and are struggling to survive. They can look down upon their peers.

The county seat also has a public education center, with monthly expenses of over 70,000 yuan. The center employs five people, each earning only 8,000 to 10,000 yuan per month. It has five or six types of daily newspapers and a book circulation department with nearly a thousand books, which is very meager. That's all. There are several bookstores in the county seat, but strangely, they don't sell books, only stationery and paper. The only source of fresh spiritual nourishment is a Zhao-surname newspaper vendor who shouts through the streets. He has all the daily newspapers from Shanghai and delivers them to subscribers on a regular basis, collecting payment at the end of the month. Among them, *Shen Bao* and *Xin Zhongguo Bao* have the most readers here. He also sells magazines and new books, such as *Ten Years of Marriage*, *Legend*, *One Gentleman's Draft*, *China Inside Story*, etc., and magazines such as *Chunqiu*, *Shen Bao Monthly*, *The Masses*, *Heaven and Earth*, etc., which sell well. Unfortunately, the prices are too high. Daily newspapers sell for nearly 3,000 yuan per month, and new books and magazines are sold at double or triple the price. (Move to support education)

### Italy Faces Food Shortages, Situation Quite Serious, General Election Scheduled for November

Berne, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Paris dispatches: The Italian interim head of state, Nenni, who is currently in France assisting in promoting the French Socialist Party's gatherings, officially declared a few days ago: "The Italian National Assembly, which will begin general elections this November, will now resolve to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. At present, we firmly believe that the left-wing parties will be able to obtain an absolute majority in the National Assembly."

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from a special correspondent for the *New York Times*: Anyone who visits Italy again in five months will be greatly surprised, because the critical moment for Italy, which declared a truce two years ago, is approaching. Currently, the citizens of Rome place great hope in the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers in London. At the same time, they also deeply hope that the United Nations will sign a peace treaty with Italy that does not involve long-standing territorial disputes, colonial issues, reparations, and military restructuring, which are difficult to resolve in the short term. Instead, the treaty should immediately discuss the serious situation of the entire Italy. The upcoming winter increasingly threatens the survival of most Italian citizens. Food shortages, coal shortages, poor transportation, and rising unemployment are the biggest and most difficult problems facing the Italian people today. At the same time, there are widespread rumors in Italy that the United Nations forces stationed in Italy will soon withdraw, and the general election of the National Assembly is about to be held, causing widespread anxiety. The chaotic situation in northern Italy is especially severe.

### Central Party Headquarters Holds Commemoration Week

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Central Headquarters of the Kuomintang of China held its 262nd weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the main hall of the headquarters at 10:00 AM today. Members of the Central Executive Committee and Central Supervisory Committee, all working comrades of the Central Headquarters, and Kuomintang members from government agencies, totaling approximately 600 people, attended.

After the report, the executive and supervisory committee members of the Jinpu Railway Special Party Department held a swearing-in ceremony. Central Government specially appointed Organization Department Deputy Minister Wu Guanxi to supervise the oath and give instructions. The meeting adjourned at approximately 11:00 AM.

### US and Soviet Rivalry, Roots of Trouble Lie Hidden

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Abend, the New York Times' correspondent in China, once said that even if a part of China, whatever its name, were to be controlled by the Soviet Union, the impact on Asia would be extremely profound, and therefore the danger of the "red" tide would increase. This concern of the United States has now become a reality. On August 9th, the Soviet Union finally dropped its mask and suddenly declared its participation in the war against Japan. The Soviet army has broken through the Manchurian-Soviet border. Regardless of its name, the Soviet Union's participation in the war has given a strong impetus, with different meanings, to both sides of the anti-Japanese resistance. From now on, the Soviet Union will be free to arbitrarily interfere in China's political and military affairs. This phenomenon is indeed one of the United States' greatest concerns. At the same time, the Chongqing side, backed by the United States and expecting to resolve the Communist question, is quite distressed by the sudden expansion of Yan'an's voice due to the Soviet Union's participation in the war. In postwar Europe, the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union has become increasingly acute, and this situation has now reappeared in China. At this critical political juncture, the Soviet Union's declaration of war has caused unprecedented changes in the power of the United States and the Soviet Union in China. Marshal Stalin firmly believes that even if the Soviet Union turns to socialism in one country, the Chinese revolution is essentially linked to the Soviet Union, and he has also incited Yan'an to adopt cunning tactics of fighting against imperialism and opposing wars of aggression. This is nothing but a disguise for the so-called unified Chinese anti-Japanese front, inciting China to war with Japan. This policy has not changed at all even today, so in the future, it will inevitably conflict with the United States' policy toward China, that is, the imperialist capitalist aggression forces. The Yan'an regime deeply understands the Soviet Union's movements and the objective conditions and interests of the international political situation and the so-called world war situation. Therefore, on the one hand, it emphasizes cooperation with Chongqing, and on the other hand, it attempts to extend its power to Chongqing. In fact, Yan'an and the Soviet Union are linked in terms of political ideology, and the linkage in terms of military affairs is also imminent. And the day this is realized will be the day the United States' policy toward China collapses, so this issue will be the core of the Third World War.

### Prosecutor Monnat Enumerates Pétain's Crimes, Strongly Advocates Death Sentence According to Law

Berne, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Paris dispatches: Marshal Pétain, the former head of the Vichy government, was requested by Prosecutor Monnat on Saturday to be sentenced to death, and his defense lawyers have decided to vigorously defend Pétain's life. Monnat insisted on announcing to the public, roughly stating, "The only punishment for national traitors is the death penalty, and the laws of France cannot be changed because of the age of the criminal. The signing of the armistice agreement caused France to fall into shame, destroyed the country's prestige, endured defeat, and was enslaved by the (German) enemy. Moreover, the attack on Britain was disloyal and unjust, assisting the Axis powers in sinking their own ships, and there was no sense of shame or righteousness, but instead French officers and personnel wore German military uniforms. With these charges, I really do not know if there is any further room for forgiveness or reduction of punishment. Now that our court is a place for applying the law, we must punish all criminals according to law."

### Britain and Denmark Sign Trade Agreement

### The Future Path of Chinese Education

— Li Tuorong

National strength hinges on education. To understand the success or failure of education, one must observe the dynamic environment. Only then can education flourish. Since the founding of the Republic of China, internal and external troubles have plagued us, with no peaceful days. Politics is not on track, the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, how can education not be affected! Our current education is a continuation of the May Fourth Movement. Although there has been no significant progress, it is still better than the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China era. However, looking back and forward, a systematic review reveals that a major revolution in Chinese education is necessary to cultivate talents who can adapt to social conditions. Appointing the virtuous and capable is the only way to eradicate deeply ingrained habits. Strengthening the nation and striving for good governance is the only way to cure student anemia. Today's entire education system cannot influence the situation, but is instead being swept into the vortex of trends. If improvements are not urgently sought, national culture will collapse, and the next generation of citizens will lose their national identity. A Western philosopher said, "A school is a small country. One who can govern a school can also govern a country." How can a country prosper if its schools are not good?

The Importance of Education

Strengthen educational institutions and establish a central ideology: I heard Mencius say, "To be well-fed, warmly clothed, and without education is to be close to beasts." It is evident that without education, one cannot be human, and without education, a nation cannot be maintained. In the past, Charlemagne united the Romans into the Holy Roman Empire through education. General Moltke attributed Prussia's victory over France to elementary school teachers. The Duke of Wellington credited the students' baseball game at Eton College for the victory at Waterloo. Japan's victory over Russia was praised by Ito Hirobumi for Japanese elementary schools, and the success of the Russian Revolution was attributed to "books being more powerful than bombs." Strengthening educational institutions is the foundation for a nation's enduring strength, which is evident to all.

Strengthen Educational Institutions

Since education is like a sharp weapon, all major powers control education. As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Therefore, educational institutions cannot be independent because they are used by the government. Consequently, they sometimes lose their educational function. If education were independent and ideas followed the right path, scholars could emerge to save the country in times of crisis. Consider Fang Xiaoru, who refused to draft the enthronement edict for the Prince of Yan, and was not afraid even when his ten clans were exterminated. Wen Tianxiang, with great generosity, wrote, "What have I learned from reading the books of sages?" as he embraced justice. When the Pope violated the law and acted dictatorially, Luther was able to lead the Reformation. When Americans faced bankruptcy, Lincoln emerged to emancipate slaves. When the East India Company oppressed Indians, Burke spoke out for them. This, from the perspective of individual freedom of thought, possesses the power of "an army can be deprived of its commander, but a common man cannot be deprived of his will." Even from an international perspective, ancient Greece and Rome had freedom in education. Later, even though their national power was lost, their education continued to be passed down. Compared to today's European educators under the iron heel of the government, who disappear without a trace along with their countries, the difference is like heaven and earth! Our country's education has always advocated "excel in learning and then serve." If one succeeds, one advances to serve the ruler and benefit the people. If one fails, one retreats to become a teacher of the people, dedicating one's life to politics and education. If bureaucrats and politicians can arbitrarily occupy educational institutions, and heretical ideas can be introduced into classrooms at any time, and local bullies and gangsters can interfere with educational authority, then education cannot be independent, and scholars cannot be the pillars of society. It will inevitably shift with politics. Since any political system has more darkness than light, how can education seek progress? Therefore, I say that if Chinese education wants to advance in the future, it must strengthen educational institutions and implement independence. This is the first point.

Cultivate National Consciousness

National language (vernacular Chinese) is an essential element for uniting the nation. Our government should issue an order to promote it, hoping to eliminate regional dialects in the future. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education should formulate and issue a national language standard for the entire country to follow. Otherwise, modern vernacular Chinese writing will lack grammatical rules, how can it create beautiful language? However, vernacular Chinese changes constantly. The vernacular Chinese of fifty years ago is different from today's. People two hundred years from now may read today's vernacular Chinese as if it were a foreign language. Just as Chaucer and Shakespeare's English is not understood by modern people and is seen as no different from French, any national dialect can change and cannot preserve the national essence to be passed down forever. Therefore, another unchanging language is needed, such as Latin or Greek. Our classical Chinese has already been changed to be more accessible. Major newspapers across the country use this modern classical style. Wherever Chinese people are located, they can understand it at a glance, and it can be passed down forever unchanged. It is truly sufficient to preserve the national essence. All historical records, biographies, memorial inscriptions, eulogies, and all texts to be passed down to future generations should use modern classical style. I believe that all textbooks in junior high schools and below should use vernacular language, while senior high schools and universities must exclusively use modern classical style. Only in this way can one read and speak ancient texts and cultivate national consciousness. This is the second point.

Popularize Children's Education

Our country has always emphasized a patriarchal society and ancestor worship. People only have the concept of family and not of the nation. Apart from the golden age of the Three Dynasties, there has been little benevolent governance. People regard officials as tigers and wolves. How can they love the country? Unless a government of public opinion is organized, the people are protected, and civic training is provided to fulfill national duties, how can the nation be preserved? Today, marriage is failing in major powers. Our family organization is the best. Cultivating oneself, managing one's family, and governing the country is our excellent motto. Divorce and concubinage must be eliminated. Family education must be developed. The education of children under the age of six can affect their lifelong character. There has never been a case where family education is not good and schools can achieve excellence. National education and patriotic movements should start with children. This is the third point.

Shortcomings of the Current Education System

Improve the current education system and create practical education: Dewey said, "Education is human life. Life grows and changes with circumstances. Those who adapt to the environment survive, while those who go against nature are eliminated." Therefore, the purpose, system, facilities, and policies of education cannot be fixed. They vary with the culture and economy of the region. Western education systems may not be suitable for our country. Urban education may not be applicable to rural areas. Liberal education, when applied to children without habits of discipline, is simply harmful. Utilitarian education, when implemented among immoral people, is no different from giving wings to tigers and leopards. Hedonistic education, when added to impoverished countries, accelerates their bankruptcy. Materialistic education, when placed in the hands of atheists, runs rampant. Communist education, when applied to lazy youth, fosters their indulgence.

Improve the Current Education System

Teachers are no different from doctors. They must seize the opportunity and prescribe the right medicine according to the symptoms. Otherwise, education is omnipotent—sufficient to build a nation, but also sufficient to destroy it. Our country's education system and materials are all copied. Many of them are not what is needed, and what is used is not what is learned, which is incompatible with society. In the future, it is advisable to investigate local needs and formulate practical courses, compiling educational regulations according to the country's situation. For example, if a university wants to investigate commercial education, it should implement the following measures:　Investigate how many shops there are in this area.　How many people are needed in each shop.　How to prepare for the work.　How many people are replaced each year. All information should be collected and reported. Then the university should establish a business school to ensure that talents and social needs are aligned. This is the general idea of reforming the education system. The original intention of education is to modify people's shortcomings, making the foolish wise, the weak strong, the evil tamed, the turbid purified, the greedy honest, the timid brave, and the lazy motivated.

Regarding Teacher Training

Teachers do not know the psychology of young people. They do not conduct "scientific tests" for investigation, but rely solely on speculation and experience, often unaware of the actual situation. In the future, party teachers must have specialized knowledge and special training. How to select teaching materials, how to increase or decrease courses, how to legally equip facilities, how to arrange the school scenery, how to fairly evaluate performance, how to appropriately employ people, how to foster student fellowship, how to improve academics, and how to reform malpractices. All educational affairs should not be carried out rashly without "measurement" and empirical evidence. Only in this way can we eliminate the accumulated habits of corruption and initiate a new educational spirit. If we run schools in this way, what learning will not flourish? If we teach people in this way, who will not be transformed? A new education movement that does not start from the needs of the people and the supply of schools will be difficult to achieve. In short, in a narrow sense, anyone can run a school. In a broad sense, only a dedicated person with specialized training, both talent and virtue, is qualified.

Poverty is the biggest problem in our country today. There are many reasons for poverty, but the first reason is that politics is not on track and production is not guaranteed. For example, overseas Chinese who operate businesses abroad and return with full loads often go bankrupt investing domestically. Without knowledge, how can one manufacture? Therefore, "ignorance" is also a cause of poverty. Compulsory education and eliminating illiteracy can remove "ignorance", but promoting education requires money. Therefore, "poverty" is still the culprit. Everyone cherishes propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. How can those who are corrupt have no conscience? However, they are forced by "poverty". One person earns money, and ten or twenty people depend on them for food, forcing them to reach the point where "one member of the family becomes a Buddha, and chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." As the saying goes, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient will propriety and righteousness arise." If a way to eliminate poverty is not found, even if corruption is constantly scolded, it will be of no avail. Moreover, our country's temporary education focuses on teaching principles and ethics, teaching people how to be human, but not teaching people how to support themselves.

Methods of Production Education

The so-called "a scholar who is devoted to the Way but ashamed of bad clothes and bad food is not worth discussing with." The so-called path to production is only about promotion and wealth—"There are houses of gold in books, and there are faces of jade in books. All other professions are inferior, only studying is superior"—this kind of education saves people who are corrupt. In the future, do not repeat the same mistakes. I believe that the first step is to eliminate the names of the academic community—scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants. After the May Fourth Movement, seeing that scholars could not produce, it was changed to farmers, artisans, merchants, and scholars, which is still not satisfactory. Studying is everyone's right, so everyone is in the academic community. Therefore, it is best to change it to farmers, artisans, merchants, and politics, on the one hand to eliminate the bad habit of seeking to be officials, and on the other hand to promote production education. Look at us, from head to toe, the items used in life are all imported. The materials for civil engineering are all produced by foreigners. Even the techniques of a thread and a needle are all foreign products. With such backward production, we are too busy saving ourselves to talk about enriching the country and strengthening the military.

Methods of Production Education

There are many methods of production education, such as establishing more vocational schools—business, fisheries, forestry, agriculture, engineering, animal husbandry, manufacturing, machinery, pharmaceuticals, mining, and so on. It is difficult to list them all. In the past, labor was despised. In the future, it must be corrected. Student labor service teams and the method of rotating spring plowing can wash away the shame of weak scholars. However, temporarily promoting labor plans is not a fundamental solution. I believe that to produce, we must cultivate habits of diligence. From elementary school to university, each year there should be a required labor course, with at least two hours each day, guided by teachers. On the one hand, labor strengthens the bones and muscles to improve physical fitness, and on the other hand, it teaches technology to increase efficiency. This is the first point. Schools should set up a labor introduction department. For those who are hiring odd jobs, they should designate after-school hours and provide introductions on their behalf to enable students to be self-sufficient and reduce the burden on parents and grandparents. This is the second point. School cleaning, washing, building excavation, gardening, and repairs should be done by students as much as possible, without hiring laborers, only using student services, and paying them wages to enable them to be self-reliant. This is the third point. Extra-curricular life courses should be set up to train labor skills. Only those who have been trained should be dispatched. This is the fourth point. The above production education is already practiced in American schools and can be emulated.

Eliminate Illiteracy: Without eliminating illiteracy, there is no education in society, and it is said to be the largest country in the world with a quarter of the population—among 450 million people, almost 400 million are illiterate; in addition, the characters are difficult and daunting, and the writing is abstract, with only a few numbers containing profound meanings, and it is difficult to understand without chewing the words; therefore, although our country's books contain all modern theories, they still rely on Western learning; although the ancients invented various scientific skills, later generations could not continue them, so they gave up on themselves and copied everything; in the future, writing must be simplified, writing must be deductive, language must be common, application must be convenient, copying must be rapid, teaching methods must be modern, and management must be populist, so that people can understand it at a glance, saving time and effort, so that they can do other things.

And we must strictly set a five-year plan to popularize education, and those in charge and those who protect children will be subject to appropriate punishment, because only when all the people of the country are literate can government orders be carried out swiftly.

Raise the Level of Teachers

To advance education, the plan for today is: (1) Constantly raise the level of teachers and strictly train them: According to recent foreign restrictions on teacher training entrance examinations:　Young men and women must have noble character.　They must be physically healthy and have a respectable appearance.　Their attitude must be appropriate and not frivolous.　They must have sufficient talent and be confident that they can fulfill the vocation of a teacher.　Those whose university grades do not reach B are not allowed to enter the College of Education.　Those who graduate in four years are elementary school teachers, those who graduate in five years are middle school teachers, and those who do not have a master's degree or above from famous domestic and foreign schools are not allowed to be university professors. (2) The teaching profession is sacred: Those who obtain the qualifications of the first article are appointed by the government as lifelong teachers, and even those who are suspended should be used as educational administrative civil servants, and the government should pay for their old-age expenses, so that they can be encouraged: (3) Teachers with excellent performance should be rewarded once every fifteen years, praised once every thirty years, and bestowed with the honor of the first rank after fifty years. (4) Teachers not only have the freedom of academic speech, but also the right to manage and discipline in the classroom, and the principal cannot interfere. The above four methods of training teachers will be able to restore the atmosphere of respecting teachers and upholding the Way, and make people dedicate themselves to educational service. Please do not treat these words lightly!

Achieve the Three Principles of the People Education

The purpose of education is not only to cultivate knowledge and ability, but also to pay attention to the "Three Nourishments"—nourishing a strong will and being able to unite knowledge and action; nourishing a love of beauty and eliminating all evil deeds; and nourishing the strength of fire and being able to reason and strive. In terms of life, it can also improve efficiency—how to make a living, how to support a family, how to use natural resources, how to make money and save the country, which is called production education, in order to achieve the purpose of the Three Principles of the People Education. As for "ignorance being the root of all evil," education must be popularized, and "teachers are like fathers," and only when teachers are respected can the Way be revered. The future of our country's education is bright and boundless. People with lofty aspirations, come forth!

### All Businesses and Shops Should Immediately Resume Operations - Economic Bureau Holds a Discussion Meeting with Various Industries

The Municipal Economic Bureau, concerned about the past two days of price chaos and shop closures, which have greatly affected society and people's livelihood, specially convened a discussion meeting with various industry associations at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 13th) in the bureau's conference room. Representatives from over thirty associations attended, including grains, sauces, local goods, pork, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, department stores, restaurants, northern sundries, pastries, egg industry, northern and southern goods, coal briquettes, flour, alcohol, vegetables, cigarettes, matches and candles, dyeing industry, new pharmaceuticals, Chinese and foreign department stores, watches, pawnshops, industrial oils, rubber, hardware, clothing industry, electrical appliance industry, pigments, thread, utensils, and other industries, as well as Mr. Wan, a representative from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and over ten others. Director Liu delivered a speech, ultimately conveying the following instructions for strict compliance by all shops: (1) All businesses and shops should immediately resume operations, focusing on their core operations, and should not close without reason, causing social unrest and affecting people's livelihood. (2) All businesses and shops should not refuse to sell goods without reason, causing problems for the lives of citizens. (3) During this critical economic juncture, all businesses and shops should not arbitrarily raise prices, causing the social economy to head towards bankruptcy. (4) Citizens should share in the hardships of the times and should not purchase goods exceeding their needs. If there is suspicion of hoarding, shops are instructed to request the presentation of citizen identification cards, record the numbers, and report them to the Intelligence Bureau for investigation. All industry leaders expressed their acceptance. Subsequently, reports were given by representatives from three associations, including Chinese and foreign department store businesses (omitted). The discussion concluded at 1:00 PM, and was considered quite satisfactory.

Chamber of Commerce Urges

Mr. Yu Yuanlu, a director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Wen Lanting, the chief supervisor, noting that in recent days various businesses have stopped trading and closed their doors in unison, causing a stir in the market, which is of great importance to the people's livelihood, and having already issued a notice from the chamber to all businesses to resume operations, although many have complied, many are still observing, Mr. Yuan and others, in order to actively urge all industries to return to normalcy, convened a meeting of leaders from all industries in the city at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 13th) to discuss urging all industries to resume trading immediately to ensure people's livelihood.

Notice to All Industries

Furthermore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued another notice to all businesses to open their doors, the original text of which is as follows: "The Chamber has investigated that due to the impact of the current situation, some businesses in the city have stopped trading. The Chamber has already published a notice in the newspaper requesting that everyone resume operations. In the past two days, many have complied with the resumption of operations, but there are still a few businesses that are taking a wait-and-see attitude, causing the market to not fully recover, which is deeply regrettable. It must be known that the local authorities are absolutely responsible for maintaining local security and social order. The banking and money industries and the stock market, which are related to finance, have all returned to normal operations, and the receipt and disbursement of funds are still smooth and fluid, without any hindrance. All businesses should understand the hardships of the times and resume normal operations in unison to maintain the status quo. We urge everyone who has not opened their doors to comply and not delay any further. It is of utmost importance, and this notice is hereby issued."

### Lieutenant Colonel Shimada Discusses the Sino-Soviet Border War - Japanese and Manchukuo Armies Calmly Responding

The Shanghai Information Department held its regular press conference at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 13th). Lieutenant Colonel Shimada of the Army, Press Officer Katsuno, and Captain Matsumoto of the Army attended. Lieutenant Colonel Shimada provided a comprehensive observation of the Sino-Soviet border war. Details are as follows:

Fierce Fighting Unfolds on the Manchukuo-Soviet Border

Currently, the Kwantung Army of Manchukuo is engaged in combat on the eastern, western, and northern fronts. The Soviet army is invading the territory of Manchukuo from the eastern, western, and northern directions. On the western front, the Soviet army is advancing from Ujumqin in Outer Mongolia towards Linxi. In the north, Soviet troops have invaded Manchuria and are advancing along the Qiqihar railway line towards Hailar. Sanhe, north of this area, is also under attack by Soviet troops, who are attempting to converge with the Soviet troops invading Manchuria in Hailar. Fierce battles are unfolding in the surrounding area. A portion of the Soviet army is also attempting to seize Solun. The Soviet troops south of Heihe and a portion of the troops in Qiqike are currently advancing. Regarding the Soviet troops invading Hulin in the east, they are advancing along the Hulin line. In the south of the eastern front, the area east of Suifenhe and a portion of Suifen are extending towards Muling via Suiyang. On the Qingxing and Korean border, battles are occurring near Rason via Unggi. On all fronts, the Kwantung Army, in unity with the officials and people, is launching counterattacks.

Japanese Army Operations Will Make Progress

In addition, a portion of the Soviet Air Force is responding to the ground forces' invasion by launching small-scale air raids or ground attacks on major cities in Manchukuo, such as Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Harbin, Xinjing, and Jilin. As for the strength of the Soviet invasion force, no accurate figures have been reported to date. Judging from the current state of the war, there are no large-scale forces. There may be a portion of mechanized troops invading on the western front, so it is still too early to judge the enemy's intentions. Regarding the terrain of the three fronts, in the eastern front, the battles centered on Suifenhe and Dongning are mostly fought on high ground, and the terrain is dangerous. Therefore, fighting here is difficult for both the enemy and us. Secondly, on the Hulin front north of Lake Khanka, in addition to the Wandashan Mountains, there are mostly wetlands and swamps extending to the opposite bank of Khabarovsk near the Soviet border. The north of the Heihe River basin, along the border area, has few plains. In addition, the Lesser Khingan Mountains are high. On the Hailar front in the north, used as the province, the grassland is a land, that is, the famous Greater Khingan Mountains, extremely the Linxi front, connected to the outer Mongolian mountains, up to the Sino-Manchukuo border. All Kwantung Army fighting on those fronts are well trained in their terrain, and will surely be able to cope with the enemy in the future, and will certainly give them pain. The current Kwantung Army is calmly greeting the enemy coming, and will surely give it a severe blow.

### Drastic Measures Will Be Taken Against Violations of Light Control - Announcement by the Air Defense Headquarters

The Municipal Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, in order to strictly enforce light control, issued an announcement stating: "In recent days, due to citizens' misinterpretation of the war situation, light control has been neglected, which is regrettable. Seeing that the entire Greater East Asia is still at war, citizens should adapt to wartime conditions and understand the intentions of the authorities, strengthen the civil air defense position, and always be vigilant. Light control must be strictly enforced. Citizens should strictly abide by the implementation, and after 10:00 PM every night, they must still enter the state of light control, absolutely avoiding light leaks. All vendors must use air defense lights when operating before 10:00 PM, and all operations must be stopped after 10:00 PM. All vehicles should also implement vehicle light control to prevent enemy aircraft from invading and protect the safety of Greater Shanghai. The police authorities of the Swiss Army will work with the Baojia self-defense groups to organize light control crackdowns and strictly investigate. The headquarters has also adopted a resolute attitude, taking the same measures as the military and police authorities, and will resolutely adopt a strict joint responsibility system for those who violate light control, cutting off electricity on the spot. It is hoped that citizens will monitor each other, and report those who deliberately violate the regulations to the police station in charge for punishment, to avoid being implicated innocently. Other air defense facilities must also be rectified and must not be damaged in any way. Those who violate the regulations will also be handed over to the military and police authorities for strict punishment according to the law."

### Police Bureau Advises Against Displaying National Flags

The Police Bureau authorities issued a statement advising against the display of national flags, saying: "Recently, the display of national flags has been observed in various districts of the city. The national flag is a symbol representing the nation, and we should earnestly respect it and not use it lightly, as everyone is well aware. Currently, various rumors are circulating. Citizens should be self-respecting and cautious, maintain a calm and composed attitude, and refrain from displaying national flags."

### Silver and Money Businesses Decide to Continue Accepting and Making Payments as Usual

The Shanghai Silver and Money Trade Association, recognizing the significant impact of banks and money houses on the market and various industries, convened an emergency joint meeting of the silver and money industries the other day. They resolved to adopt the following temporary measures regarding the operations of various banks and money houses:

㈠ Banks and money houses will continue to accept and make payments for customer deposits as usual. (A) Banks and money houses will accept all customer deposits, whether in the form of negotiable instruments or cash. (B) All cash received by banks and money houses may be deposited into the Central Bank of China, the Silver Union, or the Money Treasury at any time, except for a portion set aside as vault cash.

㈡ Banks and money houses should immediately cease lending to customers if the intended use of the loan is abnormal, unnecessary, or could fuel speculation.

It is understood that the association notified all member banks and money houses of the above measures, which are critical to the entire financial industry, yesterday, and they are required to comply with them from the date of the notice.

### Gold and Securities Market Conditions

The gold and securities market operated as usual yesterday. There was no market for matured bonds. The price of the fifth issue was as follows:

Opening price: 8.4 million yuan; highest: 8.8 million yuan; lowest: 8.4 million yuan; closing price: 8.8 million yuan; transaction volume: 765 taels.

### The Experiment of Curing Illnesses Through Meditation

Ling Zhengdu

Today's youth, being seduced by the outside world, mostly suffer from bad habits such as masturbation, resulting in physical and mental weakness, neurasthenia, and even incomplete development, nocturnal emission, and premature ejaculation. Those who suffer from this illness are mostly in a state of depression and emotional instability, let alone being energetic, vigorous, and ambitious. Therefore, on a small scale, they sacrifice the happiness of their lives, and on a large scale, they actually affect the health of the nation.

I suffered from this illness in my childhood, and the pain I felt due to physical and mental impairment is difficult to describe in words. When I reached the age of twenty, I devoted my occupational income to the injection of "hormone preparations." In three years, I tried all the famous medicines from various countries, hoping to stimulate endocrine function and restore health. As a result, I gained nothing except a relatively pleasant physical and mental state. Moreover, when the injections were interrupted, the symptoms of neurasthenia (such as back pain, brain swelling, tinnitus, and fatigue) remained the same. Therefore, I knew that hormone preparations were only a temporary solution. Other methods of physical health, such as cold water baths, are only preventive measures and cannot be relied upon as a fundamental cure.

After practicing meditation for only eighty days, my *qi* flowed through the three *guan*, and my complexion changed from pale yellow to normal. Occasionally, when I encountered symptoms such as a cold or throat swelling, I only needed to meditate once to recover. The evil winds were dispelled by the *zhengqi* during meditation. The previous symptoms of back pain and tinnitus disappeared unconsciously. Moreover, when meditating, the body and mind are comfortable, the endocrine glands are active, and there is heat. After sitting, one feels energetic, and dealing with things and people is full of interest. If the *qi* and blood are not deficient, all diseases will be eliminated. Therefore, the health benefits of meditation not only allow those suffering from youth diseases to celebrate their rebirth but also provide all people in the world with a natural "hormone" that can be used to prolong life and prevent disease. Therefore, I disclose this to tell my fellow sufferers among young people that they can seek within their own bodies and minds, without resorting to drugs.

### Special Court Sentences Three Cases of Public Officials' Malfeasance; Sentences and Fines Imposed

The Shanghai Branch of the National Government Special Court sentenced three cases of police malfeasance, etc., yesterday (the 13th) at 10:00 AM. Excerpts are as follows:

Treasury Official Embezzles Public Funds: ㈠ Chang Zhaoxiang, a staff member of the Treasury Section of the Municipal Finance Bureau, was responsible for bookkeeping, auditing, and assisting in the cashier and accounting affairs. In April of this year, due to the high cost of living and low monthly income, he thought that the section chief, Chen , often handed over the section's checkbooks and payment seals for him to hold and use on his behalf. He then conspired with his classmate, Jin Rui, to embezzle public funds, promising Jin Rui one-fifth of the profits. On the 10th of that month, he stamped the receipt for the checkbook from the section's checkbook with the aforementioned seal, and Jin Rui received checkbook No. 207 from the Shanghai Branch of the Ningbo Industrial Bank at 23 Ningbo Road on the 14th. On the 18th, he stamped two blank checks in the checkbook and handed them over to Jin Rui, instructing him to fill out a check for 2 million yuan, dated April 19th. Jin Rui obtained 1 million yuan in cash and 1 million yuan in transfer orders the next day. He handed the cash to an employee of the Juxingcheng Bank, his brother Jin Changxi, in exchange for a transfer order for 1,020,000 yuan. He used another transfer order for 1 million yuan to purchase two gold rings, weighing 7.42 *qian* in total, for 898,000 yuan at the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop at 479 Nanjing Road. The remaining 100,200 yuan, along with the transfer order, were deposited into Jin Rui's account at the Yumin Bank to earn interest, except for the odd 22,000 yuan. On the 24th, Chang Zhaoxiang again instructed Jin Rui to fill out a check for 3 million yuan and obtain three transfer orders for 1 million yuan each. Taking advantage of the section's opportunity to transfer the received bills to the bank, he drew out a check for 2.4 million yuan from the Fuxing Bank and two transfer orders for 300,000 yuan each. The next day, he obtained a transfer order for 2.4 million yuan from the Fuxing Bank and deposited it into the account of his uncle, Wang Weibao, of the Nanjing Meixin Stationery Store, in the Trust Department of the Guohua Bank, obtaining a receipt, which he sent home to Nanjing by express mail. The two transfer orders for 300,000 yuan each, totaling 600,000 yuan, were handed over to Jin Rui for storage. After the section chief discovered the matter, he reported it to the National Government, which ordered the court to try the case. Chang Zhaoxiang was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for jointly and continuously embezzling items held in public office, and fined 50,000 yuan, with deprivation of public rights for life. If he is unable to pay the fine, the total amount of the fine will be converted into forced labor based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to the number of days in six months. Jin Rui was sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment for jointly and continuously embezzling items held in public office, and fined 50,000 yuan, with deprivation of public rights for 5 years. If he is unable to pay the fine, he will be converted into forced labor at a rate of 500 yuan per day.

Sub-Bureau Police Officers Accepting Bribes

㈡ Cai Zhongkui, a police officer from the Lingjiamu Police Station of the Dongchanglu Sub-Bureau of the Municipal Police Bureau, was assigned to patrol at the Lingjiamu Bridge pier on the morning of May 7th at around 6:00 AM. Seeing pedestrians carrying goods, he would deliberately make things difficult for them, demanding bribes of 200 to 300 yuan before allowing them to pass. Zhang Jinchun and Chen Wu, carrying coal, each paid 200 yuan. After crossing the river, they were again stopped by Huang Keguang, a patrol officer from the Yulin Road Sub-Bureau, at the Andong Road public pier, who used the same method, causing them to pay bribes of 200 yuan and 300 yuan, respectively. The matter was discovered by inspectors from the Police Bureau's Inspection Department. They led Zhang Jinchun and others to identify Cai Zhongkui, and found a total of 3,700 yuan in bribes he had continuously received from pedestrians. He was handed over to the Police Bureau, which forwarded the case to the Mayor to be presented to the National Government, which ordered the court to try the case. Cai Zhongkui was sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment for continuously accepting bribes for official actions, and fined 30,000 yuan, with deprivation of public rights for life. If he is unable to pay the fine, the total amount of the fine will be converted into forced labor based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to the number of days in six months. Huang Keguang was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months of imprisonment for continuously accepting bribes for official actions, and fined 20,000 yuan, with deprivation of public rights for life. If he is unable to pay the fine, the total amount of the fine will be converted into forced labor based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to the number of days in six months. The 3,700 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates was confiscated, and the 500 yuan in bribes received by Huang Keguang was recovered and confiscated.

Fraudulently Claiming Free Rice Rations for Police Officers

㈢ Shao Tianxing, an employee of the Municipal Police Welfare Society, was responsible for collecting tickets for the distribution of May's police rice rations to officers of the General Bureau on June 4th of this year. Seeing an opportunity to take advantage of the situation and obtain illegal gains, he did not stamp the paid mark on four ration tickets for free police rice that had already been claimed by plainclothes police chiefs Li Shijin and Hu Wenbin (6 *dou* each) from the Special High Section, and Police Sergeant Qi Shouxian (6 *dou*) and Zhong Yupu (2.5 *dou*) from the Fifth Inspection District. The next day, he handed them over to his friend Wu Lianqing, who knew about the matter, who in turn entrusted the Jiang Liandi and Jiang Lingdi sisters at 50 Peideli, Datong Road, to reclaim them. The rice distributor at the society mistakenly believed that they had not yet been claimed and issued 8.5 *dou* of rice to Jiang Lingdi, who held the ration tickets for Li Shijin and Liang Yupu. At that time, there were many people crowding around, and Jiang Liandi had not yet received her rice. Zhang Jingzhi, an employee of the society who knew her, saw that the rice recipients on her rice tickets were Hu Wenbin and Qi Shouxian, and became suspicious. After investigating and discovering that the tickets had already been claimed, she reported the information to the Deputy Manager, who recovered the rice claimed by her sister. The case was sent to the Police Bureau, which forwarded it to the Mayor to be presented to the National Government, which ordered the court to try the case. Shao Tianxing was sentenced to 4 years of imprisonment for using his official position to attempt to unlawfully obtain benefits for himself by using fraudulent means to induce others to hand over their property, and fined 50,000 yuan, with deprivation of public rights for 4 years. If he is unable to pay the fine, he will be converted into forced labor at a rate of 1,000 yuan per day. Wu Lianqing was sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment for assisting in the attempt to unlawfully obtain benefits for himself by using fraudulent means to induce others to hand over their property, and fined 30,000 yuan. If he is unable to pay the fine, he will be converted into forced labor at a rate of 1,000 yuan per day.
