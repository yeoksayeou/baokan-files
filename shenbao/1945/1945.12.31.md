### Small Shadows Looming Between China and the Soviet Union; Northeast Situation Remains Gloomily Stagnant; Discussions Pending on Industrial and Mining Interests and Landing

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Beiping, 29th] It is said that Chiang Ching-kuo did not even have a peaceful Christmas, busily braving wind and snow to fly to Moscow. If this news is true, then his great task should be to remove some grains of sand from the eyes of Sino-Soviet friendship. The first grain of sand is probably the industrial and mining interests. Although the Soviet government has never formally raised it, the problem does exist. According to the viewpoint of Soviet Far East Marshal Malinovsky, the heavy industry in the Northeast is all Japanese military industry and contains a significant implication of anti-Soviet warfare. Therefore, it should be a fruit of the Red Army's victory. However, Chinese officials in charge of Northeast economics believe that war spoils should be things that can be moved away, and the Soviet army can take what it considers war spoils back to their own country. The negotiation of this matter stopped here and was not resolved. In the past two months, this problem has cast a shadow over the Northeast like a ghost. The second grain of sand should be the failure of the majority of the National Army to land in Dalian at the end of October, which even senior officials who signed treaties in Moscow felt was very sudden and unexpected. Recently, Malinovsky stated that Dalian is not under his jurisdiction and he cannot send liaison officers to assist in the takeover, which has put Chinese officials in extreme bewilderment. In addition, the Andong issue is also a small grain of sand. The Soviet side has stated that it cannot assist in the takeover of that area because there are no Soviet troops stationed there. Andong Province is a war zone rich in mountains and people of different nationalities. Japan never truly ruled this area during the fourteen years of the Northeast's occupation. A person of considerable standing told me that if Andong cannot be smoothly taken over, the Northeast cannot be at peace. The so-called grains of sand may not only be these, but these alone have already pricked the eyes of Sino-Soviet friendship. Shouldn't everyone remove them from each other's eyes?

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Beiping, 28th] The situation in the Northeast is like malaria, with alternating chills and fever. In the past half-week, news from the Northeast has become stagnant again. Some unresolved issues may have been discussed in countries extremely far away. Chiang Ching-kuo's whereabouts have become a mystery here. Currently, the takeover work in the Northeast seems to be a matter of formality and has not yet been agreed upon. Xiong Shihui is in Beiping and seems quite leisurely. For the past three days, he has gathered personnel from the three provincial governments every day to discuss the principles of conduct and work, giving speeches lasting over two hours each time. Although Chairman Chiang has ordered the chairmen of each province to arrive in the Northeast before New Year's Day, it seems that it will have to be slightly delayed. Most of them will likely greet the new year in Beiping. If everything goes smoothly, they are expected to return to the Northeast in nine batches before the 4th or 5th of next month. The National Army preparing for airlift to Changchun is still awaiting orders here. Li Zefen, commander of the Fifth Division, flew to Jinzhou a few days ago to meet Du Yuming and seek instructions. The start of the airlift should not be far off. Shu Shicun, deputy commander of the New Sixth Army, arrived in Beiping the day before yesterday. Soldiers of the New Sixth Army, fully equipped with American gear, appeared on the streets of Beiping for the first time.

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Beiping, 29th] Chairman of Rehe Province, Liu Duoquan, flew to Jinzhou a few days ago to discuss the takeover of Rehe with General Du Yuming. After finishing the discussions, he flew to Tianjin yesterday and returned to Beiping this afternoon to prepare everything. Over forty members of the Rehe Provincial Government who came to Beiping from Chongqing have arrived. Among the department heads, only Liu Lianke, head of the Education Department, has not arrived in Suiyuan. The remaining twenty or so will go to Shanghai from Chongqing and then head north by sea. The Beiping-Rehe Railway is currently only open to Shixia. General judgement says that the personnel of the Rehe Provincial Government will detour through Jinzhou and advance into Rehe with the army.

### Although Our Mayor Has Assumed Office; Soviet Side Still Controls Changchun and Shenyang; National Army Moves Westward to Rehe and Recaptures Yixian

[Dispatch from United Press, Beiping, 30th] The current situation of the National Government taking over Changchun and Shenyang seems to be more nominal than real. According to sources close to the Northeast Headquarters: Although the mayor appointed by the National Government has taken office, the cities of Changchun and Shenyang are still effectively controlled by the Soviet army. Aside from the Chinese mayor and his small number of staff, and personnel from the Bank of China, Soviet officials continue to operate as they see fit. General Du Yuming's troops moving north to Shenyang are awaiting the results of the Sino-Soviet negotiations in Xinmin. At the same time, General Du's troops are also extending westward into the Rehe area, continuing to exert pressure on the port of Yingkou to the east. According to the latest military news: General Du Yuming's troops, extending westward into Rehe, have already recaptured Yixian. Yixian is the railway transportation hub connecting Jinzhou to Rehe. After the National Army recovered Jingumen (transliteration), which is on the border of Rehe and the Northeast, it continued to extend into Rehe Province. Soviet officials have announced that they have withdrawn from the area. The city governments of Changchun, Shenyang, and other cities are like "one-man bands." All important affairs, such as police affairs, transportation, and transport issues, must rely on the Soviet side. Although the Bank of China in these two places has resumed operations, Soviet military currency continues to circulate in the market. Yang Chuoan, the mayor of Harbin, arrived at his post yesterday. The mayor of Dalian will also fly from Changchun to Harbin in the short term and is currently in Changchun awaiting permission from the Soviet side before assuming office. After the mayors appointed by the central government arrive, the Soviet authorities in Dalian and Harbin will continue to exercise their powers, because before the National Army arrives by airlift, a small number of officials are really insufficient to take over and manage the cities.

[Dispatch from United Press, Tianjin, 30th] In the week of Christmas, the American troops in North China, in addition to guarding the railway lines in the cold wind and protecting the coal trains coming from the Northeast, did not encounter other sniper incidents. Du Yuming's troops have not yet moved into Shenyang, but another 5,000 central government troops have newly arrived at Huludao from South China on Liberty-class transport ships. According to reliable sources, Du Yuming's troops may not be able to enter Shenyang in two weeks. The delay of the National Army's entry into Jiyang is said to be because the crux of the matter is still with the Soviet Union. All parties seem to be awaiting a certain decision to determine future actions. In addition, there will be more central government troops sent from South China to land at Huludao. In the future, there will be nine or ten armies in the Northeast under the command of Du Yuming. It is expected that the National Army will not encounter resistance when entering Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin in the future.

### American Railway Equipment Shipped from Iran to China to Assist in Our Country's Post-War Reconstruction

[Dispatch from United Press, Washington, 29th] The Secretary of State announced today that the remaining railway equipment in Iran, worth approximately six million U.S. dollars, has been sold to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for use in China. At the same time, the White House revealed that American civil aviation aircraft engines and equipment in Iran have been ordered to be transferred from the Department of the Army to the Civil Aeronautics Administration of the Department of Commerce on New Year's Day next year, which may be related to the withdrawal of American troops from Iran in early next year. Overseas Liquidation Commissioner MacPugh announced that railway equipment originally worth over eight million U.S. dollars, now in Khorramshahr, Iran, is being transported to China by ten cargo ships and one locomotive transport ship to aid post-war economic reconstruction, while also serving as the main means of transport for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Fifty percent of all locomotives and other railway equipment will be shipped to Shanghai, and the remainder will be shipped to Hong Kong and Kowloon. The resold items include twenty diesel locomotives, one thousand five hundred and forty-eight gondola cars, one thousand three hundred and seventy boxcars, four hundred and ninety-nine flatcars, twenty-four twenty-ton cabooses, eight paving cars, and forty-two thousand eight hundred feet of seventy-five-pound railroad tracks.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] After the snowfall, the outdoor temperature in Shenyang today was five degrees Celsius below zero, which is seventeen degrees different from Changchun's twenty-two degrees. Zhang Jia'ao was originally scheduled to fly to Harbin at 1:00 PM today, but due to heavy fog with visibility only reaching 200 meters, which made flying unfavorable, it was temporarily changed to traveling by special military train on the Changchun Railway at 7:20 PM tonight.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Liu Zhuzhou, Shenyang, 28th] When Mayor Dong Wenqi received the municipal administration at 10:00 AM on the 27th, Soviet Deputy Commander Hu Cheng and a liaison officer dispatched from the Soviet Army Headquarters in Changchun were present at the ceremony. The mayor first addressed all city government staff, district chiefs, and school principals, encouraging them to be self-aware, disciplined, orderly, and cherish the reputation of the nation, preserve local vitality. He also listed abolishing harsh policies, relieving the poor, revitalizing industry, and stabilizing people's livelihoods as the guiding principles for future administration. Subsequently, Soviet Army Commander Govodov delivered a speech, saying: Today is the day when Shenyang City, which has been occupied for fourteen years, formally returns to the rule of the Chinese Central Government, and he is very honored to be able to participate in this grand ceremony. He also solemnly stated that before his withdrawal, he will do his utmost to assist Mayor Dong in removing all obstacles that may hinder the development of the municipal administration. After the meeting, the guests and hosts raised their glasses to wish the leaders of China and the Soviet Union good health. Furthermore, when the Bank of China opened, the Soviet commander and deputy commander also attended. Banks that started operations here today also include the Bank of China.

### Northeast and North China Desperately Need Personnel; Various Industries Await Experts to Take Over

[Dispatch from United Press, Jinzhou, 29th] The victory of war does not necessarily mean the achievement of peace. This can be powerfully proved by the affairs in the Northeast. The land of the Nine Eastern Provinces is fertile and rich in treasures. For fourteen years, it has been ruled by Japan under a puppet government. Now it is gradually being recovered by the central government. However, Japan's economic power there has not yet been broken. When Japan controlled the Northeast, it anticipated the day when it would launch a large-scale military attack on Siberia. Therefore, it rapidly carried out an industrialization plan and built railways extensively. As a result, the total mileage of the railways is more than the sum of all other parts of China. There are also many textile factories. The production of coal and iron is abundant, and there are also some oil reserves. On fertile land cultivated for hundreds of years, industrial cities have sprung up suddenly. This economic development is mostly maintained by highly trained Japanese technicians. They are still staying here. Because China does not have enough talents to replace them, it has no choice but to continue employing them. Otherwise, all kinds of factories will be closed down. Many foreign observers and knowledgeable Chinese people believe that this kind of reliance on the Japanese will inevitably allow the Japanese to maintain their dominant control in the Northeast's industrial circle. A certain important person even said: "If we let the Japanese continue to take root, I am afraid that we will no longer be able to eradicate them. Their creativity is endless. They will inevitably take advantage of every opportunity when China is divided to consolidate their position." Japan's diplomatic policy has always been based on the division of China. Tens of thousands of Japanese technicians, relying on their talents, have such dreams to profit from it. The situation in North China is similar. Industrial technicians and Japanese soldiers continue to be employed. There are 50,000 American troops and tens of thousands of puppet troops guarding the railways around Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping to prevent the communist army from sabotage. On a certain railway line from Qinhuangdao to the inland, there are four types of guards: Central Army, American Army, Japanese Army, and Puppet Army. This railway connects to the Kailuan Coal Mine, which is jointly operated by China and Britain. Coal for Shanghai, Beiping, and Hong Kong is all supplied from here. The American army is very puzzled by this situation, because when they came here, they were told that their mission was to disarm the Japanese army. Six months ago, they were still fighting bloody battles with the Japanese army on the Ryukyu Islands, but now they are in China and are guarding together with the Japanese army. Isn't this strange? The Japanese army is located between the Central Army and the Communist Army and can be used as a buffer. Japanese people with industrial technology can be used to operate factories in North China. In short, the brainpower and physical strength of the defeated army have all been utilized. However, the question is whether the defeated Japanese can still maintain their dominant position in the Nine Eastern Provinces and North China. If so, then the employed Japanese will still have the opportunity to be the masters.

### Chairman Gan Gu Zhenglun Departs Lanzhou for Tianshui to Attend Baotian Railway Opening Ceremony

### Marshall to Go to North China

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Today is the second Sunday that Special Envoy Marshall has spent in the foggy mountain city. At 11:00 AM, Marshall went to the Qiujing Middle School Church to attend the service.

[Dispatch from United Press, Chongqing, 30th] As the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers and General Marshall's shuttle diplomacy in Chongqing come to a close, the Communist Party is advancing its political offensive while taking a wait-and-see attitude on the military front. The Kuomintang, on the other hand, is maintaining its firm political defensive posture while expanding its military strength. Both sides have high expectations for the Political Consultative Conference and General Marshall's efforts.

### Contents of Petitions from Beiping Citizens Released; Mostly Requests for Pensions and Relief; Chairman Chiang Orders Swift and Careful Handling Based on Established Principles

Next, there were 353 suggestions for national construction, providing opinions on various military, political, economic, and social constructions, many of which were worthy of reference, showing the people's eagerness for national construction. There were also 153 complaints against public officials, military police, and takeover personnel for illegal acts and dereliction of duty. Some were seeking redress for their own suffering, while others were reporting facts witnessed or heard out of a sense of justice. In addition, there were 80 reports of communist atrocities, all listing the atrocities of the Communist Party or the Communist Army in colluding with the enemy and puppets in various places, looting materials, killing loyal and good people, posing as democrats, and destroying transportation, as well as the various hardships suffered by the people, requesting the government to quickly resolve them in order to eliminate harm to the people. There were also 195 other petitions that did not fall into the above categories, and 155 that did not have names or addresses. All petitions are being processed with increased efforts.

Editorial

### The Grading System and Quota System for Exchange Rates

Foreign exchange issues are of utmost concern to current observers. With rumors of a new exchange rate to be announced on New Year's Day, the market is even more concerned. In the past, only the financial and import/export industries paid attention to the upward movements of the previous exchange rate. Now, general industry and commerce, and even the general public, are all watching with anticipation. The reason for this is not an increased interest in economics among the general population, but rather the increased relationship between exchange rates and people's livelihoods.

In the past, our country was a silver standard nation, and all prices fluctuated with the gold-silver ratio. When the gold-silver ratio was relatively stable, all prices, whether for imports or exports, were also relatively stable. When there were drastic changes, it was only when the balance of international payments was disrupted. After a period of remedy, all prices would often adjust accordingly and return to a stable state. The reason for this was that domestic prices and foreign prices had a common standard. What was this common standard? It was hard currency, that is, the gold-silver ratio.

Since the circulation of silver coins ceased and all banknotes effectively became inconvertible paper money, prices and currency values began to diverge. However, at that time, banknotes still had a fixed exchange rate with the British pound and the US dollar, i.e., the exchange rate with the British pound was set at one shilling and two and a half pence, and application was relatively convenient. Therefore, although the banknotes themselves had no direct value, they still had indirect value, and they still had a certain value. Therefore, prices were still in a relatively stable state at that time. In other words, prices had a close connection with banknotes, and domestic prices still had a close connection with foreign prices. The reason why domestic prices did not fluctuate drastically in the era of inconvertible paper money lies in this.

Since the coastal ports were completely blockaded by the enemy, and goods could not circulate, the central bank's foreign exchange quotation became a nominal exchange rate with only a name but no market. All the few export bills of exchange and remittances from overseas Chinese were also controlled by the central government. Therefore, domestic prices began to be completely controlled by banknotes, completely divorced from the gold-silver ratio, and even more completely divorced from foreign prices. Moreover, as a result of the long-term war of resistance, banknotes increased and inflation occurred due to financial reasons, and the occupied areas were also flooded with countless counterfeit currencies. Therefore, prices continued to skyrocket, the foundation of industry and commerce was shaken, and the suffering of the people increased day by day. Today, the general public, unanimously paying attention to exchange rates and unanimously hoping for the early regulation of exchange rates, focuses on this, not solely for the sake of restoring import and export trade. To put it plainly, they hope that prices and currency will regain contact, and even regain contact with foreign prices, thereby stabilizing prices, stabilizing industry and commerce, and stabilizing people's livelihoods.

The aforementioned sentiment can be said to be very common. Not only do the people hope so, but the government also hopes so. The problem is: how should this exchange rate be regulated? Because if it is set too high, it means that the currency value is low. Then, on the good side, it can (1) stimulate enterprises, (2) promote export trade, (3) protect domestic industry, (4) encourage all production, and (5) reduce the deficit of imports over exports, so that the balance of international payments is not too far apart. However, with benefits come drawbacks. At the same time, it will also cause or exacerbate various adverse consequences. In short: (1) prices will still rise, (2) life will still be difficult, (3) labor unrest will not be quelled, (4) it will be difficult to obtain replenishment in this time of depleted resources, (5) especially the import of machinery, raw materials, and all necessities will increase difficulties, and (6) it may provoke resentment and retaliation from importing countries. If it is set too low, that is, the currency value is increased, then the advantages and disadvantages are exactly the opposite. It is very difficult to find a method that comprehensively considers both.

Some people advocate that it should not be raised or lowered, but stabilized at the current black market exchange rate limit. On the surface, it seems that it can reduce fluctuations and gradually stabilize prices and life, but in reality, it is not entirely true.

Because domestic and foreign prices are still disconnected and have not reached the point of adjustment. According to pre-war market prices, domestic prices have risen at least a thousand times, while the decline in currency value is only three or four hundred times. If the foreign exchange rate is stabilized according to the current black market, then ordering foreign goods with foreign exchange will cost less than one-third or even one-tenth or two-tenths of domestic prices. Everyone will scramble to order foreign goods, which will inevitably flow in continuously. As a result, prices will have to fall sharply, national industries will be in danger, and various agricultural products and raw materials will also be forced into a situation where they cannot compete. This phenomenon is already very prominently displayed before our eyes!

In order to reconcile the above-mentioned conflicts of interest, there is also a rumor of graded regulations, roughly divided into four levels, namely: (1) the import of machinery and other items needed for national defense industrial construction; (2) the expenses of embassies and consulates stationed abroad; (3) major commodities; and (4) luxury goods. This is certainly a painstaking approach, very reasonable, and very practical. The most noteworthy of these is the level of major commodities, i.e., necessities. Why should necessities be set lower? This is naturally because they are needed domestically and are welcomed for import. However, it is still necessary to pay attention to: (1) whether they are truly necessary; (2) whether there are substitutes domestically; and (3) whether there are similar products and industries in this country. Because the intention of grading clearly contains some protective meaning, if the import is over-encouraged due to the reason of necessity, the effectiveness of grading will be lost.

Secondly, there is the level of luxury goods. Setting the exchange rate higher, that is, increasing its cost, is a common aspiration, without a doubt. However, to what extent should it be raised in order to achieve our expected goals? This is worth studying. Usually, this kind of means is adopted for no more than two reasons: one is due to protective policies, and the other is due to financial considerations. Now, the domestic luxury goods industry has not yet developed to the point where it needs protection, so the reason for raising the currency value is undoubtedly due to financial considerations, that is, to reduce the waste of foreign exchange funds. However, the people of our country have a fashion of worshiping foreign goods. The more expensive the goods are, the more they are valued. Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of saving foreign exchange, it is also necessary to carefully consider the degree of the increase in the implementation.

We believe that in addition to the grading system, we may as well go further and adopt a quota system to complement the grading system. That is, unnecessary imports can be classified and numerically limited. When this quota is exceeded, the supply of its bills of exchange will be stopped. The higher the unnecessary nature, the stricter the quota will be. If this is done, the above-mentioned expected goals can be achieved.

Our country is a country with a trade deficit. In the past, foreign trade was completely liberal, so that the increase in the trade deficit was endless. Based on the current differences between domestic and foreign prices, the eagerness of the import industry to try, and the stagnant state of export trade, if only the exchange rate is regulated and no quota is set, I am afraid that this trend of trade deficit will still be unstoppable, and the reverse trend of international borrowing will also be impossible to improve.

We know that a trade deficit is not absolutely worrying. The trade deficit of raw materials, machinery, transportation equipment, cultural equipment, etc., which can directly or indirectly improve domestic production and culture, is more beneficial than not. Therefore, we advocate quotas and grading at the same time. Grading should complement the quota system so as not to hinder the import of the above-mentioned goods, and at the same time, it can still achieve the effect of saving foreign exchange.

There are many types of so-called quota methods: (1) it is based on the country, that is, the import quota is differentiated according to the commercial treaty or trade relationship between each other; (2) it is based on the amount, that is, the import quota is raised or lowered according to the type of goods; (3) it is to apply the two methods of (1) and (2) in a mixed manner, and then distinguish by category in addition to the country. We advocate that the second method should be adopted purely, only restricting the total annual import volume by category, regardless of which country it comes from. Because this issue, although it also has its research value, is not within the scope of exchange rates, and it is easy to cause various adverse consequences, so it will not be discussed in detail.

### Korean People's Fury Opposes the Trusteeship System, Strikes and Market Closures Occur, the Situation is Extremely Dangerous

[Associated Press, Seoul, 30th] After the news of the Moscow Conference's decision to supervise Korea for five years reached here, Koreans seeking independence all cried out in protest yesterday. Strikes and market closures are now occurring, and brawls occur from time to time in the streets. Some people are throwing stones at US soldiers. The resentment of the trusteeship is one reason for this riot. However, it is also largely related to the left and right factions taking the opportunity to cause trouble and restart internal conflicts. The US military authorities announced martial law last night, prohibiting passage after 8 pm every night to prevent further accidents. However, the situation is dangerous, and more serious disturbances are feared to be unavoidable. Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in southern Korea, told local reporters that the supervisory system decided by the Moscow Conference for Korea will not be implemented immediately. The word "supervision" is extremely unwelcome here, and Hodge's statement was unfortunately issued too late, as the news of five years of supervision had already spread far and wide. The strike and market closure began at noon yesterday, with hundreds of government officials quietly leaving, and the police also going on strike. All banks were closed, and everyone was indignant at the five-year foreign supervision. Soon, large slogans were posted everywhere, denouncing the supervision plan as a communist conspiracy. A mass meeting hosted by right-wing groups has passed a resolution opposing foreign supervision, demanding immediate recognition of the Korean Provisional Government, and ordering all government officials to go on strike. Newspapers that oppose this resolution are ordered to cease publication, and all political parties are dissolved. Hodge still earnestly warned the newspapers, saying that true patriots do not need to fear the Moscow resolution.

This talk is hosted by the British government, and the United States has already appointed a representative to attend. There is no doubt that China, the Soviet Union, and France will accept the invitation.

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] The State Department announced today that the United States will send a military representative to London in the middle of next month to consult with representatives from China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to organize a United Nations security force to maintain world peace.

Most people in diplomatic circles believe that it is inevitable that a meeting of the chiefs of staff of the five countries will be convened in mid-January. The Security Council is considered to be the most important agency of the United Nations, and it will certainly make every effort to make it operate as soon as possible.

### MacArthur Issues Special Statement on New Measures to Control Japan, "I Do Not Bear Any Responsibility for This Decision, I Can Only Carry Out My Mission Within the Scope of My Authority"

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 30th] MacArthur issued a special statement tonight, saying that he had expressed his disagreement with the new measures to control Japan two months ago, and since then "no one has sought my opinion." The Associated Press Washington telegram to the Far East Advisory Council's news officer, saying that MacArthur knew in advance about the plan decided by the Moscow Conference and did not object to it, was denied by MacArthur, who said that the claim that the Moscow Conference consulted with him was misleading and needed to be corrected. In short, I bear no responsibility for this decision, but regardless of the pros and cons of this plan, I will do my best to try it out within the scope of my authority to make it work. The problem caused by this matter is of great importance to the future of the world, and it should not be taken lightly. All relevant parties must act in good faith so as not to encounter insurmountable obstacles. MacArthur also said that he had notified the Army-Navy Joint Staff established by the State Department by radio on October 31, stating that the proposed plan was "absolutely unacceptable." MacArthur's statement tonight did not specifically point out which items in the new plan he was dissatisfied with, but it was heard that it was the item that the other participating countries of the Control Committee were given veto power, which he believed would only cause constraints.

### Hitler's Will and Marriage Contract Found, Voluntarily Died with His Wife to Avoid Humiliation

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 30th] With the assistance of British military police, US counterintelligence personnel found a trunk in a German country cottage thirty miles south of Munich. When opened, Hitler's will, Hitler's political testament to the German people, and Hitler's marriage certificate with Eva Braun were found in it. The dates of the documents were all April 29, three days before the Red Army captured Berlin. When announcing this discovery, General Truscott, commander of the US Third Army, stated that some of the documents found still need to be investigated and are not convenient to publish at present. From these documents, one can imagine the state of the last days of the Nazis, which is of inestimable value. I guarantee the authenticity of these documents with my honor. British and American military authorities have been searching for Hitler's will for a long time. The trunk storing the will was found under the bed in the home of Bormann's adjutant, Bostin's girlfriend.

In his personal will, Hitler showed that he never gave up hope that Germany could win the final victory. Even after Soviet shells fell on Berlin, Hitler was still obsessed. However, Hitler and his mistress, Eva, had decided to die to avoid the shame of being forced to resign or surrender. In his political will, Hitler drafted a new cabinet, preparing to continue the war after his death. Although Hitler and Eva had many years of friendship, they only married in Berlin under fire on April 29, 1945, with Wagner as the officiant. Wagner wrote on the marriage certificate: "The parties declared that they were of Aryan blood. Due to the tense war situation and the special circumstances, both parties applied for marriage in accordance with wartime law."

### In the Advancing Sound of the National Army Reclaiming the Territory - A Retrospective on the Fate of the Northeast (Part Two)

[Draft from this newspaper's data room] For decades, the enemy Japan has been not only an aggressor of Chinese territory but also a disruptor of world peace. Furthermore, each act of aggression and disruption has violated international treaties and good faith, launching sudden attacks that have taken various countries by surprise, and invariably shifting the responsibility for the attacks onto the victims.

Undeclared War, Violation of Treaties and Bad Faith

As early as July 1894, Japan "invented" the act of "undeclared war" by sinking a transport ship carrying 1,200 of our soldiers, and then ambushing our small fleet in Yashawan. At that time, we were caught off guard due to the suddenness of the event, resulting in heavy losses, which led to defeat, the loss of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which have only now been recovered, and were even forced to recognize Korea's independence, placing it under Japanese rule, and forced to compensate for "losses". Ten years later (in 1904), the Japanese fleet suddenly sailed into Port Lushun and began military action against Tsarist Russia without declaring war, bombarding the Lushun forts.

Tsarist Russia Took the Lead in Forced Leases and Borrowing

This was the beginning of the suffering of the Northeast. Of course, we must also trace back to another period of suffering. On March 27, 1898, when China and Russia signed the Liaodong Peninsula Lease Treaty, Tsarist Russia had already forcibly leased and borrowed Lushun and Dalian from our country. The Russian Emperor seemed to be patting the Chinese people on the shoulder, saying, "This is His Majesty the Chinese Emperor's 'wise decision'!" At the same time, he said in a child-like manner, "This act does not harm China's sovereignty and territorial integrity!" We can say that the people of the Northeast had already been suffering from that time, and with this invasion by the Japanese Navy, they suffered another layer of oppression.

It was not until the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance on August 25th of this year, which stipulated that "all administrative power in Dalian belongs to China" and "civil administration in Lushun is under Chinese jurisdiction," that our government and people breathed a sigh of relief after a long period of pent-up anger.

In the autumn of 1931, Japan's undeclared war broke out again. Using the "September 18th Incident" as an excuse, the arrogant Kwantung Army invaded Shenyang, the central area of the Northeast, and then invaded the interior of the Northeast, finally swallowing the entire Northeast into the greedy and insatiable mouth of the robber.

The United States Aided China with Righteous Struggle

At this time, the United States rose up righteously, maintaining a firm attitude of non-recognition of the puppet Manchukuo. During this time, the US's export trade to the Northeast fell sharply.

The Northeast spent another six years in such a miserable state, and Japan then revealed its beastly ambition to swallow our entire country, which led to the situation after the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, lasting for eight years. During this period, the United States consistently supported our country, firmly advocating that "the Japanese army must withdraw from China." However, Japan still refused to repent, and instead suddenly bombed the US fleet at Pearl Harbor, thus opening the curtain of the Pacific War, which laid the foundation for Japan's surrender.

The United States Emphasized Integrity of the Northeast

Regarding the Northeast, there has never been a special treaty between China and the United States. In general, in the early stages, the United States repeatedly declared equal commercial opportunities, while also declaring the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty in the Northeast. Later, the two countries signed a road construction loan contract, with the railway and its income as collateral for the loan. In the later stages (after 1905), the United States only advocated the principle of the open door in the Northeast. Apart from maintaining its agreed interests, its relationship with our country always maintained a friendly attitude.

Britain Prioritized Commerce in the Northeast

Britain's policy in the Northeast was generally in line with that of the United States. Although it had considered its commercial interests and sent a delegation to the puppet Manchukuo for industrial surveys, it did not have any ambition to covet the Northeast. Only the ambitious Japan tried its best to suppress Britain, causing it to return disappointed, in order to realize its dream of monopolizing the Northeast and even all of China.

The dream of the ambitious was finally shattered under the axe of justice. Japan had no choice but to surrender to our country and the Allied countries with its shattered dream. It vomited out the Northeast, which it had half swallowed, from its powerless mouth. This was tantamount to a heavy blow to any country in the world whose ambition had not yet been extinguished!

The wounded Northeast will undoubtedly receive the necessary comfort and treatment, so that it can return to the embrace of its motherland, healthy and grown up.

### Various Universities in the Rear - Scheduled to Move Schools Next Summer - Indicated by a Director of a Certain Department of the Ministry of Education

[Xinhua News Agency Chongqing Airmail] The work of educational rehabilitation nationwide is currently underway actively. According to a director of a certain department of the Ministry of Education, the cost of rehabilitation and enrichment of equipment for education at all levels across the country is approximately 80 billion yuan, excluding the cost of educational rehabilitation in various provinces. In order to assist in rapid rehabilitation, the central government has also allocated 1.1 billion yuan to be used for emergency needs this year. As for the procedure for the relocation of various schools in the rear, the Ministry of Education had previously formulated a plan. However, due to transportation issues, it will be difficult to implement according to the planned schedule in the future. Currently, most universities in the rear are preparing to move back in May and June next year.

It is learned that there are currently more than 30 national schools in Dalian, each of which can accommodate about a thousand students.

### Female Teachers College Strike - Petitioning for the Issue of School Relocation

[Xinhua News Agency Chongqing Airmail] The National Women's Normal College has not resolved the issue of school relocation. A few days ago, students from various departments gathered on the campus to discuss the matter. The situation was tense for a while, and the debate was endless. As a result, they decided to go on strike from today and automatically organized a disciplinary team to maintain the school's reputation and internal order. Meanwhile, they sent a representative, Shen Guiying, to Chongqing to petition the authorities. Xie Youchu, the president of the college, was very concerned when he heard the news, and immediately sent a quick letter to the responsible personnel of the school to handle it properly and reported it to the Ministry of Education for instructions. When the alumni of the college heard this unfortunate news, they also sent letters and telegrams urging them to resume classes as soon as possible to avoid wasting their studies. As for the issue of school relocation, they should wait quietly for the authorities to resolve it.

### Brief Reports

### Perpetrators of the Incident Will Be Severely Punished - Movie Theaters Reopened Last Night - Mayor Tie Expresses Regret in His Speech

[This Newspaper News] Yesterday, various newspapers published a notice from all movie theaters in this city, stating that they could not bear the disturbances caused by unruly soldiers. On the 23rd of this month, employees of the Grand Shanghai, Nanjing, Lido, and Three Theaters were beaten and injured. On the 28th of this month, in addition to beating and injuring Manager Shi Yanpan of the Huguang Theater, the theater's property and equipment were also destroyed. In protest against such violent actions and to express deep sympathy for the injured colleagues, it was decided that all movie theaters in the city would close for one day yesterday in order to attract the attention of the Party, Government, Military, and Police authorities, as well as people from all walks of life, and to effectively prevent such incidents. Therefore, yesterday, on Sunday, no movie theaters in the city were open for movies in the afternoon or evening. However, in the evening, all movie theaters resumed their evening screenings in compliance with the order of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. It is reported that the relevant authorities have begun to discuss measures for soldiers to watch movies in the future, so that such unfortunate incidents will not happen again, so as to protect the interests of legitimate businessmen.

It is Inappropriate Not to Report First

Mayor Qian issued a speech regarding the decision of all movie theaters in the city to close for one day, as follows: I read the news that all movie theaters in the city closed for one day, stating that they could not bear being beaten. I express my regret. It was found that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters had arrested nine people for the Huguang Theater incident on the 28th, and I have ordered a strict investigation and punishment. The Movie Association Preparatory Committee did not report to the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, but abruptly decided to close for one day. Although it is not a political strike, it is also inappropriate in law. Now, on the one hand, the Garrison Headquarters is ordered to severely punish the perpetrators and rectify discipline; on the other hand, the Social Affairs Bureau is ordered to summon the responsible persons of the association to make legal corrections. In the future, no matter what kind of organization, they should make reasonable appeals in accordance with legal procedures, otherwise, they should be severely punished together as a warning to those who obstruct social order.

Persuasion to Resume Business Yields Satisfactory Results

The Movie Industry Association convened a meeting of the responsible persons of various movie theaters at the Majestic Theater yesterday to discuss and decide to voluntarily suspend performances and request the authorities to handle the matter. In order to maintain law and order and rectify military discipline, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent personnel to investigate the truth and handle the matter thoroughly. It was learned that the Garrison Headquarters sent Chief Cheng Yiming of the Inspection Department to handle the matter yesterday morning. Chief Cheng personally went to the residence of Liang Qitian, chairman of the Movie Association, on Lafayette Road. The association's legal advisor Zhu Qichao and industry colleague Kuang Baorong were present. Chief Cheng expressed that in order to maintain order in the city and allow the five million citizens to enjoy entertainment on holidays, the military and political authorities requested Chairman Liang to persuade colleagues to voluntarily resume business. As for the stray soldiers who caused the incident, the Garrison Headquarters will severely punish them to protect the legitimate interests of each theater. In the past, the Garrison Headquarters has repeatedly issued orders to the heads of various military agencies and units to strictly prohibit soldiers from disturbing theaters and has properly formulated various effective measures to prevent such incidents. The results of the discussion were very satisfactory. Mr. Liang agreed to inform his colleagues that they would do their best to continue showing movies as usual so that the citizens of Shanghai could still enjoy legitimate recreation on Sundays.

Disturbances Continue to Occur

[This Newspaper News] At the China Theater on Niuzhuang Road at 8:30 last night, the upper-level reserved seats in the gallery were occupied by several soldiers. Later, as ordinary moviegoers arrived one after another, the theater staff cautiously requested the soldiers to give up their seats, but to no avail. Suddenly, they arbitrarily beat the staff, causing a disturbance. The theater authorities immediately telegraphed the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau to send police officers and patrol teams to rush to suppress the incident, but it was ineffective. Then, the sub-bureau chief reported the information to the Inspection Department of the General Bureau, which dispatched a police car and the entire gendarmerie, setting up posts on all sides. Some of the military police and gendarmes took all the soldiers without movie tickets in the theater to the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau, totaling approximately two hundred people. The patrol team requested instructions from Deputy Commander Li and escorted them all to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation.

### Dance Hall Employee Badly Beaten

[This Newspaper News] At the Jinshan Dance Hall at 678 Hankou Road, Chen, a former puppet official, led fifteen or sixteen people in naval uniforms and surrounded Zhang Zhifu, the dance hall's manager, and beat him severely.

When the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau sent a police car to the scene, they arrested Chen and took him to the bureau for interrogation.

The inspection results were considered satisfactory, but Mr. Xuan believed that the angle of inclination during the installation of the iron poles still needed to be improved because the flags, due to the influence of wind force, were often rolled up in one place, which was unsightly.

### The Huaimaru Ship Attacked Near Hupu

The China Merchants Bureau's Jianmaru ship, carrying two iron barges loaded with 8,700 large bags of military rice, arrived at the port on the 25th. It was reported that the ship sailed from Wuha on the 17th. When it sailed near Hupu on the morning of the 24th, it was suddenly attacked by more than a hundred bandits. After the ship's escorts fought back bravely, they managed to repel the bandits after a fierce battle of half an hour. The ship and the rice were safe, but one of the escorts was shot in the head and seriously injured. It is reported that the safety issues of the Yangtze River downstream near-sea voyage have attracted the attention of the relevant parties.

British Shipping Company Plans to Resume Operations

The British Far East Shipping Management Office, which is a joint venture of eight British shipping companies in this city, including Jardine Matheson, Changxing, Baohe, Mahler, Blue Funnel, Yitai, Yihuo, and Taikoo, is managed by the British Embassy. It will expire in March next year and will be returned for self-management. Therefore, Jardine Matheson Shipping Company has been actively preparing for the resumption of operations and is still renovating its original site at 27 the Bund. It is expected to start operations after the New Year's holiday. Changxing Shipping Company also has a communications office at its original site on the left side of Jardine Matheson Building. The remaining companies, except for Jardine Matheson and Taikoo, whose offices have already been restored, are also actively planning to resume operations.

### Security Council Received Firearms

In order to strengthen its equipment and defend local security, the Municipal Security Council received a considerable number of light and heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, rifles, and ammunition from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. These weapons were all surrendered by the enemy after their surrender and are about three-eighths or four-fourths complete and new. They will be distributed to various district groups.

### City Electricity Prices to be Adjusted Again; Additional Charge of Twelve Yuan Per Unit

The Shanghai Electric Power Company and others, citing the expiration of the trial period for electricity price adjustments and attributing it to high coal prices and insufficient revenue, have petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to approve another adjustment to electricity prices. The bureau, considering the situation, reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Government and submitted it to the first Municipal Advisory Committee for discussion. The previous electricity price adjustment was based on an estimated coal price of 10,000 yuan per ton. Currently, the price per catty of coal is approaching 20,000 yuan, according to the instructions of the Fuel Committee. Even considering the value of the Power Company's coal reserves, the average price per ton has reached 16,500 yuan. It is proposed to levy a uniform coal price fee on each level of electricity price to provide subsidies. The calculation method is that for every 1,000 yuan increase in the price of coal per ton, the electricity price per unit at each level can be increased by two yuan. Since the price of coal has increased from the estimated 10,000 yuan to 16,500 yuan, which is an increase of 6,000 yuan per ton, an additional coal price fee of twelve yuan per unit can be levied uniformly on all levels of electricity consumption in the city, according to the above standard. However, if the price of coal decreases in the future, this surcharge will be reduced proportionally. Furthermore, after the implementation of this new method, all small electricity consumers, if they do not have enough electricity, can state their reasons and directly write to the relevant company in charge to request to be changed to large consumers. The company should not refuse on any pretext, so as to be fair. It is reported that this method has been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and will be implemented from January 10, 1946 (i.e., for the electricity consumed from December 10, 1945), and the bureau has notified the electricity companies to comply.

### Second Area Command Headquarters to Cease Operations on New Year's Day

Zhang Jie, the commander of the Second Area Command of the Air Force, who arrived in Shanghai on the first plane after the victory, is scheduled to return to Chongqing next month, and his Second Area Command Headquarters will cease operations on New Year's Day next year.

### Winter Business Tax to be Collected Soon

The city's business tax, since the establishment of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, has been announced to be collected quarterly. Now that winter is coming to an end, all winter business taxes after October 21, 1945, should be reported and paid according to the law. The bureau is now actively preparing, and it is reported that it will begin to promote this after the New Year.

### Resource Commission's Shanghai Office to Take Over Industrial Plans

The Shanghai Office of the Resources Committee is currently undertaking a large-scale takeover plan for various major industries. When this plan is implemented, it will take over the industrial department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs that received enemy and puppet properties. The director of the office is Mr. Xia Xianjiang. It is reported that the following departments will be organized in this plan: (1) Shanghai Materials Supply Office, (2) Electrical Equipment Factory, (3) Shanghai Machinery Factory, (4) Shanghai Shipyard, (5) Shanghai Oil Refinery, (6) Jiangnan Electric Bureau, (7) Shanghai Chemical Plant, (8) Shanghai Branch of Taiwan Sugar Refinery, (9) Foreign Trade Affairs Office, (10) Central China Mining Company, (11) China Radio Materials Company, etc.

### Over a Hundred Model Airplanes Competed in a Performance Yesterday

The first model airplane competition organized by the China Aviation Model Research Association was held yesterday at the square of Hongkou Park. More than a hundred model airplanes of various types performed various demonstrations. Among them, three motor-powered airplanes took off and circled in the sky for about 20 minutes after the engine started, winning continuous praise from the audience. The participants in this competition included many Allied and National Army soldiers.

### Robbery on Tongfu Road; Bandits Captured on the Spot

[Report from this newspaper] At around 11:00 AM yesterday, four bandits, all wearing military uniforms and three of them armed with firearms, broke into the home of Lu Munan, who runs a paper business at No. 8 Xinhua Lane, Tongfu Road. They robbed 3 million legal tender and two gold bars. Neighbors reported this to the Xincheng Branch Bureau, which surrounded and captured the bandits, seized live ammunition and firearms, and handed them over to the patrol team to be escorted to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.

Ms. Li Xu, a young woman residing at No. 421 Yuyao Road, attended a wedding banquet at the Dahongyun Restaurant in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, on the 29th. At around 10:00 PM, she returned home and was suddenly followed into her house by three robbers, who brandished pistols. They robbed her of a gold bracelet, two gold rings, and a woman's coat before fleeing.

### Ideal Level Reached; Year-End Cleaning Concluded; Nanshi and Zhabei Less Clean

The Municipal Health Bureau, based on the reports of the 57 working groups dispatched by the Cleaning Service Group, stated that the cleanliness of the streets in the urban area has reached an ideal level after this year-end cleaning. However, the cleanliness of Nanshi and Zhabei districts is far behind the former concession areas due to the damage caused by the enemy and puppets during their occupation, as well as the lack of manpower and resources, making it difficult to remove the accumulated dirt in places such as the Nanshi Temple.

The cleanliness of the alleys in the urban area is still lacking. The reasons are as follows: (1) Most alleys lack garbage bins, and those that exist are damaged and unusable. (2) Although there are garbage bins in the alleys, residents do not follow the rules and arbitrarily dump garbage, leaving it outside the bins. (3) There is often no one responsible for sweeping in the alleys. (4) Stalls are set up at the entrances of alleys, obstructing traffic, preventing garbage carts from entering to work.

The observation team also expressed agreement with the above points. The publicity for this cleaning campaign was satisfactory. In addition to the Health Bureau printing and sending 50,000 copies of the "Notice to Citizens" and "Citizen's Guide" on cleaning, as well as cleaning slogans, to the police局轉各分局轉各分局 for distribution to all citizens, newspapers and radio stations also engaged in publicity. Furthermore, cleaning slogans are still being shown in all cinemas in the city to promote public awareness of relevant matters.

### Relief for Unemployed Workers; Planning Work-for-Relief Programs

According to Mr. Lu Jingshi, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the unemployment problem is still serious, and passive relief is not a thorough solution. Therefore, the relief association is actively planning "work-for-relief" programs to fundamentally solve the problem. The reasons why factories have not been able to resume work are nothing more than a lack of fuel and raw materials, as well as restrictions on capital exchange rates, and the fact that transportation has not been restored is the crux of the problem. It is hoped that the relevant competent authorities will quickly seek solutions.

### Wu Xingbo Passes Away in Shanghai

Mr. Wu Xingbo, Director of the Central Party Headquarters, came to Shanghai on official business last month. He recently fell ill due to overwork and passed away in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. He was embalmed at the Shangtian Funeral Home.

Commercial News

### Gold and Banknotes Rose Together Last Week; Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Closed at High Prices

Last week, Shanghai's financial situation was that the lunar New Year was approaching, and it was the period for banks and money shops to close their accounts and pay interest. Money was nominally stable but secretly tight. The daily interest rate for one thousand yuan was nominally hung at three corners, i.e., nine yuan per month. The secret interest rate, because of the new high prices of Chinese and foreign stocks, increased the demand for funds, rose from eight cents to eleven cents five mils, i.e., one hundred and five yuan per month per thousand yuan, which was two and a half cents higher than the previous week. Hot red bricks rose due to the upward trend of the US dollar. Gold shops and Sichuan banks purchased them. Although the purchase price by the Chongqing Central Bank retreated from 85,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan, the Shanghai market broke through the 800,000 yuan mark, with a peak of 831,000 yuan on Friday. Subsequently, due to the cutting of long positions by the paper and yarn merchants, it retreated to 813,000 yuan, an increase of 61,000 yuan compared to the previous week. The US dollar rose because the import of foreign goods increased daily. Importers still lacked the use of foreign exchange and could only absorb as many US dollars as possible. At the same time, the definite orders for Western medicines and chemical raw materials from the Western pharmaceutical industry and chemical raw material merchants were about to arrive, so they also pre-settled in US dollars, causing the market price to remain high at 1,430 yuan, an increase of 175 yuan compared to the previous week, despite the appearance of a large number of new twenty-dollar US dollars and Hawaiian US notes on the market. The Hong Kong dollar rose because the Hong Kong government restored all exchange transactions, and the exchange rate against the British pound was easier than the exchange rate against the US dollar. Guangbang banks successively purchased them, and old goods returned to a high of 260 yuan, only 20 yuan lower than the peak of 280 yuan in November. New goods also rose to 73 yuan, an increase of 17 yuan compared to the previous week, which was about 30% weaker than old goods.

Unified public bonds, due to the good negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the good situation in the Northeast, the gold and yarn merchants absorbed type C bonds, hovering around the 800 yuan mark, and finally closed at 770 yuan, an increase of 70 yuan compared to the previous week. Securities firms, due to the equal understanding of the unified prices of types A, B, C, D, and E bonds, and the cheapness of the current market discount, sold type C bonds one after another and bought types A, B, D, and E. Chinese stocks, due to the active floating capital, were frequently purchased by banks and money shops and gold merchants. In addition, with the call for the resumption of securities trading, large and small popular stocks all closed at new high prices. The leading Yongan Yarn Factory reached 820 yuan, an increase of 110 yuan compared to the previous week, which was more than double the peak of 78,000 fake currency per share when the Japanese surrendered on August 10. Foreign stocks, due to the fierce purchase by gold merchants, Guangbang and the banking industry, believed that foreign stocks had a close value to foreign exchange and that foreign merchants would never let go. Jardine Matheson, Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corporation, and Taikoo Dockyard all closed at new high prices, even higher than the peak in early November, which was in line with this newspaper's prediction last week.

### Huge Amount of Banknotes Arrived from New York

[Special report from this newspaper] 3,680 boxes of banknotes, shipped from New York on the American ship "Satireden" (transliteration), arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The banknotes are the first import after the victory. The Fulaie Shipping Company has notified the Bank of China to pick them up.

### Many Reorganizations in the Woolen Industry

[Special report from this newspaper] Yesterday was Sunday, and the woolen market was slack. Moreover, it was the end of the lunar year, so it was even more lonely. Therefore, in addition to checking inventory and being busy with the final closing, there were very few sales. Many shops in the same industry have been reorganized this year due to the capital relationship between true and false currencies, and the increasingly difficult business in the future. According to surveys, those who have closed down account for 50-60%, those who have expanded and increased capital account for 20-30%, and those who have merged with each other account for 10-20%. In the past, there were more than 400 member stores in the woolen industry organization in the puppet organization, but now there are less than 300 who have formally joined the industry association after reorganization.

### Summary of Market Conditions

The sales of knitting yarn have slightly improved, and there are also sporadic shipments to other ports. Prices have stabilized, and a deal for 14,000 yuan for a popular color of Bee Brand coarse yarn has been made.

Not much of the new Lanhua rice was produced this year. As transportation has not yet recovered, several shipments have been transported by motorized sailing ships until recently. Samples were seen yesterday.

Due to the small number of new goods of dried lily flowers, they are sold as soon as they arrive, and the number plates are firm. It is not easy to loosen them for a while. Forty or so baskets of Longxi narcissus flower heads have also been transported in.

Since the price drop once, the sales of cosmetics have not improved. White oil and Vaseline have even fallen by more than half. Due to the time involved, skin creams have generally risen without falling.

### How to Convert Book Capital; Central and Local Governments Will Decide

[Special report from this newspaper] The question of how to convert industrial and commercial capital is highly related to tax revenue. It is heard that in terms of business tax in this city, after several discussions, some people have proposed to convert it on a one-to-one basis, that is, one yuan of puppet currency should be changed to one yuan of legal currency, but because it is a major matter, no decision has been made yet. It is also heard that the central government will make a decision on this, largely based on the three suggestions provided by the local association of certified public accountants.

### Not Many Foreign Orders for Hardware

[Special report from this newspaper] Foreign orders for hardware were quite active at first. The industry in this city competed to order, so those who sent telegrams to inquire about prices did so dozens of times a day. However, overseas replies were either because the market was higher, or because the shipment was too late, or because the exchange procedures were troublesome. Therefore, the number of completed transactions was very small. It is heard that Baohua, Hanili, New Shichang, Weili, and Hanyi Lung and other foreign firms have placed orders for a total of only four to five hundred tons, of which about 40% were purchased by the same industry, and about 60% were purchased by factories. The prices of each product are extracted below: (Unit: ton)

### Spiritual Construction and the Art Movement

— Liu Haisu

(This article is the manuscript for a lecture given at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Central Broadcasting Affairs Management Office on the 28th of this month)

Now that the violence of the world has been eliminated, the future efforts should focus on preventing the resurgence of violence to maintain lasting peace for mankind. On the other hand, the highly materialistic 20th century must also focus on the construction of spiritual civilization, especially the importance of spiritual construction in our country, which exceeds that of material construction. This will completely eliminate all selfishness, suspicion, jealousy, cowardice... and many other inferior traits. To achieve this goal, we can only elevate art, the highest spiritual activity of mankind, to cultivate a life of truth, goodness, and beauty. Because for mankind, all tangible behaviors and intangible consciousness originate from truth, which is also goodness, and also beauty. Conversely, beautiful stimuli can create good reactions, leading to the expression of truth. In this way, all mankind will only have truth, no falsehood; only goodness, no evil; only beauty, no ugliness; only love, no hatred. Everyone will not only share material abundance but also share spiritual joy, joining hands to enter the realm of world harmony. Therefore, to promote the noble ideals of a life of truth, goodness, and beauty, to cultivate a spirit of mutual affection, joy, and brightness, and to establish lasting peace for mankind, this is the necessary foundation for spiritual construction.

Since the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people have been constrained by reality and oppressed by material things, resulting in the loss of the inherent freedom of human nature, the decline of the spirit, and the chaos of society, all of which exhibit backwardness and morbidity. In this great era, we must certainly strive for the construction of economy, military affairs, science, politics, and education. However, we must not neglect art and culture, because it is the first step in spiritual construction.

Humans are inherently endowed with the ability to appreciate beauty and the ability to create. Because beautiful forms seek solace for the soul and achieve many ideals of changing personality and enhancing social happiness, it is more appropriate to say that the construction of social art and culture is a matter of urgency in the process of national construction, rather than saying that the importance of spiritual construction exceeds material construction.

For thousands of years, our country has made immortal achievements and contributions to spiritual culture. The achievements in art truly surpass those of Europe and America. However, due to the lack of proper preservation and development, they have almost been lost. This prevents researchers from imagining, tracing, and deepening their studies based on the relics of the past, and the public has no opportunity to come into contact with them, leading to a life of stagnation and helplessness. Instead, others are allowed to overstep their bounds and take their place, which is truly heartbreaking to say!

Now that the Anti-Japanese War is won, our country is one of the world's four major powers, and international cooperation has become very close. In this era of national construction, the facilities for art are certainly urgently needed. Here, I offer my humble suggestions for consideration. The so-called art facilities are the development of the art movement. Here, I propose four concrete suggestions. If they can be implemented effectively, not only can Chinese art and culture be revived, but spiritual construction can also be established from this.

One. The Organization and Establishment of Museums

Every major city, town, village, and city in Europe and America has museums that display ancient artistic masterpieces as well as modern masterpieces. This kind of facility not only enhances the public's aesthetic interest but also provides convenience for scholars and antique enthusiasts to study. The management of museums, such as collection, management, display, cataloging, mending, and preservation, has become a specialized science, employing precise methods. Famous examples include the Louvre Museum in France and the British Museum in England, which are truly well-organized and spectacular.

In various parts of our country, there are a few simple museums or ancient artifact preservation centers, but they are all perfunctory and disorganized. There are no reports or statistics, and there are frequent rumors of ancient artifacts being stolen, which is truly a laughing stock for both domestic and foreign observers. Therefore, for the existing museums and ancient artifact preservation centers, not only should we find ways to restore and enrich them, but we should also operate them entirely using scientific methods, which should not be neglected in the future. Secondly, the establishment of museums or ancient artifact preservation centers should be determined according to the standards of transportation and population. Therefore, I believe that cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Qingdao, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an should build large-scale modern museums as soon as possible. At the very least, the existing ancient artifact preservation centers should be expanded and improved to store artistic treasures. In addition, the artistic antiques recovered from Japan can be displayed separately. If there are immovable objects such as statues from past dynasties, tomb towers, and reliefs, experts should be asked to make replicas and distribute them to museums around the country for display. This will provide opportunities for universal viewing and research.

Two. Art Galleries and Music Concerts

Museums are fixed and permanent display places for artworks, while "art galleries" are places where artworks are regularly changed, introduced, and exhibited. Our country held the first National Art Exhibition in the eighteenth year and the second National Art Exhibition in the twenty-sixth year. The National Art Exhibition was interrupted due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Although there are many reasons for this, the lack of art galleries to use may be the most important one. When preparing for the first National Art Exhibition, I was ordered to go to Europe for inspection. At that time, the venue was the China National Products Hall on Guohuo Road in Shanghai, and its unreasonableness was to be expected. Although the venue problem for the Second National Art Exhibition held at the National Art Gallery in Nanjing was more reasonable, there were still many shortcomings. Therefore, major cities should establish reasonable "art galleries" as soon as possible, regularly exhibiting artistic works from ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign, from various schools of art, so that the public has appropriate places to view art, and modern artists have appropriate places to exhibit their works, which is of great help to the future development of art.

The dissemination of spatial arts such as painting and sculpture relies on "art galleries," while the dissemination of temporal arts such as music requires concerts. Concerts should be held regularly to introduce world-famous pieces. The prices should be reduced to popularize the opportunity for the public to appreciate music. Under the leadership of the government, each region should have organizations and activities like Shanghai's large-scale symphony orchestra.

Three. Establishment of the National Academy of Fine Arts

Examining the art facilities in various European and American countries, the scale is grand and the meaning is profound. It is actually managed by the National Academy of Fine Arts. Here, the government selects famous artists and scholars as members to plan the direction and methods of national art education and social art facilities, as well as the consultation and research of art undertakings. The main undertakings include museums, art schools, music schools, national regular exhibitions, art scholarships, etc. Although the systems vary from country to country, the purpose is the same. During this period of revival in our country, it is indeed necessary to establish a National Academy of Fine Arts in imitation. With this organization, the national art facilities can be planned and organized in a unified manner, without being shifted by the interests of one person or one family, and the efficiency of achieving twice the result with half the effort can be achieved.

Four. Artification of Urban Construction

Our country defeated the violent Japanese in this eight-year Anti-Japanese War. Due to international cooperation and the support of allies, the construction undertakings in various regions will inevitably change with each passing day, and the modernization of cities is an inevitable trend. I have traveled in Europe twice and experienced the large and small cities of various countries. After wandering and observing, I feel that each place has its own unique characteristics. The display of these characteristics is all tied to the artification of construction. The artification of construction is not difficult. As long as the designers can pay attention to the interests of the times and the geographical situation, and arrange public and private buildings to form an organic structure, avoiding all unreasonable and scattered forms, and taking pleasing the eye as the standard everywhere, then beauty will come naturally without seeking it. In the past, the urban construction of our country did not imitate old rules, and foreigners were in charge, resulting in something that was neither Chinese nor Western, neither mule nor horse. When engaging in construction now, attention should be paid to the artification of cities, so that the public feels happy in life and feels appropriate in appearance. The authorities engaged in construction will certainly agree with this point of view.

### Mist

— Sultan

In a letter to a friend, I wrote:

"Who is leading me onto this thorny rose path, where even cherishing the blood of youth is impossible? I would rather exchange life for a drop of clear tears than walk on this misty road, but what's the use? I bear the heavy burden of emotion."

Yes, I bear the heavy burden of emotion, walking on the thorny road. I want to find something, but what am I looking for? Is it a cold kiss, or a faint smile? Do I need these?

I don't know if these can warm me?

One should not be fooled by emotions, one must restrain oneself, one must cherish the glowing passion, but who can escape the lying mouth and the deceiving eyes? Knowing that what is dazzling you is a beautiful lie, but wasting passion here, why? Is it the contradiction of life or one's own clumsiness?

I don't understand, I have no way to explain, no way to clear this mist. This is an unfathomable mystery.

But I know that the energy of life should not be spent on some small things, especially when young. The blood of youth should be as precious as morning dew.

But, what can make me firm?

Life and thought are in contradictory pursuit. Having read many biographies, many successful great men and the lives and thoughts of failures, I know how they spin in the mist, how they walked through the misty road, gaining light and life, but what did I get? So empty, is it my own insignificance? Loneliness surrounds me like an endless desert, perhaps because I have too much hope and too many green dreams?

Although I am spinning in the mist, enduring some ridicule, I trust myself that I will not fall in the mist, because those who understand their own failures are not far from success.

I trust myself, I have such confidence: although bearing the heavy burden of emotion, one day I will pass through this heavy misty road.

### Ink Vegetables

— Shi Chongpeng

This vegetable never reaches the vermilion gate, difficult to equate with mountain delicacies; only I, a scholar, am poor to the bone, morning and evening, use it as a side dish.

The ancients always loved the fragrance of vegetable roots, moreover, grain has been scarce in recent years; even if it is sold by the load in the street, a thousand gold coins cannot fill my worried stomach.

### Brushstrokes of History

### Talking About "Circles"

— Xie Dongping

If I were a sheep, I would rather be a sheep outside the Great Wall, because the sheep outside the Great Wall can freely eat the grass it likes in the wilderness of the north. If I were a bird, I would rather be a bird in the sky that flies around the world all day long for its own food.

I despise the sheep that are kept in the fence, they are very tame, do not offer any resistance, just bleat to their masters, trying to get grass feed to maintain their unfree life. I especially despise the "mynas" and "parrots" raised by their masters, they just shout out the sounds their masters like, just sing the songs their masters want them to sing, but they think they are the smartest of the birds.

Everything in the world, things, often have both advantages and disadvantages, both good and evil. For example, a range, it can give you security, it can also make you lose freedom of action. The sheep in the fence, the bird in the cage, naturally do not have to worry about fierce birds and beasts, such as tigers, lions, owls, and birds of prey to hurt them, but they also cannot step out of the fence and cage.

The sheep's fence, the bird's cage, is the "circle" that they cannot surpass in their lives. If there were no fences in the world, sheep, as an animal, would definitely be a very promising animal. Without cages, birds, as an animal, would definitely be the freest animal.

In human society, if there were no "circles," whether ancient or modern, large or small, then everyone would definitely be promising, everyone would be able to give full play to their creative talents, and everyone would be able to live an independent and free life. Everyone wants to be an emperor, and this desire to be an emperor is the "circle" in people's minds in the feudal era. But people are ultimately different from animals, so the person who became an emperor wanted to become an immortal. The person who became an emperor was really not free in the circle of that imperial city, but the immortal could be in the sky or on the ground, and was very free.

When a person's life has not yet formed a "circle," then his future is unlimited. When a "circle" has been formed, then his fate is also determined. Inside the circle, you can never see outside the circle, just like the emperor's extravagance in the imperial city, he can never see the suffering of the people. A parent with a son with a scabby head can never see the advantages of children whose scalps are not scabby.

A sheep kept in a fence and a "myna" raised in a cage by its master will definitely laugh at the sheep outside the Great Wall and the birds in the sky who are looking for food everywhere on the ground and in the sky, as being foolish.

Human mischief is to create "circles," to create "circles" for sheep, to create "circles" for birds, to create "circles" for themselves. With this "circle," there are sheep, birds, people, people above people, and people below people in the world.

If you want to see real things, if you want to distinguish between true and false, you must jump outside the circle. If there is really foolishness in the world, then this foolishness belongs to the animals in the circle who do not know they are in the circle.

### Low Salaries Should Be Adjusted Urgently: Couples Who Faithfully Fulfill Their Duties Cannot Get Enough to Eat

A reader of this newspaper, with the pen name Canzhen, wrote: "Mr. Editor, I have long intended to use a corner of your newspaper to express my grievances, but I always felt unable to pick up the pen. However, because my grievances are really too deep, I must state them to society, not to seek help from society, but to seek guidance from all parties. When I was five years old, both my parents died. After growing up and studying in middle school, I worked as an elementary school teacher for many years. Later, due to difficult living conditions, I changed my job to become an administrator at a large construction factory. At first, the boss was eager to find someone, so he used sweet words to induce me to abandon my teaching position and take up the job. Later, he did not give me food expenses or salary, and I only got three simple meals a day. At first, I endured by pawning and borrowing, but now I have nothing left to pawn and no place to borrow from. As the saying goes, 'Eat everything up, pawn everything off,' I had no choice but to beg the boss. Who knew that the 'tycoon' would threaten me with the tone of a local tyrant and gentry? My wife is now seven months pregnant and works as a single-grade teacher in a small elementary school. She earns only 100,000 fake currency per month, and she is responsible for her own meals, averaging one and a half pancakes a day. We thought we were faithfully fulfilling our duties for the sake of the community and society, but the reward we received was so meager. It can be seen that it is not easy to survive and stand on our own feet. Those who have jobs are still like this, what about those who have no jobs? Now our small family is about to be reduced to beggars. Who should be responsible for this? Please, social leaders, teach me!"

### Respectful Suggestions to the Post Office

— Fengchichun

The post office is one of the important transportation institutions, and it is in contact with many people every day. Not to mention the past, I think postal workers should pay attention to politeness. Those who serve society should take the spirit of service as the premise, and supplement it with the word "obligation." Otherwise, arrogant behavior and lack of politeness will have a great impact on society. I hope that senior postal officials and senior officials of various branches will pay special attention to this and correct the middle and lower-level employees! Another point is that the glue on the back of the stamps should be thicker. Looking at the glue used recently, there is very little glue, and some have no glue at all. Therefore, the authorities have set up a paste station. I don't know if it is of poor quality or if it has already become moldy, which makes people want to vomit when they smell it. In addition, the edge of the window is covered with long-standing paste dirt. This situation is unsightly and unhygienic. The two points mentioned above seem to be small, but public institutions should not be perfunctory. We hope that during the period of national revival, we can eliminate bad habits and create a new spirit. We also hope that our leaders will pay special attention to the politeness and hygiene of their subordinates and hope that they will be implemented and corrected immediately.
