### Swift Implementation of Emergency Measures Law Expected to Adjust and Solidify Wartime System; Japanese Prime Minister Meets with Reporters to Elaborate on Determination

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki met with a group of reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence at 11:00 AM on the 14th (for about an hour). He answered their questions, expressing the government's beliefs and unwavering determination to prosecute the war under the pressing circumstances of the impending decisive battle on the homeland. Prime Minister Suzuki elaborated on his determination as follows:

"At this stage of the war, the Okinawa battle, I believe, is not the final decisive battle. The war situation will continue to evolve. Even if a decisive battle unfolds on the homeland, if the entire nation can raise their spirits to diminish the enemy's will and demonstrate courage, even though the enemy boasts abundant materiel, their will to fight will ultimately be frustrated.

"I, bearing the weight of the nation's security and survival, am determined to dedicate myself to protecting the national polity as I vowed when forming the cabinet, and with this resolve, break through the stalemate.

"The synchronization and coordination of state affairs and command have been perfected through the close operation of the current Imperial General Headquarters conferences and the Supreme War Leadership Conferences. In particular, the Supreme War Leadership Conference functions as a wartime cabinet, fully integrating state affairs and command into a unified whole.

"Raising the morale of the nation is crucial for the war effort. Even if the enemy attempts a landing operation on the homeland, the military and civilians must unite as one, destroying the enemy at sea, annihilating them on the coast, and utterly defeating any landing forces on land. Furthermore, the enemy's supply lines would be extremely difficult during a landing operation. They cannot mobilize a million troops at once, and even if they land tens of thousands, it would take months. Therefore, the enemy must make considerable preparations. During the European war, the Axis powers landed a large army on the coast of northern France, but that was only across a strait. The journey from the United States to Japan is a truly long distance, and we are fully prepared for it.

"To implement wartime emergency measures, we have requested the invocation of the Emperor's prerogative under Article 3 of the Constitution. The Wartime Emergency Measures Law, though still under deliberation, has been urgently submitted to the Diet due to the urgency of the ongoing battles following Okinawa. This is what the government and the people jointly desire. In the future, the application of this law must be swift, adjusting the decisive battle system and achieving its intended effect.

"Due to the victories at the beginning of the war, the people were filled with optimism about the Greater East Asia War. Now, as the war situation evolves, the entire nation is sincerely concerned for the country, resolved to die for it, and supporting the national polity. This is truly gratifying."

### Decisive Battle on Tarakan Island Enters Final Stage; Japanese Forces in the Philippines Achieve Great Victory

Southern Front Line Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - The battle on Tarakan Island, which began with the enemy's assault on the Kyuda Battery, has seen fierce hand-to-hand combat centered on Hill 102 in recent days. The brave soldiers of the Japanese garrison have fought courageously, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, who have fled in disarray without even collecting their dead. On the 9th and 10th, Japanese bomber squadrons launched fierce raids on the enemy positions, greatly boosting the morale of the garrison troops, thus entering the final stage of the decisive battle. The entire Japanese force immediately launched a general assault against the enemy's front lines, engaging in desperate melee combat. The Tarakan garrison, with its small force, has bravely resisted a superior enemy, causing them heavy casualties. The fierce fighting has continued for over forty days, and the valiant Japanese troops are still fighting bravely.

Southern Front Line Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese garrison on Tarakan Island is putting up a stubborn resistance. The enemy is employing small aircraft to bomb and burn the dense forests, attempting to break through the Japanese lines. In response, the Japanese air and land forces launched a coordinated general offensive at 3:00 AM on the 10th, causing enemy camps and supply depots to explode and catch fire. Japanese commando teams, who had infiltrated the enemy lines beforehand, joined in the attack, focusing their fire and striking hard. The enemy suffered heavy losses and has fallen into great confusion.

Philippine Front Line Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - On the Palete-Sanlak-Raglak front, Japanese and American forces have been engaged in fierce fighting for three months, and the situation has now reached a critical stage. The closest the two armies are is only thirty to fifty meters. And both armies are mobilizing all their weapons, and repeatedly launched a desperate defense against each other. During this time, the Japanese army repeatedly used suicide melee attacks, and severely damaged the enemy. Since mid-March, when the enemy began attacking the Japanese army, the enemy's losses have been approximately 20,000 people. The Japanese army is still ensuring the front, however the front has been messed up more and more. The enemy is currently advancing with a superior artillery and an absolutely superior air power. Amongst the enemy's first line, there are soldiers mixed with the local indigenous army, approximately 2,000 in front of Palete, and the army in front of Sanlak-Sek. The Japanese army fights with their best skill, killing enemies, and received great victories, and are currently waiting to prepare to launch the final battle. According to what a staff officer coming from the first line said: This decisive battle, could be said to be to the advantage of the Japanese forces. From various point of views, enemy operations can not be optimistic. Palete-Rakik enemy forces, is still the same division from when they attacked first. The Palete side is the 25th division, and the Sanlak-Sek side is the 23rd division, with no large forces. And After the Japanese army's continuous melee attacks, the fighting strength has decreased to 1/3 of its former strength. So, the enemy is using indigenous forces to fill in the gaps. Also, for the enemy's purpose of supplementing fighting strength's consumption, they made planes and artillery to increase the amount of bullets fired, in order to make up for that part of lack. In recent days, the enemy military, because of rain and other reasons, and plane cooperation suffered large impact. The artillery ammo delivery, is also extremely difficult. On the contrary, the Japanese military's morale is unusually high, and are currently waiting for the opportunity to kill the enemy.

### On the Issue of Increasing Food Production in Jiangsu Province

â€” Chen Yaoxi

On the Issue of Increasing Food Production in Jiangsu Province through Variety Improvement and Promotion of Superior Strains

Mr. Ando Hirotaro pointed out in his article "Problems of Rice Cultivation" that Japan's rice production has approximately doubled in the past fifty years, which is to say that the average annual yield has increased by more than one percent for a given area. The main reason for this is the improvement and promotion of varieties. The Jiangsu province's important food crops, their variety of systems is extremely complex. If you take only rice varieties, there is the Hsien, Geng, and Nuo three types of early, middle and late planting species. Other than species with different physical properties but the same name or same physical properties but a different name. There are at least over 1,200 types. These many types are scattered among locations. The farmers planting in those areas are not aware of the matters of choosing breeds or harvesting seeds, and they lack breeding knowledge. Thus, among these there are excellent species, and also very poor species.

After the Incident (Second Sino-Japanese War), due to environment and economic changes, the average rice yield per mu has varied greatly. According to statistics from February of the thirty-second year (1943), the Suzhou area's central six counties' cooperative union crop yield evaluation society recorded the following: among the 200 rice varieties contributed by Wu County, Wu Jiang, Yuanshi, Kunshan, Changzhou, and Dangshu, the highest yield was 3.89 shi per mu, and the lowest yield was 1.22 shi per mu. This translates to a ratio of 1 to 3.19, a shocking difference. The collection of the full results is such that 1/10th of rice yielded greater than 3 shi per mu, and that 2/10th of rice yielded less than 3 shi per mu. The rest yielded between 2 and 3 shi. These are the results provided by the richest six counties of the Jiangsu province for this evaluation association. One can assume the actual rice yields from the other counties will be even lower, suggesting that there is a significant need for improvement.

Before the Incident, Jiangsu Province focused most of its efforts on breeding in order to improve rice farming. The species produced by pure-line breeding methods include the #324, #318, and #348 Geng rice varieties from the Jiangsu Provincial Rice Experiment Station, as well as the #298 and #304 awnless late Geng rice. Also the Zhegeng Qingdao rice and Bazidao rice varieties from the Songjiang branch station, the Hongke Xiandao rice from the Gaoyou branch station, and the #1386, #287, and #1659 Xiandao rice from Jinling University. The 80 Zi rice, Jiangning Yangxian rice, and Maozitou rice from National Central University. All of these had very large achievements in promotion and cultivation. However, if previous variety breeding methods are used within current circumstances, then there are three points that should be noted:

Although pure-line and hybrid breeding methods are the most basic, reasonable, and scientific methods of variety improvement, these methods take a long time and are very costly. At a time when China's economy is tight and there is an urgent need to increase food production, we should use the most economical methods and the shortest amount of time to obtain the greatest results.

In the past, the materials used for breeding were selected from single ears of rice in various places for experimentation. The locations for selection were haphazard, and the species selected were only a fraction of the farmers' types. It was not easy to find truly superior species in various places. Even if one was lucky enough to find them, they could not be widely promoted and beneficial to farmers due to differences in adaptability.

Agriculture has regional, climatic, and temporal characteristics. A strain that is suitable for place A may not be suitable for place B. Furthermore, China's vast territory, different customs, and different farming systems have a great impact on the selection of crops. Therefore, those engaged in improvement work should recognize that the local original varieties have a considerable value as pure lines and deal with them accordingly.

In summary, in addition to implementing pure-line or hybrid breeding methods, a comprehensive variety comparison method should be actively implemented. All types of local species should be collected and tested to eliminate inferior species and raise the status of superior species, so that local varieties tend to be absolutely pure, and then actively promoted, so that local production can have better progress. The first step of implementation, testing, began in Hunan Province in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), and the method is as follows:

The entire province is divided into several large regions, with one county as a unit, four or five counties as a small region, and four or five small regions as a large region.

In the first year, all rice varieties in each unit are collected and a comprehensive variety comparison test is carried out in the region.

The superior varieties obtained in the first year are added to the large region for comparison testing in the second year, and are exchanged with each small region for comparative testing.

If a certain strain is proven to be superior by tests in various regions within four years, it is adopted as a pure-line variety for that area for promotion, and the provincial and county local governments and agricultural agencies may advise or force farmers to plant it.

After the war, the provincial government was struggling financially and had no foundation for breeding, but it still worked hard to promote it. For example, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), the Jiangsu provincial government followed the Ministry of Food's proposed three-year food production increase plan and promoted the following urgent and affordable items:

Adjustment of agricultural improvement zones in various counties - The organization of lower-level institutions was adjusted, and Nanjing, Jurong, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Wujin, Wuxi, Wu County, Kunshan, and Changshu were established.

Establishment of rice breeding farms - In order to actively propagate superior strains, three breeding farms have been established, namely Nanjing, Songjiang, and Kunshan, with a total of 360 mu. A special breeding farm was established in Changshu with 40 mu.

Implementation of seed harvesting - The provincial government announced the "Jiangsu Province 32nd Year Rice Seed Harvesting Counties" on October 18th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), including Wu County, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Wujin, Songjiang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jinshan, Dachang, and Changshu.

In conclusion, Jiangsu Province's food production is greatly related to breeding. If superior varieties can be widely adopted and the yield per mu can be increased to 3 shi, then Jiangsu Province's rice production can be increased by half compared to the present, in other words, an annual increase of more than 10 million shi, providing food for 5 million more people. Therefore, Jiangsu Province's use of variety improvement and promotion of superior strains to increase food production has a promising future. (End)

Editorial

### Reaffirming the Proposal to Evacuate Schools

In view of the recent serious situation and the problem of price inflation, the issue of population evacuation in this city should be actively pursued. The evacuation committee's original evacuation plan was to first evacuate various charitable organizations. The second step would be schools, especially secondary schools, vocational schools, and especially universities, which urgently need to find a way to implement evacuation quickly.

In our editorial on February 20th of this year, we already raised the issue of school evacuation. Afterwards, due to the problems of evacuation sites and evacuation transportation, which required active planning by various parties, the matter was delayed. Now, there are locations at Dongting and Xishan suitable to be evacuation sites. The location's environment is very good and is especially suitable for setting up schools. The transportation problems can be taken care of by the evacuation committee, transportation side. Therefore, regarding the school evacuation matter, there is the need to repeat the proposal.

The Evacuation of secondary and vocational schools, from a purely educational position, is without special causes such as the current situation and commodity prices etc., that there is a need for consideration. Firstly, in recent decades, Chinese culture and education has formed the imbalanced phenomenon of concentration of talent in the largest cities, and is the main reason for the culture of areas not being able to develop at a balanced rate. Therefore, in the future, there is a need for the nation's educational plan to evenly weigh and emphasize the city and rural areas, and especially pay attention to the development of education equal to and greater than vocational schools in rural areas. Secondly, high schools concentrated in large urban areas, especially a city such as Shanghai, it is harmful and not helpful to the education of the average student. Rural children are simple and honest in character. And upon stepping foot into Shanghai, a city of luxury and extravagance, as a result of what they have heard and witnessed, that they receive harmful habits even before they receive an education. And this is not good for the sake of nation and society's need to nurture talents.

On the other hand, schools in Shanghai evacuating to rural areas, that has the following profits. 1st, that the environment of the rural is clean and simple, which makes the youth studying there be less subject to temptation and distraction, making the education more easily have success. 2nd, if youth students get close to the rural areas, they may get a deeper understanding of rural society, and by that know the difficulties in farming and know the hardships of farmers. In the future, the transformation of China will depend on transformation of the rural being the fundamental issue. So if highschool and university students are familiar with the countryside, it would greatly assist the construction of China. 3rd, Advanced schools get close to rural areas, and can bring modern ideologies and scientific matters into the cultural backward rural areas, so that their cultural level and national and social ideas are gradually raised. They will break superstitions, traditional habits, and promote construction and agricultural improvement movements, in order to make great contributions.

The summer break is coming soon. We hope that the authorities in education and in each school will consider and implement the issue of evacuation. We especially hope that the university authorities can consider together and evacuate together. By establishing a federation of universities, on one hand they can work in specialized areas, and conserve talent, money, and resources. At the same time, for talents such as professors, it is possible to reduce the suffering from running around doing other jobs, and because living expenses in the hinterlands are cheaper, they can calmly focus on education. Within this summer break, they should finish all of the preparations and the actual implementation of the work. After the summer break, they will be able to appear in the countryside with a new attitude. The environment of Dongting Xishan is beautiful, and their houses may also be used. The Jiangsu provincial authorities have already expressed that they would give their fullest assistance to the evacuation.

In addition to the joint evacuation of the universities, schools larger than the secondary and vocational schools should also find ways to evacuate as soon as possible. As for the issue of the students after the evacuation, we believe that there is no need to worry about it, because first, if there are schools that have a good reputation, parents would not hesitate to send their children to evacuation sites, and would provide funds so that they can go to school; second, it is cheaper to live in the countryside, which can reduce the burden of the parents; third, the parents can follow their children and evacuate.

Finally, we hope that the adults and older brothers understand the seriousness of the current situation, and the rising prices, and support the evacuation movement of the schools for the sake of the children's education future, and for the sake of the burden that their kids are carrying.

### Economic Measures in North China to Undergo Major Transformation to Adapt to the Current Critical Situation

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Economic measures in North China will undergo significant changes to adapt to the current situation. Since the Japanese side implemented its new policy towards China, military-managed factories and various mines will either become Chinese legal entities or be jointly operated by China and Japan. As for pricing policies, a low-price policy will be adopted, and to implement this, a strong economic countermeasure policy will be implemented. In the past, Japanese-style control, which ignored Chinese economic habits and methods of material exchange, had very little effect. In addition, the fundamental policy of entrusting matters to the Chinese side was merely a superficial gesture, and the Chinese side was not actually entrusted with anything. As a result, the ideal of the Japanese side's new policy towards China had the opposite effect, namely, it failed to fully obtain the cooperation of the Chinese side. For this reason, the development of underground and above-ground resources, as well as the maintenance of security, failed to achieve the desired results. Since the end of last year, the military and civilians in North China have reflected on this, and therefore, the economic measures in North China will undergo a major transformation. It is understood that the concept of the Japanese side's new policy towards North China has always been to implement the basic concept of the new policy towards China, that is, to always respect the traditions and characteristics of the Chinese nation, and to fully utilize this point to complete the national revolution that the Chinese people eagerly desire. On the one hand, what the Japanese side wants to do is to concentrate all the powers of economic institutions on the single point of completing the war. On the other hand, the Chinese side is entrusted with the responsibility of autonomous activity. If this point is proven by concrete facts, the trend of economic development in North China can be clearly understood.

Abolishing the Economic Blockade Policy
The idea of stopping economic blockade and the past fixed price policy has been abandoned, and replaced by a policy of stabilizing prices. Therefore, the hindrance to production caused by the low price policy has been resolved. The economic blockade policy based on the fixed price policy has been decided to be cancelled except for military needs. At the same time, the unsmooth movement of materials during the blockade era will also be eased. The opening of inland river transportation in the past is a concrete manifestation of this. At the same time, land transportation will also be handled by the Chinese side sooner or later, and all controls will be eliminated. The impact of this is very significant.

Absolute Grasp of Important Industries
Regarding the grasp of important industries, the Japanese side is focusing on carrying out the war, and the tendency to strongly grasp the important industries to the necessary minimum extent is very obvious recently. That is, all iron ore, coal, railways, etc. that are directly related to the completion of the war are grasped by the Japanese side with the support of the military. The so-called grasp does not mean military management, but rather the joint development of industries by China and Japan, that is, taking the spirit of "shared life and death" as the starting point, and sharing the benefits of both parties. It is expected that this economic strategy will soon be recognized by the Chinese side and there is no intention to exclude the participation of the Chinese side.

Improvement of the Control and Purchase Methods
Except for the key industries that are necessary to complete the war to the minimum extent, everything else is entrusted to the Chinese side for operation, and the Chinese side is expected to take active action. This has been reconfirmed. For example, in the past, the purchase of food, cotton, vegetable oils, etc. was carried out using Japanese-style control methods, and only required the assistance of the Chinese side, which often ignored the unique traditions of the Chinese economy. Now, it has been decided to improve this method, with the Political Affairs Committee responsible for the purchase. This will alleviate the past malpractices. The Supreme Rice Control Association and the Rice Association have been disbanded and restarted. As for oils and miscellaneous grains, the same method will be adopted. The effect of this will be significant not only in the economic aspect but also in the political aspect.

Integrated Activities of Guidance Organizations
With the current situation becoming increasingly critical, all parties are demanding the promotion of policies and the integrated activities of the authorities. The integration of the Japanese local organizations such as the military and the embassy is being gradually promoted. In terms of organizational law, the integration of the military and the Greater East Asia Ministry's organizations in North China is a central issue for Japan. Due to the complexity of the situation, it seems difficult to implement it quickly. However, the issue is not the unification of the organization, but rather the integrated activities of the various organizations in fact, in order to promote the unification of policies. This is an inevitable measure for the Japanese side to implement its economic policy towards China.

In summary, the enormous transformation of economic measures in North China has reached the implementation stage, and North China bears a greater mission in influencing the Japanese side's war power. It is also an urgent task to establish economic measures in North China under the Sino-Japanese-Manchurian integrated development plan and implement them as soon as possible.

### Chongqing Has Not Yet Completed Its Independent Counter-Offensive Capability

A certain base in South China, 14th (Central News Agency) - Although the Chongqing government is still routinely proclaiming that "the general counter-offensive period has already arrived," when we carefully observe the newspapers and various intelligence reports from Chongqing, we can assert that the Chongqing regime has not yet reached the position of an independent general counter-offensive. Although the troops of the Fourth War Zone led by Zhang Fakui in the Nanning area, the troops in the Yunnan-Guangxi-Hunan border area led by Enber, who are attempting to counter-attack the Guilin-Liuzhou area, and the American-equipped New Sixth Army, which are gathering in the northern part of Hunan Province, are taking active actions, these troops are still avoiding direct attacks from the Japanese mainland army and are adopting a passive policy of increasing troop strength. They are only in the process of deploying troops in preparation for a general counter-offensive. Furthermore, according to recent intelligence reports, it is said that the 20 Chongqing divisions that have repeatedly been reported to be reorganized into American-style troops from March to June of this year have generally been reorganized, but they still do not have the ability to launch an independent counter-offensive. From this observation, the actions of the Chongqing army in the Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi areas should be described not as a counter-offensive, but rather as expressing goodwill towards the US military and indirectly encouraging the US military to launch amphibious landings. Although Chongqing is currently very confident in its strength, it does not have the "military confidence" to break through the continental iron wall with twenty or thirty American-equipped divisions. Therefore, its counter-offensive against Japan is impossible without US military cover. This is the biggest weakness of Chongqing's general counter-offensive. What the US military expects from the Chongqing government is the massive human resources of Chongqing. Because the US military suffered extremely large human losses in the Pacific War, when it launches a continental decisive battle, it will have Chongqing replace the United States in making sacrifices. It is also reported that since Weidman succeeded Stilwell in cooperating with Chongqing, relations with Chongqing have become increasingly close recently. How the US-Chongqing relations negotiated by Weidman will unfold in the future is worthy of our attention.

### Chongqing Intellectual Circles Attach Importance to Chongqing-Yan'an Relations

Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to recent intelligence reports, at the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an in late April, the CCP expressed its determination to Chongqing not to rule out armed conflict. As a result, the conflict between the two sides is on the verge of a major crisis. Intellectual circles in Chongqing attach great importance to the future of Chongqing-Yan'an relations. Chongqing newspapers have pointed out the following points: The Chongqing-Yan'an relationship has indeed entered a direct conflict, but both sides have not abandoned their prejudices and have the intention to seek compromise. Both recognize that one side resisting Japan and the other side engaging in civil war is absolutely unfavorable. The separation between Chongqing and Yan'an is difficult to prevent from triggering a full-scale conflict between the two armies. Due to the intensification of the international situation, although the two sides have not determined a fundamental policy, both have the possibility of following the trend of the times. The conclusion is that, judging from the current situation, the two sides should not start an armed struggle, and that civil war should not occur while the Japanese army is stationed on the mainland. However, both sides are using the forces behind them (the United States and the Soviet Union). Therefore, their disputes will inevitably follow the changes in the international situation and progress. Before their policy of using barbarians to control barbarians fails, a formal armed conflict

### Shen Passes Away

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Shen Guanxiong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, passed away at 8:30 PM on the 12th due to overwork.

### Paris to Try Laval in Absentia

Bern, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Paris, Pierre Laval, the former head of the Vichy government who is still in Spain, has decided to be tried in absentia. This decision came from the trial committee of the French Supreme Court. After this, Laval can still remain in Spain.

Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, Prime Minister Churchill made a statement in the House of Commons on Thursday, stating that the British government could not compromise with the Vichy regime, and that some measures were being taken against individuals within that regime in France a month ago.

### The Big Three of the United Nations Determine the Date of the Meeting, Truman Will Attend with Key Personnel

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, US President Truman announced at a press conference yesterday that the date and location of the Big Three meeting have been decided by Stalin, Churchill, and himself. However, the date and location of the meeting will not be announced before the meeting begins. He added: "I will attend the meeting with Secretary of State Stettinius and former wartime mobilization ministers Pence, Hopkins, and Davis. Now, the opinions of the three leaders of our United Nations have become consistent, and the situation between the three countries has improved greatly compared to before Hopkins went to Moscow. Hopkins' trip to Moscow has resolved the veto issue that was deadlocked at the San Francisco Conference." Finally, he added: "Chief of Staff Leahy will also attend the meeting, but no journalists will be allowed to participate in the meeting."

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to the New York Times, citing Washington sources, the Big Three meeting of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is rumored to be held in Vienna after the British general election.

### The San Francisco Conference to Close on the 23rd

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - The San Francisco Bulletin stated that the representatives of the five major powers have decided that June 23 will be the closing date of the San Francisco Conference. If the technical work of translation and transcription cannot be completed by then, the new charter of the conference will be signed in English.

Regulations on Compulsory Measures Passed
Furthermore, on the 12th, the Security Council of the San Francisco Conference passed the regulations on compulsory measures of the Security Council in the International Charter proposed by the Committee on Compulsory Measures, which stipulates the measures taken by the Council against acts of aggression, but does not include the method of decision (the so-called voting procedure), that is, the commonly known restraint, agreement, or force.

Australian Amendment Vetoed
Regarding the dispute over the veto issue, the Security Council held a meeting of the Organizational Procedures Committee on the 12th and vetoed the Australian amendment requesting that the decisions be made by majority vote with a vote of twenty to ten, and decided to adopt the Yalta method of recognizing the veto power of the major powers. Australia has been working hard to oppose the veto power of the major powers, and other small and medium-sized countries such as New Zealand have also supported this argument.

### Discussions on the Polish Government Reorganization Plan in Moscow

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Moscow, twelve Polish dignitaries will hold important talks on the Polish government reorganization plan in Moscow on the 15th. Foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will also participate in the meeting. Four representatives of the Warsaw regime arrived in Moscow on the 13th. Moscow seems to be expecting the Polish dignitaries to negotiate with the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. If so, the Polish issue may be resolved before the summit. According to a dispatch from London, Sakowski, a socialist representative of the exiled regime who was invited this time, stated on the night of the 13th that he could not attend the meeting due to opposition from the Socialist Party. However, the exiled regime authorities stated that the news of the sixteen leaders who were engaged in secret work was unknown, so it is doubtful whether the exiled regime will happily participate in the Moscow meeting.

Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, General Montgomery, Commander-in-Chief of the British Bomber Command, and Horton, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Front Assault Force, were all commended by the British King and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

### British Air Force Demobilization Plan

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, the British Air Force announced its demobilization plan on the night of the 12th. The British Air Force, with more than one million personnel, will be reduced by one-third in the coming year, and demobilization is scheduled to begin in mid-June. Consideration will also be given to the war against Japan, so that the proportion of domestic service personnel and overseas service personnel will be maintained at a reasonable ratio. 24% of the personnel in the war against Germany have been deployed overseas, and 4% need to be deployed to the war against Japan.

### Review of Anglo-American Policy Towards the Soviet Union and the Evolution of the European Situation

After Germany's surrender, the political situation in Europe underwent a significant transformation. An analysis reveals two primary issues. Firstly, the various matters decided upon by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the Yalta Conference have not been fully implemented. Secondly, no decisions regarding the new political structure of Germany were made at the Yalta Conference.

Regarding the first point, the most prominent issue is the Polish question. The arrest of Polish leaders, for example, has further complicated the matter, and the Soviet Union's desire to communize Poland is increasingly evident. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's unilateral establishment of a new Austrian democratic government without consulting the United Kingdom and the United States is also problematic. Moreover, the discord between Tito and General Alexander, commander of the Allied forces in the Italian theater, over the occupation of Trieste, similarly demonstrates a clear divergence of opinions among the three powers.

Concerning this issue, U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew stated, "The adjustment of territories should not be arbitrarily decided by the initial occupying forces. The wishes of the people must be considered and decisions made at a peace conference." This indirectly expresses American dissatisfaction. Moreover, according to the Yalta agreement, Graz, Austria, was intended to be an American occupation zone, but it is currently occupied by Soviet forces. The issues above demonstrate that the demarcation lines and political solutions agreed upon at the Yalta Conference have not been implemented as agreed.

The Struggle for Spheres of Influence Among the Three Powers

Furthermore, the Soviet Union's intention to control the communication lines from the Baltic Sea through Denmark to the North Sea is a newly emerging problem. If these issues are seen as a manifestation of the division of European spheres of influence, will the disputes among the three powers over Germany not lead to chaos beyond imagination?

Since the occupation of Germany, the differing policies of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France have raised concerns among British newspapers about the future political structure of Germany. Newspapers such as The Times unanimously point out that the current occupation method risks the emergence of two opposing political entities, thus opposing the division of Germany and advocating for a unified political system. However, in this context, the United Kingdom, unlike the Soviet Union, does not have a concrete policy regarding the future political structure of Germany.

When Stalin celebrated the conquest of Germany, he declared, "The Soviet Union suffered tremendous losses due to the German invasion, but the Soviet Union does not want to destroy the German people, nor does it intend to eliminate Germany." This statement understandably alarmed the United Kingdom and the United States. As a result, they cannot help but be suspicious, suspecting that Stalin intends to advance a unilateral Soviet policy towards Germany. Facing this pressing situation of potential renewed conflict, The Economist magazine argued that the United Kingdom must change its policy towards the Soviet Union. Its argument is as follows:

"Western European democracies will likely face the reality that the Soviet Union will adopt a foreign policy no different from that of Nazi Germany in the past. Therefore, the only policy that Western European countries should adopt is to be constantly prepared for war, as if in wartime. There must be a significant error in the UK's policy towards the Soviet Union, otherwise, issues like Poland and Austria would not be so serious. The United Nations' policy has made significant concessions, but all of these concessions are at the expense of other countries, while no ground is given regarding the UK's own position. The only way to gain the Soviet Union's trust is to adopt the Soviet Union's methods and accept its harsh bargains. The most difficult question is: What will the political structure of Germany be like? We advocate for the establishment of ordinary administrative agencies in Germany. Otherwise, if a common administrative agency is not established to replace the military administration, the seeds of conflict will never be eliminated. The Soviet forces are already preparing to establish a free German regime, but we also have a way to preempt the Soviet Union's plan. If we independently administer food distribution to the four to five million German prisoners of war and the many German people fleeing from eastern Germany to avoid the Soviet forces, and seek to restore the transportation system, providing people with various conveniences, we can undoubtedly win over the German people. While remaining slightly inferior to the Soviet Union, we should demonstrate what we will do in Germany and change our diplomatic tactics towards the Soviet Union."

Similar to The Economist's commentary, there is also a considerable outcry in the United States for changing the policy towards the Soviet Union. Leo Crowley, director of the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration, stated on the 13th, "With the end of the European war, there is a need to re-examine the lend-lease program. Although it is currently underway, we hope to prevent the transportation of new lend-lease materials to Europe until a final decision is reached; the Lend-Lease weapons transported to Europe should be limited to countries currently at war with Japan." The implication is clear: to demand the cessation of the lend-lease of military supplies to the Soviet Union.

Churchill's Warning

The most clear expression of the current situation in Europe can be found in Churchill's speech on the 12th. In his speech, there were two key points. One was to review the course of the European war, and the other was to implicitly warn the people to be vigilant about the Soviet Union's movements. Churchill hinted that the future was fraught with uncertainty in his speech, saying:

"Our future holds many difficult tasks. It is my responsibility to warn the nation of this. The UK's participation in the war was to uphold great ideals. Today, we must not disregard these ideals on the European continent. We must maintain the true meaning of the liberation of freedom and democracy. If we allow it to be distorted and fail to return to the right path, then the punishment of the Nazis would be meaningless. If another 'police state' replaces the German military, then it is incomprehensible why we fought. The international organization currently being established at the San Francisco Conference must..."

Churchill's warning and The Economist's alarm bell effectively illustrate the current political nature of Europe. The breakdown of alliances at the end of the war is a common occurrence in history. Churchill has clearly distinguished between democracy and "police politics," but the Soviet Union remains silent on the matter. To what extent the future Anglo-American-Soviet summit will achieve compromise on various disputes is currently impossible to predict, but according to U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew, there are currently about thirty border disputes outstanding. These certainly cannot be easily resolved overnight. These problems may reach some degree of understanding, but it is believed that the three parties will not reach an understanding regarding the future political structure of Germany. Then, does this mean that there is a danger of war between the United Kingdom and the United States? However, while the Soviet Union's military strength has clearly increased, it has also suffered enormous damage in this war, so it is unlikely to go to war with the United States. However, the political struggle surrounding Europe is certain to intensify. (Special dispatch from the Swiss capital, 18th) (Translated from the May 20th Asahi Shimbun)

### Municipal Finance Bureau Levies Real Estate Deed Tax; Notification Sent to Banking and Trust Associations for Compliance

The Municipal Finance Bureau states that, within the former British and French concessions of this city, the real estate ownership of various businesses and residents is based on the land deeds issued by the former concession authorities and the title deeds held by foreign merchants. Since the municipal government has taken back the concessions and unified municipal administration, the transfer of such real estate by citizens should be handled in accordance with regulations at the competent municipal authorities to ensure legal property rights. However, most citizens often engage in private transfers, failing to declare and pay taxes. Moreover, deeds involving larger areas or more houses cannot be readily divided and transferred. Furthermore, banks or trust companies issue so-called land management certificates. New and old owners can thus collect and manage properties separately, completely dissociating themselves from the government, not to mention registering deeds and paying taxes. To rectify tax collection and protect people's property rights, a deed tax will be levied on real estate managed by banks or trust companies starting in May of this year. If businesses or residents use land management certificates issued by banks or trust companies to buy, sell, or transfer real estate, they must register the deed, transfer ownership, and pay the deed tax in accordance with regulations at the Finance Bureau. For all businesses or residents whose real estate is managed by banks or trust companies prior to May, the banks and companies should submit a list to the Finance Bureau, including the names, addresses, and locations and areas of the real estate, for verification. Subsequently, the Finance Bureau will issue deeds and collect taxes based on the land management certificates of the respective banks and companies, which will bear full guarantee responsibility. The above measures have been approved by the municipal government. It is reported that the Finance Bureau has sent notifications to the Shanghai Banking Association and the Trust Companies Association, instructing them to comply accordingly.

### Temporary Measures for Detention of Criminal Defendants; Minister Wu Orders Drafting

The Criminal Procedure Law already stipulates whether criminal defendants should be detained or released on bail, but there are no separate measures to be followed. In the past, bail was handled at the discretion of judges and prosecutors, but the lack of clear standards inevitably caused misunderstandings. Furthermore, the number of detainees in detention centers is increasing daily. Detaining those who could be released on bail only makes the detention centers more crowded, which has a great impact on improving hygiene and addressing the current serious issue of prisoner rations. In light of this, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Judicial Administration has ordered the Criminal Division of the Ministry to draft five temporary measures for the detention of criminal defendants during wartime and submit them to the Executive Yuan for record, to be promulgated and implemented by ministerial order. The reporter learned the following key points of these measures from the local court:

(1) Criminal defendants who commit the following crimes shall be detained in principle:

Those who commit crimes of internal disorder, external aggression, dereliction of duty, murder, causing death or serious injury, kidnapping for ransom, robbery, rape, arson, or flooding.

Those who commit crimes under Articles 256, 257, and 259 of the Criminal Code.

Repeat offenders of theft, robbery, fraud, intimidation, or receiving stolen goods, or those who habitually commit theft, robbery, fraud, or receiving stolen goods.

Those who commit crimes with a minimum principal sentence of imprisonment of five years or more.

(2) Except for those listed in the preceding article, all other criminal defendants shall be released on bail in principle. However, the following defendants shall be released on bail and shall not be detained:

Those who commit crimes with a maximum principal sentence of imprisonment of three years or less, detention, or a fine only.

Those who are seven months pregnant or more, or less than one month postpartum.

Those who are currently suffering from a disease that a doctor has certified would endanger their life if detained.

Those who are sentenced to imprisonment of one year or less, detention, or a fine.

(3) When it is necessary to release on bail a defendant who should be detained in principle, or when it is necessary to detain a defendant who should be released on bail in principle, the reasons must be stated and submitted to the competent superior for approval. From now on, there will be standards to follow for granting bail and ordering suspension of detention. The prosecutor's office and the court can implement them effectively, and the public will know what to expect. It is also heard that Minister Wu is paying special attention to sick prisoners. In addition to raising more than 20 million yuan for the Shanghai Prison Health Improvement Fund and organizing a committee to actively implement improvements, he has recently dispatched Dr. Wang Zutung to visit the prisons daily to examine sick prisoners in order to determine whether they should be released on bail.

### County Administration Conference to Open Today

The Shanghai Special Municipality County Administration Office, in order to understand the actual situation in each county district, has convened an administrative conference of all county districts. The heads of each county district have already reported to the office yesterday (the 14th). It is heard that the conference is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM today.

### Open-Air Vendors Must Use Anti-Aircraft Lamps

The city's air defense authorities, in order to strengthen air defense tasks, have implemented regular light control, absolutely prohibiting light leakage to prevent enemy aircraft from attacking. As for open-air vendors, it was initially planned to ban them, but considering the hardships of the people, they are allowed to set up stalls in appropriate locations when preparing for light control at 10:00 PM. However, they must use the anti-aircraft lamps specified by the Air Defense Headquarters, which consist of a square kerosene lamp made of iron, covered with a circular iron lamp shade, so that the light shines downwards. The styles have been distributed to various branches, instructing the vendors to adopt and manufacture them. They must not use other dry cell or other types of lights. At the same time, they are not allowed to operate after the light control warning at 10:00 PM. Violators will be banned.

### Money Shops Increase Additional Handling Fees

The Shanghai Money Shops Association previously stated that the operating expenses of the members had increased significantly. According to Article 10 of the industry regulations, "Money shops may charge customers handling fees based on the nature of the business." It was proposed to charge an additional handling fee based on the standard of overdue interest, adding 50% to 100% of the monthly overdue interest rate. After deliberation and decision by the Board of Directors and Supervisors, it was immediately notified to all shops for implementation. However, after several months, the expenses of various shops have continued to increase frequently due to price increases. The shops have requested the Association to consider increasing the additional handling fee to provide compensation. The Association has submitted the matter to the Board of Directors and Supervisors for discussion and decision. Starting in June, the additional handling fee will be changed to increase by 100% to 150% of the monthly overdue interest rate. It is heard that this matter has been notified to all shops for compliance.

### Police Bureau Distributes Free Rice

Director Zhou of the Shanghai Police Bureau is actively promoting police administration. In order to improve the treatment of police officers, free rice is distributed to each Chinese police officer every month to stabilize their lives. The rice for this month and next month has been prepared and will be distributed by the Police Welfare Association from today (the 15th) to the 19th. Leaders of various departments, bureaus, teams, stations, and institutes are instructed to collect the rice from the Association.

### Industry Associations Urge Prohibition of Non-Industry Members from Hoarding Goods; Rising Prices Harm Industries

The main industry associations in this city believe that the recent rise in prices is due to two factors: first, industry insiders manipulating and hoarding, leading to a sharp reduction in the supply of materials; and second, non-industry members illegally purchasing and storing large quantities of goods, while taking advantage of rumors to profit from speculation. If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, it will not only harm the industries themselves but also directly endanger the livelihood of the people. In view of this, the associations have decided through separate meetings to issue documents to the relevant authorities, urging them to use political power to prohibit non-industry members from purchasing and storing any materials. If hoarding is discovered, the industry association should be notified first to determine whether they are members or non-members before considering appropriate action. It is reported that recently, some citizens have been using their spare funds to buy and sell various major commodities such as cotton cloth, silk, soap, matches, cooking oil, firewood, charcoal, and paper in an attempt to profit from high prices. However, the entire business market suffers as a result. Moreover, they do not open companies or obtain business registration certificates, often privately transferring goods to each other. If such matters are not strictly prohibited, the future of industry and commerce is feared to be bleak.

### Stock Exchange Income Tax Changed to a Levy of Six Ten-Thousandths

Yesterday, a reporter visited Director Luo of the Shanghai District Collection Bureau regarding the collection of local stock exchange income tax. Director Luo kindly explained the details. A summary is provided below: According to regulations, profits from buying and selling securities are subject to taxation as a temporary business operation, in accordance with Article 12 of the Implementation Rules of the Income Tax Regulations. Due to a sudden increase in the quota for the 34th year, the Bureau drafted collection methods last month and submitted them to the Ministry for approval, originally scheduled to take effect on June 7th. Subsequently, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and brokers, citing excessively high tax rates and cumbersome collection procedures, repeatedly requested a postponement and proposed that the tax be levied at six ten-thousandths of the total transaction amount, in accordance with the transaction tax collection method, to alleviate the hardships of businesses. Considering that the presented concerns involved modifying established procedures, the Bureau could not approve them directly. After signing an opinion, it was forwarded to the Minister for approval, and it was decided to temporarily implement the proposed method from the 15th of this month. This eliminates the need for brokers to calculate net profits on a per-household basis, and customers will only be subject to a six ten-thousandths tax. This demonstrates that the government, despite its difficult financial situation, is still considerate of businesses. However, many in Shanghai may not be fully aware of this tax collection, hence this report. According to income tax rates, securities transactions exceeding 2 million yuan are subject to a 30% tax on the excess amount. Currently, only six ten-thousandths are deducted from the sales amount. This is not only convenient for brokers, but also reduces the burden on customers, who will likely be willing to pay.

### Air Defense Instructor Injured While Fighting Fire

At 9:30 PM on the 12th of this month, a fire broke out in Chengqing Lane on Shunchang Road. Qian Zhichen, a civil air defense instructor, immediately led several Baojia officers to the scene to assist in extinguishing the fire. Unfortunately, he sustained serious injuries and was taken to the Far Eastern Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the Civil Air Defense Headquarters believes Qian's bravery deserves commendation and will honor him and award him a monetary gift.

### Industries and Businesses Safely Navigate the Holiday

Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival in the old calendar. In addition to banks, money houses, and exchanges closing, most factories, businesses, and shops also followed suit. However, most did not stop external accounts receivable or internal operations, so few workers had a holiday. This year, most industries mainly transacted in cash, and customers with existing relationships rarely made purchases on credit. Preparing funds to repay transactions with industry peers was not a problem. In addition, bad debts have been reduced compared to previous years due to careful preparation by various industries, and they were able to cope comfortably, safely navigating the holiday season.

### Exemption of Transit Tax on Silkworm Eggs

The Jianghai Customs announced that the transit tax on silkworm eggs listed under item 21 of the transit tax has been exempted by government order from this date onwards, and it hereby notifies all merchants and citizens.

In a short time, he scored seven points in one go, creating a twenty-to-seventeen, and Laiju Shang exceeded three points. As a result, at 30 to 26, Youlu relied on the efforts of the second half to secure the victory.

### Director Kuwahara Analyzes Recent War Situation: Heavy Casualties for American Forces in Okinawa Operation

Director Kuwahara of the Press Department of the Allied Japanese Fleet in China met with reporters yesterday afternoon and gave a speech on various issues such as the new intentions of the British Pacific Fleet and the strength of the American Pacific Air Force:

British Fleet's Intentions

(Question) What new intentions does the British Pacific Fleet have recently?

(Answer) Recently, I have heard that some British ships have opened up to the surroundings of the Japanese mainland and Okinawa. Initially, during the European war, the United Kingdom was unable to take care of the Pacific, but now, due to the final say, it has sent a fleet to the east to remedy the situation. Another reason is that the American maritime fleet has suffered extreme losses and its strength is insufficient. In order to strengthen the Pacific maritime strength, the British fleet has to be used. Not only is this the case in the Pacific, but the British will also participate in China in future operations. Chongqing now has the American Air Force, and in the future, the United Kingdom will also have an Air Force stationed in China. The British do not want the United States to dominate China's military, political, and economic affairs. The British do not want to sacrifice themselves at the beginning, but they are also unwilling to give up their rights at the end. Therefore, the greatest purpose is its own rights and expression.

Strength of American Air Force

(Question) What is the current strength of the American Air Force in the Pacific?

(Answer) The current support of the American Air Force in the Pacific is as follows: Mindoro is the Fifth Air Force, Luzon Island the Thirteenth Bombardment Team, China Chongqing the Fourteenth Air Force, Mariana Island the Twentieth Combat Team, and the strategic troops in this place seem to be more powerful, with more than 1,000 B29 aircraft, totaling about 4,500 aircraft. In addition to the above, there are other air forces and naval mobile teams on the Okinawa Sea.

Anti-War Sentiment

(Question) What is the situation in the United States and the anti-war sentiment of the people?

(Answer) After the end of the European war, the general American people believed that there was nothing to do in Europe for the time being. The Ministry of Agriculture announced on the 12th that the general allocation of major food this year was reduced by 5% to 7% compared to last year. Meat production last year was 24.6 million pounds, and this year it was reduced by 9% to 21.16 million pounds, of which 60% was used by the US military. The amount of edible oil going to food was 8 billion pounds, and this year it was reduced by 10%. Lard was reduced by 13% compared to last year, so the general allocation was reduced by 17% to 21%. The production of white sugar was reduced by 600,000 tons compared to last year, and the amount of allocation in the future will be gradually reduced. The American people used to be free to use it lavishly, and the food allocation has been reduced again and again, and their anti-war sentiment has also increased.

Casualty Statistics

(Question) What percentage of the total number of American troops were lost in the Okinawa operation?

(Answer) Since the enemy troops landed on Okinawa, the US military has used a total of eight divisions, each division with 15,000 people, totaling 120,000 people. The number of dead and injured is about seven-twelfths, which is more than half of the total number. The total number of large and small ships in the sea team is about 1,400, and the number of sunken and broken ones is 566. The number of deaths and injuries is unknown. However, according to the US announcement, by analogy with the ratio of 75 deaths per 100 people sunk and 50 deaths per 100 people broken, the total number of losses is about 320,000 people. According to the numbers announced by the US, the number of maritime losses is larger than that on land.

Reader's Education News

### This Newspaper's Scholarship Program Will Continue as Usual Next Term

The Office of this newspaper's reader scholarship has recently received letters from poor students from various schools inquiring about how to apply for the next term's scholarship, whether to issue additional scholarships for the three-semester system, and summer school scholarships. This office cannot reply individually, so it is hereby publicly announced as follows: Recently, prices have soared, and people's lives have become more difficult. It is expected that school fees will increase sharply next year, and the burden on students' parents and brothers will be even heavier, that is, students dropping out of school will become a widespread fact. The colleagues of this newspaper are deeply concerned about the difficulties of the times and regard education assistance as their duty; it is their unavoidable duty to relieve those who drop out of school: Therefore, the next education assistance movement is being carefully planned, and once the method is determined, it will be made public to the society to jointly plan the method of relief. It is hoped that all powerful people from all walks of life will generously donate at any time so that the education assistance fund will be increased day by day to achieve success. The gold for this office is issued with two school terms as the standard. For schools that have three school terms, unless the tuition fee is particularly low, the gold issued in the previous term does not meet the maximum limit, and all subsidies will not be provided separately. The request to issue an additional one-semester period cannot be approved. Summer school tuition fees should be raised by each student, and this office will not make arrangements. Regarding the above three matters, it is hoped that the authorities and students of various schools will pay attention and inform all students.

### Appeal to Trade Associations to Run More Volunteer Schools

Rice prices are rising on the ground, and children have no books to read, and teachers have no books to teach! Isn't "dropping out of school" and "dropping out of education" the greatest loss to society and the country? Therefore, I sincerely make a request to the municipal industrial and commercial trade associations and appeal to all industrial and commercial trade associations to raise the banner of justice and run more volunteer schools, especially volunteer middle schools, so that young people still have the opportunity to pursue further studies. Industrial and commercial trade associations have more income and sufficient strength. The most meaningful social cause is no more than this. I think the wise men of the industrial and commercial community will never take second place! (Zhongjiao)
