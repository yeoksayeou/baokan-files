### Japan Sets "Decisive Battle Transport Period," Urges Citizens to Maintain Transportation, Home Ministry Designates Thirty-Six Cities for Increased Production

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Due to the war having effectively reached the homeland, the Japanese government, based on emergency transportation countermeasures, has designated the two months from the 12th of this month as the "Decisive Battle Transport Period." It will dedicate all efforts to increasing the transport of essential materials. Tonight, Transport Minister Koyama gave a radio address, explaining the current state of domestic transport in Japan as follows: "Taking the freight tonnage of state-owned railways in February of this year as 100, it was 118 in March, 122 in April, and 133 in May. Although enemy air raids are increasing daily, transport performance is improving steadily. Furthermore, the content of transport focuses on weapons, ammunition, and other essential materials indispensable for prosecuting the war, making a significant contribution to enhancing the decisive battle situation. Moreover, damage from current air raids is being repaired within a very short period. Although air raids intensified in April and May, the quantity of transport has actually increased, which is truly gratifying to the people of the nation. However, as the war situation becomes increasingly urgent, it is difficult for the small number of existing personnel to maintain the railways. We must rely on the assistance and efforts of every citizen. Therefore, we have designated the National Volunteer Corps as key personnel for restoration. If a railway line is damaged, we hope that everyone will immediately mobilize and engage in repair work."

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - In order to utilize war-damaged sites to increase production and cultivate war potential, the Japanese government has promulgated the "Wartime Disaster-Affected Land Ordinance" (Imperial Edict), effective immediately. According to this edict, past regulations are no longer applicable, opening the way for the free utilization of war-damaged sites. The areas to which this ordinance applies have been designated by the Home Ministry as thirty-six cities nationwide, including the various districts of Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Kobe, Amagasaki, Himeji, Nishinomiya, Shikama, Itami, Ashiya, Sasebo, Chiba, Yokkaichi, Nagoya, Fuji, Shizuoka, Hamamatsu, Kofu, Okayama, Kure, Shimonoseki, Ube, Tokushima, Takamatsu, Kochi, Fukuoka, Moji, Kokura, Tobata, Hakata, Wakamatsu, Omuta, Kumamoto, Nobeoka, and Kagoshima.

Editorial

### Total Counteroffensive is Impossible

After the end of the European War, the enemy's operational goal has shifted to the east. Therefore, the future of the Greater East Asia War has attracted the attention of all parties. The Chongqing side has exaggeratedly propagandized and carried out the so-called "Total Counteroffensive on the Mainland." Yesterday, the Continental New Daily discussed the question of "Is the Total Counteroffensive Possible?" But after analysis of the facts, we believe that a "Total Counteroffensive" is impossible.

Why do we say that a "Total Counteroffensive" is impossible? Firstly, according to general observations, Chongqing's planned total counteroffensive is to be carried out under the conditions of national unification and the united front of the United Nations against Japan. Under such conditions, Japan would at least use three-quarters of its combat power to deal with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and only one quarter to deal with Chongqing. Therefore, several years ago, Hu Zongnan, Zhang Zhizhong, and others were ordered to be responsible for the training, deployment, and planning of the "Total Counteroffensive" forces in Shaanxi and Hunan. However, to this day, everything has been contrary to the expectations of the Chongqing authorities.

First, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army occupied various parts of Southeast Asia. The British and Americans withdrew and suffered heavy losses. In addition, after more than three years, the loss of combat power in Europe and Asia means that the current combat power of Britain and the United States is no longer the combat power that the Chongqing side had planned for. They can't help Chongqing's total counteroffensive much.

Second, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan has not changed significantly to this day. There is no need for Japan to allocate more than a quarter of its combat power to defend against the Soviet Union, as imagined by Chongqing. Moreover, according to the current situation of Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's statements before the Three-Power Conference, although Britain and the United States are eager to bring the Soviet Union into the Asian war, the Soviet Union is not that foolish. It will not unconditionally serve as a cat's paw for British and American imperialists. In this way, one of the conditions for the total counteroffensive that Chongqing has been hoping for for many years cannot be fulfilled.

Third, the external conditions for the total counteroffensive are not complete, and the internal conditions are even more unfavorable. For example, the Japanese expeditionary force in China has always maintained a firm position. Not long ago, a Soviet newspaper discussed the situation in China, saying that last year and this spring, the Japanese army in China had achieved unexpected success, so the coastal and inland key strongholds and transportation lines necessary for the Chongqing total counteroffensive have been occupied by the Japanese army. This is a focal point that cannot be ignored for the Chinese war situation. From this, we can also imagine its future. Second, the CCP's strength has expanded without restriction through some gaps. This new situation has made the CCP's attitude towards Chongqing even tougher. The CCP's expression towards the Chongqing Senate can be imagined. Under this actual situation, Chongqing must use more than half of its forces to deal with the CCP. So, how much can Chongqing allocate to the total counteroffensive at best? This is a very big question.

Furthermore, assuming that the U.S. military lands on the Chinese mainland to assist Chongqing in the total counteroffensive, then Chongqing will get this external aid, and it seems that it can coordinate and cooperate to realize the combat plan. However, this estimate is a huge mistake. We must realize clearly that the points where the U.S. military may land on the Chinese mainland, from Hainan Island in the south to Lianyungang in the north. After landing at any point on this coastline, it is currently impossible to achieve coordination and cooperation with the Chongqing army. Why? Because in fact, it is the CCP's forces that are likely to coordinate with the landing U.S. military. Then, if the landing U.S. military coordinates with the CCP, it is naturally not within the plan of Chongqing's total counteroffensive, and it must be something that Chongqing is unwilling to do. Moreover, it is even more possible that Chongqing, in order to directly coordinate and cooperate with the landing U.S. military to implement the total counteroffensive plan, will not hesitate to use force to eliminate obstructive forces. Under such tortuous factual circumstances, we can definitely say that the so-called Chongqing total counteroffensive is impossible until Chongqing and Yan'an have achieved practical unity.

### Change of Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Army in North China

Beijing, 12th (Central News Agency) - Colonel Shuhei Takazawa, head of the press department of the Japanese Army in North China, has been transferred to an important post. The replacement has been decided to be Lieutenant Colonel Seiji Ozeki. According to sources, Lieutenant Colonel Ozeki has served as a staff member of the Japanese General Headquarters and as an instructor at the Army University. His promotion to this position will surely yield many achievements.

### Japanese Underground Factories Mass Producing New Aircraft, Working Day and Night Without Air Raid Alarms

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Although Japan is subjected to incessant bombing from B-29s and some of the ordnance factories have been reduced to rubble, new aircraft production factories in underground or mountain-top locations are still continuously mass-producing aircraft for defense of the homeland. For example, in a remote valley, there is an underground factory covering an area of 700,000 tsubo, in which several thousand industrial soldiers work day and night, stepping up aircraft production, unperturbed by air raid alarms. Another new aircraft production factory is cleverly constructed on the slopes of a high mountain. These factories have now adopted a three-shift system, producing aircraft day and night. Furthermore, students in school factories are also working hard on aircraft production, starting with the manufacture of parts and then moving on to assembly work. More than a dozen student aircraft have been completed and flown to the skies of war.

### Kyushu and Shikoku Attacked by Air Raids Yesterday Morning

Fukuoka, 12th (Central News Agency) - Forty enemy B-25 aircraft from the Okinawa base, and about 140 smaller aircraft, formed a combat-bomber combined unit, attacked the airports in Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Oita at around 7:50 AM on the 12th, but because of bad weather, they gained nothing and fled. A part of the enemy aircraft had moved in the northwest area of Shikoku.

Fukuoka, 12th (Central News Agency) - About 110 enemy B-29 aircraft invaded from the east coast of Miyazaki Prefecture at around 6:00 AM on the 12th, part of them entered Kumamoto via Oita Prefecture, and others operated in Saga and Nagasaki Prefectures. After a part of the enemy airplanes dropped bombs in the Hakata area and the Kanmon area, they fled from the southern part of Oita Prefecture and the northern part of Miyazaki Prefecture.

### Geneva Newspaper Praises the Spirit of Japanese Special Attack Forces

Zurich, 12th (Central News Agency) - The valiant struggle of the Japanese Special Attack Forces in the waters off Okinawa has shocked the enemy's ranks. The Geneva newspaper recently published an article titled "Japanese Special Attack Forces," praising the achievements of the Japanese Special Attack Forces as follows: The organized tactics of the Special Attack Forces allow for the highest cost-effectiveness in terms of both personnel and materials. From the perspective of its effect, it far surpasses ordinary aircraft. On May 24th, Japanese Special Attack aircraft launched the fiercest attack, crashing into the American fleet in the waters off Okinawa. Although the Japanese side lost 111 Special Attack Force members in this battle, they sunk eleven American ships. During the Okinawa operation, the number of American naval personnel lost alone, according to the 伪小数 published by the Nimitz Command, has reached more than 9,000. The American naval casualties were too great, so the Third Fleet had to be transferred to replace the Fifth Fleet. During the war, in the face of life and death between the two sides, "If I do not kill the enemy, the enemy will kill me," the principle is clear. However, the Special Attack Force warriors, who regard death as home, can better exert their greatest function. They can overcome all difficulties to destroy the enemy's targets at high speed to complete their mission. This courageous spirit is truly worthy of respect.

### Chongqing Senate Holds Sixth Meeting

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing broadcast on the 11th, the fourth day of the National Senate meeting was held on the morning of the 10th in the sixth meeting. First, Lu Zhonglin, Minister of Conscription, explained the work of the Conscription Department and the recruitment of soldiers in August. Then, the senators raised 37 strong consultation items regarding the forced conscription of strong men, mistreatment of recruits, and cold treatment of families of soldiers going to war. According to sources, although the Chongqing authorities had obtained the absolute support of the senators and the understanding of the government before the opening of this Senate, the attitude of the senators was unexpectedly tough after the meeting opened, causing them to be very embarrassed.

### Shaanxi Famine

Beijing, 12th (Central News Agency) - Yan'an Xinhua News Agency reported on the famine in Shaanxi Province on the 1st of this month. Yesterday, the Associated Press Chongqing telegram also reported that on the fourth day of the National Senate meeting, Kuomintang Senator Wang Puhan raised a motion to relieve the disaster in Shaanxi, briefly stating that drought, wind, and flood disasters occurred in Shaanxi Province one after another, and the people were destitute. Among the 12 million people, 3 million had nothing to eat, and agricultural production only reached 20% of the normal year. The government should allocate 500,000 yuan for relief. Furthermore, Shaanxi has always been a cotton-producing area, and 80% of the cotton in the anti-Japanese war area comes from Shaanxi. Now planting is no longer feasible, causing great panic on the Chongqing side.

### Embezzled Donations

Central News Agency reported that according to Chongqing Radio, when the National Senate held a meeting on the 10th, Minister of Justice and Administration Xie Guansheng was questioned by senators after his policy report. The senators stated that the judgment on the corruption case of the National Comfort Association was too lenient, and the main culprit, Li Taichu, had fled to the United States. The government should request extradition. At one point, the order was in chaos. According to sources, Li Taichu, the managing director of the National Comfort Association, had previously embezzled popular donations of money and food and fled to the United States. The senators requested that the Chongqing government severely investigate the matter, but Xie Guansheng's response was extremely vague, causing the public anger of all members. With drought and flood rampant in the mainland in recent years, coupled with the eight years of the war of resistance, the people's livelihood is declining. Now Li and others are using the people's hard-earned money for their own enjoyment, which is causing extreme indignation among the people.

### Conflict Between Chongqing and Yan'an

Beijing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The members of the Senate who failed to visit Yan'an, Huang Yanpei, and others, have not attended the Senate meeting in recent days, proving the deepening and complexity of the conflict between Chongqing and Yan'an. According to a Chongqing telegram from the Associated Press on the 11th, the trip to Yan'an by six senators has failed. As expected, Chongqing and Yan'an will soon begin to adjust and negotiate again. Yan'an expressed a lack of trust in Ambassador Hurley's actions due to his unfair attitude. It is difficult to expect his mediation to have any effect.

### Preparing for Homeland Landing Operations, Enemy Air Force Launches Major Offensive, Attacking Small and Medium-Sized Japanese Cities to Disrupt Maritime Transportation

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - On the 10th, enemy mobile forces launched a third attack on the Kanto region. For this enemy aerial attack on the homeland, the total number of B-29 aircraft taking off from the Marianas was about 501. At dawn, 270 aircraft attacked Wakayama, the southern part of Osaka, and Kochi. At the same time, 120 aircraft attacked Gifu and Yokkaichi, and another 100 aircraft attacked Sendai. Forty-one aircraft dropped mines near Toyama. At noon, 100 P-51 aircraft taking off from Iwo Jima attacked the Hanshin area. In the afternoon, 140 fighter-bombers taking off from Okinawa attacked Kyushu. On the 10th, the enemy launched a total of 1,941 aircraft from base air forces and fleet air forces to attack the homeland. The enemy's propaganda of a "2,000-plane bombing" now seems to be gradually becoming a reality. The enemy fighter-bomber combined unit challenged the Japanese base air force in the Kyushu area. B-29 aircraft have recently switched from attacking large cities to attacking small and medium-sized cities. Therefore, when the enemy ends its attacks on cities in the future, it will inevitably come to disrupt land transportation. The enemy is currently dropping mines in various ports, attempting to disrupt maritime transportation. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's base air force has been extremely active recently. Furthermore, the enemy has re-established the Pacific Strategic Air Force, with Spaatz as commander, leading Doolittle's Eighth Air Force and LeMay's Twentieth Air Force. Its main purpose is expected to implement strategic bombing. In addition, after the end of the Okinawa operation, the enemy's new mobile forces have recently appeared suddenly in the waters off Kanto, directly and indirectly cooperating with these base air forces in order to carry out large-scale attacks. The 24-hour bombing on the 10th of this month has become a reality. Since modern warfare is based on the air force as the main force, if we understand that any operation cannot ignore the air force, we can know that this kind of aerial operation is a preparatory work for the homeland landing operation. Therefore, we must be vigilant about the enemy's movements.

### Chongqing Experiences Another Major Embezzlement Case

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to Chongqing radio, a major embezzlement case has recently occurred in Chongqing political circles. The Standing Committee is severely investigating, causing widespread panic, and government officials are generally uneasy. It is reported that the Chongqing court recently detected embezzlement and bribery within the Central Trust Bureau. It investigated all officials of the bureau, resulting in the sentencing of Wang Huajian, manager of the savings department of the Central Trust Bureau, and another person, to seventeen years in prison. However, the case is serious and may involve personnel from other institutions.

### Huaihai Provincial Police Bureau Intensifies Security

### Turkish Foreign Minister Arrives in London, Visits British Foreign Secretary Yesterday

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a London dispatch from the New York Times, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu arrived in England a few days ago to explore the official views on how to deal with the two issues raised by the Soviet Union to Turkey. Saracoğlu met with British Foreign Secretary Eden today to discuss all matters. It is reported that the demands made by the Soviet Union to Turkey and other issues related to the Mediterranean will be discussed at the Three-Power Conference, so it is widely believed that Eden will have new insights and attitudes to present to Saracoğlu. The Soviet Union's demands on the Turkish government effectively contain a proposal involving international relations, particularly the redefinition of the Straits of Dardanelles management agreement, so that the Soviet Union insists on its specially advantageous position. At the same time, Yugoslavia, Belgium and other countries have expressed opposition to the Greek government, and the heart of this opposition lies in responding to the Soviet Union's request that Turkey agree to the reorganization of border territories to benefit the smaller countries of the Balkan Peninsula.

### Bose Emphasizes Independent Resistance

Shonan, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Taking advantage of Chairman Bose's visit here, the Provisional Government of Free India has decided to hold an "Independent Memorial Week" from the 4th to the 10th to launch a powerful movement to raise awareness of the independent movement among Indians in East Asia. Chairman Bose delivered several speeches, emphasizing that Japan would surely win and not be defeated, that the world situation was definitely not unfavorable to India and Japan, and that Britain's position would become increasingly difficult. India's independent resistance should be fiercely launched now, and the independent enthusiasm and morale of the Indian people and the National Army soldiers should be boosted.

### General Election Begins in Twenty-Two Districts Throughout England

At the same time, Labour Party leader Attlee in Bolton suddenly criticized improper conduct during the election campaign, saying, "When the election campaign unfolds, someone releases air or takes various improper actions, which damages the dignity of our British democratic intellectuals."

### Poland and Sweden Sign Commercial Agreement

The agreement was signed by Polish Minister of Industry Minots and Swedish Trade Representative in Warsaw, Engel.

Local News

### Zhejiang Tanglou One

— A Vivid Description

Tanglou is the first town northwest of Kangyuan, famous for its fruit production, such as sugarcane, loquat, bayberry, lychee, cantaloupe, watermelon, peaches, plums, apricots, pears, water chestnuts, lotus roots, dates, and tangerines. The output is abundant, and it is sold to other places, amounting to tens of millions of yuan annually. The houses in the market are close together, about two li long. Every few houses, a windbreak wall is built to prevent fires. The street is under the eaves, so there is no need for rain gear when it rains, which is quite convenient. However, the street surface is muddy and uneven, and extremely narrow. Moreover, the street is separated by a small river, forming a single street. However, both the west and east sides of the river have shops, within sight of each other, known as the "city center," which is a commercial hub. As for the middle of the streets south and north of the river, there is a wide canal. The canal reaches Gongbu in Hangzhou to the southwest and Shanghai to the east. Before the war, sails were numerous, and freight transport was frequent, but it was only a passing dock. It does not stop.

### People's Food and Tenant Farmers

Because there are many polder fields and branching waterways in this area, local farmers focus on planting fruit trees and fruits for a living. The rice harvested from the rice fields is only enough for self-sufficiency and is still insufficient. There are no large landowners here. Each farmer has only ten or so mu, or even only one or two mu. Very few people rent land for cultivation. The landowners in the town, who cannot cultivate themselves, rent to farmers. At harvest time, rent is paid in kind, about two or three dou per mu. Also, the villagers raise silkworms in the spring and use the surplus mulberry leaves to raise autumn silkworms. This area has traditionally lacked various grains, and people mainly eat rice. Any shortfall is supplied by Huzhou Deqing and other places. Recently, because rice-producing areas have banned exports, only a small number of vendors transport it, causing rice prices to soar, reaching 60,000 yuan per stone. Residents work hard all day but find it difficult to get enough to eat. The soaring rice prices have had a huge impact on the commerce of Mutown. The shops are deserted. Moreover, when the ×× Division is stationed in the town, it requisitions supplies locally, ordering the chamber of commerce to supply military rice according to the shops, causing shops to close from time to time. The hardship of people's lives is evident.

### Education and Scenery

The level of education in Mutown is very low. There is only one Tanglou Central Elementary School run by the county, with about 800 students. There is also one private school, with the same number of students. Moreover, the teachers are of very low quality. Some even become teachers immediately after graduating from the school. The teachers in the remaining private schools are Qing dynasty graduates and scholars, leading this difficult life, with a feeling of not being able to use their talents.

About eight li from the town is Chao Mountain. The foothills are planted with plum trees. Every early spring, the plum blossoms are in full bloom, with a rich fragrance. The flowers on the branches form a sea of fragrant snow. In peacetime, special trains were opened from Hangzhou and other places, competing to visit the plum blossoms, with crowds of tourists. The Song plum in front of Bao Ci Temple (commonly known as Damentang) is particularly distinctive. Only the outer skin of the tree remains, but the branches and trunks are strong, and the flowers have six petals, which is a rare sight. Next to the temple is the tomb of the late painter and calligrapher Anji Wu Changshuo. The tombstone and inscription were written by Dai Jitao, the former president of the Examination Yuan.

The plum forest of Guanshengyuan is also here, which is the origin of the raw materials for Chenpi plums. To the west of the mountain is the Dragon Cave. The depth of the cave is indistinguishable. Upon entering the cave, one hears the sound of ten thousand horses galloping, or the sound of angry waves, so no one has explored it to the end. It is said that it can lead to the Qiantang River, and it will be blocked at the time of Hongyang. Next to Chao Mountain is the Hangtang Highway, which leads directly to Hangzhou, with a branch road to Linping, making transportation very convenient. After the war, ruins are everywhere, and people are struggling to survive. The scenic area has been transformed into a land of Shura. Since the road has been closed for several years, travelers travel by small boats. However, there are many special troops on the waterway, who check and make things difficult, and robberies are often heard. There is a state of "talking about tigers turning pale."

### Punished Banks and Money Houses Continue to Receive and Pay as Usual

The Central Reserve Bank Inspection and Monetary Affairs Department, under orders, has been inspecting the business of various financial institutions since the middle of last month. It has found that 35 banks and money houses have engaged in abuses such as pocketing cash, discounted interest rates, issuing blank transfer slips and promissory notes, forging accounts, hoarding speculation, and evading reserves. The results of the inspection have been reported to the Ministry of Finance in accordance with Article 18 of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions, ordering them to be punished separately with suspension of business and fines. It is estimated that five banks, including Yongkang Yongfeng, have committed serious offenses and will have their licenses revoked and their business liquidated.

### Enemy Forces Are Stirring in the Pacific; Japanese Army Is Fully Prepared; Military Commentator Analyzes the War Situation

A military commentator in this city recently made a detailed analysis of the recent trends of the enemy American and British forces in the Pacific as follows:

### Enemy America Is Preparing for the Next Operation

The enemy's mobile unit's carrier-based aircraft attacked Tokyo, Japan, this time. Looking at its attempt, it seems to be a prelude to an island-hopping operation, while hoping to blockade Japan. We are currently unable to immediately judge what the enemy's purpose is, but the enemy is preparing a land force of more than ten divisions, and there is no doubt that they will take action sooner or later. In the future, where the enemy America's forces move can give a glimpse of the direction they are following. For example, the enemy mobile unit that is currently attacking Tokyo, according to the enemy's announcement, has four aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and fourteen destroyers. Under these circumstances, the enemy first engages a part of the naval force in stirring, which can be regarded as the prelude to the enemy's next operation.

### Changing to McWhorter's Tactics

Since the Battle of Okinawa came to an end, the enemy's personnel changes have been frequent, and the changes in the organization of the army, navy, and air force are particularly noteworthy. For example, the enemy recently dispatched a new engineer corps to Okinawa to carry out construction. It is believed that the vanguard war between the Japanese and American armies has become increasingly fierce. According to a Delhi telegram on the 10th of this month, according to a report from Washington, a vast civil engineering project has recently been launched in Okinawa to build a powerful air base, and the activity of its workers and equipment exceeds more than twice that of Europe and the Mediterranean. According to the announcement of the enemy's Pacific Fleet Command in Omiya Island on the 11th of this month, all US Army Air Force units based in the Ryukyu Islands are under the command of McWhorter. The enemy's Air Force has been redeployed again and again, such as McWhorter's Chief of Staff and Mobile Aviation Commander George Kenney, in addition to controlling the 5th and 13th Air Forces, also serves as the 7th Air Force, which used to be stationed in mainland China. As for the tactics used by the enemy, in the past, the enemy established bases in Ryukyu and the Mariana Islands to attack Japan, which was nothing more than Nimitz's tactics, but now they have abandoned Nimitz's tactics and switched to McWhorter's tactics. Although the British and American sides are actively preparing, such as launching a large-scale war against Japan and the mainland, it cannot be realized, because the preparation of ships and troops is not enough to cope with it.

### Japan Has Long Been Fully Prepared

The enemy's troop strength in Europe, we expect to be able to move to the Pacific in November of this year. It will take until April of next spring for all the troop strength in Europe to be fully moved. Recently, McWhorter also said that the war will end by the end of next year. In Japan, such as dispersing factories to strengthen the production of underground factories, etc., Japan has long been fully prepared, especially maintaining the limit of aircraft, which will definitely not be a problem. In addition, such as the fortification of the mainland, the armed unity of 100 million people, and the supply of troops in mainland China, etc., in the future, in fact, the enemy's dreams and attempts will be shattered without residue. According to the enemy's announcement, although the United States has destroyed a lot of Japanese bases in Okinawa alone, the number of Japanese production has been minimal. Although it has repeatedly investigated the production sites and storage sites of Japanese aircraft, there is no trace, so the tactical bombing of the mobile unit is of no avail, so it feels quite uneasy. This point can better express that Japan's underground production and underground storage are extremely rich.

### British Forces in the Far East Are Not Fighting Effectively

The recent battle in Balikpapan can be said to have reached the decisive stage. In the future, British forces will invade from Malaysia, Thailand, and the East Indies, which is imaginable. Other examples include the Chongqing army's invasion of the Vietnamese border and McWhorter's invasion of Borneo. The launch of the Southeast Asian army and the East Indian Ocean Fleet is inevitable. However, after investigating the British troops' operations in the Far East, they are only engaged in propaganda and not in actual combat. For example, in the Yangon area of Myanmar, the British army is still engaged in fierce battles with the Thai army in Bago. The fact that US Representative Allett accused the UK of not being sincere in fighting the Pacific War, and of only engaging in expanded propaganda, shows the ineffectiveness of the UK in combat.

### Edible Oil Trade Association Scheduled to Be Established

The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special City Edible Oil Trade Association has been gradually completed since the preparation began. The association is scheduled to be established in late July, and a general membership meeting will be convened to elect directors and supervisors. In addition, the membership registration handled by the association will be closed tomorrow (14th) and will not be extended. Whether they are members of the Shanghai District Association or edible oil operators who have not joined the former District Association, they must register, otherwise their membership will be waived.

### Interbank Lending by Interbank Association and Money House Reserve Increases Frequently

The credit union of the banks and money houses in the city, the loan limit for interbank lending, although the amount has been relaxed once, the restriction on high-amount loans is not cancelled, in order to show the consistent rights of basic members and fair adjustment. It is reported that for this loan, if a bank or money house needs it within the limit, it can apply at any time with full collateral, but for special needs, it must attach an application form, stating the purpose and reasons for the need, before it can be processed. The purpose of the lending籌碼is to adjust the necessities of the business of the industry, and all improper needs will be rejected. It is reported that the number of loans from the two industry association reserves has increased significantly recently, but they are all within the limited amount. The total reports of loans from various banks and money houses are also sent to the Central Reserve Bank Financial Inspection Office on schedule.

### Gold Securities Market Conditions

The first phase of the purchase method has been announced in various newspapers. The participation is extremely enthusiastic. Now, in order to facilitate the participation of all sectors, the main points of the method are listed again:

All factories, shops, schools, hospitals, cultural and other institutions and groups can participate in the group independently and directly. Every 20 people can subscribe for one unit. Each institution or group is limited to 20 units. Each unit pays a purchase fund of 500,000 yuan. Individuals can join the institutions and groups they serve.

Participants can collect them at the designated location with their payment receipts in the order of payment. The collection date will be announced in the news in various newspapers at any time.

### Fundraising for Scholarships; Hope from Supported Students

For things that are of vital importance to me, I will do them myself, and the results will be great. I remember the last "Special Fundraising" event. We were actually encouraging the student community to fundraise automatically. Sure enough, when we called out, the crowd responded, and students from universities and middle schools came out one after another, either raising several teams in one class, or raising several teams in one school. The total donations were considerable. In less than a month, the goal was achieved, so the scholarship work last year was a complete success, and everyone was happy!

This newspaper currently has 3,700 students receiving aid. In addition to the more than 600 elementary school students who are young and weak, the remaining 3,000 children are all energetic and lovely. Their own families are indeed poor, but there is no shortage of enthusiastic and wealthy families among their relatives and friends. If each person raises a team, using the "collective recognition method," each person can raise 120,000 yuan, and five or six people can form a team of 100,000 yuan. Isn't it possible to realize these 3,000 ordinary teams? During the summer vacation, I hope everyone will come to the office to collect forms and fundraise from relatives and friends. This is something that is of vital importance to me. I will not complain or resent, but will do it myself!

Old students, please note that this morning from 9:00 to 10:30, assisted students in the second and third grades of junior high school will come to the office to collect the student status certificate and application form. Do not miss it. This office is open.

### Festival Celebration Funds Award Scholarships for the Poor
