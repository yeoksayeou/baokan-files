### Manila Eastern District: Japanese Elite Troops Launch Attack; Fierce Fighting Still Raging on the Banks of the Pasig River

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 19th: (1) On February 14th, powerful Japanese forces launched an attack from the eastern district of Manila against the enemy's main forces in Manila, with the Japanese garrison in the city also providing support, resulting in fierce fighting. (2) Enemy units landed on the Bataan Peninsula on February 15th and at Calaguas on February 16th, continuously increasing their forces. Japanese troops stationed in the area are currently engaged in fierce combat with them.

Luzon Front, 19th (Central News Agency): The Japanese army and naval garrison forces, having held Manila for over two weeks, learned that new Japanese elite troops had begun a counteroffensive from the northeast of Manila. Morale was exceptionally high, and they actively launched offensives. At present, the street fighting within Manila remains centered on Great East Asia Street, which runs through the city from the south bank of the Pasig River to Paco, with a seesaw battle underway. On the 15th, under the guidance of a certain Japanese lieutenant, a strike force with considerable strength penetrated the enemy's lines and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with enemy forces north of Great East Asia Street, completely repelling them and pursuing them to the Pasig River bank, where fierce fighting is still raging. Furthermore, enemy forces in the Paco area of southern Manila are continuously increasing their forces centered on the sports field along the coast, using tanks and armored vehicles to attack Japanese positions. However, after the brave resistance of the Japanese army and naval garrison forces, who engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy day and night, the enemy has made no progress.

Philippines, 19th (Central News Agency): Japanese naval infantry fought valiantly on the Pasig River for days. On the night of the 15th, a unit bravely charged into enemy lines with hand grenades and other weapons, destroying several positions and destroying six grounded tanks, killing or wounding over 300 American soldiers, and returning victoriously.

### Enemy Landings on Iwo Jima; Japanese Forces Counterattack; Enemy Ships Sustain Heavy Damage in Three Days

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): Enemy mobile forces around Iwo Jima continued their intense bombardment and bombing of Japanese positions on the 18th. From 6:00 AM to 5:00 PM that day, two battleships positioned off the southern coast of the island conducted fierce direct fire. In addition, several enemy cruisers also approached the southern coast, sailing back and forth and bombarding Japanese positions. At the same time, several enemy cruisers also conducted slow bombardment of the western and northeastern parts of the island. Also on that day, enemy aircraft conducted detailed reconnaissance of the island. At dawn on the 19th, they finally launched intense bombardment and bombing, and simultaneously, 300 landing craft, divided into three groups, began landing on the two beaches south of the island. The Japanese Iwo Jima garrison, under enemy bombardment and bombing for three days (16th, 17th, and 18th), inflicted heavy damage on enemy ships and repelled enemy landing attempts four times. They are now launching a counterattack against the enemy's expected landing forces, with high morale and engaged in fierce fighting.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): Enemy mobile forces off the southern coast of Iwo Jima, around 8:00 AM on the 19th, approached the southwestern Ni Genhama coast of the island with about 100 landing craft. The Japanese garrison forces are currently counterattacking them and engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy forces continue to send 100 landing craft each from the second and third formations, and the Japanese forces are fiercely counterattacking.

Enemy Warplanes Attack Japan, One-Quarter Shot Down

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency): As a result of the Japanese air defense forces' courageous and fierce fighting against enemy mobile fleet-based aircraft that attacked the Japanese mainland on the 17th, the General Headquarters announced that a total of 129 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed. In addition, 27 more shot down were added to the results of the engagement on the 16th, bringing the total number of enemy aircraft shot down in the two days to 275. Also, 79 were damaged in the two days. If, as expected, half of them cannot return to their mother ships, then more than 30 will have crashed into the ocean. The enemy mobile forces that launched this attack are generally composed of about ten standard aircraft carriers and five cruisers converted into aircraft carriers. The number of carrier-based aircraft in this air group is estimated to be around 1,100 to 1,200. The Japanese forces' two fierce battles resulted in a shoot-down ratio of about 28 percent, or at least one-quarter. After suffering this heavy blow, the mobile forces appear to have retreated to the Ogasawara Islands area, but continued to bombard and bomb Iwo Jima.

Editorial

### The Issue of Evacuating Schools

Evacuating the population is one of the most urgent tasks for this city under the current realistic circumstances. Among the evacuated population, we believe that special attention must be paid to evacuating schools. However, the authorities of general schools in this city may be taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the issue of school evacuation. The reasons they hold are nothing more than: (1) Shanghai has a higher cultural level, and students can easily pursue further studies; (2) Professors and talents are easily recruited; (3) School equipment is more complete, and teaching work is convenient; (4) Various schools in Shanghai already have a foundation and cannot be easily abandoned; (5) It is difficult to start over in a strange land; (6) Evacuation will cause many people to lose their schooling.

Although the above reasons cannot be completely ignored, now is an extraordinary period, and the pros and cons of an extraordinary period must be weighed. In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, some places also have to endure some. Besides, there are always pros and cons. Although Shanghai is said to have a higher cultural level, bad habits such as extravagance, hypocrisy, and arrogance are deeper and wider in Shanghai than in other places. The number of students who are lazy and degenerate has always been large. Therefore, in terms of living environment and moral environment, Shanghai is not the most ideal place to run a school, and it should have chosen a place to establish education long ago. My country's education reform has a history of more than 40 years, but there is no satisfactory achievement at all. In addition to political reasons, the educators have failed to have great ideals and plans, treat education as a business, become a part of personal interests, and fail to adapt to the times, have unique insights, and create a new educational environment suitable for the revival of the country and nation from hardships, which is also one of the reasons.

As for equipment, except for specialized schools related to base and technical education, we feel that general schools do not need to consider impractical equipment. In terms of foundation, it is certainly a pity to abandon the original foundation in Shanghai. However, everything is based on creation. As long as everyone is willing to work hard and practically, even in a strange land, it is not necessarily impossible to create a new world. After the schools are scattered in various places, they can not only achieve the effect of developing and popularizing education now, but also after the war. Most schools are concentrated in one place, which is not what a healthy national education should have. In addition, the so-called evacuation will cause many people to lose their schooling. In fact, there is no problem for those who evacuate with the school, and others can also find ways to choose a place to change schools.

Based on the above, we believe that school authorities must consider the crisis of the future environment and cannot be limited to the convenience of the present. We hope that many universities and specialized schools in Shanghai should choose a place to move as soon as possible. If they can merge, two or more schools can merge and move to one place, which can save manpower, financial resources, and materials. At the same time, because professors are no longer a problem after the schools merge, and they can also reduce the hardship of professors holding concurrent positions, traveling on the road, and having no time to prepare teaching materials. For middle school students and elementary school students, except for middle schools that can choose a place to move, students can evacuate with the school. Other middle school students and general elementary school students can move with their parents and go to school locally. If necessary, supplementary schools may be set up in various places to accommodate students who have no schools to enter.

However, the implementation of school evacuation still depends on the active support of the government authorities, especially in terms of transportation. The government must provide practical help. Special equipment and tools that must be taken away from vocational schools should be given convenience in transportation. At the same time, financial assistance should also be given as appropriate. In addition, the local authorities in various places must do everything possible to assist the relocation of Shanghai schools, so that the school evacuation work can be successfully completed.

### Japanese Government Establishes Price Deliberation Council

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): In order to ensure the operation of the wartime economic plan, the Japanese government decided at a cabinet meeting on January 19 to establish a Wartime Price Deliberation Council, with Prime Minister Koiso Kuniaki as chairman and Finance Minister Ishiwata Sotaro as vice-chairman. It was officially announced and implemented by the official gazette on the 19th. The purpose of establishing the cabinet price deliberation council this time is to suppress the recent rise in prices.

### Chongqing in the Eyes of Americans: Excerpts from the U.S. Intelligence Agency's "Official Report on Chongqing"

The U.S. Wartime Information Agency recently published an "Official Report on Chongqing" in the newspaper, in order to satisfy the American congressional circles who are eager to understand the current situation in Chongqing. The report is divided into three parts: Chongqing's internal affairs, various parties, and economic situation. It was broadcast to Chongqing by radio for three consecutive days on January 15, 16, and 17 this year. The purpose of this move is that the decisive battle between Japan and the United States centered on mainland China is by no means easy. The United States still has greater sacrifices to make, so Roosevelt wants to use this broadcast to publicize to his people and ask them to understand that the government has provided great assistance to Chongqing. What is noteworthy is the attitude of the United States towards Chongqing and the imperialist ambitions of aggression. The main points are translated as follows:

General Situation

Chongqing has been resisting Japan for seven years. Most of its industries, railways, and transportation networks have been lost. Foreign imports can only rely on air routes. Nelson said, "The situation in Chongqing is certainly very serious, but it is by no means hopeless. Chongqing must win in the production war, so in the first stage, it has been started by the United States and Chongqing." This indicates the difficulty of the United States providing material assistance. Due to the difficulty of replenishing trucks, transportation can only rely on mules and porters to barely maintain. Chongqing has at most 6,000 trucks available, and the newest are no more than three years old. The United States is working hard to increase it dramatically.

Although as many as 30,000 tons of materials were to be transported to Kunming in November, only 70% was allocated due to insufficient transportation.

So-called Democracy

The U.S. government hopes and believes that it has the ability to handle Chongqing's internal affairs. What the United States expects from Chongqing is that Chongqing must develop into a government of unity and democratic progress. Currently, because of the period of political tutelage, Chongqing is still practicing a one-party dictatorship, which is certainly being criticized from all sides, but Chongqing also has a little bit of democracy. For example, recently the Chiang Kai-shek government has made a perfunctory statement on this point.

For example, Chiang Kai-shek had to declare at the National Political Council that the repeatedly delayed law on the protection of human rights and life had to superficially allow the demands of the vast people. Chiang Kai-shek, who was always unwilling to return the government to the people, had to hypocritically say that constitutional government should be realized as soon as possible. In the past, the government's budget was like the private account of the Kuomintang, and it was never made public to the people, but now, no matter how they report false accounts, the National Political Council is allowed to review the budget. The fourth National Political Council, which was originally monopolized by the Kuomintang, has increased from 240 members to 290. The method of sending students to study abroad, which was once stopped or strictly restricted, has also been relaxed compared to before. The United States welcomes Chongqing's democratic expression.

Party Disputes

Although Chiang Kai-shek emphasized the importance of domestic unity at the third National Political Council, he allowed the Yan'an regime to have the right to speak for the first time at that National Political Council. According to Chongqing's opinion, the Chongqing Kuomintang has agreed to the preliminary requirements of the Yan'an Communist Party, but later the CCP proposed the following cooperation methods in the National Political Council.

First, Chongqing recognizes the right of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to issue currency and recognizes administrative power. Based on this recognition, the CCP should have the right to control the 12 areas recovered in the Japanese army-occupied areas. Second, Chongqing said that after the implementation of constitutional government in the future, it will recognize that the Communist Party and other parties have equal legal status. Yan'an does not accept the constitutional government that the Kuomintang has repeatedly delayed, but requires the Chongqing Kuomintang government to implement constitutional government immediately, allow all parties to participate in the coalition government, and abolish the private rule of one person or several people. Third, Chongqing verbally recognizes that Yan'an can have ten divisions of troops and provide equipment and treatment equal to that of the Chongqing army. At the same time, Chongqing requires the Yan'an army to obey the orders of the Military Affairs Commission. Yan'an requires Chongqing to supply the 16 divisions of the CCP army with ammunition and food.

These are the opinions put forward by both sides at the National Political Council. Therefore, the National Political Council decided to send an investigation team to Yan'an for inspection. In addition, there is the so-called "Democratic Political League," which should be studied. In addition to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, all other small parties participated in this democratic political alliance, such as the Youth Party, the National Socialist Party, the Third Party, the National Salvation Association, and the National News Agency. These parties all loudly advocated abolishing personal dictatorship, establishing a democratic government, abolishing military interference in politics, and realizing domestic unity.

Manchuria and North China have become important areas due to their abundant natural resources and rapid development. South China is fundamentally an agricultural area and lacks the necessary resources to develop industry. Therefore, if these two areas cannot be unified under one political machine, it will be difficult for China to become a stable force in Asia and it will be difficult to exert the strong force that the United States hopes for. The United States does not favor Chongqing or Yan'an. Our attitude is mainly to support the anti-Japanese government. Chiang Kai-shek is the sovereign of the Chongqing government, because he is still working hard on the anti-Japanese war, so the U.S. government uses materials to assist him.

Material Assistance

The greatest contribution of the United States to the anti-Japanese war is the Pacific War. The purpose of this war is to open the door to mainland China. The United States has three divisions of Americanized Chongqing troops sent to Burma to fight. This is an army trained in India, and it has the latest Americanized equipment. However, the Chongqing army fighting in the Nujiang River has undergone semi-Americanized training and has semi-Americanized equipment. The Chongqing flying division is trained at the Sanderburg Airfield in the United States. When they return to Chongqing, they will fly back to Chongqing in the P40 and B24 aircraft supplied by the United States. In addition, the U.S. aid plan to Chongqing can be mainly divided into the following four items: 1. Expand the air routes in the Chongqing area, supply the China National Aviation Corporation with four-engine transport aircraft, and cancel the previous twin-engine Douglas transport aircraft.

2. Build the Ledo Road and use this road to supply Chongqing with 10,000 to 15,000 tons of materials every day, and at the same time lay four gasoline pipelines directly to Chongqing.

3. Establish the 14th Air Force with 500 bombers.

4. Train the Chongqing Air Force and actively improve the equipment of the Chongqing army.

In addition, there are military experts in technical assistance and economic and industrial assistance. Once the transportation route is completed, the United States will supply Chongqing with the necessary weapons, but at present it is greatly limited due to inconvenient transportation. The biggest difficulty is the lack of trucks. Last year, Chongqing invested 12 million gold yuan to pave hundreds of miles of roads, but all were occupied by Japan.

Based on this situation, looking at Chongqing's economic situation, it can prove the following three points:

First, Chongqing has lost its industrial areas and has mainly lost its transportation network and resources. Second, Chongqing is under severe blockade by the Japanese army. Third, it is very difficult for Chongqing to implement a controlled economy. The people in Chongqing are deeply mired in hyperinflation, but the anti-Japanese war economy is supported by hyperinflation. As Nelson said, China is not hopeless. The people's enthusiasm for increasing production and the morale of the army are the factors that determine the victory of the army. (Translated by Fang from the Asahi Shimbun on January 27)

### On the Banks of the Irrawaddy River: Japanese Air Force War Results; Fierce Battles Launched by Residents of Ramree Island

Influential members of the Indian overseas Chinese community held a community meeting that night and decided to raise 20 million rupees to repair the hospital in cooperation with the war effort. On the 13th, a meeting was held again under the chairmanship of Chairman Bose.

### Western Front Allied Reinforcements with Ceaseless Artillery Fire: Prelude to a Large-Scale Offensive

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – Despite setbacks in recent days, the Canadian First and Second Armies, under the cover of numerous aircraft and tanks, and after hours of intense artillery bombardment on Friday and Saturday, have intensified their attempts to break through. This can be considered the prelude to a major Allied offensive on the Western Front. The main area of attack is the previous breakthrough zone, with the American Ninth Army bearing the brunt. This army has recently received a large reinforcement of artillery and tanks, and the front-line artillery fire is incessant day and night. Reconnaissance activities have developed into strong probing operations, indicating that the date for the Allied offensive agreed upon by Stalin at the Crimea Conference must be imminent.

### De Gaulle Refuses to Meet Roosevelt

Madrid, 19th (Central News Agency) – Rumors that President Roosevelt intended to meet with De Gaulle in Algiers after the Three-Power Conference were met with De Gaulle's refusal, causing a major stir in European diplomatic circles. According to a dispatch from Paris, the French government maintained absolute secrecy regarding the invitation and refusal, but this was ultimately leaked by the American Embassy, much to the displeasure of the French. Initially, during the Algiers period, De Gaulle had intended to visit the United States but was rejected. Moreover, recent negotiations between the United States and France regarding the arms lend-lease bill did not conclude satisfactorily. Furthermore, France's request to participate in the recent Three-Power Conference was denied, leading to a significant deterioration in French sentiment towards Britain and the United States. Roosevelt had promised De Gaulle last autumn to arrange a visit to Paris. However, this time, when visiting Europe and passing through Versailles on his way back from the Three-Power Conference, he did not go to Paris but instead requested a meeting in Algiers, causing De Gaulle's years of dissatisfaction to erupt.

Geneva, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to the German news agency, citing a Reuters correspondent in France: President Roosevelt recently sent De Gaulle a secret memorandum through the American Ambassador, detailing the contents of the Yalta Conference and emphasizing the organization of the San Francisco Conference. It is said that France will be invited to participate in the San Francisco Conference.

### Tensions Rise Between Argentina and Germany

### Soviet Army Deploys in a Snake Formation, Preparing for a Decisive Battle; German Army Also Completes Defensive Posture

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line reports, the Eastern Front can now be divided into the following four theaters: (1) The Soviet army in East Prussia is conducting a forced encirclement operation to eliminate the German bridgehead, launching repeated attacks. (2) The Soviet army in West Prussia aims to cut off Danzig. (3) The Grinbilk area in the Vistula River bend, where the Soviet army aims to threaten the industrial zone of Saxony. (4) The siege and defense of the Breslau fortress is only in its initial stage. While the battles themselves are extremely important, it goes without saying that they are also preparatory stages for a future decisive battle. The initial symbol of this decisive battle has appeared in the Vistula River salient northwest of Frankfurt and Küstrin, where the long snake-like formations of Soviet troops are gradually advancing towards the assembly points for troops participating in the assault on the capital. At the same time, the German command, with its vast central strategic reserve, has completed its defensive posture and is using the air force to strike hard at Soviet assembly points. The small bridgehead on the west bank of the Vistula River has become a common grave for Soviet soldiers. It is expected that the largest German decisive battle will begin within a few days.

Fierce Fighting Unfolds in Silesia

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – Havas reports: Soviet Marshal Konev's attempt to break through the German defenses between the Bober River and Sagan has been countered by a German offensive, which has closed the gap. At the same time, Soviet attempts to break through between the Bober and Queis Rivers have also been thwarted. Fierce fighting has also broken out south of Breslau. In addition, battles are extremely intense between Penslau and Lauban, and between Sorau and Sagan. Heavy fighting is also taking place southwest of Klosen, on the west bank of the Bober River.

Soviet General Killed in Action

Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to a German news agency, citing a TASS broadcast from Moscow: General Chernyakhovsky, commander of the Red Army's Third Belorussian Front, has been killed in action in East Prussia. The report stated that General Chernyakhovsky's death is a loss to the Soviet Union of a most talented young commander.

### Factories in This City Required to Register by Deadline: Municipal Economic Bureau Issues Registration Methods

The Ministry of Industry has long promulgated regulations for factory registration, which all factories should abide by. In recent years, old factories have gradually recovered, and new factories have increased daily, but the number reporting for registration is very small, making it impossible to implement adjustment work. To understand the actual situation of factories in various places, special regulations have been established for factory registration, ordering the competent authorities in various places to urge all factories to complete the application registration procedures as scheduled, before the end of March of this year. Any factories that violate the delay will be severely punished. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau specially copied the attached methods yesterday, ordering the various trade associations to transfer to their member factories to complete the factory registration in accordance with the regulations before the end of March of this year. The methods are recorded below:

Factory Registration Methods

Competent authorities in various places should, within one month of receiving the document, submit the approved factory registration forms to the Ministry for record (those already submitted do not need to be resubmitted). In the future, the registration forms for newly established factories should also be submitted to the Ministry for record at any time. All factories that have been established but have not yet been registered should be ordered to comply with the Factory Registration Rules, and complete the registration within three months from January 1, 1945, to the end of March 1945. The penalty provisions of Article 12 of the Registration Rules are now temporarily exempted from execution to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. If registration is further delayed, the competent authorities in various places shall severely punish them. Newly established factories should apply for registration in accordance with Article 1 of the Factory Registration Rules and should not delay. Violators will be punished in accordance with the regulations and may have their various licenses revoked.

### Embezzlement of Consumption Special Tax Severely Punished by Finance Bureau: Small Changzhou Noodle Shop Fined Over 4 Million

The Small Changzhou Noodle Shop, located at the south end of Sichuan Road, specializes in selling pork ribs and noodles, and its business is very prosperous. In October of last year, the former Consumption Special Tax Office heard that the noodle shop had not been truthful in collecting the consumption special tax, and sent someone to investigate. Dong Lingeng, the owner of the noodle shop, fearing the investigation, bribed the investigators. The investigators reported it, and the Special Tax Office notified Dong Lingeng to come to the office for questioning. According to the general ledger he submitted, the total business volume for October was less than 10,000 yuan per day, which was obviously inconsistent with the facts. After further investigation by the office, the net business income from the 14th to the 18th of November was 615,740 yuan, about 120,000 to 130,000 yuan per day, and about 3.7 million yuan for the whole month. The shop had been consistently underreporting its income and embezzling tax money. According to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Consumption Special Tax of the Ministry of Finance, based on the average food price index for November, the amount was traced back to June of last year, decreasing month by month. Except for the tax money for October and November, which had not been handed over, it was still difficult to determine whether there was embezzlement. In June, July, August, and September, the shop had embezzled 472,698 yuan in tax money. The Special Tax Office, in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Consumption Special Tax of the Ministry of Finance, fined the shop ten times the minimum amount of the embezzled tax, for a total of 4,726,980 yuan, and ordered it to pay back the embezzled tax of 472,698 yuan. Huang Lingeng, the owner of the shop, recently submitted a report to the Finance Bureau, saying that he was unable to pay the money at once. It is said that the Finance Bureau has rejected the application.

### Municipal Health Bureau Promotes School Hygiene

The Municipal Health Bureau in this city has been promoting school hygiene in various municipal schools. The working principle is to check students' physical condition, treat simple diseases, and guide students to correct physical defects and conduct family visits and health talks. However, in recent times, the living standards in this city have been rising daily. Once they fall ill, the medical expenses alone easily cost tens of thousands, which is indeed difficult for poor parents to bear. This not only affects the health of the students, but also hinders their studies. It is necessary to actively provide relief to maintain their health. The bureau has ordered the relevant departments to carefully formulate expansion plans. From this semester, in addition to continuing to promote the original work in the clinics, free internal medicine treatment will be added, with each doctor responsible. The required medicines will be issued by the Health Bureau, and the cost will be recovered as appropriate. The students' parents will purchase the medicines needed for injections, and the doctors will still provide free injections. Those who need to be hospitalized will be accommodated in the municipal hospitals as much as possible, and special arrangements will be made with the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Jimin Hospital, Fuxing Hospital, etc. Those who hold introduction certificates from the Health Bureau can have a 30% discount. The above plan has been implemented this semester. This measure will not only help the social economy, but also maintain the health of students. It is of great benefit to children. It is also heard that the health authorities will universally promote school health work to all public and private schools in the city, so that all students in the city can enjoy health protection.

Short Commentary

### Power Supply Must Be Reasonable

The power supply in this city is limited due to the reduced source of coal. Recently, the power company announced that the power supply time is from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM every night. However, this is not the case in reality. For example, the power supply time in the old First District and the eighth district is different. Sometimes the time is extended, sometimes the time is shortened, sometimes there is no electricity all day and night, and sometimes there is electricity all day and night (yesterday, from 7:00 AM to 2:00 AM when this was written, general users in the old First District were all supplied with electricity). This kind of divergent phenomenon is completely the result of the power supply side messing up its steps.

Since it has been decided that the power supply will be for three hours every night, why is it sometimes reduced and sometimes increased? This is incomprehensible. If the power supply is reduced due to a lack of coal, then there should be no possibility of supplying power all day and night at all. Even if there is temporary supply power, it should be accumulated for reserve. Today, if there is coal, it can be used more, and tomorrow, if there is no coal, it can be stopped. This kind of profligate behavior should absolutely not exist in public utilities. From the perspective of the credibility of the power company's announcement, there should not be a phenomenon of sudden increase or decrease, which reduces the faith of citizens.

Finally, we still advocate that during the lunar period of each month, street lights should be temporarily reduced or turned off, which can also save electricity. On the other hand, essential production and social welfare undertakings such as factories and hospitals cannot be supplied in the same way as general users. In short, it is hoped that general users will save electricity, and the power company should first achieve planned savings. Power supply must achieve the most reasonable allocation.
