### Fierce Fighting on Iwo Jima; Japanese Suicide Squads Active; Garrison Forces Tenaciously Defend Positions with Fierce Counterattacks

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency): Since the enemy Americans landed on Iwo Jima a week ago, the battle situation has become increasingly fierce. Heavy fighting continued on the 24th, with the focus of operations in the area from Screen Rock to the south side of Motoyama Airfield. The second area of intense fighting is in the area south of Asotai, facing Nishito. The enemy has consistently attacked the central part of the island, but after fierce counterattacks by the main Japanese positions, enemy losses have become increasingly heavy.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese suicide attack squads active on various fronts on Iwo Jima are infiltrating deep into enemy lines everywhere, bravely killing the enemy and destroying their supplies. On the night of the 21st, a suicide commando team led by Yamada Oboro on the island advanced from the west coast to the enemy command post near Chishima, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers and capturing operational maps from the command post. These maps contain extremely detailed information on the enemy's combat deployment.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency): The Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima is still holding key terrain, securing its main positions, and launching fierce counterattacks against the enemy, inflicting heavy damage. Since the 23rd, the enemy's main focus of attack has shifted to the Screen Rock and geothermal areas, attempting to penetrate the central part of the main Japanese positions. The Japanese garrison has also reinforced its forces at the enemy's main counterattack points, launching fierce attacks and completely shattering the enemy's plans. Since the 23rd, the front lines on the island have stabilized. At around 7:00 PM on the 25th, enemy forces in front of the Japanese positions attempted to penetrate the Asotai area from the western front of the island. The Japanese garrison immediately engaged them, initiating fierce fighting. Enemy forces on the southern front also amassed a force of 200 men near this area at 7:00 AM, launching an attack with tanks and using part of their force to attack the geothermal area. In response, the Japanese artillery units launched heavy shelling. At 9:30 AM on the 25th, the enemy's first line was formed from Asotai, Chishima Village, the geothermal area, and Screen Rock. The enemy's main focus appeared to be on the center, with 80 tanks attempting a strong advance from the geothermal area towards Motoyama Airfield. However, the Japanese forces isolated on Mount Suribachi are still fighting bravely. On the night of the 23rd, they dared to launch a large-scale melee assault, charging into the tank ranks and destroying many tanks. After the 24th, the Japanese flag can still be seen flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi.

Suribachi Mountain Riddled with Shell Holes

Central News Agency Report: According to a New York dispatch on the 24th, a U.S. Associated Press war correspondent reported the difficulties of the Iwo Jima operation as follows: The slow progress of the U.S. Marine Corps attack on Iwo Jima is quite disheartening. The soldiers currently with me on the beach all believe that the future operations will be the most difficult in the Pacific War. The area of Iwo Jima is extremely small, making operations extremely difficult and preventing the use of clever tactics. This morning, I witnessed the tragic situation of the U.S. Marine Corps attacking Mount Suribachi. The mountain is about 550 feet high, and due to intense bombing and shelling, the entire mountain is riddled with shell holes, almost like a honeycomb. Most of the Japanese gun emplacements, artillery caves, and tunnels have been destroyed, but the Japanese resistance is strong, and they are fiercely shelling the U.S. supply base and personnel ships on the beach. Although the Japanese shelling has temporarily decreased, it has become active again today. The Japanese defensive equipment is even more fortified, requiring three or four direct hits to disable it. Japanese soldiers are lurking everywhere on the island, even appearing at the Motoyama Airfield, which has already been occupied by the U.S. military. Therefore, the closer we get to Tokyo, the more difficult the operations become. U.S. naval shelling has the potential to harm U.S. troops on the island, so the battle must become an infantry war, and naval artillery has lost its effectiveness.

### Japanese Use Rocket Shells

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency): The heavy rocket shells used by the Japanese on Iwo Jima are directly applied to front-line launchers, which is very different from the German V1 flying bombs launched from the rear. Their impact on the war situation is very significant. Enemy positions were quite alarmed upon receiving this news. According to a report by United Press correspondent Ronzebach, U.S. artillery experts believe that the new Japanese weapon exploded four days ago at the landing site of the U.S. Marine Corps in the southeast of Iwo Jima. The launch site is likely in the northern mountains, which provide protective firing positions. The emergence of this new weapon is clear evidence of the extensive defenses on Iwo Jima. The shell uses jet propulsion to fly through the air, and explodes upon impact using a fuse. In addition, the Japanese also use ordinary rocket launchers, anti-ground and anti-air dual-purpose guns, Japanese artillery, automatic rifles, and other weapons.

### U.S. Plans to Seize Chongqing Aviation Business

According to reliable sources: Mao Bangchu, Director of Chongqing Aviation, went to the United States last autumn to attend the Chicago Aviation Conference and has now returned to Chongqing. On the 22nd of this month, he made a statement saying: Although international aviation will restore free competition in the future, China's civil aviation can still develop and will not be hindered, etc. The reason why Mao made this statement is that the United Kingdom and the United States had a secret understanding at this aviation conference: the United Kingdom recognized that the United States could control Chongqing's aviation business. Therefore, Mao made this statement to cover it up. The United States also plans to control the global aviation network in the future, so it pays close attention to the oil production situation in various oil-producing areas such as Iran, Iraq, and even the kerosene production in the Chinese mainland, which is the basis for seizing the international aviation network in the future.

### Japanese Prime Minister's Remarks

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency): After leaving the Imperial Palace on the night of the 25th, Prime Minister Koiso made the following remarks: Enemy planes that attacked Tokyo on the 25th dared to bomb the Shumaryo (horse department) of the Imperial Household Ministry and the guard station of the Omiya Imperial Palace. The damage was indeed minimal, but as a subject, I was terrified and at a loss. I immediately went to the palace to respectfully inquire about the Emperor's well-being, and went to the Imperial Residence to respectfully inquire about the Empress Dowager's well-being. Tomorrow morning, I will visit His Majesty the Emperor and humbly offer my apologies on behalf of the Cabinet. I and 100 million compatriots are indignant at the disrespectful behavior of the enemy planes and vow to kill and reduce the enemy Americans.

### Wuzhou Gradually Becoming Prosperous;督辦 Commissioner's Office Established in Guiping

Wuzhou, 26th (Central News Agency): Since Guangxi's Wuzhou fell in late September last year, the market has recovered to its pre-war prosperity by May of this year. Before the war, Wuzhou had a population of about 150,000 to 160,000, and the number of returnees has reached 100,000. Wuzhou is located in the transportation center from the South China coast to the interior, and its Xijiang River basin is a distribution center for materials. The listing of materials has increased with the restoration of law and order, and various light industries and home handicrafts have gradually started work. Before the war, there were 42 leather factories, and 32 have resumed operations. Other small-scale industrial and commercial enterprises such as rice mills, soy sauce gardens, and electric wires have also resumed operations. A civil administration department has been established politically to guide the people. At the same time, Japanese banks such as Zhengjin and Taiwan have successively established branches, which has provided a lot of financial assistance. In the war ruins in southern Wuzhou, the people voluntarily donated 3.5 million yuan. Guiping, a key strategic location upstream of Wuzhou, has about 40,000 returning residents. A Guiping area 督辦 Commissioner's Office has now been established. A few days ago, Li Shaochang, the younger brother of Li Jishen, a veteran sent by the Southwest faction, took office as the 督辦 Commissioner and engaged in all restoration plans.

### Japanese Air Force Night Raid on the Banks of the Irrawaddy River; Destroyed Enemy Vehicles and River Crossing Facilities

Burma Frontline Base, 26th (Central News Agency): Japanese air force units cooperated in the northward operation, attacking enemy troops on the banks of the Irrawaddy River. On the 24th, fighter squadrons launched a fierce attack on enemy motor vehicle units, setting three on fire and destroying 48 others. That night, a bomber formation attacked Nyaungbinwun (28 miles southwest of Pakokku), destroying four river crossing facilities (one of which was a major fire), inflicting great damage. The Japanese planes returned safely.

### Manila War Moves to the Periphery of the City; Japanese Troops Launch Surprise Attacks and Advances Everywhere

Luzon Frontline, 26th (Central News Agency): On the 14th, a powerful Japanese force struck the flanks and rear of the large enemy American forces near Manila from the northeast of Manila. Since then, they have repeatedly launched surprise attacks and advances everywhere, ravaging enemy reinforcement and transportation units, or blowing up their supplies, continuing to advance like a whirlwind. One unit has approached the Manila coast south of Marololos, cutting off the enemy's supply line. Another team approached the city of Manila and joined forces with the naval forces of the entire former Magiliac camp, adding to its transfer and continuing to actively and decisively attack, achieving great results. At the same time, they have made considerable contributions to the Manila garrison. After achieving their goals, they returned to their original positions with bold and rapid action. The enemy concentrated all its forces outside the city of Manila, attempting to attack the Japanese strongholds in the eastern mountainous area of Manila. Their actions are gradually becoming active. One part used boats to travel upstream on the Pasig River and began landing south of Laguna de Bay in the southeast of Manila. Another part appeared on the same day with ten tanks as a vanguard, appearing near the eastern highlands of the Marikina airfield, 15 kilometers east of Manila. In the battlefields between Pasig and Marikina, 15 kilometers southeast of Manila, near Rosario, enemies possessing 15 cm howitzers and a large number of tanks are in action. In the area south of Novaliches, 10 kilometers northeast of Manila, enemy activity is also active. At the same time, there are no major changes on the northern front. Fierce fighting began at dawn on the 22nd in the San Nicolas area. Two battalions of enemy troops with 40 artillery pieces attacked the Japanese strongholds in the eastern highlands of Luzon. The war has now shifted from the streets of Manila to the periphery of the city, and from the plains and lowlands of central Luzon to the surrounding hills and mountains.

### Inland River Shipping between Shanghai and Suzhou

—Wenxiang

During my school vacation this time, I originally planned to take the train home, but it was difficult to buy train tickets, and it was inconvenient to carry luggage. Coincidentally, a peanut boat from my hometown came, so I took a ride on the empty boat back. I lived on the boat for three days and four nights. The various things I saw along the way are probably known by very few people. Therefore, I will describe them below for the reference of those returning home.

A Glimpse of the Wharf

The boat was parked at the Zhongshan Bridge pier next to the Toyota Yarn Factory. On that day, there were more than 100 ships of various sizes, mostly empty boats, which had loaded goods such as firewood, soybeans, and peanuts from the mainland and came to Shanghai. After unloading, they were preparing to wait for the steamer to tow them back. In a Yu Yuanyuan teahouse in Zhoujiaqiao, it was crowded with all kinds of people of the upper, middle, and lower classes: boat owners, brokers, boat crew, gangsters, and "yellow shirts," all day long bustling and noisy, busy with nothing more than customs declaration, bargaining, and buying steamer tickets. It is said that when cargo ships arrive at the wharf, they are not allowed to declare customs unless the conditions are negotiated here. When the ship sets sail, the empty boats are first arranged in rows, connected to each other with ropes, and then connected row by row, totaling more than 40 boats, all large boats capable of carrying 300 to 400 dan of soybeans. The tugboat is called Ruijing. At this moment, the shouts of the boatmen and the roars of the boat owners, a constant stream of "Daohao!" sounds, were much more tense than taking the train. Standing at the bow of the boat from 10:00 AM, waiting on an empty stomach, it was not until 3:00 PM that we officially left Shanghai.

Passing Huangdu

Although it is only a short 50 li journey, the steamer towed for 17 hours. According to the boatmen, it was still very fast. This is because the river is narrow and shallow, the waterway is tortuous, and towing 40 large boats, if the speed is too fast, there is a risk of running aground. The boat left Yejidun, only a dozen li away from Shanghai, and it was already late, so we stayed overnight in Beixinjing. We continued the next morning, arriving at Xiaohuangdu at 6:00 PM.

The next day, the boat passed Dahuangdu, and the river suddenly widened. In addition, the water was strong, so the boats traveled in pairs. It took another day and night to reach Baodai Bridge in Suzhou, a distance of 160 Chinese li, with a speed of only six or seven li per hour. From Baodai Bridge onwards, the steamer untied its cables and left, and each boat had no choice but to use poles to move forward.

Extortion Along the Way

From Shanghai to Suzhou, a steamer ticket costs 13,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, just after leaving Shanghai, a small boat came to extort money from each boat, ranging from 500 to 1,000 yuan. From Shanghai to Huangdu, passing through Beixinjing, Yejidun, Zhouwangmiao, it can be said that there are checkpoints everywhere, and the blockade is heavy. Two people in a group, three people in a group, with various tricks, all had to unlock. It is said that this is the "rule": relying on the mountain to eat the mountain, relying on the water to eat the water. In total, including the expenses on the steamer, an empty boat had to spend 15,000 yuan in sweat money. The boat owner said that it was necessary to do so, and it was still worthwhile. If a boat traveled alone, the expenses would be even greater, and there would also be danger.

When the boat set sail, the boat owner informed the passengers in advance not to go out when we reached the blockade line to avoid trouble, so we almost completely lay in the cabin for three days. The boat had three meals a day, nothing more than pickles, so the hardship can be imagined. At night, the cold wind was piercing, and we huddled together unable to sleep. In addition, we could not raise our heads and stand upright during the day. Therefore, all those who took the boat complained endlessly.

Evacuation Tools

It is currently difficult to travel, as if trying to climb to the sky. If you bring family members and belongings, it is simply unthinkable. The train shouts to improve, but it is difficult to meet expectations. The steamer has a small capacity, so it is better to use civilian boats. First, you can carry heavy belongings, second, the whole family can travel together, which is convenient to take care of, and the losses are less. If Shanghai implements a large-scale evacuation, it is the most simple and economical. Schools, groups, charitable organizations, etc., can use the empty boats on the return trip, and the boat owners will also be happy to accept, which is a win-win situation, and will not be affected by external influences, such as fuel shortages, etc. The method can be to first investigate the ships coming to Shanghai from their hometowns at the wharf through the hometown association and register them, and then register the hometown compatriots returning home in advance. The military should be sent along the way to escort them, and the municipal government should issue certificates to avoid enemy fraud along the way. If this is done, it can be said to be foolproof.

Suzhou Countryside

When the boat reached Baodai Bridge, we heard rumors that empty boats were being sealed in Suzhou City, so boats of all sizes avoided the village riverbanks. The boat I was on originally planned to go straight to Changzhou, so we also bypassed the city and stayed overnight at Zhujiacun in Xinguoli, six li away from Huangtang Town. This place is eight or nine li away from the city, close to Mulong and Lingyan Mountain. The place is remote, and I was initially very afraid. After asking the villagers, they said that there were no bandits or disturbances in this place, and we were able to sleep peacefully. The next morning, I called a villager to carry the luggage and lead the way. I learned that the villagers in this place are unusually simple and honest, and there are absolutely no bad elements. The villagers did not show any surprise when they saw me wearing a student uniform. Prices are very cheap in Changdi. A pot of tea is only 20 yuan, the price of rice is 25,000 yuan, and a dan of firewood is 1,000 yuan. It can truly be said to be a paradise.

### 1,800 U.S. Planes Attack German Industrial Areas; Munich Heavily Bombed

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency): According to a London dispatch: a large formation of 1,100 U.S. bombers and 700 escort fighters bombed Munich and the Ruhr area, targeting railways, airfields, military industries, etc., especially launching a concentrated attack on Munich with more than 500 bombers.

### Street Fighting Unfolds in Breslau

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency): According to frontline news: The initiative in the operations on the Niesse River front has returned to the hands of the German army. The German army has cleared several enemy bridgeheads, and the German army at the Guben bridgehead is still resisting the Soviet offensive.

Zurich, 26th (Central News Agency): The Soviet left wing continues its persistent attempts to break through in the Gorlitz area. The area between the Wohte River and the Niesse River is the main battlefield on the Eastern Front. The battle for the Breslau urban fortress has become even more intense. The Soviet forces suppressing the city's periphery seem to have started from the south. 100,000 German troops determined to defend the fortress to the death in the city center are launching street fighting with siege guns and machine guns. The German forces besieged in Konigsberg, East Prussia, have finally secured the city's connection with the outer harbor after several days of bold attacks.

### German Troops Destroy Water Gates; Ruhr River Floods; Fierce Street Fighting in Düren and Jülich

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency): DNB reports: The German army has also destroyed a section of the steel pipe of the Ruhr water gate, causing the Ruhr River to rise again, and the war zone south of it has been flooded. It is expected that the enemy troops under Marshal Montgomery will have great difficulties in operating.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency): On both sides of the Ruhr River, the enemy's reinforcements are endless, and the fighting is fierce. Enemy engineers are trying to establish a bridgehead, but they have been hit hard by German artillery fire. The street fighting in Düren and Jülich has not ended. The U.S. First and Ninth Armies have not yet established a larger bridgehead on the other side of the Ruhr River, so the enemy's tank units have not been able to exert their strength. Therefore, the battle of the Ruhr River cannot be said to have passed the first phase. Between the Meuse and the lower Rhine, the Canadian First Army continues to attack on the Goch-Weeze road. The casualties of U.S. and Canadian soldiers since the 15th have been over 10,000.

Editorial

### The Problem of Unemployment Relief

Recently, the central government formulated principles and methods for implementing streamlined administration, and the municipal authorities also implemented internal rectification to reduce the size of institutions and simplify them, focusing on reducing redundant personnel and improving work efficiency as the focus of rectification. This is the trend of layoffs in government agencies. At the same time, due to restrictions on electricity and raw materials, production has decreased in the city's industrial sector. Due to rising prices and reduced general purchasing power, business is slow in the commercial sector. Both industry and commerce have to increase salaries in order to take care of the livelihood of employees due to rising prices. Therefore, in order to adapt to the environment and balance income and expenditure, it is also necessary to implement layoffs and reduce expenditure. This is the trend of layoffs in industry and commerce.

Regardless of whether it is government agencies or industry and commerce, under the current circumstances, it is an inevitable situation to implement layoffs and reduce expenditure in order to strengthen themselves. As a result of the layoffs, the problem of unemployment arises, and the laid-off personnel become unemployed. Moreover, because the entire society has a trend of layoffs and reducing expenditure, the number of unemployed people is bound to be considerable. These unemployed people are either civil servants or industrial and commercial employees, all of whom are so-called salaried workers. In the past few years, the salaried class has been threatened by high prices and feels that their livelihoods are difficult. However, they still have an official position or salary, which can be used to supplement their income. If they are unemployed, they will not be able to obtain even this meager salary, and prices will be even higher, making life even more difficult. Let us imagine how serious this panic will be!

In view of the above situation, we cannot but pay close attention to the problem of unemployment that we are facing. The problem of unemployment is one aspect of the overall social problem, and the government and society should jointly take responsibility for relief. We take the lead in providing our humble opinions for discussion:

(1) Government agencies and industrial and commercial enterprises should provide severance relief funds to laid-off personnel to the greatest extent possible, so that their lives will not be immediately affected.

(2) Government agencies should provide laid-off employees with certificates of service. When inland agencies need staff, they should give priority to employing them according to their abilities. Industrial and commercial enterprises should provide laid-off employees with certificates, giving priority to reinstatement or employment when they resume business or need them. Of course, those with poor character and poor performance are exceptions.

(3) The Social Welfare Bureau should consult with civil social welfare and social service organizations to organize an unemployed personnel registration office, register the skills of the unemployed, classify and compile them, and introduce them when there is an opportunity. They should also contact inland agencies, guilds, and chambers of commerce to recommend talents.

(4) The population evacuation is currently being carried out, and the unemployed are also included in the evacuation. From the perspective of the unemployed themselves, it is best to evacuate from Shanghai. Those who have a home to return to can simply return to their place of origin. Those who have no home to return to should immediately join the locations designated by the Evacuation Committee. However, the most important thing to pay attention to is to abandon class concepts. For example, those who originally worked as writers do not need to write after evacuation, but should accept the assignments of the times when they need to pick up a hoe.

As the saying goes: "If you are prepared for anything, you will succeed." The problem of unemployment is already an inevitable trend. It is hoped that the authorities and social leaders will pay attention together, take advantage of the implementation of the population evacuation, and at the same time take care of unemployment relief, so that the unemployed can be arranged and social order can be guaranteed and peaceful.

### Minister Zhao Discusses Propaganda Implementation Plan; Guidance Work Under Planning

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department took office, he has been comprehensively planning the propaganda system of the national government under the decisive battle, and is now gradually implementing it. Yesterday, a reporter paid a special visit to Minister Zhao to inquire about the current propaganda policies and strategies. The following is the response:

(Question) Since you took office as minister, we have gleaned the general outline of the key points of propaganda administration from your previous talks. However, the specific promotion policy has not yet been published. For example, regarding the propaganda organization, is there a need to reform the four-division structure of the Propaganda Department at the central level in today's decisive battle period? Furthermore, war propaganda organs have been established in Shanghai, Hankou, and other places, joined by propaganda organs from allied countries to strengthen their power. Is such an organization also necessary in the capital? Also, regarding the propaganda organizations in various provinces and cities, special cities and northern Jiangsu still have propaganda offices, while provincial governments only have sections, which seems to be an imbalanced development. Moreover, it seems necessary to unify the central and local propaganda administrations. What are your thoughts on this?

No Changes to the Propaganda Department's Structure for Now

(Answer) There will be no changes to the structure of the Propaganda Department for now. The establishment of new war propaganda organs must await instructions from the central government. As for close contact with the propaganda organs of allied countries, that is naturally not a problem. The abolition of propaganda offices and the establishment of sections in the provinces is one of the items in the provincial administration reform plan. If the central government reforms the administrative structures of various special cities and northern Jiangsu in the future, this issue can be submitted for discussion.

(Question) The national government's news policy has been decided long ago. Recently, the News Association was established. I wonder if the Propaganda Department has any plans to refresh newspapers in various places. Are there any considerations for merging major newspapers, prioritizing the allocation of newsprint, and adjusting personnel? In the past, the Propaganda Department issued propaganda guidelines for special news, which was quite effective. However, this was a temporary measure. It seems that regular propaganda guidance is also very important. I wonder if there is any consideration for this.

Propaganda Guidelines Issued at Any Time

(Answer) The Propaganda Department adopts a sound strategy for newspapers in various places and does not want to make any personnel changes lightly. As for the merger of newspapers, it arises from the problem of paper supply, but the circumstances of each newspaper are different. Forcing mergers is not something that can be accomplished overnight and requires detailed research to achieve perfection, so that each newspaper can make more progress and fulfill its responsibility of comprehensive reporting. Propaganda guidelines will be issued at any time according to the needs of the situation. As for guidance work, the department is now meticulously planning it, but it focuses on the guiding principles so that each newspaper can have the freedom to develop within the scope.

(Question) The number of magazines issued in various places is not small, but very few of the contents are suitable for wartime. They are either soft reading materials or publications with abusive tones. It seems necessary to correct this trend.

Magazine Rectification Proceeding Step by Step

(Answer) Magazine rectification will proceed step by step. We have already begun to conduct strict reviews of those applying for registration, and then we will further re-examine those who have already registered.

(Question) Under wartime conditions, winning the hearts of the people is undoubtedly the primary task. It seems that past propaganda organs have not achieved practical results in this regard. What specific policies will be implemented in the future?

(Answer) Winning the hearts of the people is, of course, a key point of propaganda administration. We will, of course, follow the instructions of the central government and do our best to achieve it.

(Question) Important national news is currently released by the Propaganda Department. In addition, for regular news from various agencies, some now send manuscripts directly, while others are forwarded by the Propaganda Department. News agencies and newspapers only seek the speed of news. Furthermore, holding regular meetings with reporters, where the highest authority of propaganda releases views on the current situation, or where reporters ask questions at any time and ask the vice ministers to answer, seems to be particularly beneficial to clarifying the truth. What is your opinion on this?

Centralized News Release

(Answer) Apart from the most important news being released by the department's wartime public reports, it should be handled centrally by the Central News Agency. Various departments should establish contact with the Central News Agency to seek speed. The Propaganda Department is an administrative organ and does not directly release manuscripts. When there are important matters, we will, of course, meet with reporters at any time. If there are any questions, they can be submitted in writing, and we will be happy to answer them.

### First Round of Affordable Rice Distribution; Committee Decides on Rice Collection and Payment Methods Starting Today

The affordable rice purchased by the city government has been successively shipped to Shanghai. In order to handle the inspection, acceptance, and distribution work, a special affordable rice committee has been organized to take charge. The committee held its second meeting yesterday (the 26th) to discuss implementation methods. It is reported that the key points of the decision are as follows:

(1) The first batch of 30,000 dan of affordable rice has already been fully shipped to Shanghai by the Rice Control Committee and delivered to the city government's storage warehouses. It is now stipulated that distribution will begin this afternoon. Please ask each household to obtain a rice collection form from the person in charge of the national entity of their respective units. Collect rice at the designated warehouse in accordance with the previously agreed-upon order.

(2) Please ask the police bureau to order all sub-bureaus to provide protection for the transportation of affordable rice along the way and to allow it to pass without inspection. The transportation certificate will be issued by the committee.

(3) The price of the second batch of 30,000 dan of affordable rice is set at 37,000 yuan per dan. The payment date is from today to March 2. It is hoped that all households under the respective units will pay attention.

(4) The payment for the second batch of rice must still be in cash. All payments will be collected by the Fuxing Bank on behalf. However, each household must first obtain a payment notice from the Fuxing Bank from their respective unit organizations before depositing it into the Fuxing Bank headquarters or branches. The locations are listed below:

Headquarters: 303 Henan Road.

Southern District Branch: Intersection of Taishan Road and Machang Road.

Western District Branch: 247 Yuyuan Road.

Northern District Branch: Inside the Central Market at the northern end of the New Garbage Bridge.

### Police Bureau Continues to Investigate Gambling Den Case; List of Arrested Employees and Gamblers Announced

In order to thoroughly refresh the city's appearance and wash away the poisonous atmosphere, the city police bureau is cracking down on all kinds of illegal businesses. The large gambling den at 147 Weihaiwei Road, the "Russian General Association," was also raided the night before. The den owner, Wang Maoting, and the manager, Han Huaqing (erroneously reported as Meng Qing in yesterday's newspaper), have been arrested one after another, and 174 employees and gamblers were arrested on the spot and will be investigated, and a large amount of gambling money, gambling equipment, and pledges were seized. It is now known that the bureau's third division investigation and trial section is continuing a meticulous investigation. Wang Maoting, a native of Zhenjiang, is 57 years old. He used to be a translator at the former French Concession Police Department and a university professor. The former Qiuyuan Club and Suzhou Hongyun Cafe were also opened by him. It was not until the end of the lunar year last year that he signed a contract with a Russian to invest in opening a gambling den at that location and gathered crowds to gamble.

### Security Command Destroys Extortion Gang; Dozens of Robberies in the City

The investigation team of the city's Security Command, in view of the frequent occurrence of theft and extortion by impersonating public officials in the city during air raids, team leader Gu Baolin ordered his subordinates to step up investigations. They received a tip that bandits Zhou Jinfang (also known as Zhou Xiaomao), Zhang Yuchang, and Chuan Aju were carrying six-inch and four-inch handguns, respectively, and were specializing in robbery in the city during air raids and darkness.

Zhang Yuchang and Chuan Aju were arrested at the entrance of the China Hotel, along with a four-inch handgun and eight bullets. They confessed to dozens of robberies in the city. The case has been submitted to the military law office for trial. According to another tip, Yan Yuming, a merchant from Nanhui, came to Shanghai to purchase goods and stayed in room 435 of the Great Shanghai Hotel. At about 12:00 a.m. on the 21st of this month, four hooligan youths, Yang Jie, Meng Guitao, Qu Jingen, and Yang Shiming, suddenly rushed into the room and claimed that Yan Yuming was a roving bandit who had killed people and had to be sent to the gendarmerie for strict handling. Under duress, Yan Yuming asked for leniency and paid 1.2 million yuan. Since there was a shortage of cash, two checks were written for 860,000 yuan, one appropriation slip for 240,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan in cash to resolve the matter. The team dispatched personnel to the Mainland, Great Shanghai, Southeast, and Xin hotels and arrested the principal offenders Meng Guitao, Yang Jie, and Yang Shiming. Qu Jingen fled and was not captured. Two checks for 860,000 yuan were seized. Later, the accomplices Lu Xilin, Sun Yunde, and Hu Jinji were arrested at the Tianjin Muyi Zhong Qian Zhuang, and one appropriation slip for 240,000 yuan was seized from Lu Xilin. All were taken back to the team. After interrogation, they confessed to the crime and have now been sent to the Ministry of Military Law Office for trial.

### Utilizing News Policies to Attempt to Threaten Chongqing; Minister Matsudaira Reveals Enemy American Conspiracy

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference yesterday. Minister Matsudaira delivered the following speech:

The New York Tribune published a commentary on February 22 regarding the Chongqing news censorship system, the main points of which were: recently, articles exposing the inside stories of the occupied areas have been increasing in foreign newspapers. This is because the Chongqing news censorship authorities are very strict in censoring news. In order to avoid censorship, foreign correspondents secretly send information directly to their home countries, resulting in the exposure of more inside stories of Chongqing. The responsibility for this should be borne by the Chongqing authorities.

Minister Matsudaira continued: Recently, American and Soviet newspapers and magazines have published more and more articles exposing the inside stories of Chongqing. This phenomenon is noteworthy. On February 13, ten Chinese-language newspapers in North and South America jointly published a statement commenting on Chongqing's policies. This statement criticizes the occupied government and can be asserted to have been directed by the American government. There is a background to it. The meaning of the statement can be divided into four points: (1) Chongqing should adopt American-style democracy; (2) Moderate Chinese nationalism; (3) Smoothly reject China's equal demands in the international arena; (4) Smoothly promote the strategy of using East Asians to control East Asians. All of these are pretenses by the American government to carry out its national news policies, with clever methods and dangerous intentions. The Chongqing authorities should be aware of the American side's conspiracy and deeply reflect, and must not follow its lead. It was also reported yesterday that thirteen newspapers in Chongqing had unanimously criticized this joint statement.
