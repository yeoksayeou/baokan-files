### Enemy Planes Attack Nagoya; Eight Shot Down; Okinawa Island Also Attacked the Day Before

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:00 PM on March 25th: From approximately 0:00 AM to 1:30 AM on the 25th, 130 enemy B-29 aircraft attacked the Nagoya area, using bombs and incendiary bombs to indiscriminately bomb urban areas, causing fires and damage throughout the city. The fires were extinguished by 4:50 AM. The results of the battle are currently under investigation.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands base, after massively bombing Nagoya City with hundreds of aircraft at dawn on the 19th, again launched a night attack on Nagoya at around 0:00 AM on the 25th with 130 aircraft. Before invading Japanese territory, the enemy aircraft first gathered over the southern sea, and then attacked. The officials and civilians fought bravely, and by approximately 4:50 AM, all fires were extinguished. By 2:00 AM, it was determined that eight aircraft had been shot down and several more damaged.

A Certain Base in the Southwest Pacific, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy mobile forces appeared again over the southern sea of the Japanese mainland on the 23rd. In the evening of that day, 250 carrier-based aircraft attacked Okinawa Island. At around 7:00 AM on the 24th, they attacked it again.

### Fierce Fighting Continues East of Manila

Luzon Front, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces east of Manila continue to fight. The fighting there is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy's 13th Division attempted to break through the Japanese lines but suffered heavy losses due to fierce resistance from the Japanese forces. In the month from February 21st to March 20th, excluding the damage since March 8th, the enemy suffered approximately 9,000 casualties, including two division commanders, and their morale is low. The commander of the enemy's 6th Division was seriously wounded by a Japanese commando raid near Montalban. Also, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Regiment was seriously wounded by a Japanese Miyazaki unit raid west of Antipolo. In addition, in the past month on the Manila eastern front, in addition to killing many enemy soldiers, the Japanese forces have achieved the following other results: destroying 54 artillery pieces, 7 tanks, 10 armored vehicles, 27 tractors, 12 machine guns, and other weapons, ammunition, and supplies; and capturing 8 machine guns, many rifles, and other items.

### Japanese Forces Complete Defensive Position Transfer in Lingayen Gulf

Luzon Front, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese forces in the Lingayen Gulf area have subsequently transferred their forces to new defensive positions in the eastern mountains according to plan. Therefore, the Japanese forces have completed the transfer without suffering any damage. Afterwards, the enemy actively constructed rear roads, and with a portion of their forces, centered on Baguio, they invaded the west, south, and southeast to a range of 20 to 25 kilometers, with the intention of invading the interior of the mountains. They are conducting reconnaissance on the Japanese forward positions or guard posts. Enemy forces in the San Fabian area are constructing artillery positions and shelling the vicinity of Baguio City with maximum range. On the Baguio mountain road, enemy forces are advancing towards Baguio from Rosario, and small units of both armies are engaged in fierce combat. The sound of gunfire shakes the mountains. Japanese troops are conducting night raids everywhere, thus opening the prelude to mountain warfare in the northern Luzon highlands, known as the "Roof of the Philippines". In response to this, enemy bombing of Baguio is also gradually intensifying. The beautiful city, formerly known as the Summer Capital, has been largely reduced to ruins by indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft.

### Japan's Manpower and Material Resources Remain Abundant; US Operations Increasingly Difficult - Speech by US Undersecretary of State Grew

According to a dispatch from New York, US Undersecretary of State Grew delivered a speech on the 1st of this month to the Foreign News Association in New York, explaining the difficulties of the war against Japan as follows:

Three years ago, after returning from Tokyo, I tried to inform the nation how strong Japan's war power was and how formidable the Japanese soldiers were as enemies. Judging from all the battles fought so far, the nation should have fully recognized what kind of enemy Japan is. The Battle of Tarawa informed us that the Japanese army is an army with unusual beliefs. In the Battle of Manila, the US military has also learned the same lesson. And in the Battle of Iwo Jima this time, the reason why the US military suffered such great losses was the result of the Japanese army's tenacious resistance.

Important Materials in Japanese Hands

Japan has now become a world power. Japan now controls important trade routes in East Asia, and the region is virtually isolated from the world. Japan has established its position in the region with the most abundant raw materials in the world, and the materials controlled by Japan are absolutely indispensable to the world economy. For example, Japan has controlled nine-tenths of the natural rubber production. At a time when the United States is suffering from a shortage of rubber, Japan is making good use of this valuable material. Other materials such as tin, which Japan now controls, account for 70% of the world's total production, and copra accounts for 83%. Due to the advance of the anti-Axis forces, it is true that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Japan to utilize these resources. However, even though the US military has now advanced to Iwo Jima, 1,200 kilometers from Tokyo, it has not weakened Japan's war power. Japan is still capable of increasing the production of aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons. Japan is currently able to produce more aircraft than the US military can destroy on the front lines. Even if the US military can block south of Taiwan, Japan can still be self-sufficient in important materials such as coal, aluminum, iron, and food. Japan has long prepared for a long-term war and has stored huge amounts of aviation fuel. It will be able to fight for at least two more years. In addition, the fact that the US supply lines are becoming longer and longer, while Japan's are relatively shorter, should not be ignored.

Japan's manpower is also quite abundant. Although Japan has now mobilized × million troops, it is still possible to immediately mobilize another × million strong men, and ×× million men aged seventeen to twenty can also be mobilized. Furthermore, Japan can obtain ××0,000 new recruits every year. The number of Japanese soldiers lost on the front lines has not reached this number, which is a clear fact. It is difficult to truly grasp the nature of the war against Japan without fully recognizing these facts.

US Ships Suffering from Shortage

In the Pacific War, the United States is deeply troubled by a shortage of ships. The shortage of ships has been a problem since the beginning of the war, but it is difficult to solve in the future. The biggest obstacle in the anti-Axis war is the lack of transportation. This shortage is particularly pronounced in the Pacific War, because there are also the two factors of time and distance. The number of ships required for the war against Japan is actually three times that of the war against Germany. Even in the battle on Iwo Jima, which is only a small dot on the map, the tonnage of ships mobilized by the US military was greater than the tonnage gathered in the North French landing operation. Landing on a Pacific island requires 16 tons of ships per American soldier in the first month, and 6 tons per month thereafter. To give a concrete example, the US forces that landed on Luzon up to a few days ago totaled 100,000, and the ships required for their supplies reached 1.6 million tons in the first 30 days. Assuming that the number of troops will not increase in the future, 600,000 tons of ships will still be needed in the next 30 days. Therefore, within two months after the start of the Luzon landing operation, the United States must have 2.2 million tons of ships. The 40,000 Marines who landed on Iwo Jima required 640,000 tons of ships in the first month and 240,000 tons in the second month, totaling 880,000 tons in two months. These two battles alone require the mobilization of 3.08 million tons of ships in the first 60 days, which accounts for 6% of the total of 50 million tons of anti-Axis ships. The above figures are based on estimates by Nimitz's command, but in reality, due to the increased speed and difficulty of Japanese attacks, the number of ships required will inevitably be even greater. Japan does not regard this war as a ten-year war, but is prepared to engage in a hundred-year war. Japan's greatest advantage is time. Japan hopes to use its vast resources under its control within a sufficient amount of time. We must destroy this plan, so we are taking the offensive simultaneously in the Pacific and Europe.

Commentary

### Report on Affordable Rice

— Chen Binhe

The affordable rice purchased by the city government has been distributed in two phases. I have participated in this matter, and I know the details of the handling process in detail. There may be criticisms from the outside world about this matter, so I am making a report to clarify the general situation.

The main significance of this affordable rice lies in (1) supplementing the deficiencies of general rationing and key rationing, and (2) curbing the rise in black market rice prices. The success of the handling is deeply attributed to the leadership of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, as well as the cooperation of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Allied Suzhou Military Headquarters, the local military headquarters, and the Rice Control Association. These should be thanked first. The Municipal Advisory Committee established a "Temporary Rice Purchase Committee" in the twelfth congress to handle this matter. On February 21st, a "Affordable Rice Committee" was established to handle the actual work of collecting rice, distributing rice, collecting funds, etc., and was responsible for promotion. The committee was organized by representatives from six units, including the municipal government, public welfare and charity circles, education circles, news and culture circles, factory circles, business circles, and banking circles.

When contacting affordable rice, several principles were agreed upon in advance: (1) The target of selling affordable rice is limited to workers in various industries and low-paid classes. (2) Full cash payment is required, because the Rice Control Association must collect rice with cash. (3) It is agreed that the rice payment will be paid by the employees of each rice-receiving household, and no government agency or bank can advance the payment. The determination of points (2) and (3) at that time was meaningful. Outsiders who do not know the truth and have doubts and criticisms about this should explain it here.

The payment date for the first phase was set at the end of the last lunar year, and the cash payment was cleared. It was hoped that after a batch of rice arrived at the end of the year, it would be supplied to those in need, so that the black market rice would not be raised. However, in general, the industrial and commercial sectors did not feel interested in this, because the black market rice price at that time was not much different from the affordable rice price, only 20% off, and there was also a fear of trouble. Therefore, the payment was postponed and the scheduled date could not be fulfilled. This is a violation of the promised obligations on our part, which almost affected the abolition of the second phase of affordable rice. This gave us a great lesson. We must be swift and punctual, and we must never take a wait-and-see attitude. The eyes of these onlookers only see that the difference between the affordable rice price and the black market rice price is only 20% off, and only see the small side. They did not notice that this batch of affordable rice can reduce the extent of the black market rice price increase no matter what, and can stabilize people's hearts. They did not see the big side. By the second phase, because of the delay and breach of contract in the first phase, which could not be trusted, the payment date was extremely short, and it was fortunate that the payment could be made on schedule.

As for the distribution quantity, it is stipulated that each sector will get a certain number of units, which is roughly determined according to the number of people in each sector. Of course, it is not ideal. However, the original intention at that time was that the low-paid classes would receive practical benefits, which would be considered as the goal achieved. Naturally, it is impossible to be as average as household rice. For example, the news and culture sector has a total of 50 units (the smallest number in each sector), of which 10 units are allocated to news practitioners, 1 unit to magazines and periodicals, 1 unit to employees of small newspapers, 10 units to the medical profession, 10 units to newspaper vendors, 1 unit to writers, 10 units to printing workers, 4 units to drama practitioners, and 3 units to film practitioners. The number of newspaper vendors is less than the number of news practitioners, and the salaries of news practitioners are higher than those of newspaper vendors. In order to suit the principle that low-level employees receive practical benefits, it is stipulated that news practitioners and newspaper vendors have the same 10 units. This is an example.

Therefore, in order to suit this principle, it is hoped that all sectors will pay attention that any rice-receiving household should allow low-level employees to enjoy the right to purchase, and must not be purchased by the company, factory or any organization (except for public welfare and charitable organizations) itself. Assuming that the company or factory is assigned 10 shi of rice, that is, the company or factory itself buys it and gives it to the employees for meals, it is still unreasonable. The decision must be that all the rice assigned is transferred to the employees, and no part of it can be retained to reduce the rights of each person. It is rumored that a small number of rice-receiving households did not distribute the rice to low-level employees after it was assigned. We believe that this is extremely unreasonable and should be remedied immediately to conform to the original intention of affordable rice. Otherwise, it should be reported and sanctioned by law.

In the process of the two phases of rice that have been received, there are two points that can be gratifying. First, the amount of rice is sufficient, and perhaps there is a slight shortage, but it is only temporarily stolen on the road. Second, the general quality of the rice is very good, and the number of brown rice is very small. In fact, in the current environment, it is good to have rice, and it is not possible to talk about whether it is coarse or not. The cooperation of the Rice Control Association should be thanked.

Finally, some people have raised that after affordable rice was available, the black market rice price did not fall but rose instead. We believe that the reduction of the black market rice price is only one of the conditions with affordable rice. The most basic conditions are (1) the general rationed rice must be on time and in quantity. (2) The source of rice must be unblocked. If these two points are not achieved, there is only one condition of affordable rice, and naturally it is impossible to achieve a comprehensive reduction. However, further speaking, if there is no affordable rice, perhaps the black market rice price will be higher. Therefore, the cooperation of the military headquarters and the efforts of those who handle affordable rice can be said to be not in vain.

### The Election System Restored in Party Branches at All Levels to Strengthen Party Affairs and Lead the People

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Wu Lanxi, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters, met with reporters yesterday and made the following remarks: Since last year, the central and local party branches have recognized the urgent need to strengthen the Kuomintang's work. Opinions from all parties on this matter can be summarized into three points: first, to strengthen centralization; second, to adjust personnel; and third, to change the organization. After discussion, it was decided to restore the system prior to the incident. Chen Daizhu proposed additional considerations based on this point, and it was then decided to restore the election system. The restoration of elections has three meanings: (1) To clean up party membership. Elections require investigating the number of party members, which will clarify the actual situation of party member segments. (2) To reorganize the organizational system. Elections must go through legal procedures, which represent the hierarchical structure of the party branch organization. This will further reorganize the party branch organization and produce outstanding party members. As a principle, party branch staff should be local people. The electoral units this time include the Central China region: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Huaihai, Nanjing, Shanghai, as well as the Jiangxi, Hubei, and Northern Jiangsu Party Affairs Guidance Committees, and the Hankou Special Municipal Party Branch. The election in each unit of Central China is scheduled to be completed before May 15. Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hankou will complete the election two months after the election documents arrive. In South China, there is a sound Guangdong Provincial Party Branch, but it will depend on the circumstances due to transportation. In North China, there are Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Tianjin, and Beiping. Due to the special circumstances, the central government will handle them separately depending on the situation. The central government has already issued the outline of the election, and party branches at all levels are paying attention to handling these procedures. Originally, during the period of political tutelage, the Kuomintang's work was to represent the people. When the period of constitutional government is implemented, political power will be returned to the people. In this extraordinary period, there is an urgent need for a strong and capable organization to lead the people. From the party's perspective, this is equivalent to having more help. Therefore, from the Kuomintang's standpoint, it has high expectations for the wartime people's representative conferences of various provinces and cities being held in Nanjing. In the future, the Kuomintang will work hard to strengthen its work from its own position so as to further assume the heavy responsibility of leadership.

### 50 Million Yuan in Relief Bonds Underwritten by Individuals; Li Sihao and Others Invite People from All Walks of Life to Discuss Methods

Of the 1.5 billion yuan in relief bonds recently issued by the municipal government, 1 billion yuan was entrusted to the Central Reserve Bank for overall underwriting, and 500 million yuan was underwritten by the public. Of this, 450 million yuan was underwritten by various industry associations according to their levels, and 50 million yuan was underwritten by people from all walks of life. Li Sihao, Jin Xiongbo, Chen Binhe, and others were responsible for inviting people from all walks of life to discuss underwriting methods. A tea party was held at 4:00 PM on the 24th in the municipal government auditorium, inviting the following personnel to attend and discuss.

Invited Units: You Jusheng, Sheng Youcai, Zhang Rongchu, Shao Shijun, Wu Tongwen, Zhu Miaosheng, Zhou Jifu, Zhou Wenduan, Dong Hefu, Zhan Peilin, Xu Datong, Shen Jinzhou, Bao Guochang, Jiang Shangda, Gong Xingwu, Dai Gengxin, Liao Houqing, Tang Xinghai, Cheng Nianpeng, Wang Houfu, Shen Jiashi, Luo Hongyi, Lan Bason, Wu Guozhang, Lu Bingfu, Yan Qingxiang, Cheng Yong'an, Xu Mao, Shi Zhifu, Xu Xiangsun, Zhang Lanping, Wu Zhiwei, Wu Ruiyuan, Bian Ruifeng, Lin Zhaopin, Hu Guigeng, Rao Taoshu, Guo Linshuang, Shao Changchun, Xu Shun'en, Zhu Shunlin, Cai Shengbai, Chen Bofan, Bei Runsheng, Pan Zhiquan, Xu Busun, Zhao Shenying, Zhou Zongliang, Tan Jing, Huang Zhendong, Zhang Ruitang, Xu Wenzhao, Le Rucheng, Xu Changchun.

Attendees: Those who attended on time, notified in advance, or replied by letter included: Liao Youyi, Zhan Peilin, Shen Jinzhou, Bao Guochang, Liao Houqing, Cheng Nianpeng, Luo Hongyi, Zhang Ruitang, Xu Changchun, Gong Xingwu, Zhu Shunlin, Wu Yong'an, Xu Maotang, Wu Zhiwei, Wu Ruiyuan, Guo Linshuang, Xu Busun, Zhou Zongliang, Huang Zhendong, etc.

Meeting Proceedings: Li Sihao first explained the meaning of convening the tea party and expressed the hope that people from all walks of life would actively underwrite. Jin Xiongbo then reported on the use of the bonds: 1 billion yuan to make up for the deficit of past household rice, 200 million yuan for air defense and relief funds, 200 million yuan for population dispersal funds, and 100 million yuan for special security funds. He also explained that this proposal was decided during the tenure of former Mayor Chen, and now it is received at 96%, with a 1.5% handling fee deducted. The funds will be submitted to the Fuxing Bank for collection by the end of the month. This matter concerns social welfare, and it is hoped that everyone will actively underwrite. Chen Binhe then spoke, stating: Mayor Zhou mentioned "public interest is more important than private interest, society comes before the individual" in his letter to the citizens. The general public should pay attention to this, especially the social leadership, who should especially experience it. Shanghai has many people with economic strength or windfall profits who are usually indifferent to national and social welfare undertakings. In the past, under the protection of foreigners in the concession era, they could escape punishment. But now the times and environment are completely different, especially in this extraordinary period. We hope that these people will change their mentality, pay attention to national and social welfare undertakings, and assume their family and social responsibilities. This time, the municipal government issued relief bonds entirely for the benefit of the citizens, and it is hoped that everyone will actively underwrite. If they still maintain the past attitude of ignoring public welfare, they will inevitably be subject to unanimous social criticism and public condemnation. For example, many of those invited today neither attended, nor delegated representatives, nor replied in writing, which is already inappropriate in terms of personal etiquette, let alone for social welfare. We deeply regret this attitude. But we still stand on a loyal advisory position, hoping that they will wake up from now on.

Underwriting Situation: The attendees then discussed the underwriting methods and decided to notify each person on the invitation list to underwrite at least 500,000 to 2 million yuan. If there are people with economic strength outside the list who are capable of undertaking this, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will nominate them so that social welfare undertakings can be undertaken equally by the powerful members of society.

### Regulations on Fulfillment Points for Various Industries' Subscription to Relief Bonds

Regarding the Municipal Advisory Committee's suggestion to issue temporary relief bonds for the 34th year of the Republic, which was approved, a person in charge of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce said: Although there were announcements in the newspapers yesterday, many details were not detailed enough, and it is feared that various industry associations may not fully understand. Therefore, in addition to the fact that this association will consult with the Economic Bureau to separately stipulate the subscription levels and quantities for each association, and should immediately instruct each industry to comply, it is also hoped that each industry should fulfill the following three points:

(A) The deadline for payment is the end of this month.

(B) Those who pay before the end of this month will be given a handling fee of 1.5% in addition to paying at 96%, that is, a handling fee of 15 yuan will be given for every 1,000 yuan of the solicited amount to show excellence. The handling fee will be deducted when the fundraising is fully paid.

(C) The payment location is the Fuxing Bank in this city.

### Regulations on Loss Reporting Methods for Money Shop Remittance Orders

The Money Shop Association of this city, in view of the fact that remittance orders, which are as solemn as money shop bank notes, are often reported lost under false pretenses, requesting payment to be stopped, thereby affecting the circulation of negotiable instruments, in order to eliminate long-standing abuses and prevent future occurrences, added an item to Article 46 of the industry regulations, stipulating that the method of reporting loss and stopping payment of remittance orders should be handled in accordance with bank notes, requiring the issuing shop to send the funds to the association for safekeeping, emphasizing credibility, and preventing the abuse of easy loss reports. Since this matter was discussed and handled, many shops have complied with and implemented it, and will never lightly comply with customers' requests for accommodation. The association deeply agrees with this move and hopes that all member shops will be able to comply, so that the credit of negotiable instruments among money shops will increase day by day.

### Meticulous Investigation of Husband Murder Case Underway

In the tragic case of Zhan Zhou murdering her husband Zhan Yunying, the murderer was captured on the spot, and the coroner confirmed that the deceased was indeed killed with a kitchen knife and dismembered into more than ten pieces, which were put into a gray leather suitcase in an attempt to destroy the evidence. The deceased has been sent to the Pushan Villa for burial. The murderer and suspect have been interrogated by the prosecutor's office once, and the police bureau's application for continued investigation for two weeks has been approved. It is reported that the new Chenfen Police Station, which is handling the case, arrested the murderer's lover, He Xianhui (He Damazi), a few days ago. The suspects have not yet made a definite confession, and the detective Wang Zhengwei is meticulously investigating and collecting evidence. In recent days, some idle people have spread rumors that the murderer Zhan Zhou will be paraded through the streets as a warning, which is completely unfounded. The authorities hope that the public will not believe the rumors and cause unnecessary disturbances. Once the authorities have completed the investigation, they can make a public announcement.

Also, after the case occurred, many people rushed to the scene to inquire. A few days ago, a gangster named Zhang Tianbao impersonated a public official and entangled the landlord Wang Bianyang at the scene, attempting to intimidate and extort money. His impersonation was recognized by detectives, and Zhang was taken to the station for interrogation. It is reported that Zhang Tianbao has committed multiple cases of impersonating public officials to intimidate and extort money and is currently under investigation.

This adjustment plan is being submitted to the municipal government for approval.

### Obligatory Elementary School Actively Prepares; Scheduled to Open on April 1st; Hoping that Baojia (Neighborhood Watch) Will Inform Out-of-School Children to Register

The obligatory elementary school is progressing with preparations, relying on the enthusiastic assistance of all parties, and is progressing smoothly. The two matters of borrowing school buildings and selecting teachers have been decided, and the textbooks used by the students have also been donated by various circles, and continue to be collected from all parties. As for the funding, the start-up expenses have been donated 1 million yuan by the charity market, so there is no problem. Although the recurring expenses have been supported by readers who have successively contributed to the "Obligatory School Fund," judging from the results of one week, the most enthusiastic donors are limited to the scope of the students of each school, and most of them are elementary school students and poor students. This phenomenon on the one hand shows the purest sympathy, and on the other hand proves that it has not yet aroused a general response from all walks of life. We sincerely appeal to all readers, especially those with resources who are familiar with education, to come forward and support. Now we are preparing to open school on April 1st, and we must start recruiting students tomorrow or the day after. We run obligatory education, of course, hoping to give the opportunity of obligatory education to every out-of-school child. Although at present we can only run ten schools due to various environmental reasons, we consider that the parents of out-of-school children may not see the newspaper and do not know that there is an obligatory school. Therefore, in order to ensure that out-of-school children do not miss the opportunity, we request the assistance of the baojia (neighborhood watch). For example, if there are out-of-school children in households near the obligatory school, the baojia can inform them and instruct them to register at the school. On the one hand, the Shen Bao Obligatory Education Committee will send a letter to the chief lianzhang (chief neighborhood watch leader) to request assistance.

### Elementary School Students Sympathize with Elementary School Students

All the students of the third grade of the Ningbo Shanghai Alumni Association Sixth Elementary School wrote to say: "When we were in class, we heard Mr. Jiren tell us that your newspaper is founding an obligatory elementary school for many children who cannot study because of poverty, and launched the "Obligatory School Fund" movement, and many children have responded. We were very moved when we heard this, and now we have collected 5,000 yuan, please include it under the "Obligatory School Fund" item. And we hope that all the children in the city will unite and respond to this meaningful movement, and that way, children who have no books to read will have the opportunity to study."

### Nanshi Civilian Hospital: Free Tuberculosis Examination

If your office introduces middle and elementary school teachers and poor patients to the hospital for examination, they will be allowed to do so free of charge, limited to five people per day, to promote and do our best."

### Rice in Zhenru

— Xi Jia

Zhenru is located in the northwest corner of Shanghai's urban area, bordering Jiading to the west and connecting to Laoshan to the north. It is the first stop on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway departing from Shanghai. The Taoshupu River runs north-south, allowing civilian boats to reach the Yangtze River and Suzhou Creek. Highways are also well-connected, reaching various nearby locations. Before the war, National Jinan University was located opposite the station, its architecture extremely magnificent. The Zhengfeng College of Arts and the Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station were also located here, and the residences of important figures and Western-style houses were numerous, so it attracted quite a bit of attention.

The Procession of Rice

From Caojiadu Bridge, a wide and flat road stretches northwest, extending straight through Zhenru to Nanxiang. Nanxiang is a large distribution center for rice and grains, with over a hundred rice shops there. Every day, five to six hundred people from Shanghai go there to buy rice, almost all of them men. Only a small number of these men walk and carry it on their shoulders; about eight out of ten ride bicycles. According to a precise estimate by a resident of Zhenru, at most times, up to five hundred bicycles pass through here. On this road, bicycles come and go in a continuous stream, some ridden by laborers, some by merchants, some by students, and occasionally dotted with green-uniformed postmen. Those heading north sped lightly, while those coming from the south had two large sacks heavily loaded behind their bikes, with a Western flour sack pressed on top. Some even carried a Western flour sack on the front handlebars. Their highest record was three *shi* (approximately 300 pounds). Rice thus flowed into every alley in Shanghai.

A Variety of Livelihoods

Zhenru's main product is vegetables. Every grocery store in Zhenru sells vegetable seeds: amaranth seeds, chive seeds, rapeseed seeds, artemisia seeds, scallion seeds, everything is available. In Xiaoli, there is also the Zhenru branch of the Shanghai Central Market, which opens at 2 PM every day, and its prices differ from those of the main market. These days, because of the warm weather and abundant rainfall, vegetables grow extremely quickly. Purchase prices have had to plummet. Cabbage only sells for 220 (currency not specified), and spinach has fallen even lower to 130. The Caojiadu vegetable market and the residents of Shanghai's northwest corner mostly get their vegetables from here. Its rich output can be imagined.

There is also a temporary rice market. At a glance, there are more than a hundred stalls, and the crowd is amazing! Most of the rice merchants from Shanghai who live nearby come here to buy rice. The rice merchants of Zhenru, who buy from Nanxiang, also mostly sell it here. Originally, there were six or seven large rice shops in Zhenru, but there were too many problems, so they closed their shops and set up rice stalls instead. This definitely reduced a lot of hassle and saved a lot of expenses.

About two *li* northwest of Zhenru Station is Yangjia Bridge. This is an important route for passing through Shanghai and Nanxiang, making it a good place for rice merchants to grab a bite. Small restaurants, noodle shops, griddle cake stalls, and dumpling shops stand one after another, all bustling with activity, and seats are always full. Several places selling Shandong steamed buns are doing especially well. Although each one sells for 200 (currency not specified), they are still snatched up by the steamer-full. It is estimated that such eateries account for eight-tenths of all the shops in the town, more than forty in total!

In Yangjia Bridge, there is a small flour mill called "Shenfeng," which has been established for almost two years. It operates day and night, producing more than three hundred bags a day. However, due to electricity restrictions, it can only operate for one day and then stop for two days. This naturally leads to a situation of supply falling short of demand. Many master bakers from the city's pancake stalls, griddle cake stalls, and noodle shops come here to buy one or two bags when flour is cheap. Now, because wheat is expensive, and more flour from Suzhou and Wuxi is arriving in Shanghai, business is not as good.

After deducting the check issued on March 20 for 200,000 (currency not specified), the net balance is 130,647 (currency not specified) and 14 *fen*.
