### Fierce Fighting in Southern Okinawa; Japanese Defenders Launch Courageous Counterattacks, Inflicting Over 60,000 Enemy Casualties Since Landing

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – American forces on Okinawa Island, having extended their troop strength, now occupy a battle line of just over ten kilometers, deploying eight divisions. The attack front of a single division is less than two kilometers. With such formidable strength, the enemy continues to launch stubborn attacks against the Japanese defensive positions. In response, the entire Japanese garrison is carrying out courageous special attacks, gradually infiltrating the enemy’s lines. The situation on the southern battlefront is becoming increasingly severe with each passing moment. On May 30th, the enemy, having advanced from Naha and Shuri, breached the Inafuku line, three kilometers south of Yonabaru. Subsequently, by June 1st, the focus of their attacks shifted from the east coast to the Naha-Shuri area, concentrating on the central sector. Under the cover of naval artillery fire, they attempted to break through the Japanese outer perimeter, launching a relentless offensive centered on Naha and Shuri. Amidst the courageous and fierce counterattacks by Japanese forces, the enemy is inching into Japanese positions. As of June 1st, the line of confrontation stretched from the south of Naha-Shuri to the arc of Inafuku. Since the enemy landing, the Japanese garrison has fought bravely and fiercely, launching attacks against the enemy from the land, sea, and air, inflicting over 60,000 casualties, striking fear into the enemy's hearts. Japanese losses are also steadily increasing, but in the deep defensive positions south of Shuri and Naha, Japanese forces are putting up a fierce fight, yielding significant results.

### Over One Million American Casualties in the Past Three Years and Five Months

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 1st, American casualties have exceeded one million in the past three years and five months, including 890,019 army personnel and 112,868 navy personnel, totaling 1,002,887. It was also stated that this number is an increase of 6,798 compared to the previous week. America has always regarded the depletion of human resources as its greatest weakness in combat effectiveness. Since entering the war, the United States has re-calculated the casualty figures before releasing them. According to reliable Japanese calculations, American casualties had already exceeded one million by January of this year, but the United States is only now announcing that casualties have exceeded one million. This is because the United States is trying to conceal the depletion of manpower and the number of wounded, calculating only based on the number of people sent back to their home country or rear bases. However, the point that casualties increased by 6,798 in the past week is particularly noteworthy, as the European war has ended. Therefore, the number of casualties must have occurred entirely in the Pacific theater. Even with the American-discounted numbers, the situation in the Pacific is worthy of serious consideration.

President Truman delivered a message to Congress on May 1st, stating that American army and navy casualties in the Okinawa area from March 15th to May 29th totaled 37,925. Even with this figure alone, it is rare in the history of world war. The head of the US Manpower Resources Bureau, Paul V. McNutt, also stated that "the end of the war will be prolonged." One naval observer said, "The success of the Japanese kamikaze attacks in Okinawa is like the German U-boat offensive of 1942 for the Pacific Fleet Command." Also, Admiral Spruance, commander of the Fifth Fleet, stated that the US Navy suffered unprecedented losses in the Okinawa campaign.

President Truman also declared that the United States would double its military strength within one year, totaling seven million men. This is also deceptive talk, as a large army of seven million can never be transferred to the front line, and there is no base capable of accommodating seven million people. Presumably, the majority of them are scattered throughout the Pacific in places like Hawaii and New Guinea, with probably only a fraction being direct combatants. So why is Truman exaggerating his propaganda so much? Perhaps it is a sedative before announcing the news of over one million casualties. Furthermore, even if there are seven million troops stationed in the Pacific, it is not a critical element in determining the outcome of the war. If the United States loses 2 million combat effective personnel, it will be beyond saving. The war situation is becoming increasingly critical today. The U.S. Navy has suffered unprecedented heavy losses in the Okinawa campaign. Further attempts to advance bases toward the Japanese mainland will require more powerful firepower positions and larger forces than at present, but this will only allow Japanese special attack units to be even more active, and American casualties will inevitably increase daily. With this American announcement of over one million casualties, combined with the current Pacific war situation, it is foreseeable that the American combat capability will soon pass its peak and decline.

Washington, 4th (Central News Agency) – The San Francisco Conference, which was originally scheduled to conclude on June 6th, has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. The White House stated on the 3rd that the secretariat of the conference has notified President Truman of this matter.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to news from San Francisco: the Soviet government abruptly recalled Sobolov, its chief representative at San Francisco, causing conference participants to be surprised.

### Food Problem and Social Psychology

Yesterday, the *Continental Daily News*'s editorial, titled "Inverted and Disordered Social Psychology," discussed the reasons for the recent surge in rice and commodity prices, attributing it to the effect of inverted and disordered social psychology. The formation of this psychology is half due to a lack of understanding and half due to the failure of economic policies. Therefore, to correct this psychology, it is necessary to first consider improving economic policies.

We believe that the *Continental Daily News*'s viewpoint is quite accurate and insightful in its observation of the issue. However, the formation of an inverted and disordered social psychology needs to be supplemented with several points:

First, the public constantly has a sense of anxiety about life because they are unable to obtain the supplies that have already been allocated by the authorities. The prices of essential commodities rise constantly and without end, so there is no psychological certainty that one will be able to obtain essential commodities in the future.

Second, most profiteers only seek personal wealth and only know how to hoard and speculate. Food has also become a target for those seeking exorbitant profits, who seize opportunities to hoard and manipulate prices. For example, although the soaring rice prices this time should not have risen to such a degree, some of the reason may be attributed to hoarding. However, the prices of ordinary coarse grains have also risen to high level, which is suspected to be due to large-scale hoarding and manipulation by powerful individuals behind the scenes. At the same time, most people with wealth are competing to purchase and store goods, exceeding the amount needed in the short term, with the attitude of "as long as I can solve it, even if prices rise higher, it will not affect me."

Third, the general public believes that the Chinese authorities in charge of economic control, especially food control, seem to have reached a point of helplessness, and seem to lack the courage to have frank and thorough discussions with Allied authorities in order to obtain solutions and overcome difficulties.

Fourth, at the same time, the general public believes that, while the Japanese authorities are extremely concerned about the livelihood of the Chinese people, they have not yet fully understood the true nature of the practical difficulties of the people, especially the current food problem, its urgency and severity, and have not anticipated the crisis.

This time, rice prices have repeatedly soared for more than a week, and to this day, there are still no more effective countermeasures and emergency measures. Under these circumstances, how can the psychology of the public not become inverted and disordered?

However, we have already made suggestions for emergency food relief measures in our editorial on the second of this month. These are worth repeating, such as:

We suggest that the authorities promptly approach the Allied military for grain allocation. This is the most effective and realistic countermeasure. Has the government contacted them to borrow? Have the Allied authorities agreed to lend? From our observations in civil society, the success or failure of this suggestion seems to be resolvable within three or four days.

We suggest that the authorities purchase coarse grains from Huaihai Province and transport them to Shanghai for distribution. This is another thing that should be done without hesitation. Have the authorities made contact? To what extent has contact been made? Did the authorities make contact or did civil society make contact?

We suggest strictly prohibiting price increases for coarse grains, because there are reasons for the soaring rice prices, but the proportional rise in coarse grain prices is due solely to opportunistically seeking exorbitant profits. Do the authorities have measures to curb this? Why not implement reasonable purchases and distribution immediately?

Has the food control mechanism and the food purchase methods been reasonable in the past experiences? Have the Chinese and Japanese authorities jointly reviewed them? If they are considered reasonable, why is the price of food rising so crazily? If the Chinese and Japanese authorities see that the purchasing methods are unreasonable, then why don't the Chinese and Japanese authorities frankly discuss ways to improve them for the benefit of both military needs and the people's livelihood? If the Chinese authorities have already seen this and do not offer it up, taking a hands-off attitude, then the Chinese authorities are derelict in their duties. At the same time, we hope that the Allied authorities must recognize that the food problem of the Chinese people has reached its most serious point, and should deeply investigate the causes and reflect on the unsuitability of past purchasing methods. We firmly believe that the Allied forces are confident of achieving victory in the military field, and all preparations are thorough and sound, but have they considered to what extent the collapse of the Chinese national economy will hinder them militarily? This must be given serious consideration. The seriousness of the current food problem is the crisis of the national economy, and should not be taken lightly under any circumstances.

We firmly believe that as long as the strength of the Chinese authorities, the strength of the Allied authorities in China, and the strength of civil leadership are united, all difficulties can be overcome. Under this belief, the food problem can naturally be resolved quickly. However, these three forces are currently disconnected from each other, thus forming the phenomenon of inverted and disordered social psychology, and all urgent practical problems cannot be resolved quickly.

### Inverted and Disordered Social Psychology

The continuous rise of rice prices and the subsequent soaring of various commodity prices is a well-known fact. Quietly observing the situation, what we first feel is the close relationship between commodity prices and the psychology of the people.

Half of the reason for the high price of rice lies in the psychological effect of the people. The obstruction of rice sources and the pessimistic prediction of the future of purchases can indeed promote the soaring of real rice prices. However, observing other commodity prices, the situation can be said to be the same. This pessimistic prediction may not be appropriate, which anyone who is familiar with the real situation can understand. The public suffers from their own lives by being frightened by self-constructed illusions. We have discovered the pitiable social psychology of inversion and disorder.

Calmly observing, food and various supplies may not be so difficult. The existing materials may not be abundant, but it may not be difficult to meet the needs of Shanghai, Nanjing, and other cities, depending on the method. The idea that if you do not quickly search and hoard now, you will not be able to buy it in the future is obviously a misconception of the people. The public themselves are trapped in hardship because of this misconception, which is a ridiculous phenomenon. Unscrupulous merchants and speculators seize this opportunity, use the psychology of the public to seek illegitimate profits, which is indeed hateful, and the public's own suffering from this psychology is an even more pitiful phenomenon.

In order to solve the real problems of commodity prices and food, this inverted and disordered social psychology must be corrected. However, this psychology is not formed overnight, but is produced by certain economic conditions. This point must be recognized first. No matter how powerful the enemy's propaganda is, if there are no supporting facts, its effect will be very small. If we view the changes in the current social psychology as being related to this kind of propaganda, then we must also reflect on whether we have given the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of their propaganda. Therefore, in any case, we must fundamentally review the economic conditions, and especially the issue of the comprehensive transformation of purchase and distribution institutions, must be brought up for discussion.

We need to deeply investigate the Chinese social psychology expressed in today's commodity price problem. Half of the inverted and disordered psychology stems from misunderstandings, lack of knowledge, enemy propaganda, etc., and half is due to the failure of various economic policies, making this kind of fear and disorder an unavoidable fact. We must frankly admit this fact, and push the work of economic reconstruction. If we want to reform social psychology, we must first eliminate the economic and social conditions that cause it. We are now merely shouting loudly in response to the psychology of the public. To correct this inverted and disordered psychology, we must deeply consider the true improvement of economic policies.

### Impressions of Northern Jiangsu

— Huang

This reporter went to Northern Jiangsu for about a month. The counties and districts visited included Dongtai County, Xinghua County, Jiangdu County, and Angjian and Dazhong Towns. Other places such as Gaoyou, Xinghua, Tongzhou, Rugao, Haimen, and Jingjiang were not visited due to time constraints, so a complete picture of Northern Jiangsu could not be obtained. This article only expresses the reporter's impressions of the places visited, for the reader's consideration.

The greatest suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu currently is the cumulative levy and unrestrained collection of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, placing a heavy burden on them. Taking Dongtai County as an example, after a large-scale "invitation to the God of Wealth" by a certain stationed army last autumn, most of those with assets in the urban area fled. The situation in Anfeng Town, under the county's jurisdiction, was even more tragic, with even small traders and petty merchants being swept up. At that time, among the 33 Bao (unit of household registration) residents in the entire town, only two elderly men in their sixties, one surnamed Qian and one surnamed Zhou, one sick and one disabled, were spared. Every household was closed, and even buying sesame cakes and fried dough sticks was impossible. The district chief of the area also took advantage of the troop transfer to abscond with the funds, leaving the district government without anyone responsible for two months. When this reporter interviewed the residents in the town, everyone spoke with fear, gnashing their teeth. It was not until the Lunar New Year last year that residents gradually returned home from neighboring counties and districts. After this great calamity, how should the authorities be considerate of the people, allowing them to recuperate and recover? Since March and April of this year, the burden on the people of the county has become increasingly heavy, with no avenue to air grievances. When this reporter was stationed in the county, it coincided with the undertaking of borrowing 20,000 Shi of military rice. Before this task was completed, another order to raise military grain (referring to both rice and wheat) of 20,000 Shi was issued. The former was allocated to each household and Mu (unit of area) according to the Baojia (household registration) system, dividing the area into districts and towns. The latter designated wealthy households and large shops to purchase grain coupons for collection, allocating 70 Shi for large households, 50 Shi for medium households, and 30 Shi for small households, with wheat accounting for 70% and rice accounting for 30%.

The Dongtai County government sent bailiffs to deliver notices, giving a three-day deadline for delivery. The first batch of notified households numbered 80, and the second batch numbered 96. This only applies to the urban area, and other townships are not included. Those in power easily issue orders, unaware that those below use this as an opportunity for personal gain. The county's grain prices, stimulated by this excessive purchase, have seen a significant surge, and the people are filled with sorrow and resentment, pacing restlessly in their homes.

Poor Military Discipline

The stationed troops in various counties in Northern Jiangsu mostly adopt a defense zone system. Superficially, it seems that there is unified leadership, but in reality, they each govern themselves. In each county, the stationed troops range from a division to a brigade. Even the garrison troops in a township are often at least a battalion or regiment. Combined with the original security teams of each county, their strength can be described as considerable. However, because defense zones vary in wealth and stationed troops vary in quality, the situations in different places are often different, so one cannot compare one case to another. In addition, the different management and treatment methods of the troop commanders also affect the quality of military discipline, which cannot be generalized. Generally, in a certain area, if there are more unmarried officers and soldiers and fewer who bring their families, their own burden of expenses will be lighter, and their demand for local exactions will be better. Conversely, in a certain area, if there are more officers and soldiers who bring their families, their own salaries will definitely not be enough to cover their expenses, so local exactions are unavoidable, such as forcibly occupying civilian housing, commandeering furniture, collecting donations, and raising funds locally. Frankly speaking, with today's high cost of living, the salary of each soldier is definitely not enough to maintain their personal life. Even virtuous senior officers cannot prevent their actions from going astray. Good and weak people only seek peace and tranquility, how dare they file complaints everywhere and become enemies with the stationed troops? For example, when the reporter traveled from Taixing County to Yangzhou on May 13th, departing from Qingdun in a charcoal-powered small car, after traveling about 18 Li (unit of distance) and arriving at Jiegou, they suddenly encountered the stationed troops "sealing troops"—that is, requisitioning vehicles for military use. Soldiers, armed with guns and commanded by a company commander, forced everyone traveling in the cars to get out. In a short time, more than five vehicles were "sealed", and over fifty passengers were forced to disembark. The travelers, unable to advance or retreat, held their already paid car tickets and asked the company commander for a solution, but he simply replied, "There is no solution," and waved to the drivers to drive away. Some people are puzzled: If military requisition of vehicles is necessary, Taixing County can "seal", Yangzhou can "seal", but why not "seal" there, and instead intercept in the middle of the journey and call it "sealing cars", trapping people in a situation where they have paid the fare but have no special permission.

Eager for Governance

In conclusion, the people of various counties in Northern Jiangsu have long been living in deep water and scorching fire. Since the Director of Pacification, General Sun Liangcheng, has been stationed in Yangzhou, all parties have placed high hopes on him. However, given the complexity of the environment in Northern Jiangsu, the recovery from the decline of the people's livelihood cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Fortunately, "a hungry person is easily satisfied with food, and a thirsty person is easily satisfied with drink." After a major illness, if the people can receive proper care and attention to balanced nutrition, recovery is not difficult. In short, if Northern Jiangsu today can first start by reducing the burden on the people and rectifying military discipline, fulfilling every word and acting decisively, then Northern Jiangsu three months from now will surely have all the haze swept away and bright flowers blooming everywhere, which can be predicted.

### Cotton Production Increase Agreement Council Hastens to Close

### Denmark Values Freedom and Opposes Changing Borders

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 4th: A special correspondent for the Svenska Dagbladet reported that the Danish border issue had been repeatedly discussed in Copenhagen. The public generally observes that the Danish authorities currently do not want to re-demarcate the border. In response, a statement was issued in Germany stating, "If you want to change the border to weaken our country's position, causing our border to shrink to the south, then this action will inevitably conflict with the Danish people's long-cherished concepts of freedom and justice. Our country's current border is conducive to the national spirit of autonomy and cooperation. At the same time, the Danish state and society are built on this national spirit of autonomy and cooperation."

### Indian Newspaper Warns Britain and France Not to Harm the Holy Teacher

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 4th: According to a New Delhi report released last night, "Dawn," a newspaper published by Jinnah, chairman of the All-India Muslim League, published an article yesterday warning Britain and France not to harm the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, al-Husseini. al-Husseini was arrested by French forces in southern Germany and is currently detained in Paris. Last week, news suddenly broke that al-Husseini would be transferred to Britain. "Dawn" stated that the British government must understand that the blood of martyrs is of great value. If they intend to protect this Holy Teacher, they should quickly release al-Husseini from the custody of the French government. If Britain does anything unfavorable to al-Husseini, it would be a destruction of the entire Muslim world.

### Remittances from Shanghai Banks to Other Cities Reduced Compared to Before

It is also learned that if the financial situation improves in areas where circulation has been suspended, the industry will make appropriate adjustments.

### France Expresses Determination to Protect Syrian and Lebanese Interests and Refuses to Recognize the Independence of the Two Countries

Central News Agency, Zurich, 4th: A Paris report states that French Premier de Gaulle exposed Britain's conspiracy to provoke the Syrian conflict on the 2nd and expressed the French government's determination to protect the interests of Syria and Lebanon by force, as follows: The motivation for the Syrian and Lebanese conflict can be said to be due to Britain's direct provocation. Most British agencies stationed in the two countries have incited residents to oppose France, and the Syrian police force equipped with British weapons has repeatedly attacked French outposts. Moreover, the total number of British troops stationed in Syria and Lebanon is over 600,000, while the French army has only about 5,000 troops, and the rest have been withdrawn to the western desert area. The French government ordered the French army to cease fighting on May 30th. I received a memorandum from the British Prime Minister on the 31st, but the memorandum did not change the attitude of the French government, and it is unlikely to change its attitude in the future. I did not respond because of its vested interests. Regarding the current issues of the French government, Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, etc., whether viewed from a political or geographical perspective, must exist as independent countries. Regarding the necessary conditions for Syria and Lebanon to be independent, our only requirement is to conclude various treaties in order to solve the cultural and economic interests of our country, the same as the United Kingdom and the United States. The French representatives negotiated this matter with Syria and Lebanon on May 8th, but shortly thereafter, the French army was attacked by armed Syrian rioters. Regarding this conflict, the French government believes that it must be resolved through international cooperation and cannot take other solutions. The French people must unite strongly around the government, and when necessary, they will not hesitate to use force to protect French interests and dignity.

Central News Agency, Zurich, 4th: A Paris report states that the French Foreign Minister officially stated the French government's attitude towards Syria and Lebanon to reporters on the 2nd as follows: The French government previously intended to recognize the independence of Syria and Lebanon, but now it has no intention of recognizing the independence of the two countries.

Syrian Foreign Minister Criticizes France

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 4th: According to a Damascus report, on the eve of the Arab League meeting, Syrian Foreign Minister al-Bey stated that "France is desperately planning a conspiracy within Syrian territory, so the relationship between Syria and France has to be severed." He also countered de Gaulle's statement, saying, "Last month, we repeatedly warned the French government that the more the French army shows its strength and increases its troops, the more difficult and troublesome it will be for Syria to seek a proper solution to resolve the conflict between the two countries, as advised by the British government. We have collected all the evidence from May 20th to 26th, which is sufficient to prove that France has ambitious intentions in Syria, so General de Gaulle's statement is merely a cover for France's conspiracy. France's recent actions have shattered the last remaining friendly relationship between Syria and France. It is clear that France is trying to obtain a special privileged position in Syria, but now it has obtained a special right that is not as good as it intended. We are preparing everything to solve this problem based on justice and equality. We sincerely thank Britain for its efforts." At the same time, Foreign Minister al-Bey compiled the following statistics on the damage suffered in Damascus last week: 400 dead, 100 missing and suspected dead, and 500 injured.

### Securities Transaction Income Tax to be Levied Starting the 7th, Taxation Methods Announced

### Yesterday's Tea Party by Four Organizations: Farewell to Minister Matsushima; Over Five Hundred Attendees in High Spirits

Colonel Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, has been honorably transferred to an important post. Four organizations in this city—the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Journalists Association, and the Magazine Association—held a farewell tea party yesterday (the 4th) afternoon at the Kang Le Restaurant. Minister Matsushima, accompanied by Lieutenant Commanders Matsumoto and Hirata, arrived promptly. Representatives from the four organizations, Wen Ziting, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Binhe, and Lu Feng, received them. Also in attendance were Director Gu of the Municipal Propaganda Office, Aoki Setsu, Motomoto Toraji, Akahoshi Tamemitsu, Osaka Koichi, Hidaka Seima, Lin Kanghou, Chen Shaowei, Zhao Zhengping, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, and over five hundred other people. First, Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the representatives of the four organizations, delivered a farewell speech. Then, Minister Matsushima gave a speech in response. Subsequently, representatives from the various organizations, Chen Binhe and Lu Feng, gave speeches. Finally, Minister Matsushima also recited a poem. The atmosphere was extremely convivial.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Yuan Ludeng's speech briefly stated: "Minister Matsushima is leaving his post, so the four organizations are holding this tea party to show our respect. Since Minister Matsushima took office, he has worked hard on his reporting duties. Not only is the press deeply grateful, but various organizations in Shanghai have also benefited greatly. We hope that after Minister Matsushima's honorable transfer, he will continue to remember Shanghai and continue to assist us in our joint efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War."

Minister's Reply

Minister Matsushima said: "Today, I am deeply grateful for the warm farewell from the four organizations. Since I arrived in Qingdao in August of the year before last, major changes have occurred. However, thanks to your sincere cooperation, the reporting tasks I have shouldered have been completed successively without any failures. I am especially grateful for this. This is my fifth time in China, but this time I have gained the best understanding of China and a deep understanding of the sentiments of the Chinese people. I have studied Chinese since childhood and have a deep impression of China. Therefore, my relationship with China can never be separated. At this time of war, as a soldier, I am responsible for reporting work. In particular, I hope to do my best to promote the overall peace of China. I will continue to work hard in accordance with my original intentions and hope that you will continue to work hard for the construction of Greater East Asia."

Chen Binhe's Speech

I remember two years ago, on September 3, 1943, when Colonel Matsushima assumed office as the Fleet Press Officer and hosted a reception for the city's journalist group, he said to us: "From now on, we must thoroughly understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, use the true value of Eastern culture to smash the enemy's violent aggression, and strive for final victory. Those of us who are responsible for reporting should be even more aware of the increasing importance of our responsibilities. We must be unyielding and unwavering, which is our creed. I hope to work with you, with the unified spirit of the Japanese Navy, to activate the reporting front and complete our heavy responsibilities." Looking back over the past two years, it can be said that Minister Matsushima has fully accomplished what he said. What we cannot forget in particular are the following two things:

First, he helped and guided those of us who are responsible for reporting to unite and cooperate ourselves. Minister Matsushima has provided great assistance to the past Journalists Association, enabling the association to fulfill its own tasks in the major situation. Later, when the China Journalists Association was established and the Shanghai Journalists Association was reorganized into a branch, Minister Matsushima made every effort to help us establish the new organization. Since then, China's news reporting industry has a unified core organization.

Second, due to the development of time in recent years, the situation of Shanghai's news industry has become increasingly difficult, especially the problems of printing paper, electricity supply, news reporting materials, and the improvement of news reporting content and succession operations, etc., all rely on Minister Matsushima's enthusiastic guidance and assistance to solve them, so that we gradually overcome the difficulties.

Minister Matsushima has been able to perfectly realize his ambitions in China. What we admire is that, first, he is a veritable enthusiast who studies Chinese issues. He has come to China successively in 1931, 1932 to 1933, 1937 and 1939, and has a deep sympathy for our country's situation. Second, he himself is a literary writer, a Confucian general, who is good at presenting and is close to the Chinese people, and our news media takes it upon ourselves to be the mouthpiece of the people, so we can understand each other very well.

Now that Minister Matsushima is honorably transferred back to his country, we inevitably feel a kind of spiritual loss. Fortunately, the minister is still continuing to promote the work of completing the Greater East Asia War. We will continue to fight under the same goal in the future. Today, I would like to specifically ask the minister to bring to the Allied countries and hope that the Chinese and Japanese public opinion circles will work together to realize that we must complete the cooperation between China and Japan with redoubled efforts. We always believe that the close and sincere cooperation between China and Japan is the prerequisite for completing the Greater East Asia War and solving the East Asian problem. The more difficult the situation, the more firm our beliefs should be, the more our efforts should be strengthened, and the practice and completion of China-Japan cooperation should be based on adapting to the other party's national conditions and public sentiments, and grasping the other party's public mind as the basic direction. I wish the minister good health and a happy future.

Li Sihao Wrote a Poem to Say Goodbye

Also, Li Sihao, chairman of the China Journalists Association, wrote a poem to bid farewell to Minister Matsushima, who was honorably transferred to an important position. The original poem is recorded as follows:

*Light fur in old general style,*
*Sea-faring achievements amid opening waves.*
*Bold and straightforward as Chen who startled the seat,*
*Subtle arguments flow beneath the tongue.*
*First meeting at Songbin, discussing poetry,*
*Straightforward liver and lungs go into the matter.*
*Reluctant farewell and sorrow for the times share the same distress,*
*Looking forward to preserving the late-blooming virtue together.*
*Both talented and chivalrous, yet refined,*
*Especially presenting this poem to you,*
*Parting at the river, a cup of wine,*
*Thoughts of departure often circle over the sea of clouds.*

### Centralized Purchase of Miscellaneous Grains: Emergency Measures to Solve the Rice Shortage in the City

Recently, the market price of rice and grain has shown a sharp rise again, and the degree of violence has exceeded the past record. Although middle and upper-class families have some stored rice, the majority of civilians do not have overnight food, accounting for nine out of ten. Even those with stored rice, if not replenished, will not be able to support it for a long time. People are panicked and cannot live a peaceful day. If emergency relief is not carried out quickly, not only will all industries collapse, but it will also cause a crisis in public security. The Municipal Advisory Committee, as a public opinion organ, is unwilling to sit idly by. It seems that it should immediately assist the Municipal Government in formulating an emergency relief plan to relieve the plight of the citizens. Based on the perspectives we can see, we will present the following measures:

According to various investigations, it is feared that it will be impossible to obtain a sufficient source of rice and grain in the short term. Therefore, the countermeasure to relieve the rice panic in this city is to try its best to enrich the source of miscellaneous grains to meet the urgent needs. Miscellaneous grain producing areas such as Huaihai Province are rich in production and will be able to supply it fully.

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government should establish a Miscellaneous Grain Purchase and Distribution Committee to preside over the purchase, transportation, and distribution of miscellaneous grains, with special responsibility. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, the Director of the Economic Bureau, and the Director of the Social Welfare Bureau are all Fu Ran members. In addition, several chairpersons of the Rice and Grain Control Association, consulting committee members, and directors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are hired as committee members.

The types of miscellaneous grains to be purchased are announced by the committee after investigation. The target for the first batch of purchases is one million yuan, and then they will be collected one after another. Adjustments will be made depending on the changes in the situation.

Each industry association in this city may sign an agreement with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to purchase miscellaneous grains. Each unit is at least 400,000 yuan, of which 50% is distributed to members and workers by the trade unions, and 50% is purchased by the committee and sold to the public at a reasonable price. The proceeds from the sale will be used to repay the funds of the trade unions that purchased the grain.

Each trade union that purchases miscellaneous grains should pay a deposit of 50% in advance. The remaining 50% of the price will be paid by the committee with a request to the Central Reserve Bank for advance loans to meet the needs of the situation. After the goods are received, each trade union will pay for the goods and ship them.

Commercial firms, factories, charitable organizations, and homes that have not joined the trade union may also pay the full price in advance and purchase miscellaneous grains from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Each unit is at least 200,000 yuan, but if the stock in the production area or the transportation capacity is insufficient, the purchase amount of the trade unions should be purchased and transported first.

The above are just outlines. The effectiveness of this matter depends on its swift action. Detailed rules should be formulated quickly and implemented as soon as possible to meet the needs of the situation. Otherwise, when the water of the West River arrives, the dried crucian carp will have died. What is the use? What is more, the seriousness of the rice shortage problem is closely related to the skin of every citizen. Even those who have rice stored for a year or several months will have a very short period of time if the price of rice does not fall. Therefore, they are still threatened by the high price of rice in their minds. Therefore, all citizens should work together and cooperate to solve the difficulties. Do not have the mentality of watching the fire from the other side, which will harm yourself and others.
