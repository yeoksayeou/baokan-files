### Enemy Warships in Lingayen Gulf: 23 Sunk and Destroyed; Japanese Ground Forces Courageously Counterattack

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Imperial General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 12th: (1) Enemy forces landing on the coast of Lingayen Gulf consist of approximately two infantry divisions and one tank division. Apart from some advances in front of San Fabian, they are consolidating their position near the coast and attempting to reinforce their strength. Japanese ground troops are courageously engaging in counterattacks. (2) Japanese air forces continue to fiercely attack enemy warships near Lingayen Gulf. The confirmed results of the battles on January 9th and 10th are as follows: one transport ship sunk by bombing, two cruisers sunk by bombing, two transport ships sunk, one aircraft carrier sunk, one cruiser sunk, and two cruisers or destroyers sunk. Seven transport ships, one aircraft carrier, two aircraft carriers or battleships, one battleship, and two cruisers heavily damaged and on fire.

Philippine Front Line Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Under the cover of intense artillery bombardment and aerial bombing, the American enemy finally landed between San Fabian and Lingayen in Lingayen Gulf on the morning of the 9th. Further, on the morning of the 10th, they landed with strong follow-up forces, attempting to expand their beachhead and are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese defending forces. Since around 1:00 PM on the 10th, the enemy forces, using numerous landing craft filled with approximately 2,000 soldiers, attempted a new landing at Lapun (approximately ten kilometers north of San Fabian). At this time, the Japanese ground forces lying in wait launched a fierce barrage against the enemy flotilla, resulting in the sinking of seven or eight large craft carrying tanks and numerous other craft, completely shattering the enemy's landing attempt. After suffering a major blow, the enemy retreated in disarray, and the morale of the Japanese troops to annihilate the enemy is soaring. The spirit of engaging in surprise attacks has shocked the enemy. Currently, the enemy forces are concentrating their landing forces in San Fabian, focusing on covering the landing of follow-up forces and attempting to strengthen their beachhead, preparing to launch a major offensive centered on their superior tank forces. Therefore, the great decisive battle between the Japanese and American forces in Lingayen Gulf is about to begin.

Fierce Close Combat Unfolds Near San Fabian

Philippine Front Line Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the American enemy landing forces landed in Lingayen Gulf, they attempted to expand their beachhead centered on San Fabian in the Gulf on the 10th. At the same time, enemy warships in the Gulf continued to bombard fiercely with artillery, and mobilized their total air power in the area to attack Japanese positions. The Japanese forces also adopted an offensive strategy, launching fierce counterattacks with elite units. On the afternoon of the 10th, starting at 4:00 PM, the enemy forces, spearheaded by numerous tanks and supported by artillery, began attacking eastward from San Fabian. At 6:40 PM, a portion of the enemy forces broke into a corner of the Japanese positions. In response, the Japanese immediately moved their rear forces forward and, after engaging the enemy in fierce close combat, drove them out of the positions. Subsequently, after an even more intense concentrated artillery barrage, the enemy once again advanced on the Japanese positions with tanks as the vanguard. The Japanese forces repeatedly counterattacked. The enemy has now established a foothold in a portion of the Japanese protruding corner position, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the surrounding area. Meanwhile, since the enemy's landing, Japanese commando teams have launched night and day raids on the enemy, successively destroying the enemy's artillery fire. Due to the large number of enemy aircraft, they repeatedly used fighters and bombers to attack Japanese positions and ammunition depots. Enemy warships in the Gulf also fired flares while continuing their artillery bombardment. Therefore, Lingayen Gulf has now become a scene of tragic and unparalleled decisive battle.

Japanese Army and Navy Special Attack Units Heavily Damage Enemy Warships

Japanese Army Base in the Philippines, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Army Special Attack Unit "Mount Fuji Team" attacked an enemy mobile force operating northwest of Bolinao on the west coast of Lingayen Gulf at dawn on the 10th. According to reports from Japanese escort aircraft, they hit two large enemy ships, possibly aircraft carriers or battleships, causing them to explode violently. Another Japanese Special Attack Unit further penetrated the enemy fleet in Lingayen Gulf on the same afternoon, ramming three enemy transport ships, causing them to be heavily damaged and set on fire. That evening, another Japanese Special Attack Unit attacked an enemy mobile force cruising in the Gulf, hitting one of their aircraft carriers. As confirmed by Japanese escort aircraft, the enemy ship exploded violently and then sank.

Japanese Army Base in the Philippines, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A Japanese "Kamikaze" Special Attack Unit penetrated Lingayen Gulf on the 9th, heavily damaging one enemy battleship, two cruisers, and large destroyers.

Japanese Troops Form Commando Units, Charge into Enemy Artillery Positions

Philippine Front Line Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese elite troops engage in hand-to-hand combat against the invading enemy forces in Lingayen Gulf day and night, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. At 2:30 PM on the 10th, a commando unit consisting of three men, including a sergeant, infiltrated the enemy's mortar position northeast of San Fabian amidst heavy artillery fire, destroying two of their barracks. All members returned safely. Also, a commando unit consisting of Sergeant Shirashima and three other men infiltrated the enemy's field artillery position east of San Fabian, which was under construction, at 10:30 AM on the 10th, destroying two field guns and several heavy machine guns.

Philippine Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy's first and second convoys, which invaded Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island, finally began landing on the morning of the 9th under heavy Japanese attacks. Afterwards, before dawn on the 10th, the enemy arrived in the Gulf again with over a hundred transport ships and approximately several dozen landing craft, heavily guarded by ten aircraft carriers. At this time, the Japanese air force stationed in the Philippines mobilized entirely and launched a tragic attack on the arrogant landing enemy. As a result, the enemy's first convoy, after being severely attacked by Japanese aircraft, had only two large ships and sixty landing craft remaining when it reached Lingayen Gulf on the 6th. The enemy, after suffering damage, abandoned the landing attempt. Furthermore, by the time the enemy's second convoy, consisting of over fifty transport ships and over two hundred landing craft, invaded the Gulf late at night, its losses had reached 40%. According to the enemy's recent tactics, they have adopted the principle of using a large number of small boats, attempting to evade the fierce attacks of Japanese special attack units. However, Japanese aircraft are specifically targeting the largest ones. The current battle has evolved into a land battle. On the Luzon front, Japanese forces are currently engaging the enemy in counterattacks in a portion of Lingayen Gulf. The Japanese army has extremely strong ground fortifications throughout Luzon Island. Therefore, in the second stage of the decisive battle on Luzon after the enemy's landing, it is inevitable that they will suffer a strong counterattack from the Japanese army.

Major Offensive and Defensive Battle Imminent in the Agno River Basin

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Special Attack Units continue to fiercely bomb the enemy fleet in Lingayen Gulf. According to a dispatch from an embedded Associated Press reporter on the 12th, Japanese aircraft and torpedo boats have launched night attacks on convoys transporting reinforcements for the US XIV Corps, hitting several enemy ships. However, the enemy, relying on their abundant supplies, continues to bring transport ships into Lingayen Gulf one after another, attempting to expand their beachhead. According to enemy sources, approximately 100,000 American and Australian troops, carrying over 10,000 tons of equipment and military supplies, have already landed. General MacArthur plans to move his main force south along the Manila Road into the central plains of Luzon, with the aim of engaging the main Japanese forces in a decisive battle. According to enemy sources, it is speculated that Japanese and American forces have successively arrived at the Agno River line from the south towards the Agno River. According to an Associated Press frontline dispatch, a portion of the US forces has reached the mouth of the Agno River, ten kilometers west of Lingayen, and is currently under heavy Japanese artillery fire, making the situation even more critical.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the US Pacific Seventh Fleet, Rear Admiral Barbey, Commander of the US Amphibious Forces, announced on the 11th that over 80,000 tons of supplies and equipment have been unloaded by US forces since the start of the Philippine operations.

### Morotai Bombed 60 Times in Two Months: Summary of Results by Japanese Air Force

Southwest Pacific Japanese Army Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese air forces are constantly attacking enemy airfields on Morotai Island, which has been invaded by the enemy and serves as a Philippine air force base, thwarting their attempts. From November 4th to January 1st, Japanese army air units launched sixty fierce attacks, achieving remarkable results. Enemy airfields were set on fire in 140 places, exploded in over 44 places, and numerous land-based supply depots were destroyed. Enemy aircraft losses include 153 aircraft set on fire (99 large aircraft, 28 medium aircraft, and 26 small aircraft), 128 enemy aircraft suffered light or heavy damage, and 2 enemy aircraft were shot down.

### Minister Matsushima Explains Philippine Battle Situation, Vowing to Annihilate the American Enemy with Unshakable Faith

The Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department in China held its regular press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday. Minister Matsushima, Lieutenant Shioda, and advisors Lin Junfu and Wang Bingnan attended. Minister Matsushima spoke about the recent situation in the Pacific War. His remarks were as follows:

Landing Enemy Forces in Disarray

Regarding the recent situation in the Pacific War, since the end of December last year, Japanese air and naval forces in the Lingayen Gulf area have been cooperating to launch fierce attacks on the invading enemy forces. Relying on a large number of transport ships, the enemy arrived in Lingayen Gulf on the 8th of this month and began landing on the 9th. The enemy's forces from the south of Lingayen to the San Fabian area consist of approximately two divisions. After being fiercely attacked by Japanese ground and air forces, the enemy has fallen into a state of disarray. The enemy force assisting the landing troops has divided its forces into several groups, cruising on the eastern sea of Luzon Island. This mobile force mainly uses special aircraft carriers (i.e., aircraft carriers converted from merchant ships) for transportation. The warships protecting the mobile force, such as cruisers and destroyers, are few in number, so their combat power is also very low.

Closer to Japan, More Advantageous for Japan

MacArthur's headquarters is exaggerating the publicity for this operation, claiming to have occupied over thirty strongholds and is now actively advancing on Manila. All such claims are false. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 10th, the American troops landing on Luzon Island have advanced 18 to 20 miles from the landing site. During the journey of the American convoy of 2.5 million tons, Japanese special swimming teams were discovered engaging in fierce combat. From the surface perspective of the current battlefield, it seems that the Japanese are gradually being pushed back from Leyte Island through Mindoro Island to Luzon Island. However, from a strategic point of view, the closer to Japan and the wider the land, the more advantageous it is for Japan. That is, Japan can make the enemy bleed more and consume more in various battlefields, and annihilate them as close as possible to our homeland.

American Personnel Facing Great Difficulties

Regarding the heavy losses and severe damage suffered by the enemy in bleeding operations, according to Reuters from Washington on the 11th, US Undersecretary of War Patterson stated that 900,000 more troops must be added within six months this year in order to win the war, which shows the severity of the enemy's damage. When MacArthur was preparing to attack the Philippines, he had only 200,000 troops. Those who landed in Lingayen Gulf were only about 40,000 to 50,000, including a portion transferred from Leyte Island, where the enemy suffered great damage. At this time, when both sides are in a stalemate on Leyte Island, the enemy still needs to divert a portion of their forces to other places, and their personnel difficulties are clearly visible. Regarding the future Pacific War, the battle in the Philippines is said to be the final decisive battle of the Pacific War, and I also believe it to some extent. However, we will make the enemy suffer more bleeding and greater consumption within the possible range and advance according to our predetermined strategy. The closer the enemy gets to the Japanese mainland, the greater our hope. I have said this repeatedly before. In particular, we must prevent the enemy from coming to the Chinese mainland. This policy will never change.

Resolved to Fight to the End

In the current war situation, it is quite easy to cause public unrest in Shanghai, and this point should be paid special attention to. Secondly, the enemy is eager to conduct air raids on important cities in Shanghai and the peaceful areas. Based on the results of the air raids that have been proven in Changsha, Hengyang and other places, the United States carries out indiscriminate and blind bombings, and the greatest damage is to the lives and property of the Chinese people, which is extremely regrettable. On the evening of January 8, I broadcast to Chongqing and the peaceful areas, wanting to urge the Eastern nations to recognize the significance of this war and struggle. We have always been determined to fight this war to the end, so we are not afraid of enemy bombing at all. In any case, we want to minimize the damage to the lives and property of the Chinese people as much as possible. This is what we are extremely concerned about. Therefore, air defense preparations are extremely important, and the Chinese people should be advised to step up this kind of prevention work.

Location and Progress Unimportant

I believe that the enemy's combat methods are all "incomplete advance operations." For example, in the current war situation, the enemy is carrying out island-hopping operations in the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, Palau Islands, etc., attempting to quickly reach the Chinese mainland. In short, the enemy's attempt is to disregard the foundations along the way and reach the Chinese mainland early to disrupt the Chinese army and cause chaos in Japan's construction on the mainland. Based on this, it is expected that in future operations, the enemy may ignore the situation in the Philippines and move towards the Chinese mainland. This cannot but be considered. This can make the enemy run east and west, consume everywhere, and finally destroy them, which is the best strategy. Those who do not understand warfare may easily misunderstand, but the final goal is to destroy the enemy, and the location and progress are not important. In short, we have the determination to win this war, make the enemy consume, and finally eliminate them. We have always had this confidence.

Editorial

### The Relationship Between the Chongqing Government and the Communists

The relationship between the Chongqing government and the Communists was one of unity for resistance, but it began to split during the war of resistance. In recent years, they have each raised the flag of resistance while acting independently, creating a situation of internal strife. You oppose me, I restrain you, and neither yields to the other. The situation has escalated, and the division is always on the verge of erupting. People who care about China's future are very concerned about this issue. We would like to offer an analysis of this issue from an outsider's perspective.

The core of the relationship between the Chongqing government and the Communists is that Chiang Kai-shek opposes the Communist Party's expansion of power during the war of resistance, while the Communist Party must develop during the war of resistance. Therefore, the anti-Communist issue has become one of the central tasks of the Kuomintang in Chongqing.

The issue of anti-Communism has been on the Chinese political stage for a long time. Everyone probably still remembers the famous ten-year campaign to suppress the Communists. It took five encirclement campaigns in Jiangxi to drive them out of their stronghold, and they fled back to northern Shaanxi in disarray. After the Xi'an Incident, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to repay the Communist Party's kindness in not killing him, dismissed the ten-year resentment with a smile, shook hands, and accepted the Communist Party's proposal to resist Japan. The Communist Party, in return, abandoned class struggle, supported the program of resisting Japan and building the country, and formed the "National Anti-Japanese United Front" to jointly "resist Japan." The bloody issue of anti-Communism was written off, and the atmosphere of national unity reached its peak for a time.

However, grand feasts are hard to repeat, and good times don't last long. After the fall of Wuhan and the move to Chongqing, it was decided to engage in a long-term war of attrition. It was felt that one's own power had been greatly diminished during the two years of blind war, while the Communist Party had taken the opportunity to develop. Recalling the difficulties of the ten-year campaign to suppress the Communists, a deep fear arose, with a great sense of regret. However, one could not personally take down the anti-Japanese signboard and start another campaign of first securing the home front and then repelling foreign invaders. One could only formulate methods to restrict the activities of dissenting parties, secretly mobilize subordinates, and start grassroots friction, creating a situation of open suppression, which was very painful. The Southern Anhui Incident in the winter of 1940 was an attempt to lead the Chongqing government and the Communists back to the old path of the past sixteen years. However, Chiang Kai-shek's "two resistances" policy—resisting Japan on one hand and resisting the Communists on the other—bound his own hands and feet, leading to extreme contradictions and preventing any development. Although Chiang Kai-shek used 700,000 troops to blockade Yan'an for more than six years, there was no good opportunity to directly attack Yan'an and uproot the Communist Party. In the fall of the year before last, the Soviet Union announced the dissolution of the Third International, which was a rare opportunity. Hu Zongnan wanted to lead his elite troops to annihilate them in one fell swoop, and the situation was very serious. The Communist Party quickly raised the old fist of "unity to resist Japan" to parry, and only then did Chiang Kai-shek strike back into the contradictions of resisting Japan, close the shop, and get through the crisis.

However, Chiang Kai-shek did not give up. He wanted to use the fist of "victory in the war of resistance" to retaliate against the Communist Party. Therefore, in his speech on the Double Tenth Festival last year, he emphasized that victory in the war of resistance must have unified military orders, and in front of the people of the whole country, he denounced the Communist Party's "possession of troops and territorial division" as undermining the unity of military orders, which was "treacherous and deceitful." This kind of scolding can be said to be very pleasant, but it is doubtful that it will incite a full-scale anti-Communist campaign, which Chiang Kai-shek probably did not consider. When Chiang Kai-shek learned to use the "anti-Japanese flag" as a bomb to attack the Communist Party, the Communist Party invented a new weapon to counterattack, which was to use the military setbacks of the Chongqing government and the pressure from the United States to blackmail Chongqing and fundamentally remove the political anti-Communist weapon of the Chongqing government. Therefore, it openly proposed a "coalition government" with the participation of all parties and factions. The demand for a "joint command" was getting closer and closer, with even the intention of sharing power equally.

In order to counter this, the Chongqing government changed some of the personnel that American public opinion was dissatisfied with in order to appease the United States and ease diplomatic pressure. In domestic politics, it avoided giving the Communist Party an excuse to attack and bewitch the people, and strived for the people's belief. In his New Year's Day broadcast this year, he claimed: "As long as the military situation stabilizes and the foundation for counterattack is established, the constitution will be announced and power will be returned to the people." The Yan'an side gave a fierce condemnation of Chiang's pledge of an empty check, thoroughly exposing its deceptive nature in front of the people of the country. At the same time, it listed facts to refute it and raised practical issues to accuse it. Today's relationship between the Chongqing government and the Communists is a tit-for-tat struggle. What are they fighting for? They are fighting for the people. A tooth-for-tooth fight, what are they fighting for? They are fighting for the "coalition government" and the "joint command." Looking at the speech by Lin Zuhan, the Yan'an representative at the Chongqing-Communist negotiation conference, that "the Communist Party has tens of thousands of regular troops and tens of thousands of militia," the purpose of which was to demand an equal division of foreign aid. But the implication was that it was demonstrating to the Chongqing government, meaning that it would not stop until its goal was achieved.

The Chongqing government has indeed made some achievements in its work of unification during the protracted war, but it has lost more than it has gained, emboldening the Communist Party. Now it is still stuck in the horn of a dilemma in the protracted war of anti-Communism, which is really a foolish thing. To understand the relationship between the Chongqing government and the Communists, the key lies in this.

### Fierce Bombing of Japanese Creek Harbor: Japanese Aircraft Drop Huge Bombs, Smoke Fills the Air, Enemy Warships Sunk and Destroyed

Burma Front Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese new fighter squadrons on the Burma front heavily bombed enemy transport fleets in Japanese Creek on the 9th, achieving great results. When the new Japanese fighter formation arrived in the skies over Japanese Creek Harbor, it was just as the enemy was transporting soldiers and weapons for landing. The enemy transport fleet anchored in the harbor consisted of cruisers arranged in two parallel rows. At this time, after the Japanese aircraft circled in the air, the lead aircraft of the front team first carried out a dive bombing of the large enemy cruiser. The first bomb hit the deck squarely, and the enemy cruiser exploded one after another. At the same time, the enemy, after being ambushed by Japanese aircraft, blindly fired anti-aircraft fire from ships and ground. In this situation of smoke-filled air, the Japanese fighter squadrons dropped a large number of huge bombs on the enemy fleet. When another Japanese aircraft soared to the skies over the bay, it flew into the enemy transport fleet and destroyed a large ship with a heavy bomb. At this time, a large enemy transport ship of the thousand-ton class was seen leaking heavy oil due to injury. Furthermore, on its return trip, the Japanese aircraft shot down two small enemy fighters. In this operation, the Japanese fighters also sacrificed three aircraft.

### Japanese Students Complete the Mission of Production
From Classroom to Factory

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese students from various schools have entered factories from the classroom in order to take on the national wartime production work, and have become the mainstay of military industrial labor. Their enthusiasm for serving the country can be said to have reached its peak. The following is an example of these wartime students working hard in factories. At a certain factory in Tokyo that produces various chemical industries, everything from the initial construction of the factory was undertaken by the students. Recently, they have been working in three shifts day and night, so the production results are far superior to those of ordinary factories. The large factory, which has an area of 75 acres and large-scale equipment, was actually completed entirely by students' hands to fulfill the mission of the production war. Moreover, these students are all of middle school level or below. Their work has been carried out since September last year, first engaging in the production of synthetic rubber, and starting at the end of December, starting the manufacture of carbolic acid. Among them, the organization of diligent students is that fifth-year and third-year middle school students serve as captains of each detachment, and each detachment member is composed of 15 elementary school students. Before the start of work every day, all members must first gather together, sing "We have received many lands from the country," call out the slogan "We will definitely win," and then the whole team marches into the factory to work. Their spirit of dedication and law-abiding reflects the struggle of the soldiers on the front line.

### Japanese Botanist Studies New Wheat Species

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A teacher at a certain Japanese school has recently used the cross-breeding of wheat species to research and complete a new, huge wheat variety. This summer, 100,000 grains of seeds have been harvested and formal planting has begun. The researcher is Mr. Nakajima Goichi, a 44-year-old contract worker in the Faculty of Agriculture at Kyoto University, who is a teacher at the Prefectural Kiryu Doshi High Museum in Kiryu City, Gunma Prefecture. This wheat is a crossbreed of wheat and naked rye, which was considered impossible among past scholars. Compared with wheat No. 16, its wheat grains are three times larger, the number of grains per ear is 150 (ordinary is 50), the length of the ear is about 10 cm longer than ordinary, and the wheat base is about 10 cm-20 cm. The quality of this grain is not much different from ordinary wheat. The teacher named it "Fixed Species Naked Wheat." The characteristics of this giant wheat are the same as naked rye, but it can grow well in barren mountainous areas or dry, barren land, and fertilizer is almost not needed. The research of this wheat took 19 years. Initially, it could only flower without bearing ears every year, and it took nine years before a pot of ears finally appeared.

### Hong Kong Sets Deadline to Exchange Enemy Currency

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Hong Kong authorities announced yesterday that all residents in the jurisdiction who hold Hong Kong dollars, old legal tender, US dollars, and other enemy currencies must exchange them for military scrip at the designated banks of the Central China Bank from today until February 7th. The ratio of old Hong Kong dollars to military scrip is still one to four, and the ratio of other enemy currencies to military scrip is still unknown. Furthermore, passengers traveling between Guangzhou and Hong Kong are still allowed to exchange for military scrip with a limit of 500 yuan, but passengers from Macau, Shantou, Xiamen, Shanghai and other places are limited to exchanging 1,200 yuan of military scrip.

### Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Yano, Goes to Beijing

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Consul General of the Allied embassies stationed in Shanghai, Mr. Yano Seiki, has been honorably transferred to an important post and has come to Beijing from Shanghai on the 12th to conduct affairs with the relevant parties. He is scheduled to return to his country to take up his new position within days.

### Goebbels Writes About German War Goals

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports that German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels published an article in the "German Weekly," stating that this war is a social revolution, and the winners will be the workers, not the bankers and capitalists. The tide of socialism will flood all countries after the war. The political goals of the anti-Axis powers are very vague. The people of plutocratic countries lack political ideals and will face political failure after the war. The people in the occupied areas of the anti-Axis armies are experiencing political instability, famine, and domestic struggles. These are the results of ideological conflicts between revolutionaries and conservatives, and a proper solution cannot be reached. The German people have already experienced the revolutions that other countries are currently facing. Germany has not changed its basic ideals for this war over the years. The German people understand the historical significance of this war and recognize the war goals, thus generating the strength to overcome the various difficulties of the war. The German people use the war goals as their compass.

### Holding a Firmly Confident Heart of Victory, Exerting Full Effort to Assist the Allied Nations, Vowing to be the Backing for the Brave Soldiers on the Luzon Front

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a statement released by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters at 10 AM on the 10th: The enemy American forces finally landed on San Fabian and near Lingayen on the south coast of Lingayen Gulf on the 9th. The decisive battle for Luzon Island, which will determine the fate of the Pacific, has now begun. Currently, fierce artillery fire is still raging there, and intense naval and air battles are unfolding. The valiant fighting of the Japanese army, navy, and air force special attack units has already inflicted heavy damage on the stubborn enemy. Furthermore, the enemy Americans' landing in Lingayen Gulf this time is using the same old trick as the landing in Leyte Gulf, adopting a feint to the east and attack to the west strategy to divert the Japanese army's attention. The Japanese army has long seen through this trick and, in addition to establishing an impregnable defense posture on the Philippine Islands, is also using a unified combat will of the army, navy, and air force to stand in strict formation and await to shatter the enemy American's attempts. Therefore, the enemy American's operation to cut off the Japanese army's connection with the southern regions of the mainland will ultimately suffer another miserable defeat under the divine might of the Japanese army. However, the enemy Americans, with their superior quantity of materials and desire for dominance, will not necessarily change their plans even if the offensive against the Philippine Islands is frustrated as a result. This is what everyone expects, so the seriousness of the situation in the Philippine Islands cannot be underestimated. However, our entire nation is extremely angry about the historical fact of the enemy Americans enslaving the people of East Asia and their stubborn ambition. Therefore, after the news of the enemy American's landing in Lingayen Gulf reached us, our spirit of unity has become even stronger. Holding the same righteous and firmly confident heart of victory, we should exert all our strength in this autumn of decisive battle to assist our allied nations in striking the enemy Americans. Moreover, in fact, the Japanese army is in a position of fighting on the inner line. The shorter the battle line, the more concentrated the military strength. The enemy Americans are in a position of fighting on the outer line. The longer the battle line, the more serious the problem of transportation and supply becomes. The Japanese army is in a superior position of natural defense, possessing abundant supplies and a steady supply of military strength, waiting at ease for the enemy to tire themselves out. There is absolutely no doubt that they will be victorious. The enemy Americans are exhausted and rushing to end the war against Japan, even resorting to unscrupulous means and disregarding sacrifices to penetrate deep into the Japanese army's positions. The Japanese army can seize the opportunity to exploit the enemy's plan to penetrate deep, and then annihilate them in unison. At this moment, in addition to strengthening our belief in certain victory in the Philippine Islands, we should also exert all our manpower and material resources to assist the war of the allied nations, to be the backing for the brave soldiers on the Philippine front, in order to achieve the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Agricultural Experiment Station's Work Plan for This Year: Emphasis on Food and Livestock Products

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Central Agricultural Experiment Station is an agricultural technology research institution. As the food production increase campaign is being actively promoted, and experimental work is particularly important, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the station yesterday to inquire about the implementation plan for this year's work. The explanation was as follows:

This year's work plan of the station intends to place emphasis on edible crops and livestock improvement. In terms of experimental crops, the work will be divided into agronomy, animal husbandry, and plant pest and disease control. Agronomic crops will focus on hemp, and winter crops will focus on wheat and vegetables. In terms of animal husbandry, the focus will be on improving the breeds of poultry and livestock, formulating feed, preventing epidemics, and expanding livestock farms for raising pigs, chickens, and draft animals. In terms of plant pests and diseases, the main research items will be rice locusts (armyworms and stored product pests), rice blight, black smut, cotton wilt, etc., and it is planned to train instructors and establish instructor training classes. Furthermore, it is planned to expand rural social undertakings, operate rural clinics, people's schools, people's reading rooms, cooperatives, etc., which are directly or indirectly related to the experimental work, and to add branch stations. Moreover, in order to promote agricultural cooperation, the management of specially contracted farm households will be strengthened. Regarding equipment replenishment, it is planned to establish a chemical laboratory, construct five warehouses and workshops each, repair greenhouses, establish a breeding livestock farm, and add agricultural tools.

### New Countermeasures Will Be Taken to Improve Economic Controls

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the implementation of the National Government's economic control measures, the anticipated results have not been achieved. The reasons are: (1) the lack of accurate statistics; (2) the imperfection of the methods of the control agencies. Regarding the former, due to the lack of accurate statistics on population, production, and consumption, there is no definite policy. Regarding the latter, due to the lack of unity of the control agencies, the power is dispersed, and each acts independently. For example, although the procurement agencies nominally have their own responsibilities, in reality, there are many constraints, which is a prominent example. All of these situations are unfavorable maladies that hinder the advancement of the control measures. At this decisive stage, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and enhance combat power, it is indeed necessary to emphasize that the economic control measures are not working. Therefore, people across the country are paying close attention to this issue and expecting improvements. After inquiring with relevant parties, the reporter has learned that the authorities are carefully studying improvement measures aimed at the above-mentioned maladies, and a formal decision will be made in the near future. This new countermeasure for controlled economy will surely bring about epoch-making progress in stabilizing people's livelihoods and economic combat power.

### Jiangsu Agricultural Production Increase Association Holds Committee Meeting

Suzhou, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since Sun Yucai, Director of the Department of Reconstruction of Jiangsu Province, concurrently served as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, he has spared no effort in promoting the association's affairs. All the newly appointed committee members have also been appointed separately. A reorganized first committee meeting was specially held at 2 PM the other day. The attending committee members were chaired by Chairman Sun, and the following were passed: (1) The directors of the county associations shall be concurrently held by the chiefs of the reconstruction sections of each county to comply with regulations. (2) Standardizing the organizational structure of each county association. (3) Procedures for cooperatives in various regions to apply for business expenses.

### German Army Straightens Line in Southeastern Belgium, German Army Recaptures Rimling in Lorraine

Berlin, 11th (German News Agency dispatch) – According to an official German war report: In order to effectively support the flank of the Allied forces' deep advance in the Ardennes salient in northeastern France, the German army has pulled back the line from the salient on the west bank of the Ourthe River in southeastern Belgium and withdrawn from the city of Saint-Hubert. The German army was not subjected to enemy pressure. Although the enemy army stubbornly attempted to move north in the Bastogne area, the battle line did not change much. After several days of fighting, the German army in Lorraine has occupied Rimling north of Rohrbach. The German army in the Rhine plain swept through the Maginot Line fortifications near Hagenthal, and has captured several villages and towns in central Alsace. The enemy army was surrounded by the German army in Kilstett and then annihilated. The German army's long-range artillery fire on Liège and Antwerp has become increasingly fierce, disrupting the enemy army's supply.

German Troops Still Fighting in French Coastal Fortresses

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German garrisons have continued to fight in the French coastal fortresses since the American army began its major breakthrough offensive in late July of last year. According to a report from Paris, there are currently 35,000 German troops in Saint-Nazaire, 40,000 near the mouth of the Gironde River, the entrance and exit of Bordeaux, and 20,000 in Lorient, stubbornly fighting and have prevented the Allied forces from using the three important military ports.

### British Army and Greek Leftists Reach Ceasefire Agreement

Stockholm, Sweden, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: London announced this morning the ceasefire conditions between General Scobie, commander of the British army in Athens, and the ELAS (Greek People's Liberation Army). The agreement states that the ELAS army will withdraw from the Langonika district before January 17th, and other troops will withdraw to designated areas before January 10th. ELAS personnel whose residence is outside the Peloponnese but are currently in that area must withdraw from that area. ELAS personnel whose residence is inside the Peloponnese but are currently elsewhere must withdraw to that area. The ELAS army on the Cyclades, Sporades and other islands must withdraw before January 19th. Civil servants captured by the ELAS army, regardless of their nationality, shall be returned to their original posts. The British army is willing to release the same number of ELAS prisoners. British civilians captured shall be returned. If the ELAS army fails to implement the agreement or attacks British troops in any part of Greece, it shall be regarded as a violation of the ceasefire agreement.

### Soviet Fire Team's Attack on Hongjing Thwarted, Famous Buildings Destroyed by Artillery Fire

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: The Soviet army has resumed its attack on Kispest and Szebely, the southeastern suburbs of Hongjing (Budapest), and is using fire teams to assist in the battle. However, it has not yet achieved its purpose. Other Soviet troops have been transferred to the west of Hongjing to prevent the German army from advancing towards the Bakony Forest and the Vértes Mountains. The Soviet army's failure in the large-scale tank battle in Székesfehérvár has allowed the German army to advance all the way to the Danube River. The German army's counter-offensive in Vértes and Pilis Mountains has advanced eastward. The Soviet army's breakthrough west of the Gran River has met with strong German resistance, so the battle of Hongjing has been favorable to the German-Hungarian forces. The German army's offensive northwest of Budapest has forced the Soviet army to temporarily abandon its offensive against Hongjing.

Berlin, 12th (German News Agency dispatch) – Among the cultural monuments destroyed in Budapest are the Coronation Church, the Citadel, and many other buildings on the Palatinus River, as well as the Parliament House and the Theater.

### Anglo-American Blockade and Air Raids on Germany Have Not Been Effective, Over One Million Tons of Bombs Dropped Last Year

Zurich, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a statement released by the British Air Force authorities: In 1944, the British Air Force dropped a total of 525,000 tons of bombs on Germany, equivalent to two and a half times the amount of bombs dropped in the first four and a half years since the outbreak of the war. Furthermore, Lieutenant General Spaatz of the US Army, commander of the US Strategic Bombing Force in Europe, also stated that the US Air Force dispatched to Europe last year dropped 998,000 tons of bombs in Europe and the Mediterranean region. Combining the above two figures, the total is 1.5 million tons. According to a Swedish magazine, although the Allied air force has carried out such large-scale bombing, it has not achieved victory. On the contrary, the German side has thoroughly evacuated factories and placed them underground, rendering the enemy army's bombing operations ineffective.

### Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting Being Actively Prepared

Lisbon, 11th (German News Agency dispatch) – According to news from Washington: President Roosevelt held a meeting with the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is said that the meeting between the President and Churchill and Stalin was also an example of the topics discussed.

Various Speculations on the Topics of Discussion

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry pointed out that although several locations have been proposed for the next meeting of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, Tehran is the most likely. It is still undecided whether Roosevelt is preparing to consult with Churchill in London first to prepare for the discussion of the three giants. The date of the meeting has not been set either. There will be no lack of issues to discuss, such as the political issues of Greece and Poland, and the Near East oil issue, all of which can be used as discussion materials. However, Berlin believes that the topic of discussion should be the future European political system. The Moscow-published "War and the Working Class" magazine recently pointed out that the Soviet Union cannot tolerate the existence of pre-war governments in the occupied areas. This statement is veiled and worthy of careful consideration.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: Washington news, representatives of American oil companies will hold a meeting with representatives of the State Department and the Department of the Interior on January 15 to discuss the amendments to the Anglo-American oil agreement.

### Song Ziwen's Entry into the Cabinet and Chongqing's Unease

— Yoshida Toyosuke

Question: Today I have many questions to ask you. You previously said that He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi were the pillars of Chiang Kai-shek's regime, and their decline proves Chiang Kai-shek's own decline. However, since Song Ziwen became the Premier of the Executive Yuan, everyone naturally understands that Chongqing's political arena has gradually become the domain of the Anglo-American faction. So, please first explain the process of Song Ziwen's ascent to power.

Answer: The Premier of the Executive Yuan in Chongqing was originally Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek was consistently preoccupied with military affairs, and in fact, all affairs were solely controlled by the Vice Premier, Kong Xiangxi. As for this year, as Chiang Kai-shek said, China is in a decisive year where military matters take precedence. Therefore, since the end of last year, they have been racking their brains to study this issue. Finally, they decided to have a specialized talent appointed as the Premier of the Executive Yuan, while he himself would concentrate on military affairs. Of course, there are still talents in Chongqing, but very few are capable of taking on the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan. Everyone knows that although the current Chongqing regime is said to be a party-state, it is not controlled by the Kuomintang, but by the Chiang family and a few other families directly affiliated with Chiang. In essence, it is not the Chinese government, but the Chiang family's government. Therefore, the selection of individuals for such an important position as the Premier of the Executive Yuan is greatly restricted. First, looking at the individuals within the current Chongqing regime who could potentially be candidates for Premier of the Executive Yuan, even with a relaxed standard, there are at most only Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Zhang Qun, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, and He Yingqin. Among these people, from the perspective of possessing the ability and qualifications to be Chiang's Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen is the most suitable. Honestly, it is precisely because Song Ziwen is overly qualified and capable that he has never been the Premier of the Executive Yuan until now. Although Chiang Kai-shek is known for his magnanimity in tolerating opposition, he cannot escape the common flaws of a "dictator." Ordinary dictators are cowards. Although they are said to be cowards, it does not mean they fear "death." To protect their personal power, they are always suspicious and fear that someone will compete for "their" power. Although Chiang Kai-shek is a dictator, he is different from dictators like Stalin and Hitler. His dictatorial foundation is built on the balance of power among various factions (please see my book "Further Discussion on the Chongqing Regime"), so his level of paranoia is the greatest. Chiang Kai-shek will never allow anyone around him to exist who can rival his power. Although Song Ziwen is not Chiang Kai-shek's opponent in terms of ability and qualifications, as Anglo-American pressure increases universally around the world, a group of people gradually gathers around Song Ziwen, such as Wang Zhengting, Gu Weijun, Wang Chonghui, Guo Taiqi, and Chen Guangfu, all of whom are not directly affiliated with Chiang Kai-shek and are supporting Song Ziwen. Chiang Kai-shek cannot help but pay attention to this. This is one reason why Chiang Kai-shek has not heavily relied on Song Ziwen. However, today, Chiang Kai-shek is already in a situation where he cannot "do as he pleases" or think "I am the state."

Question: What exactly is the situation that forces Chiang Kai-shek to let Song Ziwen succeed as Premier of the Executive Yuan?

Answer: First, there is the issue of dealing with the United States. Chongqing is superficially fulfilling the democratic demands of the United States by partially reorganizing the government, replacing He Yingqin with Chen Cheng as Minister of Military Affairs, and replacing Kong Xiangxi with Yu Hongjun as Minister of Finance. However, such reorganization, as pointed out by the Moscow government newspaper "Izvestia" (December 2nd), is entirely a "pretentious" reorganization. The United States is very dissatisfied with this superficial reorganization, so to deal with Chongqing's perfunctory attitude, the United States directly exchanged military delegations with the Chinese Communist Party. This is what Chiang Kai-shek fears most. Chiang Kai-shek's greatest opponent is not Japan, but the Chinese Communist Party. He believes that although Japan is strong, it can be dealt with by the United States. As for the Chinese Communist Party, he must deal with it himself. But contrary to his wishes, the United States recognized the existence of the political power of the Chinese Communist Party, not only exchanging military observation groups with them, but also having the US Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, personally visit the Yan'an government, attempting to resolve the Kuomintang-Communist issue. Chiang Kai-shek is not stupid. He knows that adopting the same hard-line policy towards the United States' emphasis on Yan'an is harmful and brings no benefit. Therefore, he brought out Song Ziwen, who is favored by the Americans.

Second, there is the relationship with the war situation. The Chongqing government stated in the December 18th edict to the press: "Chongqing hopes that the United States will land on the Chinese mainland before the complete recapture of the Philippines. The early landing of American troops on the Chinese coast is in accordance with the unanimous demands of all the Allied countries." Chiang Kai-shek also feels that he cannot cope with the current war situation on his own. Originally, Chiang Kai-shek did not want American troops to land. It would be a highly desirable thing for American troops to land in China and fight to the death with Japanese troops, but the future is frightening. Aesop's fable "The Horse's Revenge" tells the story of a horse seeking help from a man to take revenge on a deer. The man rode the horse to chase the deer and finally killed it. However, later, the man realized that the horse was the most useful animal, so he used the horse as a means of transportation. This is the author's beginning of a Western pun on "horse-deer" (which in Japanese means foolish). Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek is cautiously and vigilantly guarding against Chongqing imitating the story of the horse relying on man to kill the deer. However, the situation has reached such an urgent stage that it does not allow for considering the future. Currently, the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army and the Northern Expeditionary Army departing from Annam have completely converged in Huanlu, Guangxi Province, on December 10th. As a result, the Third, Fourth, and Seventh War Zones have been completely cut off from communication with Chongqing. The military situation in these three war zones is very clear: Chongqing has neither the strength nor the will to break through the Japanese defense line and open up a supply line. Their only hope is for American troops to land on the southern coast and establish a supply line from the sea. Otherwise, these three war zones will not be able to sustain themselves. They certainly know that the Japanese army will not launch large-scale operations against the Third and Fourth War Zones, but when Chongqing's troops are cut off from their supply lines, soldiers often turn into bandits and commit crimes among the people. Of course, Chongqing has never been afraid of its own soldiers committing crimes among the people, but what Chongqing fears most is that the Chinese Communist Party will take this opportunity to show goodwill to the people, highlight the evil of the Chongqing army, and win over the hearts of the people in these two war zones to establish a consolidated regime. Looking at the examples of northern Jiangsu and Shandong, after Chongqing's troops are cut off from their supply lines, they cannot survive and will self-destruct, but in such war zones, the strength of the Chinese Communist Party rapidly develops. This trend is currently manifesting itself significantly in various parts of Zhejiang Province. To prevent this trend, Chongqing has to welcome American troops to land. Even if the landing of American troops is harmful to China's independence and autonomy, it is not an immediate harm. For a debilitated opium addict, stopping the supply of opium will lead to death. Therefore, for such a terminally ill opium addict, even knowing that opium is poisonous, one has no choice but to supply it. To save itself from the current crisis, Chongqing, knowing that the landing of American troops is harmful, has no choice but to hope for it. As Chongqing has such a weakness, the United States wants to take full advantage of this weakness. As for the landing operation, it has never given Chongqing a definite date, deliberately making Chongqing anxious, thereby the United States wants to force Chongqing to make a political concession. Chongqing is now truly like ants on a hot pan and has fallen into the trap of the United States. This is the second reason for Chongqing's further reorganization.

Third, there is the demand for Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. The Japanese army has already entered the territory of Guizhou Province, posing a threat to the heart of Chongqing. The UP correspondent stationed in Chongqing, with keen senses, even predicted that Chongqing's fate would be decided within two months. Chiang Kai-shek also increasingly felt the thorniness of the issue, so he transferred Hu Zongnan's mechanized forces of 300,000, which had consistently been surrounding the CCP, to reinforce and take on the defense of Chongqing. As a result, the actual pressure from Chongqing on the CCP has been greatly reduced, imperceptibly. As a result, the CCP's attitude seems to have become even more justified. Today, Chiang Kai-shek can only rely on political compromise to suppress the CCP. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's attitude towards the CCP is no longer the openly unreasonable and insincere Kuomintang-Communist cooperation negotiations that it used to be. Now Chiang Kai-shek has to pretend to be sincere. To put on a show, he has to put figures trusted by the CCP in prominent positions in the Chongqing regime. Currently, the politicians most trusted by the CCP in Chongqing are only Song Ziwen and Sun Ke. The CCP calls these two the two liberals of Chongqing. However, the time for Sun Ke to rise to prominence has not yet arrived. Moreover, the current stage of the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation negotiations is showing a triangular relationship between the CCP, the United States, and Chongqing. Therefore, Song Ziwen, who has considerable relationships with all three of the above, is truly the most suitable figure. This is the third reason why Song Ziwen was appointed as Premier of the Executive Yuan.

Question: After Song Ziwen takes power, is there hope for improvement in Kuomintang-Communist cooperation in the near future?

Answer: Before discussing this issue, we need to first examine Song Ziwen's character. Let's leave aside the question of whether Song Ziwen is a capable financier. It is enough to explain his position on the Chinese revolution. I believe that he, like most wealthy intellectuals, is a "coward" when it comes to social revolution. This is by no means my personal opinion. Just mentioning his attitude towards the Wuhan Revolution will make it clear. Vincent Sheean, the American journalist who encouraged Song Ziwen to participate in the Wuhan government at the time, wrote in his diary:

"Song Ziwen is very smart and can understand that the true successor of the Kuomintang is the Wuhan government, not Chiang Kai-shek's warlord dictatorship (at least he said so). Although he has been threatened and tempted, he has always refused to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's government. His residence is often under surveillance by secret agents, so he has become a very nervous person. He has never stepped out of the French Concession and the Public Concession. Because Chiang Kai-shek's henchmen are everywhere in Chinese-controlled areas, there is always the possibility of being arrested. If Chiang Kai-shek catches him, he will either be the Minister of Finance or go to jail, one or the other. I don't believe they would kill him, but he is worried about this. He is truly a coward of the first order. And the proposal I brought from Hankou is a way to save him from this predicament. He immediately agreed and asked me to buy a ticket on the same ship as me for a Cantonese man named Zai. He repeatedly asked about the situation in Hankou.

The next day, he changed his mind. He changed his mind after discussing it with his mother, sisters, and brother-in-law. His family is extremely reactionary. He nervously became neurotic and said: 'I have no reason to go to Hankou. You know that I am not a social revolutionary, I hate revolution, I do not believe in revolution. When the labor and peasant policies force merchants and industrialists to stop operating, how can I balance the budget, how can I issue currency? I cannot convince the Central Executive Committee...' This change of mind dominated his mind for a week. I think this is the greatest manifestation of his typical liberal wavering" (Personal History: By Vincent Sheean P.254-255).

Anna Louise Strong, who was close to Song Ziwen in the same era as Vincent Sheean, also made the same comment about Song Ziwen:

"Song Ziwen was born to be a conservative industrialist, having studied at Harvard University in the United States. He naturally likes industrialists and hates communists and workers. His obvious future is to be an industrialist in Shanghai. If he had met the Kuomintang advisor, the Russian Borodin, and not been influenced by him, he would definitely be a wealthy industrialist in Shanghai. The revolution has given Song Ziwen power and the opportunity to build national finances. What destroys his achievements and deprives him of his property are the warlords. Therefore, Song Ziwen hates communists and also hates warlords. As for building a national bank, the communists have a good attitude, and the worst and most unreasonable are the warlords. Although the Wuhan government cannot satisfy his desires, it has given him the opportunity to create national finances. And the Wuhan government is holding high the banner of the people's government against the warlords. So he hopes to go to Wuhan and see the success of Wuhan. And he knows that his mission is calling him. But he did not go to Wuhan. Because he has too deep personal relationships with Chiang Kai-shek and the merchants of Shanghai.

He said to me: 'Go up the Yangtze River as soon as possible! There is nothing to hear and nothing to see in Nanjing. Everywhere there are colorful slogans and the old corruption of China. Wuhan is the opposite of Nanjing, full of meaningful social experiments.' He repeatedly sent letters to Sun Yat-sen's wife Song Qingling and his old friend Borodin, saying that he would go to Wuhan as soon as he could escape Chiang Kai-shek's eyes and ears. ... He seemed to want to do this sincerely. He has his personal difficulties. But the last time he met me, he unconsciously said: 'Goodbye! We will meet in Beijing! Farewell for now.' Based on this sentence, I knew the path he should take. He is prepared to wait until he understands that everything is safest in terms of life and reputation."

There are countless materials explaining his character. I am just selecting one or two observations from Americans who were particularly close to him from countless materials to narrate. Of course, a person often progresses through cultivation. The current Song Ziwen may be more mature and sophisticated than the Song Ziwen of fifteen years ago. Although his social status has become increasingly solid, I have never heard of any revolutionary transformation in his thinking. It is true that he has had considerable understanding of the CCP since the War of Resistance Against Japan. This is a fact. But I think this is a bluff made to counter Chiang Kai-shek's dislike of him. If Song Ziwen really has this character, wouldn't he be able to use his courage and personality to make the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party unprecedentedly better?

Question: Then does Song Ziwen's assumption of the premiership have no political significance at all?

Answer: On the contrary, it has great political significance. It is the most significant event reflecting the current world situation. As you know, the anti-Axis side believes that the current question is whether the world belongs to the Soviet Union or to the United States. This either/or question was discussed by the general public long after the end of World War I. In 1928, Edgar Mowrer wrote on the second page of his book "This American World":

"Europe in the past has determined the fate of most of humanity on Earth. However, at present, Europe is gradually losing this decisiveness. Modern Europeans are not comparable to their past era of self-satisfaction and swaggering. The great ideas of Europe, of course, are still radiating light, but it is in the distant, dense clouds. Most of humanity openly admits that what they expect in their subconscious, 'a new culture, a new religion, a new spirit,' may be seen not in the Soviet Union but in the United States, these two absolutely opposite fields of different spirits. However, the Soviet Union has not yet fully grown its feathers and is still developing. And the other, the United States, has already stood out from the crowd. Because of this, the leaders of the Soviet Union are looking for samples of material development in the United States."

Mowrer wrote this book in 1928. Sixteen years have now passed. During this period, the Soviet Union has grown into adulthood, and the "Bobbit" civilization of the United States has reached maturity. What is particularly obvious in the recent world situation is the struggle and compromise between these two forces. Can these two forces compromise? Or will a head-on conflict occur in the near future? This question is the greatest force affecting the current World War. Of course, everyone wants to end this World War II as soon as possible, but the fact is that it is still far from over. As for whether World War II will be followed by World War III, or whether it will break out again after a longer or shorter period of stability, this is the crux of the matter. When Mr. Chen Youren was alive, I often discussed this question with him. Based on the trends of several meetings between the three powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, he believed that the two forces might reach some kind of agreement, so he thought there would be a considerable period of stability. As for me, I think that the current Soviet Union is indeed working hard to strive for a certain degree of agreement on dividing the spheres of influence in the world. This kind of agreement may be established. But this kind of agreement, to use a metaphor, is equivalent to an agreement using the riverbank as the dividing line between land and sea. The riverbank is constantly changing due to high and low tides, so what is currently called land becomes the riverbank itself during high tide. Specifically, after the Soviet Union and Britain reach an agreement, the Soviet Union will declare to the world that it will not promote communism. Such an agreement may be established. But within the dividing line agreed upon by the two, as long as there are people and class struggle, their own movement will determine whether they go to the world of the Soviet Union or to the world of Britain and the United States (or to neither). No matter what kind of agreement the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States reach, after the national government of each country determines its political system, it will have no effect. Therefore, no matter how the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States reach an agreement to divide the world, it is often overturned by the national government movements of each country, thereby destroying the balance between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, and intensifying their opposition. Look at the current civil unrest in Greece that has shocked the world, and the opposition of the two Polish governments, which is the best example. In addition to these conflicts on the surface, there are also these conflicts in the dark, such as the opposition between the French de Gaulle government and the communist armed forces, and the internal opposition in Italy and Yugoslavia. Stalin has full confidence in the development of the national movements of each country, so he is very happy to conclude agreements with Britain and the United States. However, Stalin knows in his heart that this kind of agreement cannot continue forever. Naturally, Roosevelt and Churchill also know this. As long as Germany and Japan exist powerfully for one day, Roosevelt and Churchill must, even knowing that it is temporary, conclude agreements with the Soviet Union and spread all illusions to the people, believing that the world after World War II will achieve stability. This is the weakness of Britain and the United States.

Question: Wait! Didn't Roosevelt declare that the political system of each country in the post-war world will be determined by the people of each country?

### Merchants Request Electricity Allocation: Over Three Thousand Families. Implementation and Supply Distribution to be Considered Based on Order

Previously, the city's Bureau of Economic Affairs halted electricity supplies to general manufacturers as a result of the Luo Zhong Water and Electricity Company discontinuing service, bringing production to a standstill. Following discussions between the Bureau and relevant authorities, the decision was made to organize the registration of electricity consumption for all factories in the city, and staff were dispatched to conduct on-site investigations. After convening discussions with city merchants, industry associations were instructed to submit reports to the Bureau in advance for implementation. Since this began, it has been reported that over three thousand businesses have submitted electricity applications to date. The Bureau will consider order of allocation, It is our understanding that many factories have yet to submit reports, hence distribution will be delayed until this takes place. Electricity allocation will be implemented in the order that reports are submitted. The bureau hopes merchants will no longer delay submission.

### Municipal Schools: Provisional Fee Collection Methods; Revised and Promulgated by the Municipal Bureau of Education

The Shanghai Special Municipality Bureau of Education has recently revised the provisional fee collection methods for municipal primary and secondary schools as follows:

(1) Municipal primary and secondary schools must follow these regulations when collecting various fees from students.

(2) Tuition fees collected by municipal primary and secondary schools from students are specifically for improving the treatment of faculty and staff. The amount of fees collected will be determined by the Municipal Bureau of Education by district each semester, submitted to the Municipal Government, and then forwarded to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation. (Attached is a table of the fee collection standards for municipal primary and secondary schools in each district for the second semester of the 33rd year [1944]). For first-class district secondary schools, the junior high school fee is 1800 yuan, and the senior high school fee is 2400 yuan. For second-class district secondary schools, the junior high school fee is 1300 yuan, and the senior high school fee is 1600 yuan. For first-class district primary schools, the lower grade fee is 1200 yuan, the middle grade fee is 1400 yuan, and the upper grade fee is 1600 yuan. For second-class district primary schools, the lower grade fee is 600 yuan, the middle grade fee is 700 yuan, and the upper grade fee is 800 yuan. For third-class district primary schools, the lower grade fee is 500 yuan, the middle grade fee is 600 yuan, and the upper grade fee is 700 yuan. For newly designated third-class district primary schools, the lower grade fee is 250 yuan, the middle grade fee is 300 yuan, and the upper grade fee is 350 yuan.

(Explanation) 1. First-class districts refer to schools in each district where the economic conditions of student families are the best. 2. Second-class districts refer to schools in each district where the economic conditions of student families are the next best. 3. Third-class districts refer to schools in each district where the economic conditions of student families are relatively poor. 4. Newly designated third-class districts refer to schools in each district where the economic conditions of student families are the worst. 5. All primary and secondary schools that were formerly established by the Public Works Department and the Municipal Council and are now municipal schools should uniformly collect fees according to the above standards from the second semester of the 33rd year [1944]. The school class will be determined by the Municipal Bureau of Education. However, the fee collection methods for foreign children's primary and secondary schools will be determined separately because all students are of foreign nationality. Half-day primary schools are of the nature of short-term primary schools, and they are allowed to collect half of the fee amount of the newly designated third-class primary schools. Night school tuition fees will also be determined separately by this bureau.

(3) Municipal primary and secondary schools with library facilities may collect library fees, specifically for purchasing essential reference books for students in the library. Those with sports facilities may collect sports fees, specifically for providing students with sports, hiking, travel, and hygiene supplies. (Attached is a table of the library and sports fee collection standards for municipal primary and secondary schools for the second semester of the 33rd year [1944]). The library fee for secondary schools is 100 yuan, and the sports fee is 50 yuan. The library fee for primary schools is 50 yuan, and the sports fee is 20 yuan.

(Explanation) 1. For the above library and sports fees, if student families have economic difficulties and it is inconvenient to collect them, each school may decide on its own to waive all fees, or waive fees for some students, or reduce the amount. 2. All fees collected above must be used by each school according to the specified purposes and must not be used for other purposes. 3. All schools that collect the above fees must prepare a budget of income and expenditure and submit it to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval at the beginning of each semester. At the end of the semester, they must submit a statement of income and expenditure for review along with the vouchers. 4. The fees for school supplies collected by each school from students are purely for agency purposes. The Municipal Bureau of Education will investigate the price situation each semester and separately determine the full amount and issue a notice for implementation. 5. If each school has student accommodation facilities and collects student accommodation fees, the full amount of fees collected each semester should be submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval. 6. All miscellaneous fees, tutoring fees, and other names previously collected by each school are hereby canceled and must not be collected again. Violators will be treated as embezzlement and fraud. 7. If the principals of each school make false reports regarding various fees or collect fees without approval, they will be punished accordingly upon investigation. 8. The amount of tuition fees collected by each school should be handled in accordance with the standards stipulated by the bureau for each district. If there are special circumstances that require changes, they should be collected after being submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval. 9. Municipal secondary schools should set up free places for no less than 15% and no more than 20% of the total number of students. Municipal primary schools should set up free places for no less than 20% of the total number of students. The maximum standard for free places in primary schools in first-class districts should not exceed 25% of the total number of students, in second-class districts should not exceed 30%, in third-class districts should not exceed 35%, and in newly designated third-class districts should not exceed 40%.

The increased passenger ticket prices and express train ticket prices from Shanghai to major stations are recorded as follows:

### Large Pancakes and Steamed Buns Exempt from Consumption Special Tax

Recently, prices have soared, and the lives of ordinary people have been severely threatened. In view of this, the municipal authorities, in addition to allocating large quantities of flour to various industries through the Flour Distribution Office, have also approved the Shanghai Special Municipality Pancake and Steamed Bun Guild's request to the Finance Bureau that steamed buns sold by all pancake stalls, whether filled or unfilled, be exempt from the consumption special tax, citing the Ministry of Finance's announcement that restaurants that only sell "one dish and one rice" to provide sustenance for ordinary people are exempt from the consumption special tax.

### Civil Defense Air Raid Instructors

The Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters, in order to strengthen civil air defense and cultivate air defense instructors, has established an air defense training center, selecting outstanding police and security personnel from various districts for rigorous training. The first class of 128 students has completed their training and passed the examination, qualifying as civil defense air raid instructors. Therefore, the headquarters has issued them certificates, filling in their names, ages, addresses, and the names of their respective Baojia, and attaching a photo of themselves in the upper left corner for identification. They have also been issued a white "Civil Defense Air Raid Instructor" armband, and a badge with a national emblem in blue on the front and the words "Air Defense" above and below, and the words "Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters Air Defense Training Graduates" in gold on the back, as a reward. It is stipulated that in the future, the Baojia in each district should assist these instructors in air defense situations and follow their guidance.

### We Urgently Request Capable Individuals to Speed Up Assistance to New Students Who Apply for General Responses

Looking around the schools in Shanghai, there are quite a few that carefully consider the actual situation, understand the burden on students' parents, and do their best to reduce tuition fees. However, some schools are strictly ordering students to pay tuition in full, and limiting them to pay tuition and miscellaneous fees within the year; otherwise, they will not issue grade reports, will not allow them to receive admission certificates, and will even prevent them from starting classes, using this as intimidation, causing students to cry and ask their parents, and parents are unable to cope due to their lives, so they have turned to the Shen and Xin newspapers to ask for student loans. The front of this office is quickly crowded with these lovely poor students, and the rest of the letters requesting assistance are also flying in like snowflakes, filling the desk. Besides expressing deep sympathy and comfort for this situation, the staff of this newspaper only feel that their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient, and they cannot help. Looking at this year's grant budget, even if we can raise 30 million yuan, assisting the previous 4,500 or so old students, at an average of 10,000 yuan per person, will require more than 45 million yuan, which is still a considerable difference; moreover, so far we have only raised less than 20 million yuan (as of today, we have a total of 18,880,000 yuan). It seems that we are not sure about assisting new students, so we simply cannot help new students who come to ask for help in person or by letter! Your requests only increase our anxiety and guilt. When can we open "applications for new students"? Only enthusiastic people in society with strong power can answer. We are willing but unable, and we dare not harbor a psychology of perfunctoriness and deception.

### Song Ziwen's Entry into the Cabinet and Chongqing's Vexation

— Yoshida Toyosuke

(Continued from the Second Edition)

Answer: Yes. However, is America truly capable of doing so? I dare to assert that post-war America will absolutely not have room to adopt the current liberal diplomatic policy. The reason is simple: America, as it boasts itself, is the arsenal of the world's anti-Axis powers. America's military industry is supplying the vast amount of weapons consumed daily by anti-Axis nations worldwide. In particular, the development of the military industry has undeniably achieved considerable success recently. For example, taking the production index of aircraft in 1941 as 100, according to American propaganda, it was 344 in 1942, even more in 1943, and in 1944, it will exceed ten times that. Thus, America's military industry, having engaged in procurement on an unprecedented scale, cannot but proceed to consumption on an unprecedented scale as well. In other words, from whichever perspective one looks at it, American financial capitalism has already developed to the point where it must dominate the entire world. Based on this, two characteristics are clearly revealed in America's foreign policy. First, America can no longer maintain the liberal diplomacy it has always practiced in the Western Hemisphere. This is the reason for Hull's oppression of South American diplomacy, and the reason for the discord between Argentina and the United States. Second, America's foreign policy has recently ceased to refer solely to the Western Hemisphere; it has now reached the point where it cannot survive by relying solely on the Western Hemisphere market. The world market has become an indispensable necessity for American capitalist production. Roosevelt knows this very well, so during the war, he sent economic advisors to various parts of the world to obtain the necessary lifelines to maintain the world market.

Therefore, if the various markets predetermined by the United States after the war break away from American control, or if they completely establish independent economic policies, America's wartime investment will not only be wasted, but will also pose a crisis to the very survival of American capitalism. The freedom of each country to choose its political system cannot be allowed.

Question: The issue has gone too far afield. What is the relationship between the current situation in America and Song Ziwen's rise to power?

Answer: Roosevelt wants to firmly grasp the investment market for American post-war financial capital. Regarding this, the Lisbon dispatch on January 5th contained a passage saying: "The American industrial and commercial giants represented by the American Chamber of Commerce have been secretly working for a reciprocal trade treaty between the United States and China for the past year. But this anticipates that post-war China will experience a great new era of industrial development. Chamber President Kelley declared that Chongqing spokesmen have assured that Chongqing has revised its various regulations on foreign trade and investment under a liberal approach, and that free enterprise is protected by a modernized independent judiciary."

Song Ziwen's rise to power is the result of the new Chongqing path that Kelley spoke of. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek declared that party politics would also be implemented during the war, which is also a product of the same path. In a sense, this is a concession by Chongqing's nationalists to American financial capitalism.

Question: Chongqing's concessions to the United States will tend to intensify from now on, so ultimately Chongqing will become a colony of the United States. In order to counter this, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the CCP is becoming increasingly close, so wouldn't Chongqing be divided into a Sovietized China and an Americanized China?

Answer: In my presence, it is best to use less of the worthless propagandist's tone; I do not wish to hear such words. If the thing called "nation-state" is an economic range, the result will either become hidden or apparent due to the changes in the economic territory. Because China's capitalism does not have sufficient economic territory to prevent the invasion of American capitalism, and the economic territory that bitterly hates the CCP's workers and peasants has no reason to reject Soviet communist theory. For this reason, if pure economic struggle determines history, then Chongqing's territory can only become a battlefield between an Americanized China and a Sovietized China, and there is no other way to go. However, at present, no Chinese person is fighting for a Sovietized China or for an Americanized China. At the same time, in the peace zones, no pure Chinese person is fighting for a Japanized China. The purpose is all to fight for China's independence and autonomy. This is the characteristic of the "nation-state". Therefore, the term nation has again become a problem. Marxists believe that the nation "is formed by the elements of capitalist development, so the differences between nations will naturally disappear with the demise of capitalism" (Stalin's "On the National Question", I can only write it from memory because I do not have the book at hand). But in any case, one cannot but admit that "the elimination of national differences is first of all a long-term task, and can only be realized under the conditions of future social transformation" (Mitin's "Dictionary of Materialism").

The elements of national formation are the commonality of language, territory, economic life, and psychological habits. These elements are all acquired, but in a nation formed by the commonality of blood, such as the Japanese nation or the Chinese nation, the "blood" element is by no means acquired. Will this element also disappear with the demise of capitalism? Now, let us assume for the time being that other elements of national formation completely disappear, then will the group of Asians and the group of Caucasians completely eliminate any psychological antagonism and unite? Now, let us put the American example in the laboratory of national questions for analysis. Indeed, there is no longer any difference between German-Americans, British-Americans, and Russian-Americans among the American people. However, is there no "national" difference between Asian-Americans, Black-Americans, and White-Americans? Let's say it's not a national difference, but in terms of social treatment or social psychology, it cannot be said that there is absolutely no concept of racial discrimination. If China is incorporated into the world of the United States or the world of the Soviet Union, and such a concept of racial discrimination can be immediately guaranteed to be eliminated, I have no doubt. But I believe that in that case, the concept of racial discrimination will continue to be a social scorn. The difference in skin color and body structure between Asians and Caucasians is the material condition for this social scorn. How does Marxism understand this material condition? I believe that Japanese and Chinese people with such innate characteristics, if they do not first show strong power to the world, those Caucasians will not easily eliminate this scorn. I believe that the Japanese who have experienced the Meiji Restoration, and the Chinese who are currently carrying out the national liberation revolution, are all very clear about this point. Therefore, all Chinese people with a conscience do not want to use Japanese power to fight for independence and autonomy today, and do not want to rely on Soviet power to seek national liberation. They always want to rely on their own efforts, they want to complete the Chinese revolution by their own efforts, so that when China shows the face of a master to slaves, they should immediately resist, and not be servile and submissive. This is the spirit of national revolution. The Japanese must trust the Chinese national spirit a little more. The Japanese do not need to worry about the infiltration of American power into Chongqing, and even less need to worry about the political influence of Yan'an expanding due to the expansion of Soviet power. What is worrying is whether the Japanese fully understand this spirit of Chinese national revolution.

It is generally said that this year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War. The so-called decisive battle is by no means simply a war with weapons in hand, nor is it simply being enslaved to increase production in the rear. If the Japanese do not understand this spirit of Chinese revolution this year, and do not correct the erroneous attitude of arrogance, then the decisive year will only be the Japanese's decisive year, and it will never be able to become the decisive year of the entire Asian nation. And the Greater East Asia War will not be easily won without the actual participation of the entire Asian people. Only when the Japanese fully realize this can they lay the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. (Translated by Jing)

In order to carry out the education and upbringing work for more than 300 refugee children, the Chinese Ciyou Association held a fundraising campaign a few days ago, which was well supported by the society and achieved good results. As of yesterday, a total of 6,721,496 yuan in donations had been received. The largest amount of donations was raised by Yang Pengnian, General Manager of Datong Enterprise Bank, at 981,070 yuan. His wife, Mrs. Yang, has a benevolent heart and has sponsored ten refugee children of the Association for two years. Two of the children are now studying in secondary school, and she often sends people to give them clothing and daily necessities to encourage them. The Yangs are a model for society in their enthusiasm for cultivating children from impoverished backgrounds. However, according to the current price situation, the Association needs to raise 10 million yuan to maintain expenses for half a year. There is still a shortfall of more than 3 million yuan in donations. In addition to the efforts of the Association's standing committee members Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and Ding Boxiong to promote the campaign, it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to donate generously and participate in this grand event.
