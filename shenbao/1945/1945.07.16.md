### Hokkaido Area Base Harbor Suffers First Air Raid Yesterday; Enemy Warships Shell Area Near Kamaishi

Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 14th: Enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked our air bases and harbors in the Tohoku region and southern Hokkaido several times on the morning of the 14th. On the same day at noon, a portion of enemy warships echoed this, conducting naval bombardments near Kamaishi.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 14th, carrier-based aircraft from enemy mobile forces attacked the Tohoku region and southern Hokkaido. On the morning of the 15th at around 6:00 AM, a portion of a mobile force composed of battleships, cruisers, destroyers, etc., attacked Hokkaido and the Tohoku region. Simultaneously, a portion of an enemy mobile force composed of battleships and cruisers conducted naval bombardment of factory facilities in the Muroran area of Hokkaido from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy mobile force had previously suffered continuous fierce attacks from Japanese special attack units in the Okinawa sea area, losing approximately half of its aircraft carrier strength. However, they subsequently exerted great effort in re-equipping. At dawn on the 10th, a mobile force composed of more than ten aircraft carriers, etc., approached the Japanese mainland southeast of the Kanto region, launching approximately 1,200 carrier-based aircraft to attack Japanese air bases in various parts of Kanto throughout the day. Afterwards, due to weather and other reasons, they immediately withdrew from our sphere of influence in the eastern sea, awaiting an opportunity to attack. On the 14th, they approached the mainland again, attacking Japanese air bases and harbors in the Tohoku region and southern Hokkaido with carrier-based aircraft. Simultaneously, a portion of their warships echoed this, conducting naval bombardments in the Kamaishi area. It is noted that this is the first time enemy carrier-based aircraft have attacked Tohoku and Hokkaido, and they simultaneously conducted naval bombardments. However, we cannot consider this naval bombardment as the first step towards landing. The enemy's execution of this type of naval bombardment is merely a diversionary tactic, and there is currently no intention to land. Therefore, the enemy's air raid on the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions is to expand the operational range of B-29 aircraft based in the Mariana Islands. At the same time, the enemy aims to destroy Japanese air power. Therefore, the enemy mobile force is accompanied by oil tankers, enabling it to operate independently for two to three weeks. Based on this observation, it is feared that enemy carrier-based aircraft will continue to attack the mainland coast in the future, and their naval guns may continue to bombard coastal areas.

### War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The war situation in various parts of East Asia for the past week is as follows: From the perspective of the movements of enemy base air power, the forces in the Mariana Islands have been dispersed this week, with a tendency for simultaneous air raids in multiple locations. P-51 and PB4Y aircraft from Iwo Jima attacked airfields in the Tokai Naval District and laid mines to blockade various ports along the Japanese mainland coast. Regarding the movements of enemy air power in the Okinawa area, they have gradually advanced and strengthened their bases on the main island. Medium-sized aircraft and night fighters have appeared, attacking airfields in the Kyushu area, and it is expected that this will become even more intensified in the future. At the same time, the enemy must mobilize a large number of ships and pour in huge amounts of materials, making the special attack aviation center, which is the center of air power, the focus of their operations, launching attacks every day, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Japanese forces in the Philippines continue to use the Cagayan Valley in northern Luzon as a base for counterattacks, engaging in active and courageous decisive battles. Due to continuous losses and sacrifices, the enemy ground forces have recently experienced a severe shortage of manpower, and have transferred the black troops of the 93rd and 13th Divisions to Cagayan in an attempt to reverse the decline. At the same time, the enemy air force in the Philippines has deployed part of its forces to attack Taiwan, another part to operations in Borneo, and the remaining half to Okinawa Island. From this, it can be seen that the enemy, who boasts of air power, is finding it difficult to allocate air force resources to all areas as the theater of war continues to expand. In Borneo, both sides are in a standoff in various regions such as Tarakan, Balikpapan, and Brunei. Japanese forces in Miri are intensifying their attacks in various locations, especially fierce battles are being waged northwest of Balikpapan to block the enemy's advance. However, the enemy's intentions are extremely stubborn, and they continue to reinforce their forces on the front line, urgently seeking to advance. On Ternate Island, as of July 12th, Japanese garrison troops were pressing the landing enemy forces towards the north, inflicting heavy attacks. In the Indian Ocean, although the activities of the British fleet are gradually showing a tendency to become more active, on July 5th and 6th, enemy naval forces again invaded the Nicobar Islands, stirring up trouble in the northern and southern parts of Kamorta and the western parts of Kotara, and on the 11th, a mobile force including two aircraft carriers launched 200 carrier-based aircraft in an attack. The war situation in the Pacific is such that the enemy's ambition for resource zones in the south is becoming increasingly evident, and their future movements should be closely monitored.

### Polish Priest Talks About Japan's Decisive Battle Situation

Zurich, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a French news agency dispatch from Helsinki, seven Polish priests who returned from Japan a month ago and are staying in Helsinki, spoke about the situation of the decisive battle in Japan as follows: Although many Japanese citizens have suffered damage from bombing, not a single one has succumbed to the air raids, and everyone's belief remains firm, with no fear. They believe that victory will belong to Japan no matter how long the war is prolonged. Although Japan's food situation is quite difficult, everything that can be obtained within the realm of possibility is distributed fairly. We, as travelers in Japan, are not restricted in any way.

### U.S. Aircraft Based in the Philippines Bomb Guangzhou City Area

Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - U.S. Air Force aircraft based in the Philippines, in a combined formation of approximately fifty fighter and bomber aircraft on the 12th and 13th, indiscriminately bombed various parts of Guangzhou city, dropping large bombs weighing from 100 to 250 kilograms on Chinese residential streets in the Xiguan and Henan districts, carrying out a "carpet bombing" atrocity.

### Japanese Army Active in the Shwe-dan River Basin

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The British-Indian Army Headquarters on the Burma front announced on the 13th as follows: Japanese army activity in the Shwe-dan River basin in Burma is gradually becoming more active. The Japanese army has a concentration of forces 36 kilometers northeast of Pegu.

### Italy Declares War on Japan

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Rome: The Italian government issued a proclamation on the 14th stating that Italy has now decided to formally declare war on Japan.

### Renewing the Plea for Needy and Outstanding Students

Since the launch of our newspaper's scholarship fund campaign, it has gone through eight sessions. Although we cannot say that it has been a great success, thanks to the enthusiasm of our readers for education, their active assistance, and their generous donations, quite a few needy and outstanding students have been rescued from the sea of lost education in these past few years. Other good deeds are done without expecting reward, and in reality, it is impossible to conduct a thorough investigation. However, the scholarship campaign is different. Donating more money means rescuing more students. Their academic performance, character, and grades can all be investigated, which directly and indirectly benefits society and the nation. Therefore, we have previously proposed the slogan "Helping with education is the greatest good, helping with education is the greatest joy," proving that this kind of good deed is especially worthy of praise and commendation.

On the recent launch date of the ninth scholarship fundraising campaign, we published an article titled "Pleading for Needy Students," hoping that our readers would make their best efforts, donate generously, actively solicit donations, and contribute together. The amount of money raised in this scholarship fundraising campaign exceeds the previous sessions by a huge amount, which also means that expectations for benefactors from all walks of life are particularly urgent. Therefore, we find it necessary to reiterate our views by renewing our plea to all sectors for the benefit of needy and outstanding students. Why is this so? The current social and national environment is at a turning point. Regardless of whether the environment is good or bad, the economic situation of middle- and lower-class citizens is extremely difficult. Maintaining their livelihoods has already become a great challenge, and they have to put their children's education in second place. As a result, tens of thousands of outstanding students are forced to drop out of school, wandering the streets, struggling for survival and losing their education for the sake of food. If this situation is allowed to continue, what kind of serious impact will it have on China's political and cultural aspects in the future? Therefore, we must not only continue to hold the old student scholarship campaign so that students who have previously benefited from social scholarships will not drop out of school, but also decide to selectively accept new students so that outstanding young people who were previously able to support themselves but are now about to drop out of school will also have the opportunity to receive social benefits and continue to complete their studies.

In order to achieve this ideal of rescuing outstanding young people who are dropping out of school for the country and society, the estimated fundraising target is 30 million yuan based on the lowest estimates. For the convenience of fundraising, it is divided into two types: honorary teams with at least 1 million yuan per team, and ordinary teams with at least 100,000 yuan per team. However, because there is only a little over a month left before the start of the next semester, we hope to reach this goal within one month, which means that at least 10 million yuan must be raised per day. In order to express our sincerity and determination in this regard, our newspaper and our colleagues, although being the most impoverished cultural enterprise and cultural workers, will first pledge two honorary teams ourselves, hoping that those who are richer than us can donate generously, and those who are the same as us do not need to be discouraged, and can pool their resources to establish one or several teams.

However, the total amount of donations received is only over 13 million yuan, which is too far from the expected goal! Thinking of the tens of thousands of young people who are eagerly awaiting scholarships to continue their studies, every one of our staff members cannot help but shed tears! Looking back at the donations in the past ten days, in addition to a small number of enthusiastic donors who donated the total amount, most of them saved on birthday celebrations or festival expenses, and transferred the cash gifts from relatives and friends to help. This is a very commendable good deed. However, we hope that people with relatively more generous economic conditions will donate generously, pledge or raise several honorary teams, and break our previous scholarship records. Secondly, the Zhongshi Tennis Club held a scholarship tennis match this time, and the results were excellent, which shows that there are many people who are happy to do good. In the future, we hope that enthusiasts from all walks of life will use various methods to complete our scholarship campaign. At the same time, we also sincerely hope that all the great benefactors who have enthusiastically solicited and donated funds in the past will continue their efforts, donate generously, so that people and those who care about scholarship undertakings can laugh through their tears as soon as possible, and sing praises for thousands of students!

### The Attitude That Should Be Had in Wartime Life

Under the frequent attacks of enemy aircraft, the lives of people in the Japanese mainland are inevitably affected to a considerable extent. Many innocent civilians have lost their homes and property under indiscriminate bombing, causing a lot of inconvenience in their lives. Therefore, some ignorant people even complain about the hardship of life. It is a common human weakness to reveal an unbearable mood when encountering adversity. However, victory is just around the corner, as long as you know how to fight for it. Therefore, a reporter from the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper went to ask the Abbot Watanabe Genryu Zenji of Sojiji Temple in Tsurumi (a suburb of Tokyo) about the attitude towards wartime life. The conversation is as follows:

Practice Self-Reflection

(Question) Recently, I often hear people talk about the decline of national morality, etc. What are the abbot's views on this?

(Answer) Yes, I have heard it too, but I don't think so. Even under the stress of life, people's hearts can still conform to morality. If you reflect for five or ten minutes a day, you won't overstep the mark.

(Question) However, the self-reflection that Zen masters talk about is related to education. Isn't it too difficult for ordinary people to reflect on their own?

(Answer) Yes. Education is wisdom. Knowledge is the substance of things, and wisdom is its operation, just like the relationship between a candle and its candlelight. There can also be a standard for judging the overall situation. It may be unreasonable to ask ordinary people to reflect on their own, but isn't there politics?

Improve National Morality

(Question) Even if national morality has not fallen, isn't the decline in national morality sufficient to affect the war?

(Answer) There are many cases in history where wars have failed due to the collapse of the rear. Therefore, the national moral compass indeed has a great effect on the execution of war, and we must find a way to improve it. However, the moral compass of our people is definitely not lower than that of Britain and the United States. Of course, generally speaking, the British and American people are rich in common sense, but their connection with the moral compass is not correct. If the investigation of things is not thorough, then one will be confined by things. Not being confined by things and not being bound by reason is the ultimate state of Zen. Regarding Germany's failure, the Germans were too confident in the power of science, which led to them being too subjective about things and tending to ignore their objective operations. Therefore, once they were defeated, they lost confidence. As a result, the weakness was exposed.

(Question) Like the moral compass, will the problem of food also depress the morale of the people?

(Answer) Today, we only ask to fill our stomachs, and even coarse food is okay. If we have such a mentality regarding the food problem, then there is nothing to worry about. Those who become depressed without delicacies are better off dead. I have been accustomed to coarse food since I was a child, and today's rations are very good to me. Of course, I am not asking everyone to be like me, but we should all be patient.

(Question) What are your thoughts on the B-29 bomber raids?

Should Be Calm During Air Raids

(Answer) I have no other thoughts. I had expected today's events from the beginning of the war. However, the strange thing is that some people panic when their houses are destroyed. People are bound to die. When you die, you can't take anything with you. As long as you don't die, what's so bad about burning down your house! The day before yesterday, my relative came to me and said that his house was destroyed and there was nothing to eat. Seeing that he was young, he said such unambitious words, which made me so angry. So I also said to him impolitely: You can also live in an air-raid shelter, and you can eat weeds! During the air raid on the 25th night, in the fireworks, I heard the roar of the B-29 flying overhead, which was really the roar of the devil! It was the devil's heart hidden under the mask of peace. Therefore, if we don't subdue it, true peace is definitely hopeless.

Special Attack Units and the Japanese Spirit

(Question) What are your thoughts on the special attack units?

(Answer) Ah, there are no appropriate words to praise them! The special attack units are the concrete expression of the Japanese spirit. Therefore, I think that all Japanese people can become special attack units in an emergency. Isn't this a strength of the Japanese spirit? Two or three days ago, I went to Tokyo and looked out the window of the train at the coastal situation. I only saw smoke coming from the houses. However, I deeply believe that the Japanese people will definitely rise from this scorched earth. From now on, we can only take out our true strength! (Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)

### Enemy Aircraft in Small Formations Attack Kyushu Area; Japanese Air Defense Unit Crashes Two of Them

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 40 enemy small aircraft from the Okinawa base attacked southern Kyushu around 2:00 PM on the 14th without any organization and left by 3:00 PM.

Because a part of his speech was deleted by the review authorities, the council members believed that this measure was a clear insult to the National Political Council and seriously protested to the review authorities. The part of Chiang's speech that was not published until the 11th. It is said that the key point of the problem is the Chongqing-Yan'an dispute, from which it can be seen that the Chongqing-Yan'an dispute is deep and complex.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the British capital: The Indian Affairs Bureau in London announced yesterday that the Simla Conference of Indian leaders convened by Lord Wavell, the Governor-General of India, ended without any achievement. The original text of the news said, "The British government announces that this Simla Conference convened to discuss the reform of Indian execution failed to reach an agreement between the Indian people and the British government, and ended without any achievement, which is a great regret."

### British Military Authorities Revoke Amity Ban on Germany

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters: General Montgomery officially announced yesterday the revocation of the "no friendship" ban on German troops and civilians, following in the footsteps of the Soviet military authorities.

Now, British troops in Germany and local adult German civilians can talk and interact." After the news was broadcast, it spread widely among the British and German troops and civilians in the Erfurt area.

### Joint Statement by Su and Yu: Both Sides Have Reached Understanding; Soong Tzu-wen and Entourage Speedily Return to Chongqing

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 15th - According to a Moscow dispatch, the Soviet government and the Yu side issued a joint statement on the 14th regarding the talks between Soong Tzu-wen and Stalin as follows: "The Soviet Union and Chongqing have held several talks over the past two weeks on various important issues in the relations between the two countries and have reached a mutual understanding. Chairman Stalin, being urgently required to go to Berlin to meet with Truman and Churchill, the talks have been temporarily suspended. Yu Executive Yuan President Soong Tzu-wen has set off to return to Yu, and the talks will be reopened in the near future."

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 15th - According to a Moscow dispatch: After six talks between Soong Tzu-wen and Chairman Stalin, Mr. Soong and his entourage departed from Moscow on the 14th and returned to Chongqing. Mr. Soong will report the results of this trip's talks to Chiang Kai-shek, discuss countermeasures, and plans to visit the Soviet Union again soon to continue talks. Furthermore, Moscow Radio, regarding these Yu-Soviet talks, stated that the two sides held talks in a harmonious atmosphere and have reached the goal of mutual understanding.

The Truth of the Talks Remains Unknown

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 15th - Stalin and Soong Tzu-wen's talks have reached five sessions, but the content of these talks has remained silent on both the Moscow and Chongqing sides, so the full truth cannot be known. Only British and neutral country newspapers have reported that the Soviet talks sought cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in order to resolve the establishment of a coalition government and delineate the status of Outer Mongolia. Moscow and Chongqing's opinions were difficult to reconcile, and it is expected that Soong Tzu-wen's negotiations face considerable difficulties. According to the "Observation Daily" commentary on the 8th, in the Moscow talks, the Yu side has the United States as a backer, but the Soviet Union does not want US concern to be concentrated in Chongqing. Although the Soviet Union's influence is limited to the Yan'an area, its intentions for China policy hope that China will achieve a unified coalition government with friendly relations with the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Kuomintang leaders have not paid attention to the Communist Party's proposed construction of a coalition government, and the Communist Party has also refused to send representatives to attend the National Political Council, thus leading to the rupture between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party today. If Soong Tzu-wen cannot break through this difficulty, he will lose Chiang Kai-shek's trust. Moreover, the purpose of the Moscow meeting is not only the Kuomintang-Communist issue alone. In short, if this issue cannot be resolved, the talks will lose their meaning. Furthermore, "The National Daily" speculated on the participation of Outer Mongolian Prime Minister Choibalsan in the Stalin-Soong meeting, stating that the talks only discussed the status of Outer Mongolia, but the Soviet government will never agree to the reintegration of the Outer Mongolian Republic into Chinese territory. If the Soviet Union can stop entering Xinjiang, Chongqing might be prepared to sacrifice Outer Mongolia, but that remains to be seen.

### British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Invited to Warsaw

Central News Agency Dispatch - According to TASS, Warsaw: British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, at the invitation of Polish Parliament Chairman Bolesław Bierut, arrived in Warsaw on July 12th. Welcoming Sir Archibald at the Warsaw airport were the chairman's personal representative, representatives from various countries' governments to Poland, and representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### Three Key Fascist Members Arrested

Central News Agency Dispatch - According to TASS, Rome: Rome Radio broadcast news from Florence stating that important Fascist Party members Spadini and Golemi have been arrested by local authorities and will soon be tried in the Supreme Court. At the same time, news has confirmed that Blackshirt leader Bellinelli has been arrested by the local police station and will be tried in the Supreme Court of Florence.

### Lawyer Argues: Pétain Should Be Sentenced to Death

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 15th - According to news from Paris: French defense lawyer Maître Fernand Payen, considering that former Vichy government head General Philippe Pétain will be tried on July 23rd, strongly advocated that Pétain be sentenced to death. Payen's reasoning is that General Pétain still held important positions and power during the defeat of France, in other words, Pétain's rise to power at the time was due to France's defeat. At the same time, Payen stated that he would summon fifteen witnesses at the start of the trial.

### New Situation in Zhejiang

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Tang Yi

Zhejiang stands at the forefront of the peace zone. Whether in military, political, or economic aspects, the environment is particularly complex. In recent years, it has truly been a case of bandits everywhere, rampant extortion, daily shortages of supplies, and difficult living conditions for the people. Facing many difficult problems, the successive Zhejiang authorities have deeply felt the suffering of untangling knotted silk. Since the National Government adjusted personnel and strengthened the local leader Chen Rong, the former provincial governor appeared in the posture of a soldier, leading his troops to Zhejiang, expanding the scope of the western Zhejiang territory, and laying the foundation for security. Recently, Ding Mocun took charge of Zhejiang's administration, adhering to his calm and pragmatic style and rich political experience, focusing on cultivating combat power, restoring transportation, increasing production, establishing security, and relieving the people's suffering. Since taking office on June 11th, in just over a month's short period, there has been significant progress in provincial administration, and the appearance has been renewed. This time, the reporter came to Zhejiang to visit and will briefly introduce aspects of administration, construction, and education to show a glimpse of the new Zhejiang.

Visiting the Department of Civil Affairs

The first visit was to Zhang Juan, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. Mr. Zhang served as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government in 1940, presiding over the cleansing work in Jiaxing, and deeply understood the situation in Zhejiang. Furthermore, because he worked under Ding Mocun's leadership in social welfare work at the beginning of the National Government's selection of the capital, Ding appointed Mr. Zhang to take charge of the important task of civil affairs when he took charge of Zhejiang. On the one hand, he was skilled at what he did, and on the other hand, in implementing Ding's policies, he could assist each other.

Mr. Zhang has a square face and a towering figure. At first glance, he is a pragmatic person. The reporter first asked about the Department of Civil Affairs' policy guidelines. Mr. Zhang said:

"Director Ding's policy for governing Zhejiang, from the perspective of civil affairs, is first to increase the authority of county magistrates, and second to strengthen Baojia and self-defense, which is to improve public organizations, such as the strict training of district, township, and town leaders and local administrative cadres.

"In the past, county magistrates could not command the various bureaus because their authority was not concentrated, and it was naturally very difficult to fully develop their talents and make achievements. The provincial government is planning to increase their authority. In the future, the heads of various county bureaus, such as police, finance, and education, will be recommended and appointed by the county magistrates. This will not only make it easier to cooperate but also more convenient to command."

The reporter interrupted to ask about the changes in the selection of county magistrates after Governor Ding took office. Mr. Zhang replied, "There are not many changes; the Haiyan county magistrate was dismissed for reasons, and there were slight adjustments in Hangxian, Chongde, and Deqing counties."

Mr. Zhang then said, "In addition to the two points mentioned above, such as promoting the National Mandatory Labor Law promulgated by the central government, popularizing social welfare undertakings, and promoting the conservation movement, etc., are also within the scope of the Department of Civil Affairs' work, and we plan to start work on them."

Territorial Scope

The reporter asked Mr. Zhang to explain the current area under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province. Mr. Zhang stood up and pointed to the map on the wall behind him, saying, "Zhejiang Province is currently divided into seven administrative regions: the first region is centered on Hang County, the second region is centered on Wuxing, the third region is centered on Jiaxing, and the fourth region is centered on Haiyan. The above four regions are called western Zhejiang. In eastern Zhejiang, there is the fifth region centered on Shaoxing, the sixth region centered on Ningbo, and the seventh region centered on Jinhua. At present, only the seventh region, that is to say, Jinhua, Zhuji, Yiwu, Pujiang, and Dongyang, cannot be pushed forward because of the military environment. In other words, out of the original thirty-five counties, the county administration of five counties is currently in a state of standstill."

The reporter asked for a more detailed explanation of the situation in Jinhua. Mr. Zhang was very frank and analyzed the military situation and needs very clearly. Apart from what did not need to be published, the general situation was roughly as follows:

In order to adapt to the war situation, the situation on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road may change in the future, but at the very least, the transportation line in eastern Zhejiang along the Qiantang River from Ningbo, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan to Hangzhou, whether railway or highway, must be ensured. Currently, there are still allied troops stationed in Jinhua City. In Zhuji, government orders can be fully implemented. The reporter asked about rumors in Shanghai that Jinhua was withdrawing its defenses. Mr. Zhang's conversation proved that this was completely untrue, saying, "The Yiwu county magistrate came from that area yesterday."

It is said that the situation in western Zhejiang has greatly improved recently. This is because the security forces have been strengthened. Several divisions stationed in northern Jiangsu in the past have gradually recovered in Wukang, Deqing, and Fuyang counties, which have been troubled by bandits for two years since they moved to western Zhejiang. The Deqing County Government has been living in exile in the New City for one or two years, and recently plans to move back to the county seat. The New Fourth Army in Changxing and Wuxing has temporarily retreated to the Tianmu Mountain area. Some of the Communist forces in western Zhejiang have gone to eastern Zhejiang. The reporter talked about the security problem in Taihu Lake. Mr. Zhang said, "Based on past experience, it will not work without the simultaneous cooperation of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces."

Situation in Western Zhejiang

While the reporter was waiting to see Governor Ding, he met Han Jun, the Wukang county magistrate who was returning to the province to report. In a hurry, he talked about the military situation in western Zhejiang. According to County Magistrate Han, the conflict between the Yu army and the Communist army in western Zhejiang is very fierce. In the past, the Yu army stationed in that area included the 79th Division, the 69th Division, and the 102nd Division, among which the 79th Division was disarmed by the New Fourth Army. The New Fourth Army in Wukang had seven or eight thousand people, with the title "Fourth Collection". They had powerful cannons and were powerful. Therefore, the Yu side sent five divisions, known as the Anti-Communist Allied Army, commanded by Zhao Jue, to launch an offensive against the New Fourth Army in the Anji area. The Yu army and the National army are on good terms. County Magistrate Han smiled as he talked about this.

It is said that Wukang used to have a very small territory. Because of the New Fourth Army last year, the people fled and there were only eighteen residents left. The former county magistrate had never taken office. Now the territory is gradually expanding, accounting for one-third of the county's area, with three districts, thirteen townships, thirty-three Bao, and more than 10,000 people under its jurisdiction. There are currently about 100 policemen with 60 guns and Allied troops stationed there. It is expected that within a month, government orders can be extended to two-thirds of the county. Local products such as mountain goods such as bamboo, wood, and tea are sold to Shanghai through Suzhou and Jiaxing. On July 10, the price of rice was 550,000 yuan per Lao Hu (a unit of measurement) per Shi (another unit of measurement). (Published on July 13)

### Central Bank Gold Inspection Office Continues Inspection; Unsound Business Practices of Banks; Helping Financial Institutions with Legitimate Business

The Central Reserve Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office, in order to crack down on premium cash, inspected various financial institutions this time and discovered that 35 banks and money shops were suspected of violating the laws and regulations on managing financial institutions and engaging in illegal business. Under the order of the Ministry of Finance, the licenses of five banks, including Shui Kang, were revoked a few days ago. Eleven banks and money shops, including Jin De, were temporarily suspended from business, and they will be allowed to resume business after internal management has been improved and reported to the Ministry for approval. Nineteen banks and money shops, including China Huimin, were fined for minor offenses. The 16 banks and money shops that have had their licenses revoked and temporarily suspended from business have all followed the liquidation and reorganization measures promulgated by the Central Bank Gold Inspection Office to carry out liquidation procedures. According to news from the Central Bank Gold Inspection Office, it will continue to conduct strict inspections in the future to eliminate unsound business practices and help stabilize finance. However, the Central Reserve Bank will help with legitimate businesses of financial institutions that are facing difficulties.

### Restrictions on Bank Transfer Applications

In order to help regulate financial institutions and prevent fraud, the Central Bank Gold Inspection Office has formulated restrictions on the application for transfers from member banks of the Banking Joint Committee and the Money Industry Reserve. All transfer applications from member banks will be treated as transfer funds for the day, except for non-member banks' business-related transfers. It is heard that the Central Bank Gold Inspection Office will soon send a letter to the banking and money industry associations to investigate and handle the matter.

### Most Banks Loosen Cash Withdrawals

The Central Reserve Bank, in view of the urgent need for cash, has recently gradually increased the cash limits for banks and money shops to pay customers, aiming to exceed 20%. It is understood that several long-established banks and money shops have deeply understood the significance of the authorities' solution to the cash problem, and have used the cash they received in proportion to the amount deposited in the Central Bank to the greatest extent possible for the purpose of withdrawing cash for various depositors. Not only have they met the 20% cash payment, but many have voluntarily increased it to 30%. That is, for every 1 million yuan deposited, 300,000 yuan of cash can be paid out per week. As for the banks and money shops that deliberately shortchange customers or transfer cash to seek exorbitant discounts, they have not disappeared.

### Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions in the City Last Week; Hot Transactions Shift to the Gold and Securities Market

The financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in Shanghai have rebounded in the past week. The trend was still stable in the first half of the week, but the fluctuations in the second half of the week were sudden and fierce. People were excited, and those with funds absorbed a large number of shares, and retail investors also followed suit, with most of the hot spot transactions shifting to the gold and securities market.

### Gold Securities

The gold and securities market was stable and rising on Monday and Tuesday, and all parties showed little interest. It was said that the issuance period for the fifth phase of gold securities was approaching, and they were waiting for the listing price. On Wednesday, it was rumored that the new price would be high, and the expiring bonds and the fourth phase bonds saw a slight increase. On Thursday, it suddenly became apparent that the issuance of the fifth phase of gold securities was postponed, and those who released bonds took advantage of the scarcity, coupled with unfounded rumors confusing the people, and the buying trend suddenly became fierce. It was difficult to suppress the buying power even at high prices. The expiring and fourth phase gold bonds broke through the 40 million yuan mark per ten taels. The rising trend continued on Friday, and the rising momentum was still not flattened on Saturday, continuing to rise by more than 200,000 yuan per tael, with the highest price reaching 43.2 million yuan per ten taels. Silver and government bonds rose crazily with the price of gold, with silver reaching 22,000 yuan per tael.

### Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks saw sudden ups and downs on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, due to rumors about the issuance of the fifth phase of gold securities, people became disheartened and stock prices weakened. Investors wanted to sell but could not get a good price. On Thursday, it was proven that the gold bonds were postponed and idle funds were useless, and the buying trend rebounded. In general, the bulls learned that the 10,000-yuan notes were issued and invested heavily. The three hot stocks and small and medium-sized stocks generally rose. On Friday, the opening market was still in a rising trend. However, due to the bulls selling off for profit, retail investors felt panic and scrambled to sell, and the supply exceeded the demand. The market showed a sharp decline, and large, medium, and small stocks all turned back to small gains, but the fundamentals were still stable.

Internally, they are trying their best to eliminate cash panic and increase cash chips, and have executed the Ministry's order to punish 35 banks and money shops that are operating illegally, of which more than a dozen have suspended business. However, this change in financial institutions is not enough to affect the entire financial market.

### Prices

As for the industrial and commercial sectors in a week, there were no significant changes. Major commodities and industries factories will soon get electricity supply and are preparing to resume some production. However, companies and shops in various industries have generally raised prices without authorization, citing increased raw material costs and increased living expenses, such as cotton textiles, silk textiles, soap, firecrackers, candles, firewood, charcoal, oil, sugar, etc. The rise is severe. Fortunately, the market prices of rice, grains, miscellaneous grains, flour, and wheat are still stable.

### Tram Fares to Increase Again Today

Shanghai Urban Transportation Company submitted a request to the Ministry of Construction to readjust the urban public buses and trams managed by the company. The Ministry's approval has been received and will be implemented starting today (16th). The new fares for trams are as follows: Ordinary fare is 500 yuan, military ticket is 50 yuan. Monthly ticket is 70,000 yuan for adults and 35,000 yuan for children. Single-line monthly ticket is 30,000 yuan for adults and 15,000 yuan for children. At the same time, the tram fares managed by the French Concession in the city will also be increased in proportion to the adjusted new prices of the Urban Transportation Company.

### Service Hours May Be Extended

According to the company, the company has made its best efforts to maintain the operation of the city's trams. Regarding the tram operating hours, it is prepared to find ways to extend them. The required power supply is being negotiated with the relevant authorities. Currently, the coal problem has improved, so there is a possibility of extending the tram operating hours. If implemented, the city's traffic can be more smooth.

### Charity Mini Soccer Game; China United vs Overseas Chinese United

Among our citizens, there is no shortage of those who love science, and their spirit of hard work is no less than that of scholars in other countries. It is a pity that they are not rewarded and are unable to concentrate on one field. If they are given financial assistance, they will continue to devote themselves to science and achieve success. If they can invent something or explain a theory, it will not only be their own honor, but also the honor of the country and society.

Last summer, this newspaper also held a science award, but due to the lack of enthusiastic assistance from the community, it soon faded away, which is a pity. In the future, if the city government hosts it, it will be more powerful. Moreover, the city government has now established a cultural committee to encourage wartime academic research, so the science assistance award can be handled by the committee. However, scientific research is slightly different from other academic research, so when evaluating the results, they cannot be treated equally. The main differences are selected below for reference:

Ordinary academic research can be judged on the report of the work results, but scientific research is not. The merits should be judged based on the purpose and method of the research. Why? Most of those who study science cannot achieve their goals, and can only select what they have gained in their life's work for later generations to continue, so even if the purpose is not achieved, their merits should not be ignored.

Since scientific research focuses on methods and steps, the competent authority should send personnel to supervise the work of the winners, and provide guidance and various conveniences at any time. At the same time, the winners must report the current status of their work to the competent authority with specific records on time.

Governments of various countries have always protected scientific and technical personnel. Therefore, in order to cultivate national power, the city government should maintain the minimum living standards of the winners so that they can work with peace of mind.

In this scientific era, we must not delay any longer. It is urgent to cultivate scientific cadres and talents to lay the foundation for the future of our new culture.

### Responsibility Issues of Representatives of Penalized Banks and Firms

— Hesheng

The recent severe punishment of thirty-five law-breaking banks and firms by the responsible financial authorities with an impartial attitude is indeed a social shock and a gratifying event. Subsequently, some banks and firms will undoubtedly learn from this and be more cautious, while others will likely revert to their old ways once the matter has passed. Therefore, in addition to requesting the authorities to continue to pay attention to the future activities of banks and firms, to seek a more thorough solution, I have the following thoughts on the penalties for the banks and firms this time:

According to regulations, the director is the external representative and internal supervisor of a company (banks and firms are also companies). They hold the highest authority in the company and are fully responsible for handling all internal and external affairs. The quality of the director directly affects the company. In light of this, the Financial Inspection Office stipulated in the "Strengthening Finance Order" that the chairman of the board shall not concurrently serve as manager to ensure full-time service and avoid negligence. However, according to the reports in various newspapers on the 12th of this month, as many as thirty-five banks and firms were punished for major illegal acts such as over-issuing notes, profiting from discounts, forging accounts, and hoarding for speculation. I wonder what the directors of these banks and firms were doing that led to these illegal acts? If citizens commit the above acts, they will be punished by law. Why were the banks and firms only subject to penalties such as revocation of licenses, suspension of business, and fines by the financial authorities, without any consideration for their representatives?

The illegal act of a legal person (company) is caused by the actions of the representative. Therefore, regardless of whether the act is committed by the representative personally or by subordinates (actions representing the company), the director, as the representative, is ultimately responsible. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the financial authorities will further investigate and transfer evidence of the above-mentioned over-issuing, forgery, hoarding, and speculation to the relevant authorities for thorough investigation and strict punishment of the chairmen and directors of the aforementioned banks and firms. At a minimum, they should be prohibited from serving as chairmen or directors of banks and firms in the future. This will ensure that they are aware of the consequences, act responsibly, and thus contribute to financial stability.

### Suggestion to Establish a Public Sales Office by the Trade Associations

— Mu

In the past, there have been several instances of price controls, and the result of each price control has been a phenomenon of goods available at a certain price, but the goods cannot be found in the markets, which means the demand vastly exceeds the supply at the set price. Later, batches of goods gradually came out from the back doors of retailers, adding many vendors to the sidewalks, and their prices were freely determined, not subject to price controls.

For example, number 46 crude paper was originally priced at 132 yuan per knife (a unit of paper), but at that time, some merchants were asking for 200 yuan. Now, it cannot be bought for less than 1,500 or 1,600 yuan, and the original retailers have no goods to sell.

In recent days, the newspapers have published batches of new price controls. According to reports, these new price controls are proposed by various trade associations and then approved and announced by the Price Review Council. This is certainly a reasonable price, and the profits for wholesalers and retailers should be taken care of. In theory, it should be available everywhere. However, the reality tells us that, except for a few people with special connections, the general public still cannot buy items sold at the controlled price. Under the "Take it or leave it!" situation, people can only sigh at the goods or reluctantly buy them at a high price.

Although there are economic police patrolling, or you can report to the nearby police station, who wants to spend a lot of time and effort to buy a knife of crude paper or half a catty of meat, and at the same time attract a lot of unexpected trouble? Therefore, most people always hold the attitude of "Buy it if you can afford it, don't buy it if you can't," and are told, "Take it or leave it!"

Our meaning is that since there is a price control, the trade association should maintain its credit, and the government should maintain its prestige. It must ensure that everyone can buy the goods. Therefore, we suggest that the trade association should designate retailers as public sales offices in various parts of the city. All citizens can go there to buy controlled-price items. The goods in the public sales offices are supplied by the wholesalers of each trade association, and the quantity should be sold to the best possible extent during the validity period of the price control. In this way, the economic police will also have a fixed location to facilitate inspection, and the people will not suffer from not being able to buy the controlled-price items, and the price control can become a price control in name and in fact.

### My Views on Assessing Commodity Prices

— Gan Dounan

It is stated that the Price Assessment Committee has stated that the assessment of publicly agreed-upon commodity prices has been too complicated in the past, resulting in the assessed prices being outdated. Therefore, in the future, trade associations will be responsible for drafting and submitting them to the committee for review and decision. However, for the necessity of emergency handling, the chairman of the committee may first approve and announce its implementation and then submit it to the meeting for ratification, without being as constrained as in the past by waiting for the approval of the Price Review Council, in order to avoid the disadvantages of delays and lost timeliness. However, this move still requires the review and approval of the committee, which takes a considerable amount of time. In a calm market, there is no need to worry, but in this era of rapid changes and fleeting moments, even a few days will inevitably lose the original meaning of the agreed price due to different environmental conditions; Moreover, after the trade association deliberates, it is submitted to the competent authority for record, which takes more than a few days for approval. Therefore, there is still a feeling of price but no goods for general daily necessities, and it is bound to search for them in the black market again. At the same time, the gap between the controlled price and the cost will inevitably affect the production process of general manufacturers, which will hinder the circulation of materials and promote the trend of unemployment. It is obvious that this is an obstacle to the authorities' policy of encouraging production.

In order to completely eliminate the above phenomenon, I believe that the agreed price of any commodity, unless it is obtained from the official allocation of raw materials, it is best to temporarily cancel the current price control, strengthen the organization of the trade association, and give the trade association greater powers and responsibilities. That is, whenever there is a need to change the price, the trade association is responsible for evaluating the price based on the facts, and it can be implemented immediately. However, in order to avoid the abuse of power by merchants and the malpractice of obtaining excessive profits, all directors and supervisors of the trade association should sign their names, submit the evaluation process and the cost table of the raw materials on which it is based to the competent authority for record. If it is discovered that the trade association has indeed falsely reported the market price and attempted to make excessive profits, the competent authority may severely punish it according to wartime law, then the persons in charge of the trade associations will not dare to take the risk and cause inconvenience, and will inevitably avoid illegal attempts as much as possible. If it can be implemented in this way, on the one hand, it can stabilize prices and reduce the arbitrary price increases of illegal merchants, and on the other hand, it can protect manufacturers and give them legitimate profits, in other words, it is to encourage production, so manufacturers will not hesitate to search for raw materials and be happy to produce, and consumers do not have to seek the black market. My humble opinion is as follows, I ask the people with foresight whether they agree?

### After School Evacuation, Students Should Adopt a Work-Study System

— Renzhong

Recently, for the safety of citizens, the authorities decided to implement the evacuation of the population, starting with government agencies, and then evacuating schools and other organizations. However, the evacuation funds had to be collected by schools themselves, which was difficult to achieve!

Evacuating schools without simultaneously evacuating students is merely a nominal evacuation. If students are forced to evacuate together, the following difficulties will arise: Are the students' parents satisfied? Even if the students' parents are willing, can they afford the students' accommodation and living expenses elsewhere?

The first of the above-mentioned difficulties can be addressed by informing the authorities of the situation: "Shanghai has a large population, a shortage of food, and is vulnerable to air raids. Students studying in other places will be close to the simple customs of rural areas, which will benefit both their moral and physical well-being." Reasonable parents would not disagree.

The latter difficulty is not easy to solve without substantial financial and material support. After all, students' parents may not all have the ability to support their children studying in other places. When will the school evacuation be implemented?

Therefore, this serious problem of "school evacuation" can only be solved by planning ahead, selecting suitable locations in other places to prepare for work-study schools, and striving for "both schooling and no worry about food and clothing."

In this era of "increased production first," no citizen can afford to waste time. If some people are attached to the prejudices of enjoyment and live a drunken, dreamy life, then these young masters and misses are willing to be parasites of society and the country. (We cannot bear to mention the recent parties initiated by university students!) Looking at countries around the world, which students are not working hard to prepare to serve the country? After the school evacuation, adopting a "work-study system" to make up for the lack of consumption is the best way now.

As for work-study schools, the curriculum should be developed according to the nature of the school itself. Whether it is industry or agriculture, it should be adapted to local conditions and circumstances. However, it must meet the following conditions:

It does not hinder the students' physical and mental health.

It should be simple and able to produce in a short period of time.

For example, industry should ensure that students continue to produce after graduation and are still needed by society.

The Shanghai Municipal Government should not only select professionals to handle industrial and educational matters, but also do its utmost to facilitate transportation for evacuation. It is also hoped that the administrative authorities in the area where the school is located will provide protection, and provide the necessary housing for the "continuation school" to the best of their ability, such as temples, which can be temporarily used as schools or workshops, and farms can be rented on their behalf, and offer preferential treatment such as tax exemption for the products of work-study schools.

As for the expenses, in addition to collecting part of the funds from the students' parents at the time of opening, it is hoped that the municipal authorities can solicit donations from wealthy people who love education and the country so that the evacuated schools can still have vigorous vitality, or even make the phenomenon of "graduation is unemployment" a thing of the past.
