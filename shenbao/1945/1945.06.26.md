Our forces, after consolidating the battle lines in the Oroku and southern Shimajiri areas, engaged in courageous battles against the enemy forces of more than seven divisions, who were supported by superior air and naval power, inflicting heavy casualties. However, after June 16th, the enemy gradually invaded our main defense lines. B. The naval forces in the Oroku area, commanded by Rear Admiral Minoru Ota, completed the task of covering the retreat of the main Japanese force to the southern Shimajiri area, and it is reported that on June 13th, all officers and soldiers launched a final assault against the enemy.

Our air force continues to seize opportunities to attack enemy ships and air bases around the island, and to cooperate with ground battles. Since the start of the operation, the damage inflicted on the enemy by our forces is estimated at approximately 80,000 enemy soldiers killed on land and approximately 600 enemy warships sunk or destroyed around the islands. On the Okinawa battlefield, our officials and civilians, under the leadership of Governor Shigeru Izumi, have unanimously cooperated with the Japanese army since the enemy landed, fighting to protect the imperial nation.

Lieutenant General Ushijima, Japanese Supreme Commander on Okinawa, Delivers Farewell Address

Tokyo, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima, the supreme commander of the Japanese forces on Okinawa Island, delivered a farewell address to the motherland on June 19th, before launching the final offensive against the main enemy force. The gist of his address was as follows: "By order of Heaven, I have led the entire army in brave and fierce battles for three months. This is truly moving to Heaven and earth, and causes the spirits to weep. However, we have ultimately been unable to crush the enemy's offensive, and the situation is now on the verge of crisis. Since my subordinate units advanced to this island, they have actively prepared for battle with the sincere cooperation of the local compatriots. When constantly engaging the enemy, they have coordinated with the air force, hoping to defend Okinawa perfectly. But ultimately, I have acted contrary to my wishes and cannot continue my duties. I am unable to face His Majesty and unable to face the nation; I am truly regretful. Since things have come to this, I have decided to lead my remaining subordinates and launch one last battle."

### Japanese Aircraft Bravely Attack Enemy Fleet and Airfields in Adverse Weather, Inflicting Significant Damage in Four Days

Ryukyu Islands Base, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The army air force, since the 21st, has been cooperating with the Japanese forces in the southern Shimajiri area of Okinawa Island, relentlessly attacking the enemy fleet in adverse weather. It has since been determined that the results obtained by the Japanese forces from the 21st to the 24th are as follows: From the evening of the 21st to the night, Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombed enemy aircraft carriers and other warships, hitting aircraft carriers, battleships, and other warships of unspecified types. In addition, torpedo squadrons also carried out daring torpedo attacks on the enemy fleet in the area, destroying one cruiser and launching fierce attacks on the central and northern airfields, causing large fires everywhere. Furthermore, they launched fierce attacks on enemy ships at sea off Kadena, and after several hours, several large fires could still be seen from a distance. Again on the morning of the 22nd, enemy ships were attacked, with more than a dozen planes hitting and exploding, causing heavy damage to the enemy. Also on the same day the Japanese militarys powerful air force protected special attack units, which daringly attacked enemy fleets. On the same night torpedo units again attacked sinking one enemy ship of unspecified type. Further beginning at dusk on the 23rd until the morning of the 24th, the Japanese forces again attacked the enemy fleet, causing them to suffer great damage.

Japanese Forces Demonstrate Special Attack Prowess

Tokyo, June 24th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese ground forces in the southern Okinawa Island region have now completed organized combat, but this does not mean that the fighting in all areas of the island has ended. Subsequently, Japanese units will continue to fight fiercely in the two strongholds in the southern Shimajiri area, causing the enemy to suffer heavier casualties. Furthermore, the Japanese naval air force is repeatedly attacking the enemy fleet and airfields around Okinawa, so although we have strategically lost the Okinawa area, it is clear that the enemy, using Okinawa as a powerful air and sea base, will launch fierce air attacks on the Japanese mainland in order to achieve the final stage of their offensive against Japan, namely, a landing operation on the Japanese mainland. The Japanese air force, in response to the enemy's intentions, will launch heroic air attacks against the enemy with all-out special attacks. This will be intensified after the fall of Okinawa, so as to inflict heavy blows on the enemy's plans. At the same time, the terrifying special attack prowess will be unleashed against the enemy fleet and warships, so as to cause the enemy to suffer even greater losses.

US Army and Navy Announce Losses

Lisbon, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram, Washington Telegram. The US Navy Department announced: Japanese air forces have continuously attacked US ships in the seas near Okinawa Island on the 21st and 22nd, causing damage to the ships. This attack by the Japanese air force was the most intense attack since January 6th.

### Japanese Forces in Balikpapan Complete Defense Preparations: Residents Evacuated Deep Inland

Southwest Pacific Base, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: An enemy landing in Balikpapan is considered difficult to avoid. However, the enemy, having suffered a crushing defeat in the landing at Tarakan, is particularly cautious this time. In recent days, they have been using air force to conduct full-scale bombing in an attempt to weaken the Japanese defensive positions. At the same time, they are also using naval guns to bombard fiercely, seeking a good opportunity to land. However, as of the 21st of this month, there is still no sign of them having a landing motive, and the strength of the enemy warships is not substantial. The local Japanese garrison has completed the preparation of the defensive positions. At the same time, the residents have also been evacuated deep inland, and the Japanese residing here are each equipped with weapons, waiting for the enemy troops to land, in the hope of annihilating them in one fell swoop. The enemy's invasion of Balikpapan is indeed expected. Therefore, when enemy ships appear, the local supreme commander leads the staff to the front line and personally directs the battle under a hail of bullets. And the camp newspaper continues to be published despite the difficult circumstances of the enemy's bombing.

Enemy Forces Suffer Losses on Tarakan Island

Southwest Pacific Base, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The enemy forces, which forcibly landed on Tarakan on the morning of May 1st in an attempt to invade the oil-producing area of Borneo, suffered heavy losses due to the fierce resistance of the Japanese soldiers. However, their ambition to invade the Balikpapan area has not disappeared. Since June 12th, the enemy has been carrying out intense bombing with about ten airplanes, and at 2:15 PM on the 15th, a fleet of more than twenty enemy ships approached the land and carried out naval bombardment of the Sepinggang area. On the 16th, the naval bombardment gradually diminished and mine sweeping operations began, indicating their strong desire to land. Currently, the actions of the enemy ships are coordinated with the wave-like attacks of their air force, carrying out slow bombardment of the fuel facilities in the coastal Japanese positions. At night, they retreat elsewhere due to fear of attacks by Japanese special attack aircraft. One enemy minesweeper approached the coast and was sunk by Japanese forces on the 16th. Another enemy minesweeper was also destroyed on the 20th. Because of this, the enemy's actions are becoming more cautious, but enemy air raids are still frequent. Every day, about a hundred large aircraft come to attack the Japanese positions. However, the damage to the Japanese forces is quite minimal.

### Weekly Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The following is a summary of the war situation in the Greater East Asia War zone this week: In the Central Pacific area, the enemy aircraft carrier groups in the Ryukyu waters have recently been anchored on the southern end of the island chain, each composed of several special aircraft carrier vessels. On the 20th, about 300 enemy aircraft attacked Oshima Island. In addition, the Japanese air force, despite the adverse weather conditions, has continued to fiercely attack the enemy supply ships around Okinawa Island. Furthermore, the enemy's base air power in Okinawa Island and its surroundings, with a total of more than ten airfields, seems to have five to six hundred aircraft directly cooperating with the land operations on the island and patrolling the nearby sea surface. They are also actively attacking the mainland air force base with small aircraft every day, so air battles between the two sides are likely to intensify in the future. In the Mariana Islands, the island can now accommodate about a thousand B-29 aircraft. Recently, small-scale formations have attacked small and medium-sized cities in Japan. In Palau, the Japanese forces are conducting an operation to retake control in the sea south of Palau, and progress is quite favorable. In addition, on the night of the 26th, the Japanese forces launched a surprise attack on the defenses of the island of Karaon. Carrying explosives, they engaged in close combat, killing or wounding more than two hundred enemy personnel, destroying two artillery pieces, one trolley, two amphibious tanks, and eleven barracks, resulting in great battle gains. In Borneo, the Japanese garrison forces near Tarakan Island and Borneo are currently bravely engaging a superior enemy with a small number of troops. On the morning of the 20th, enemy transport ships began landing in the Miri area. Since June 16th, enemy cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers, etc., have been appearing near Balikpapan and have begun mine sweeping operations, and are currently engaged in combat with the Japanese land defense forces. In the Philippines, enemy air strikes against the northern Cagayan region are becoming more active, and enemy bandits seem to be starting to move. In the Indian Ocean, enemy shipping activity has been increasing recently.

### Air Raid on Nanking Yesterday

### Japanese Forces in Henan and Guangdong Launch Preemptive Strikes to Secure Strategic Points on the Mainland

Beijing, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese forces in Henan province launched an attack on the troops of the First War Zone in Chongqing on May 13th, aiming to secure the strategic points along the Yellow River bank in the Luoyang and Xi'an area. This disrupted the headquarters of the First War Zone army, achieving the anticipated results. To prevent the Japanese forces from advancing further south along this route, the Chongqing side has mobilized strategic reserve forces consisting of three armies and nine divisions from the eastern front and the rear to block the Japanese advance south. In addition, the elite units of the Japanese South China Army, starting in early June, launched a preemptive strike against the main force of the Seventh War Zone army under Yu Hanmou, who were actively preparing to respond to a landing operation by the US Sixth Army. The enemy was surrounded in the SanNan area in southern Jiangxi province, their base area, and suffered great losses. The pursuit of the enemy troops, who are in a state of collapse towards An Yuan, east of the area, is continuing.

### Thai Regent Emphasizes Thai-Japanese Friendship

Bangkok, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Thai National Assembly convened a meeting yesterday (24th) on the anniversary of the revolution. Regent Pridi Banomyong delivered the opening address, discussing the relationship between Japan and Thailand. He emphatically stated that Thailand and Japan should maintain friendship based on the alliance treaty between the two countries.

Furthermore, the Prime Minister met with a group of Japanese reporters on the 22nd, firmly stating his unwavering belief that if enemy forces invade Thai territory, we will cooperate with the Japanese army to defeat them.

### Dong Biwu's Conversation with Reporters in America

Beijing, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: Yan'an representative Dong Biwu, previously in Fushan meeting with foreign reporters, had presented foreign reporters with two pamphlets entitled "The Current Situation in China and the Demands of the People", exposing the inside story of the War of Resistance. A New York United Press dispatch of the 20th stated that Dong Biwu, in his meeting with the reporter group, discussed the Chongqing Political Council, the statement by Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng regarding armed resistance, and the aid material given to the Eighth Route Army as follows: Of the 240 plus councillors in the People's Political Council, no proposal can be presented without twenty names signing it, Yan'an had only eight representatives, and they were all named by Chongqing, it is only right that they had expressed that they wouldn't attend the conference. In regards to the armed conflict with Yan'an, the Minister of Military Affairs had admitted to regional resistance, stating that material given as aid was not used in attacking Yan'an. I believe that with the ordnance Chongqing produces themselves, they will not be able to launch such a positive attack against Yan'an. On the contrary, the ordnance given by the US to the Yan'an army only consist of 120 rotating machine guns, 6 anti-aircraft guns, and a small amount of ammunition.

Editorial

### The Fundamental Strategy for Solving the People's Food Crisis

Curbing the soaring rice prices can be achieved through stopgap measures, but resolving the people's food panic requires fundamental solutions. Stopgap measures can only be effective for a short time, while fundamental solutions can thoroughly stabilize people's livelihoods. Stopgap measures are like stimulants, only effective in emergencies; fundamental solutions are like tonics, only effective in preventing disease.

Today's hope is not only to suppress the soaring rice prices, but also to fundamentally solve the food problem. Since the implementation of the Emergency Rice Measures, this newspaper has repeatedly discussed the issue of rice prices. Today, we propose a new path and a new strategy: "Comprehensive Control and Guarantee of Food Supplies."

The awareness of food supplies must be re-examined: The term "food supplies" includes not only rice but also wheat flour, coarse grains, etc. In today's environment of soaring prices, those with money can certainly afford to have rice reserves at home, which is not a concern. But we must not allow those without money to be unable to afford even wheat flour and coarse grains. Especially in the lean season, when rice is fundamentally scarce, focusing solely on rice is not enough to solve the food problem. To solve the food problem, we must supplement the rice shortage with wheat flour and coarse grains.

For example, everyone has almost given up hope for household rice rations, and the authorities really have no way to provide them. However, household flour rations have been repeatedly distributed recently, and the general public is overjoyed, like a cloud in a great drought. As another example, when the Emergency Rice Measures were implemented, the Allied military authorities stated that the wheat and coarse grains purchased by the military in the interior would be released in Shanghai as much as possible, which reassured everyone. From this, we can see that relying entirely on rice to regulate food supplies has become an unrealistic expectation. In the future, we can only supplement the shortage of staple foods with auxiliary food supplies.

Moreover, adopting the method of comprehensively adjusting food supplies with a combination of wheat flour, coarse grains, and rice is not only a temporary measure during the current lean season, but may even be the fundamental plan for regulating people's rice needs in the future.

In short, rice, wheat flour, and coarse grains are now inseparable parts of food supplies. Therefore, there must be a comprehensive plan. We cannot only use wheat flour and coarse grains as temporary fixes for temporary problems, nor can we allow the agencies responsible for controlling each component to act independently without any coordination.

The policy for solving the food crisis must be unified, so that the issues of food procurement funding, transportation, purchasing, and distribution can all be solved comprehensively and rationally. We hope that the people can learn from the psychology of welcoming household wheat flour and cheap coarse grains, and stop relying solely on rice.

Rice prices are rising again. Rice prices in various regions are soaring due to speculation by rice merchants. The rice price in Shanghai cannot be lowered further due to economic reasons. To effectively curb rising rice prices and thoroughly solve the food problem, we must strive for "Comprehensive Control and Guarantee of Food Supplies."

Translated Commentary

### After the Emergency Rice Measures

In Shanghai and other cities, the food problem has again become somewhat tense. The National Government's Emergency Rice Measures have not been implemented for long, and their full effect must still await a few sentences later. However, judging from the situation after the implementation, it is difficult to consider the help to people's food as significant. After the cessation of controlled purchases and the abolition of rice restrictions on movement, as a result, rice has become the center of speculative targets for merchants in Shanghai and elsewhere, leading to a unified increase in rice prices in Wuhu, Wuxi, Suzhou and other places. The increase in rice prices in the interior cities cannot but threaten the lives of local residents, and also has a necessary impact on rice prices in Shanghai. In the past, the rise in rice prices in Shanghai, we determined it to be caused by a special mentality. Today, although the conditions of this mentality are being overcome and eliminated, the increase in rice prices in the interior will inevitably hover at a peak. In other words, even if the psychological rise in rice prices will be replaced by economic gains, it is not a fallacy.

Merchants who purchase rice from the interior pay high interest rates and obtain the required funds. How difficult it is to send this money into the interior, and the huge amount of funds required, anyone who knows the interior exchange situation can understand. Because interest and discounting and remittance fees, the merchants' capital, I am afraid that half of it will be consumed. This statement is by no means exaggerated. Therefore, it goes without saying that the rice purchased and transported to Shanghai cannot be sold at a low price. At the same time, the illegal demands of local civil servants, military police, etc. have not yet been improved. If this situation is ignored as in the past, will the Emergency Rice Measures not be difficult to show their effect? We are sincerely worried about this issue!

After the Emergency Rice Measures, the measures that should be taken are to cancel the illegal demands in the localities and to fundamentally solve the funding problem, especially the countermeasures for the people's livelihood in the localities. These strategies are still difficult to be called perfect today. Illegal demands and funding problems still exist. Even if the movement restrictions are deliberately abolished, its effect is still not expected. Therefore, we hope that the National Government will further consider appropriate countermeasures. Regarding the abolition of movement restrictions, since the Japanese side does not spare its greatest cooperation, the National Government should also overcome the difficulties in the exchange of goods and effectively handle these two.

Due to the implementation of the Emergency Rice Measures, the rice flour problem in Shanghai has greatly improved, which goes without saying. However, in order to maintain this situation for a long time and to truly protect the safety of the people's livelihood, after the emergency measures, it is still necessary to seek appropriate and proper methods and strive to make the effect of the emergency measures perfect. The effect of emergency measures depends on how the government's subsequent policies are, and it may be positive or negative. Regarding this point, the National Government should consider it deeply.

At the same time as the Emergency Rice Measures, it is also necessary to consider promoting the purchasing efficiency of wheat and coarse grains in order to ensure the safety of food. It is said that the purchase of wheat is very smooth, but this is also the result of the prevalence of rice speculation, and Zhu Rong is generally optimistic. In the comprehensive guarantee of food, do not make mistakes, this is what we especially hope from the Chinese and Japanese authorities. (June 25th, Continental News)

### Random Chats from the Balcony

— Yoshida Toyu

Chongqing in the Eyes of the Chinese Communists: So what exactly is the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party's intention in attacking the Chongqing government?

Answer: The CCP's intention is very clear. They feel that Chongqing is able to attack them because of American aid to Chongqing. They believe that the "anti-communist trinity" is guiding this conspiracy within the Chongqing government. Therefore, as long as the Chongqing government is controlled by this group of people, the CCP will ignore any proposals for cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists made to Chongqing. Chiang Kai-shek also understood this point, so he proposed to Zhou Enlai a "three-party committee" to adjust the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The so-called three-party committee is a committee formed by one person from the CCP, one from the Kuomintang, and one American military officer. Chiang Kai-shek believed that if the committee were solely composed of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the CCP might worry that the Kuomintang would play tricks again. Now that a third party, the United States, is involved, they should naturally feel at ease and boldly accept it. However, the CCP is not so foolish and clearly knows that the United States and Chongqing are birds of a feather, with no distinction between high and low. The CCP will naturally not fall into this trap. To know the truth about Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and Kuomintang-Communist friction, one must first understand the CCP's deep hatred for the current leaders of Chongqing. Let me briefly explain this point. Edgar Snow once affirmatively said that the main driving force behind the CCP's ability to complete the 25,000-mile Long March was the millions of landless peasants who were created by the oppression of corrupt officials. The majority of Chinese Communist Party members were previously landless peasants with no home to return to. According to the land survey report discussed at the third meeting of the Kuomintang Land Commission in 1926, landowners accounted for 45 percent of the rural population in China; landless tenant farmers and agricultural laborers accounted for 55 percent. Furthermore, among the landowners, small landlords, who owned no more than 14 percent of the land in the country, owned 62 percent of the country's arable land. Conversely, poor peasants with only one to ten mu of land accounted for about 44 percent of the landowners in the country, and their land accounted for no more than 6 percent of the country's arable land. As for the large and small landlords, they usually lived as absentee landlords in the city and simply collected rent in the countryside, a very common phenomenon. Before the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, Dr. Fei Xiaotong, who spent several years painstakingly investigating the "Kāi Xiàn Gōng" village on the south bank of Taihu Lake, made the following report on how Chinese landlords exploited peasants:

"The large landlords have their own rent collection agencies. Small landlords also participate in it. This organization is called a 'bureau.' Tenant farmers don't know whether their landlord is Zhang San or Li Si, and even if they know who the landlord is, it has nothing to do with them. They only know which organization they belong to. The tenant farmer's name and the area of rented land are clearly recorded in the account books. At the end of October, the organization notifies individual tenant farmers of the amount of rent they must pay for the year. The notification is delivered by a specialized agent. The agent of the bureau is an employee hired by the organization, and the employee also holds the power of inspection appointed by the local government. Therefore, the landlord's organization is, in fact, a semi-governmental organization. When determining the amount of rent to be collected that year, the landlords hold a meeting in the Landlords' Association to decide on the amount of rent reduction due to drought and the rate of converting rice into money (rent is based on rice, but paid in cash). The rice exchange rate is not the publicly recognized exchange rate in the market, but is arbitrarily determined by the Landlords' Association. To pay the rent, tenant farmers must first sell the rice they have earned through their blood and sweat. And during the rent payment period, the price of rice is always lower than the usual price. This combination of in-kind rent and monetary rent further increases the burden on those who pay the rent. ... If the tenant farmer resists slightly and refuses to pay the rent, the agent has the right to take him to the local government's prison. If the tenant farmer is actually unable to pay the rent, he will be released at the end of the year. This is not a kindness to him, but detaining him in prison only leaves the fields uncultivated, which is only a loss to the landlord" (Fei Xiaotong, "Peasant Life in China," 1939, English version).

This is by no means communist propaganda. Dr. Fei is a Kuomintang scholar, and his work is full of an absolutely objective research spirit. The rent he saw with his own eyes usually accounted for 40 to 80 percent of the total harvest, and sometimes even 90 percent. Therefore, Dr. Fei concluded: "In a nutshell, the root cause of the Chinese countryside is that the income of farmers cannot maintain the minimum standard of living. Frankly speaking, China's current real problem is the hunger of the people."

The foundation for the rise of the Chinese Communist Party is actually this widespread hunger among peasants throughout China. Driven by hunger, peasants joined the Chinese Communist Party in an endless stream, creating the CCP's enormous power today. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine the degree of hatred the CCP holds for the landlord class. Although the CCP allowed the existence of rich peasants in 1935, declared protection for the petty bourgeoisie, and even recognized the existence of the landlord class in 1936, this policy was undoubtedly a temporary measure taken according to changes in the international situation. In the near future, the CCP will definitely want to eliminate the existence of the landlord class. Chinese landlords are also usurious capitalists, as well as investors in urban national commerce and industry. And their children are the backbone cadres of local governments and lower- and middle-ranking officers in the Kuomintang army. The CCP believes that the most powerful representatives of these landlords, national industrialists and capitalists, local governments, and the military within the Chongqing government are the "anti-communist trinity." In other words, they are He Yingqin, who controls the "military," Zhang Qun, who holds the "power," and Chen Lifu, who manipulates the "party" power. Shortly after I published "A View of the Chongqing Government," a left-leaning youth came to visit me and said the following:

"Although the 'military' directly belongs to the central government, the soldiers' salaries are collected from the poor farmers by the local government in the form of military rice. Therefore, the cadres in the army maintain a close relationship with the landlord class, which directly represents the local government. The constituent elements of the 'government,' especially the constituent elements of the local government, are all powerful local landlords and national industrialists and capitalists. Even the officials sent by the central government, due to 'reciprocity' and 'banquets and socializing,' develop close relationships with the local ruling groups. Thus, the principles for determining policies are naturally all in the interest of the landlord class and national industrialists and capitalists. The so-called 'party' is simply a place where the children of the landlord class temporarily show their skills in the interests of their class when they have not yet grabbed a lucrative position in the government."

Since the CCP observes the leadership of the Chongqing enemy government in this way, then it cannot but pay attention to the conspiracy behind the collusion between Chongqing and the United States. At the same time, the deeper the relationship between Chongqing and the United States, the deeper the relationship between the Soviet Union and the CCP. Of course, this is self-evident.

### Strict Prohibition to Prevent Rice Circulation Actually Carried Out by Relevant Agencies

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Since the implementation of emergency measures regarding rice, the price of rice in various places has been declining daily. However, as the opening of rice transport is just beginning, it is inevitable that a small number of merchants will take the opportunity to hoard, that military police along the way will create difficulties and extort money, and that local governments will restrict the circulation of rice on the pretext of maintaining local food supplies. To prevent this, the Ministry of Industry has separately notified various government agencies to strictly investigate and prohibit these practices, and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to consult the Military Affairs Commission and order various municipal governments to strictly prohibit such behavior in order to uphold the law.

### Recent Policy Overview of the Ministry of Industry

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters from Kyoto at the ministry at 3 PM today, and gave a detailed account of the ministry's recent policy situation. It is recorded as follows:

"Promoting Agricultural and Forestry Work": Locusts and grasshoppers have appeared in the suburbs of Kyoto and in several sections along the Kyoto-Wuhan railway. The ministry has specially dispatched technical personnel, in cooperation with the Agricultural and Forestry Promotion Association and the Cooperative Business Association, to guide locust control work in various places. The plan to establish a training institute for aquatic product management personnel has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and work is being accelerated. There is a shortage of spring silkworm eggs. In order to coordinate the production of silkworm eggs, the ministry has conducted a detailed survey of the quantity of autumn silkworm eggs produced in various provinces this year, so as to facilitate overall planning and distribution.

"Investigating Private Factories in Shanghai and Distributing Electricity": Due to insufficient electricity, most private factories in Shanghai are at a standstill. In order to remedy this situation, the ministry will transport more than 1,000 tons of bituminous coal to Shanghai each month through the Coal Production Increase Steering Committee, which will be handed over to the Central China Hydropower Company to increase power generation for the exclusive use of various factories.

"Promoting the Increased Production of Various Private Coal Mines": All mines are expanding their projects and enriching their equipment, and are now working hard to extract coal from various mining areas. Under the implementation of supervision and guidance, the work is also quite active. The ministry is doing its best to assist in the export of coal from various mining areas. For example, it is contacting relevant parties regarding the mines in Longtan to arrange vehicles for transportation. The mines in Dongliu lack equipment and are crying out for help. The Coal Increase Steering Committee plans to purchase trucks to assist in transportation.

### Commander Chen of the Military Police Visits Hangzhou for Inspection

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Chen Gao, commander of the Central Military Police, previously visited Wuhu and Bengbu to inspect the affairs of the military police in various regions. After returning to Kyoto, he went to Hangzhou yesterday morning to inspect the current situation of the military police along the Kyoto-Shanghai-Hangzhou line.

### Zhejiang Governor Ding Discusses Policy Guidelines

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Zhejiang Governor Ding Mocun, who recently came to Kyoto to report on his work, told reporters about the general situation of Zhejiang Province's recent policy: The situation in Zhejiang Province is more complicated than in other provinces, especially the problems of food, finance, and public security are more difficult. The current coping strategies can be roughly stated as follows: Regarding food, the fundamental solution is to increase production, and the temporary solution is to dredge sources. After taking office, I negotiated with the Central Reserve Bank for loans to purchase miscellaneous grains in the Kyoto-Wuhu area and wheat grains in the Xichang area to meet the current urgent needs. Regarding finance, we are actively working hard, but on the premise of not increasing the burden on the people. We plan to eliminate corruption in tax collection and collect in-kind taxes on mountain taxes, so as to enrich the treasury and achieve a balance of income and expenditure, and to implement an accounting system to facilitate consolidation. Regarding public security, the Red Bandits in Zhejiang Province have been quite rampant in recent months, which has a great impact on public security. After contacting relevant parties and obtaining their assistance, and after assigning certain troops to carry out suppression, there has been considerable progress. Many important cities and towns between Hangzhou and Wuxing have been recovered, and traffic between Hangzhou and Wuxing can be restored.

### Summer Hygiene Campaign Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday; Deputy Secretary-General Hu Gave Instructions on Behalf of the Mayor

The city's Summer Hygiene Campaign officially opened yesterday (the 25th) at 9:00 AM at the Nanjing Grand Theater. Officials and guests attending the event included Mayor Zhou's representative, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Hu Zewu, Director of the Health Bureau Yuan Rongchang, Director of the Welfare Bureau Zhou Yuying, and representatives from various bureaus and offices, totaling over a thousand people. Members of the Shanghai West Youth Corps' Disciplinary Team were dispatched to assist in maintaining order. Deputy Secretary-General Hu delivered instructions, followed by Director Yuan's report on the preparations and the significance of the campaign. Subsequently, guest Mr. E.S. Tyau delivered a speech. After a little over an hour, the ceremony concluded, and the entire group marched in formation to the Qingnian Hui (YMCA) at Eight Immortals Bridge, where they dispersed.

Speech by Deputy Secretary-General Hu

Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Hu Zewu's Speech on behalf of Mayor Zhou: "On the occasion of the opening of the Shanghai Special Municipality's Summer Hygiene Campaign, the Mayor is unable to attend in person due to official duties and has instructed me to represent him. The Summer Hygiene Campaign is held annually by each province and city according to central government regulations. Each time we hold it, we should earnestly review it, hoping that the results will be better each year.

The Chinese people have historically paid little attention to public health, leading to the scorn of foreigners and the moniker 'Sick Man of East Asia.' China has been a rural society with very few cities. In the future, as urban economies develop, cultures flourish, facilities are complete, and knowledge levels increase, we will naturally not be ridiculed by Westerners. The purpose of holding the Summer Hygiene Campaign is to awaken national awareness, led by the government, to promote the efforts of the entire nation.

I believe that future goals should focus on: first, cultivating hygienic habits and respecting public health ethics. Attention to hygiene is not just the concern of one person or one family, but of the entire nation. I sincerely hope that we can collectively create and promote public health movements."

Director Yuan's Report

This year's Summer Hygiene Campaign in this city was planned by this bureau in March and submitted to the municipal government for approval, after which preparations were immediately undertaken. According to the plan, in addition to holding the opening ceremony, it is also divided into two parts: hygiene activities and hygiene exhibitions. Regarding hygiene activities, the first day is Clean-Up Day, the second day is Fly-Swatting Day, and the third day is [omitted in original]. To gain the cooperation of the citizens for the above-mentioned activities, this bureau convened discussion meetings with the leaders of various Lianbao (Neighborhood Watch) units beforehand to ensure close communication. The hygiene exhibition includes departments such as physiological hygiene, nutritional hygiene, prevention of tuberculosis, oral hygiene, charts of infectious diseases, and other food hygiene topics. The scope of the exhibition is very broad, but this bureau has limited funds and a pressing timeline. Especially during this extraordinary period, with a shortage of materials, we cannot avoid being simple and crude. In addition, every evening from 7:00 PM at the Qingnian Hui at Eight Immortals Bridge, we will invite hygiene experts to give academic lectures, which are free for all citizens to attend, so that everyone can understand the meaning and purpose of public hygiene.

The completion of public health must be based on personal hygiene because the conditions for personal hygiene are relatively easy to achieve. Anyone who has received education can at least maintain personal hygiene. However, relying solely on narrow personal hygiene and neglecting family and social public health is still incomplete. If an infectious disease occurs, will you be exempt from infection simply because your personal hygiene is adequate? Therefore, the government must promote public hygiene so that all citizens can understand the importance of public hygiene.

The purpose of the hygiene campaign is to reduce disease and enable every citizen to have a healthy body to engage in the great cause of enriching the country and strengthening the people. To achieve this goal, everyone must take responsibility for transforming environmental hygiene: clearing road garbage, removing household waste, cleaning toilets and kitchens, and eradicating mosquitoes, flies, and rodents to prevent epidemics. This is merely the most important work of transforming environmental hygiene. This work will definitely not be accomplished simply by holding this hygiene campaign. The hygiene campaign is merely an opportunity to awaken the general public to truly understand the word "hygiene" and to promote the development of hygienic habits in everyone to ensure the safety of the public and reduce disease and mortality rates. However, this work is not a one-sided matter for the people, nor can it be done solely by the government. Cooperation is necessary to achieve the health of the people. I hope that after attending the conference, you will return and take the lead in earnestly promoting this, so that every citizen of Shanghai can achieve health and enjoy [omitted due to character error in original] , then can we consider this city's public health a success. This is my most sincere wish.

Exhibition and Lectures

After the opening ceremony, the hygiene exhibition began. The venue was located at the Qingnian Hui at Eight Immortals Bridge and was divided into two areas. The internal materials included: The first room displayed: Market inspection, dairy product inspection, chemical inspection, processed products, pathological inspection (specimens), and oral hygiene. The second room displayed charts and diagrams related to school hygiene, child protection, nutrition and health, infectious diseases, tuberculosis prevention, leprosy, life statistics, actual vegetable specimens, disinfection and insecticidal equipment, quarantine hospitals, and other public hygiene matters, in great detail. Visitors from all walks of life were quite enthusiastic. Yesterday (the 25th) at 8:00 PM, the association, according to its scheduled plan, invited medical expert Dr. E.S. Tyau to give a lecture on "Leprosy" and to show slides related to public hygiene. It is also reported that tonight (the 26th), Dr. Wang Qizhang will lecture on "Tuberculosis Prevention."

### After Discontinuing Allocation Drafts, Banks and Firms Switch to Issuing Northern Notes; Banking Industry Hopes for Central Reserve Supply of Cash

Due to the shortage of cash in this city, the banking industry previously issued allocation drafts to supplement circulation, which was convenient but also created drawbacks. To ensure safety, the banking industry has notified all banks and firms that they will uniformly stop using allocation drafts from July 3rd. The reporter visited various responsible parties in the financial community to seek their opinions on the important matters that need to be handled and prepared for before and after the discontinuation of allocation drafts.

Significant Meaning of Discontinuing Allocation Drafts

It is indicated that the authorities considered it necessary to issue allocation drafts to adapt to the wartime monetary contraction policy, which was an inevitable process in wartime. However, after issuance, they were repeatedly transferred and flowed to other ports in large numbers. Many industries in this city also hold them without presenting them for payment. Moreover, counterfeit allocation drafts are emerging frequently, greatly affecting the financial system. The creditworthiness of the payers is also noteworthy. The primary purpose of issuing allocation drafts is to prevent inflation and effectively contract the currency. However, if allocation drafts are not presented for payment for a long time and continue to be issued, how can credit volatility be avoided? The financial authorities' decision to stop using allocation drafts has significant meaning.

Clearing and Storing Allocation Notes Before the Deadline

It is decided as scheduled that the allocation drafts, which are actually checks used by each bank and money exchange that are taken from the Central Reserve Shanghai Branch and the Silver Union Society cash storage, should be deposited by all industries in the city and outside merchants into the business bank or firm with which they do business, preferably before the deadline of July 3. If it is absolutely necessary to exceed the deadline, the banks and firms are advised to absolutely refuse acceptance, but if there is acceptance after the deadline, no allocation draft will be issued to customers, and from July 3, each bank or firm will only issue its own banker's draft to each customer, and in addition to the amount of cash to be paid, the banker's drafts should be developed with absolute caution, and the bearer of the draft will be limited to presentation within ten days. However, it is not appropriate for the amount of circulation of the banker's drafts to be too large, and it is deeply hoped that the Central Reserve Authority will grant the cash position required by each bank and firm as decided by the joint meeting of the banking industry as much as possible, and even allow the amount of cash requested recently by each member bank and firm of the two industrial associations. If the banking industry can issue one less banker's draft, its responsibility can be reduced by one point, and the banker's draft, because of the relationship of parallel lines, can only be submitted for exchange and transfer, but cannot be regarded as having the same effect as cash.

Cash Supply Possible Next Month

Yesterday, the money market tightened again, and the discontinuation of allocation drafts at the beginning of next month made many parties feel that there were more disadvantages than advantages to the banker's drafts of each bank and firm. The rediscount of 10,000 yuan is still around 2,000 yuan, and this trend may subside. The Central Reserve notified the banking industry that it is strictly forbidden for bank and firm employees to smuggle, and a new plan may be realized from the third day of next month, with each large and small bank and firm having a cash supply of 30,000 yuan per day.

Is engaged in illegal transactions, and have already found solid evidence, and have requested from above to file a report with the financial inspection authorities for implementation of reporting and punishment.

### Shanghai District of the First Bureau of the Political Security Department Uncovers Major Criminal for Impersonating and Swindling

Liu Wenwu, from Qingdao, 28 years old, resided in the pavilion room at 821 Haining Road. He had been adrift at sea for a long time. Recently, due to the extremely high cost of living in Shanghai, he could not maintain his livelihood, so he had the audacity to impersonate the "Special Shanghai Supervisory Office of the Political Security Department" to swindle and deceive, issue official ID cards indiscriminately, and defraud money for a living. This illegal major case has been thoroughly uncovered by the Shanghai District of the First Bureau of the department. The details of the investigation are described below:

Fraudulent Situation

Liu Wenwu, impersonating the "Special Shanghai Supervisory Office of the Political Security Department," privately printed official identification cards, indiscriminately appointing military ranks. In the short month from the start of the operation to the case being solved, he had already issued more than 30 fake official identification cards with the ranks of major, captain, lieutenant, etc. He also claimed that after the troops were officially formed, each person could receive six dou of rice and a living allowance of 15,000 yuan, and firearms could be issued. Therefore, many ignorant people were deceived and actively offered bribes in an attempt to be appointed.

How It Was Uncovered

After receiving a confidential report on June 7, the Shanghai District of the First Bureau of the Political Security Department, knowing that there was no "Special Shanghai Supervisory Office" within the organization, recognized it as impersonation and swindling. It immediately dispatched officers to investigate and, on the night, arrested Li Mingjin, the major director, and Wang Xiaoshan [name obscured due to possible misspelling], the lieutenant secretary, both of whom were appointed by Liu, at the British [name obscured due to possible misspelling] Village on Robison Road in West Shanghai. Based on the confessions of the arrested individuals, they rushed to 821 Haining Road and arrested Liu himself, seizing more than a dozen privately carved [symbols obscured due to character corruption/illegibility], as well as privately printed official identification cards, a [symbol obscured due to character corruption/illegibility] pistol, and documents such as the roster of [symbol obscured due to character corruption/illegibility] cases. All were taken to the district for interrogation.

Hoping for Whistleblowing

The institutions under the Political Security Department are established to protect politics, eliminate reactionaries, expose corruption, and maintain local order. The discipline is strict, and there are absolutely no out-of-bounds actions. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will pay attention in the future. If they discover any similar cases of impersonation and swindling, they can report and expose them to the Shanghai District of the First Bureau of the Political Security Department at 76 Fanwangdu Road, Shanghai, to avoid being deceived and to maintain law and order.

### Security Training Corps Holds Make-Up Inauguration Ceremony

In January of this year, in order to improve the quality of officers and soldiers, the Security Headquarters gathered many active-duty officers and soldiers from various teams under its command for retraining. At the same time, it selected 150 outstanding young people and provided them with officer training for more than one year.

In addition to the head of the corps, Han Shangying, and his academic and scientific instructors and all the staff, more than 30 officials including Chief of Staff of the Security Headquarters Xiong Jiandong and liaison officers from friendly countries attended. After the ceremony, the head of the corps first reported on the training progress over the past three months, followed by Chief of Staff Xiong giving instructions on behalf of Commander Zhou. Other attending officials also delivered speeches in succession, mostly encouraging words. Everyone was inspired. The ceremony was simple and solemn. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.

### Economic Police Continue to Arrest Discount Offenders

The Economic Police Brigade of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Police Bureau investigated that some unscrupulous merchants have disregarded the law and secretly engaged in illegal transactions of discounting allocation slips, with discounts as high as two jiao to two and a half jiao per yuan, so dozens of such vendors have been arrested, and all the profits obtained have been confiscated and subject to detention. The brigade is still actively continuing to promote this work, mobilizing all economic police to conduct strict investigations in various markets, shops, and firms throughout the city. If there are any of the above-mentioned illegal acts, they will be arrested and investigated, and it has been reported that some firms have also been

### Natural Ice Allowed for Refrigeration

The Municipal Health Bureau has previously approved the Shanghai Natural Ice Industry Association and others to transport and sell natural ice to supplement the shortage of artificial ice. It is now summer, and various industries have a great need for ice, but due to power restrictions, the production of artificial ice is not abundant, resulting in supply falling short of demand, and the high price makes it difficult for users to bear. If natural ice does not directly contact food and is used for refrigeration and air conditioning, there is no obstacle to hygienic principles. Therefore, management measures have been formulated and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and the association is responsible for transportation and sales.
