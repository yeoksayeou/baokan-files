### Enhanced Sino-Soviet Friendship Contributes to World Peace; Chiang Kai-shek and Stalin Exchange Congratulatory Telegrams

TASS, Moscow, 19th: The original text of Chairman Chiang's letter to Marshal Stalin on August 15th is as follows:

"The defeated and exhausted Japanese aggressors have surrendered unconditionally. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese army, I extend my most sincere regards to Your Excellency and the Soviet people and army.

The Soviet Union's resolute participation in the war is one of the main reasons for accelerating the collapse of the cruel enemy. During the Allied struggle against the Axis powers, Your Excellency's wisdom and firm policies, as well as the Soviet army's glorious war successes, have won the admiration of the world. Complete victory over the enemy can only be attributed to the close military cooperation and unparalleled determination between the Allied nations. Henceforth, all the United Nations will strive to continue their cooperation, and we can be confident that the task of building a new world will be completed in a short period of time.

I firmly believe that the close friendship between our two countries, which is growing day by day, will not only contribute to lasting peace in East Asia but also be an important factor in establishing a new order for the world."

This victory has worldwide historical significance and is a great sign of the progressive development of all mankind.

Welcome Speech: "General Commander Li, you dedicated yourself to the revolution at a young age, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen for many years. During the anti-Yuan movement in 1913 and the Battle of Hukou, your call to action rallied support, earning you significant merit. In the Northern Expedition, you took on the role of vanguard, braving enemy fire, and your achievements are still remembered today. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, you volunteered to fight behind enemy lines. For eight years, you fought tirelessly in the Xuzhou-Lianyungang-Huaiyin region, suppressing violence and ensuring the safety of the people. In this fog of war, northern Jiangsu was able to maintain a pocket of freedom, and justice was preserved, all thanks to your efforts. Now that the war is over and peace has been achieved, we look back with deep appreciation for your invaluable contributions. While celebrations are natural, the task of restoration must not be delayed. As you command significant military and political power in northern Jiangsu, our association, representing the people of your hometown, hopes for your prompt return to ensure security, protect commerce, and bring stability to the people. We cannot express enough our heartfelt wishes and anticipation."

Commander Li's Reply: "After my escape last month, I received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, expressing his commendation for my loyalty and service, and expressing his own inadequacy. Looking back on the past eight years, I have been stationed in northern Jiangsu, leading the resistance. I am grateful for the assistance of the local people, and I have acted with integrity. I dare say I am innocent. The righteousness of the people of northern Jiangsu is deeply moving. I am currently in Shanghai, consulting with doctors about my ear and dental issues, awaiting instructions from the central government before planning my return. The people of northern Jiangsu have suffered greatly and are in dire need of respite. Therefore, all post-war reconstruction efforts must be carefully planned. I am willing to return military power to the central government and dedicate myself to local reconstruction, sharing both the hardships and the rewards with my comrades."

### Chairman Chiang's Representative in Shanghai, Jiang Bo, Delivers Important Speech

Expressing Hopes for Colleagues and Citizens

Chairman Chiang appointed Jiang Bo as the Chairman’s Representative to Shanghai, formerly the Chairman of the Puppet Military Affairs Commission, residing in the International Settlement on the 18th. After being appointed, Jiang immediately organized the Representative’s Office and appointed Huang Bo as the Secretary-General of the office, commencing operations. Yesterday, Representative Jiang delivered a speech expressing his hopes for his colleagues and the citizens:

"I have been secretly working in Shanghai for eight years, facing numerous challenges and hardships. Fortunately, I have been guided by Chairman Chiang and supported by my colleagues, allowing us to overcome all difficulties. In the late spring of last year, due to overwork, I developed high blood pressure and subsequently suffered a stroke. At the same time, I was arrested and interrogated by the Japanese military police, but I continued to oversee my colleagues' work in secret. Now that the Japanese government has accepted the Potsdam Declaration and ceased military operations, I am fortunate to be free and have been appointed by Chairman Chiang as the Representative in Shanghai. I have immediately established the Representative’s Office and commenced operations. Before the arrival of the National Army and local administrative officials, the local order and security rely entirely on the cooperation of officials and citizens. I would like to express my hopes for my colleagues and the citizens:

The responsibility for maintaining local security and order has been temporarily entrusted by the central government to existing agencies and troops, and no disturbances are allowed. I also hope that the people will remain calm and maintain order, refraining from disorderly conduct.

Industrial, commercial, and financial institutions should maintain the status quo and stabilize the market, refraining from hoarding, speculation, and profiteering, so as not to affect the livelihood of the people.

Employees of industrial, commercial, and transportation institutions currently managed by the Japanese military should do their utmost to protect all assets, refraining from moving, destroying, or selling them.

The Japanese military and civilians in Shanghai should be treated with tolerance and kindness, demonstrating the magnanimity of our great nation.

If any agencies or organizations have proposals regarding important welfare matters for the citizens, I will consider them and forward them to the central government for review.

For the past eight years, the people in the occupied areas have suffered greatly, and the government and Chairman Chiang are deeply concerned. From now on, the reconstruction efforts will be complex and challenging, requiring the united efforts of everyone. I hope that the above points will be widely publicized."

After receiving their orders, Commander Hua and others have arrived in Shanghai and established the Special Operations Unit. Yesterday, Commander Hua met with reporters and gave a brief statement, saying: "I have been ordered to Shanghai to take charge of special operations. I will fully comply with Chairman Chiang's instructions and the orders from my superiors, and handle all matters diligently. I will also maintain close contact with the central party, government, and military agencies in Shanghai. However, the situation in Shanghai is complex. If any unscrupulous individuals disrupt security or violate military discipline, our unit will take strict action. I hope that all citizens will maintain close contact with our unit to maintain order and assist in maintaining security."

### Banks and Firms Will Change Business Hours

According to news from the financial sector, the business hours of banks and firms in Shanghai, which were originally based on summer hours, will be changed again starting next month due to business needs. The new hours will be determined and announced by the Bankers and Firms Association.

### Various Industries Settle Debts with Banks and Firms

Banks and firms in Shanghai have provided loans such as overdrafts, mortgages, and discounted bills to various industrial and commercial enterprises. According to news from the financial sector, businesses are now voluntarily repaying their short-term debts to banks and firms without being urged, and are even requesting to settle their long-term debts early, which is completely different from the previous situation. Banks and firms are surprised by this.

### Hanging the National Flag

— Cheng

Citizens celebrating victory are unanimously displaying the national flag. On the streets and on rooftops, we see our national flag flying everywhere. What an exciting sight!

However, some people need to correct their methods and attitudes when hanging the national flag. For example, not raising the flag fully, hanging it at half-mast, is the first thing that should be corrected. Whether hanging it horizontally or vertically, it must be raised to the top of the pole. Also, laughing and joking casually when raising or lowering the national flag, and showing disrespect, should also be corrected. Those hanging the flag must have a solemn attitude, and onlookers must stand at attention and watch. Raise the flag at sunrise, lower it at sunset, and do not leave it up overnight or in rainy weather.

All these methods and attitudes for hanging the national flag should be based on respect as the principle. The national flag is a symbol of the state, and respecting the national flag is respecting the state, which is enough to inspire patriotism.

Therefore, citizens must pay attention to all aspects of hanging the national flag, and at the same time, medical personnel must also provide guidance and correction, and especially explain the meaning of respecting the national flag.

### American Publications

— Chao

Major American magazines include the economic magazine "The Analyst Weekly," the international political analysis magazine "Current History" monthly, and the government-related international political magazine "Foreign Affairs." The well-known weekly magazines "The Nation" and "The New Republic" often publish articles and book reviews on the current situation in the United States and other countries. "The Saturday Review of Literature" magazine and "Reader's Digest" magazine both publish articles on literature, art, and science. Avant-garde writers are centered around the magazine "New Masses."

American publishing businesses are operated by large corporations, which not only have printing plants and publishing houses, but also operate large-scale forestry industries to maintain the source of paper necessary for manufacturing books. Even during the world economic panic of 1929-1933, the total revenue of publications in 1929 was still $1.564 billion, of which advertising revenue reached $1.111 billion, and pre-orders and retail revenue were only $453 million. In 1930, there were 8,134 new books and 1,893 reprints, totaling 10,027 titles. In 1939, there were 10,640 new books, excluding reprints. By title count, the Macmillan Publishing Company ranked first, with 492 titles; followed by Grosset & Dunlap with 337 titles, Oxford University Press with 312 titles, and McGraw-Hill Publishing Company with 203 titles. The largest publishing company, Macmillan, was established in 1843 and has branches in New York and London.

### Old Home

— Ren Jian

Seven years of separation, the date of return is still uncertain, the old dreams are gradually blurred, how can I bear this sorrow? With the nostalgia for my old home, I finally set foot in Zhabei after the war.

On the desolate roadsides, the traces of war are still vivid, desolate and bleak, and the old situation is unbearable to recall! My devastated motherland, am I a stranger on this war-torn land? But I can no longer recognize the roads I once knew from my memory! All the buildings have been destroyed by the ruthless artillery fire, the charred and withered trees stand alone on the desolate roadsides, the empty and dilapidated broken walls are also visible everywhere, the desolate tombs decorate the empty fields, and the great architectural features support its remnants, standing alone on the rubble field covered with weeds, telling the faint sunlight of its former glory and the kindness of the old owner, adding a bit of the desolation of human affairs. The boundless sky reveals the secrets of the souls of the disappointed, and the songs of the birds also seem to be sad elegies, lonely and desolate and unbearable to hear. On the desolate thatched huts, intermittent smoke is rising, and thinking of home, I feel even more longing for my relatives. At this time, no matter how cold and hard your heart is, you can't help but shed tears. How can we not resent the cruelty of this war? Our grief and anger seem to be beyond expression by tears and sighs.

The old site of my home plunged me into memories of the past. I never thought that when I had deeply understood the tastes of human feelings and returned to visit my old home again, the beautiful homeland would have turned into scorched earth. People can never predict tomorrow! I will always remember that unforgettable moonlit night when I left my lovely home. The joys of the past have now turned into bleak relics, and when I recall them, I can't help but feel sad!

Even if the old home is rebuilt now, it will no longer be able to have the carefree joy of the past, because my old father has passed away with regret, and what about myself? In recent years, I have been suffering from the hardships of life, wandering in the vast sea of ​​people, running around all day long, so only my mother is left alone at home, more lonely. The impoverished reunion of the past is far better than the desolate loneliness of today! I finally had to leave the site of my old home with regret.

At this time, a heavy and solemn bell rang in the distance. Is it a report of light? Or a call from the motherland? When will a beautiful home be rebuilt on the scorched earth?

The time is not far away! (Donations to Help Students)

### "Victory Celebration Team" Receives Enthusiastic Response from All Sectors

Eagerness to Serve the Public, Loving the Country and the People

Our newspaper proposed a slogan the day before yesterday to increase fundraising for student aid: "Celebrating Victory While Not Forgetting to Help Students." Based on past experience, we believe that we can raise more student aid funds for celebrations and rescue more poor students. I remember that a month ago, Shanghai suffered an air raid, with countless deaths and injuries and devastation everywhere. Disaster relief donations came in droves, and we proposed the slogan "Disaster Relief While Not Forgetting to Help Students." Sure enough, donations for student aid surged. By analogy, the enthusiasm for celebration is even greater than for disaster relief. We can imagine that the individuals and groups that contribute to celebrate victory will be a hundred times greater than in the past. Yesterday, Renhe Hospital and Tongda Money Shop took the lead in responding, each contributing to a Victory Celebration Team. We greatly admire this spirit of serving the public, loving the country and the people! In addition, the celebration measures issued by the central government and published in various newspapers will soon be held grandly. The business and industry sectors in Shanghai will definitely be quick to donate first. The size of the celebration teams expresses the public's enthusiasm for loving the country and the people. At that time, our highest leader will also feel very happy about the charitable actions of all sectors to protect poor students!

### Peace of Mind Among the People; Commodity Prices Plummet

Hoarding Groups Painfully Sell Their Stocks

In recent days, commodity prices in this city have plummeted unprecedentedly. The reasons are as follows: A large quantity of materials stored by the Japanese army have been released onto the market; all large and small hoarding groups, feeling insecure, are selling goods at low prices; and public sentiment is stable, leading to a sharp decrease in demand for goods. Due to this situation, the prices of all kinds of goods have fallen sharply in recent days. Whether it is rice, food, oil, sugar, fuel, soap, cigarettes, matches, or other daily necessities, there are few buyers. According to observations from the city's industrial and commercial sectors, the price decline will intensify because transportation in various regions will gradually recover, goods can be freely transported for buying and selling, and production capacity will return to normal. Therefore, the city's general hoarding groups are extremely worried and are painfully selling their hoarded goods.

### The Origin of the Patriotic Contribution Movement

Yesterday, we received a letter from reader Changfeng, suggesting a "Patriotic Contribution" movement and initially donating 50,000 yuan in [currency type] as an initiative, showing commendable enthusiasm. Fortunately, patriotic contributions during this celebration of victory and reconstruction...

The unprecedented suffering of the past eight years has finally ended in a final victory under the leadership and struggle of Chairman Chiang. Peace-loving people around the world are celebrating wildly. Victory cannons are heard everywhere, and the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flutters everywhere! We express our most sincere respect to the loyal, brave, and martyred soldiers and civilians, and we salute the returning soldiers who have endured hardships!

Now, although the great national war has come to an end, we must "be cautious in victory," and follow Chairman Chiang's instructions to "not remember old grudges and be kind to others, in order to promote the highest and most precious virtue of our national tradition," giving benevolence and compassion to guide these innocent people oppressed by the Japanese militarists, so that they can repent and consciously join our democratic paradise of peace!

Finally, our great land, having suffered through this tragic war, needs immediate reconstruction. On the one hand, economic assistance and spiritual comfort should be immediately provided to the families of the loyal and martyred soldiers and civilians! The greatest consolation should be quickly given to the soldiers defending the country in the war zones. Although I am just a small employee, my patriotic enthusiasm has always been second to none. Therefore, I donate one-quarter of my salary for this month, amounting to 50,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes (to be converted into national currency later), and send it to your publication, hoping that you will collect a certain amount and present it to the country. I propose to name it the "Patriotic Contribution Movement" with a target of 50,000,000 yuan in national currency (not Central Reserve Bank notes). This is like a drop in the bucket, knowing that it will not solve the problem, but there is no shortage of great merchants and wealthy people at sea, as well as major organizations. If they can rise up in response, then by accumulating small contributions, the will of the people can build a great wall. Those who have money should contribute money, and those who have strength should contribute strength, jointly shouldering the important task of national reconstruction!
