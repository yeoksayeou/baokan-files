### Chairman Wang Yintai of the North China Political Affairs Commission Arrives in Beijing; Makes a Statement to Newspaper Reporters

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Chairman Wang Yintai of the North China Political Affairs Commission arrived in Beijing by plane from Beiping at 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning. Central government officials who welcomed him at the airport included Foreign Minister Chu Minyi and National Government officials.

Chairman Wang made the following statement to reporters: Since taking office, Yintai has briefly arranged various affairs. Today, I personally enter the capital to pay respects to Acting Chairman Chen and seek advice, and report on the political situation to the central government. I have been in office for many years and deeply regret that I have not made any achievements. This time, I am again ordered by the central government to take charge of political affairs in the north. Looking around at the country's difficulties, I feel even more the importance of my responsibility. Unifying, peace, and reviving the motherland are the common goals of the Chinese people. To achieve this goal, we must stand firm, recognize the direction, be sincere and diligent, and move forward independently. If we can reawaken the youthful national innovation spirit, I am confident that all difficult situations can be overcome, and all construction problems will naturally be eliminated. At this critical time, we especially rely on compatriots from all sides to shoulder the mission of saving the country.

### Outline of the Capital's Price Stabilization and Discipline Enforcement Committee (Part Two)

— Ren Ping

Hoarding Rice is Punishable by Death

Among the seven essential necessities of life, rice is the most important, so the attention paid to it is also greater. After the establishment of the committee, the first thing it did was to revise the rice control measures, lift the blockade of the city gates, and abolish the limit of eight kilograms of rice allowed to enter the city. Moreover, it wanted to ensure that the rice sources in the five nearby counties of Jiangning, Jurong, Piaoshui, Jiangpu, and Liuhe, which supply food to the capital, were unobstructed, and even counties in Anhui Province that produce rice were allowed to transport it to the capital freely. Moreover, all rice peddlers or military police who used trains to run singlehandedly to various stations in Shanghai were banned to prevent rice from flowing out due to the high prices in Shanghai.

Initially, the rice price was also fairly evaluated, and the price limit was set at 20,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). Later, when the price limit was revised again on March 8, it was not announced because it was still awaiting negotiation with relevant parties, and then it was opened due to the rampant black market, becoming a decision based on the situation at any time.

However, anyone who intends to profit by hoarding and speculation, which is sufficient to hinder the relationship between supply and demand, whether official or civilian, will be punished with the "death penalty" in accordance with the Special Criminal Law during wartime.

As for firewood, in addition to the unified purchase by the city government, police, and military police three agencies, which began on February 1, and the quantitative distribution according to the actual number of people to meet the needs of military, police, and military police teams, government agencies, schools, soldiers, and students, if military police still intercept and demand firewood, once discovered, they will also be executed by military order.

Another point worth mentioning is that the public-operated company's various malpractices previously caused the price of pork to skyrocket. Now the company's activities have been stopped, and all previous fees of 1,600 yuan per pig for stamping and charging have been waived, allowing free entry into the city for sale. Therefore, the recent decline in pork prices to below the price limit is precisely the effect of eliminating agencies that enrich themselves.

Living Allowance for Military Police

In order to thoroughly assist in suppressing prices and stabilizing the lives of military police in the capital, the committee also stipulated the issuance of living allowances, and, with the rise and fall of prices, divided them into two types: "minimum living allowance" and "allowance for supporting direct relatives." However, the "allowance for supporting direct relatives" is limited to the recipient's parents, grandparents, spouse, and children in school who are over 60 years old and reside in the capital.

The "minimum living allowance" for all military police officers is uniformly 8,335 yuan per person per month. Police officers are subsidized 4,872 yuan per person per month. Military police are subsidized 7,515 yuan per person per month. Soldiers are subsidized 2,500 yuan per person per month. These are all amounts supplemented in addition to the base salary to maintain the individual's minimum living standard. Regarding the "allowance for supporting direct relatives," all officers and soldiers are treated equally. Each family member is subsidized 10,000 yuan. Three or fewer family members are counted as one person, four to five family members are subsidized 20,000 yuan, and six or more family members are subsidized 30,000 yuan, but the maximum is 30,000 yuan.

The above-mentioned allowances and subsidies were determined based on the prices in the first ten days of each month. The prices change with price fluctuations. The numbers above are all the amounts issued according to the prices in the first ten days of January. When issuing the allowances, the distribution team sends a mixed team of personnel to work with the competent authorities, troops, and school authorities to distribute them by name according to the register. If there is any fraudulent reporting, it will be severely punished according to law.

The Price Stabilization and Discipline Enforcement Committee has been in operation for almost two months since its inception. In view of the recent upward trend in prices in the capital, the committee authorities cannot but bear the responsibility, and must quickly find ways to overcome various difficulties so that prices can truly reach the point of being "stabilized by suppression." Only when the people's livelihood is rescued from dire straits will there be hope, just as the newly appointed chairman, Xiao Shuxuan, said in his speech on the 20th, telling us to strengthen our work, which is what the entire city's people are looking forward to.

Editorial

### Adjusting the Distribution of Fair-Price Rice

Regarding the process of handling fair-price rice, Chen, the president of this newspaper, made a report on the 26th in a substitute commentary from the position of someone who participated in it. It explained that the significance of fair-price rice is to supplement the inadequacy of general ration and key ration rice, so as to suppress the rise in black market rice prices. The target of the ration is limited to workers in various industries and low-salary classes. The amount of distribution is roughly determined according to the number of people in each sector, with each sector receiving a certain number of units. The decision on the distribution amount is only based on objective estimates, and is of course not entirely ideal. Moreover, after two periods of implementation and distribution, various discussions on the distribution issue have been aroused in various aspects, revealing reactions that are not entirely reasonable.

Why is the target of the ration limited to workers in various industries and low-salary classes? According to our observation, it is because most workers in various industries have meager salaries and difficult lives. The so-called workers in various industries here of course refer to those with low salaries. For example, senior staff in the same institution, although also workers, have higher salaries and do not conform to the principle of being in the low-salary class, and should naturally not be included in the ration. At the same time, the original intention of fair-price rice is to benefit the low-salary class. If those with higher salaries in the same institution also enjoy the ration, it reduces the number of low-salary earners and reduces the benefits for the low-salary class. Therefore, we advocate that not only should those with higher salaries in the same institution not be given the same ration as those with lower salaries, but also that in the same sector, those who are equally low-salary earners should also be divided into higher and lower levels within the lower class, and the distribution amount should be adjusted accordingly. For example, in the news and culture sector, news employees and newspaper vendors are both low-salary classes, but in general comparison between the two, newspaper vendors' salaries are even lower than those of news employees, while the number of news employees is larger. In comparing and considering the two, the decision is made to distribute the same amount. This distribution method is based on the original intention and principles of fair-price rice. As for the decision of each unit to receive the ration within the same sector, it is also necessary to consider the obligations to the wartime state and society and the principle of high and low salaries of employees. For example, the nine units listed in the news and culture sector, such as news employees and periodicals, are of course not fully inclusive of the news and culture sector. This is because these units generally fulfill more wartime propaganda obligations. For example, in the banking sector, all banks are qualified to be included in the unit, and the Central Reserve Bank also belongs to the banking sector. However, because the Central Reserve Bank is a state bank, the salaries of its employees are higher, and there is a special ration, it is not included. This distribution method is also in line with the original intention and principles of fair-price rice.

The "Industry Associations and Fair-Price Rice" article published in the Continental News on the 24th of this month (see page two of today's newspaper) criticizes the industry associations' distribution method. We believe there is considerable reason for this. The industry associations' distribution method also neglects the original intention and principles mentioned above. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the nature of the industry association members and what kind of obligations they have fulfilled to the wartime state and society. It is necessary to consider the number of industry association members and the salaries of their employees, and then decide on the distribution amount, which is more reasonable.

Let us put the past aside for the time being. In the future distribution of fair-price rice, it is hoped that all sectors will fully consider the original intention and principles of fair-price rice and consider reasonable adjustment methods, so that the low-salary classes who contribute to the wartime state and society can fully benefit.

### Insufficient Supply of Enemy American Military Supplies Leads to Sharp Production Decline; Director Matsudaira Discusses American Material Panic

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference yesterday afternoon. Director of Public Relations Matsudaira explained the situation within the United States, elaborating in detail on the decline of military supplies, the impoverishment of national life, and the degradation of moral standards. The gist of his statement is recorded below:

**Sharp Decline in American Military Production** Since October of last year, the production of American military supplies has decreased dramatically, resulting in a severe shortage of supplies for the European theater. General Eisenhower has repeatedly requested increased production from the domestic front to meet urgent needs. There are two reasons for this shortage of military supplies: First, the supply system is insufficient, wages have decreased, and military industries have shifted to the manufacture of civilian goods. Second, demand has increased, as can be seen in Eisenhower's report. The demand for small arms such as machine guns and rifles in the European theater has increased fourfold compared to previous estimates, artillery has doubled, and other ammunition, fuel, clothing, and other supplies have increased significantly. The most severe period of the American military supply shortage was in October and November of last year. Production could only meet 68% of demand. Heavy weapons production, which was relatively higher, only reached 64% of demand, leaving a shortfall of more than 35%. Heavy trucks only reached 31%, and tanks were short by 35%. The above figures are based on the announcement made by Secretary of the Army Supply Somerville on November 21st. Although production has reportedly increased since then, according to figures released as of March 20th of this year, the US Army and Navy have completely exhausted their stockpiles of military supplies, and their production capacity has reached its peak. Therefore, the United States has recently adopted the slogan of shipping military supplies directly from factories to the battlefield. Recent consumption of American military supplies in Europe and East Asia has been enormous, further exacerbating the shortage.

**Major Food Shortages** Secondly, regarding the plight of American civilian life, the main food crop, wheat, suffered an unprecedented harvest failure last year. Therefore, based on the distribution of population and production, each person will inevitably consume 20% less. Consequently, the government is promoting the consumption of sweet potatoes among the public. Last year, the average beef consumption per American citizen was 147 pounds (40 pounds more than the British). However, due to a reduction in production of 200 million pounds last year, this year's beef consumption per citizen will inevitably decrease significantly. New York City's butcher shops have officially set prices regulated by the government. However, according to a foreign dispatch dated March 22nd, 90% of the beef sold is at black market prices. Butter production is even more insufficient, with a shortage unseen in the past seven years. Public consumption has been restricted. Sugar production has been greatly reduced due to sugarcane crops in southern regions (including Brazil) suffering from typhoons, and public consumption will also be severely restricted this year. The United States has traditionally exported cotton cloth and yarn, but this year is different. The civilian allocation of shirts has been reduced to 60%, and towels to 50%. The production of automobile tires this year is estimated at 18 million, while the actual demand is 48 million. Tobacco production is also insufficient, even in North Carolina, which is famous for its tobacco production. Therefore, it is very difficult to buy cigarettes in the market. Even the staff serving President Roosevelt in the White House must queue up when buying cigarettes, which is indicative of the situation. The cigarette ration for overseas expeditionary force soldiers has also been reduced. American soldiers stationed in Paris must pay US$4.80 for a pack of domestically produced cigarettes, equivalent to the black market price. Non-direct combat units, such as supply, nursing, maintenance, and transportation units, have all had their cigarette supplies discontinued. Due to financial difficulties, the government is aggressively promoting the sale of public bonds, leaving no avenue unexplored. Whether people buy cigarettes, matches, or even watch football or baseball games, they must also purchase public bonds.

**Glimpse of National Moral Decay** Finally, regarding the decline of national moral standards, due to the pressure of life, crimes such as black market trading, theft, and fraud have increased compared to before. The most obvious are the black markets for gasoline and train tickets, which are particularly criticized by citizens. Crime rates have generally increased in various regions, with a particularly sharp increase in female crime, more than 145% higher than usual. The age of offenders is mostly around 17 years old. Although marriages are numerous, divorce cases are also not uncommon. According to statistics from the Chicago Civil Court last year, there were 15,000 divorce cases in a year, accounting for half of the marriages. A glimpse of the decay of American national morality can be seen.

### Committee on Industry and Commerce Holds Third General Meeting Yesterday; Vice Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Attends and Delivers Speech

(2) To investigate the organizational structure, management personnel, and economic status of industry associations in various industries, requesting assistance from the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (3) To investigate the content of department stores and trading companies in Shanghai.

**Vice Minister Jiang Discusses Mission in Shanghai**

The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Jiang, met with reporters in Shanghai yesterday and stated: In addition to chairing the third plenary meeting of the Committee on Industry and Commerce Investigation convened by the authorities today, his most important mission is to discuss and communicate with the local industrial sector and relevant parties to address the coal transportation problem and avert an industrial crisis. Currently, industrial production in Shanghai is at a standstill, primarily due to power shortages caused by a lack of coal supply. However, in various coal-producing regions, there are currently twelve coal-producing areas with accumulated coal reserves, but transportation difficulties prevent them from being shipped to Shanghai. For example, the Longtan Coal Mine near the capital has recently stored over 4,000 tons of coal. Furthermore, reserves at Mantoushan, Xiafa, and Huainan are even more staggering. He intends to actively find ways to expedite the transport of this coal to Shanghai to meet the urgent needs of factories. Regarding the issue of promoting industrial development, Director Tang of the Industrial Department of the Ministry arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and has been in contact with leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors.

### Police Department Adjusts Affairs of Various Agencies

In order to refresh police administration, the Shanghai Police Department has adjusted its organizational structure and personnel. The original Accounting Office has been abolished, and all accounting affairs have been transferred to the Accounting Section of the First Department. Subsequently, police salaries will be issued by the Accounting Section. Furthermore, the free rice rations for police officers, which were previously handled by the Personnel Section of the First Department, are now to be managed by the newly reorganized Police Welfare Society. Therefore, it has been ordered that the Police Welfare Society take over these affairs, and all police welfare matters will henceforth be handled by the Police Welfare Society.

### Trade Associations and Affordable Rice

— Yangzijiang Ren

The second round of affordable rice distribution has been completed. According to Chinese friends, so-called "affordable rice" is rice sold at the purchase price without adding any commercial profit. Especially at a time when household rice rationing has stopped and the pursuit of profits from rice is endless, the distribution of affordable rice, even in small quantities and limited scope, is undoubtedly a great boon for the starving people.

The source of the affordable rice is the agricultural tax in Jiangsu Province. Distressed by the ever-rising rice prices, the municipal government and citizens, represented by Luo Junqiang, Li Sihao, and Chen Binhe, began negotiations with Jiangsu Province to cheaply resell the agricultural tax rice to the Shanghai municipal government. The Jiangsu Provincial authorities, based on the spirit of "promoting good Shanghai municipal administration," immediately agreed and concluded a contract for the sale of 100,000 *shi* of rice. The affordable rice currently sold at a low price of 37,000 yuan per *shi* is part of these 100,000 *shi*. The hope of "promoting good Shanghai municipal administration" is not only the hope of the leaders of Jiangsu Province, but also the prayer of the four million citizens of Shanghai. Needless to say, 100,000 *shi* is just a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. However, every citizen should personally know that in such a critical and dangerous situation, obtaining even a grain of rice requires much hardship and struggle, so they should not dislike it for being too little but should value it. To seek good politics, one must first seek good distribution. However, can it be said that the affordable rice distribution entrusted by the municipal government to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is being handled in a good way?

Charitable organizations and cultural institutions have all received affordable rice rations. However, the main recipients of the rations are the various trade associations. The mission and strength of trade associations are undoubtedly undeniable, and they have made certain contributions to the country and society. However, it is really impossible to agree that all trade associations, regardless of their size or importance, should receive the precious affordable rice rations equally. Just reading the advertisements in the newspapers should make it clear that organizations such as the Bathhouse Trade Association, the Advertising Trade Association, the Stock Brokers Association, the Teahouse Association, and the Superstitious Items Trade Association, etc., are all contributing nothing to the Greater East Asia War and are of no importance to the stability of people's livelihood. That these same organizations also receive a quantity of affordable rice rations equal to that of others is really incomprehensible and even laughable. A Chinese friend said the other day, "It cost me and a friend 8,000 yuan to take a bath." In today's world of expensive rice and firewood, how many Shanghailanders can afford to go to the bathhouse and comfortably have the "old men" and "old women" inside rub their backs? It is even more strange that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, while giving cheap affordable rice rations to many unimportant trade associations, puts on airs and acts officially towards the employees of wartime-important organizations!

The Economic Bureau of the Municipal Government has recently repeatedly stated that it will resolutely rectify trade associations. But the fact that it is generously distributing affordable rice to trade associations that are currently unrelated to people's livelihood, is this not the same as the authorities' statement being just empty words on paper? All those who sweat and cry for the war and people's livelihood should be the first to receive rice, that is our claim. (Translated from the Continental News, March 24)

### Talks by Shanghai Representatives at the Wartime People's Congress; Three Proposals for Government Adoption

The Provincial and Municipal Wartime People's Congress is scheduled to be held in the capital on March 28. The Shanghai representatives are Yuan Ludeng, Chen Binhe, Chen Riping, and Zhou Yueran. Except for Chen Binhe, who could not attend due to circumstances, the remaining three were interviewed by reporters from the Central News Agency yesterday and made the following remarks:

**Yuan Ludeng's Remarks**

I am pleased to hear that the people of the capital are aware of the current difficulties and that representatives from the provinces and cities are meeting in Beijing to gather public opinion, discuss national affairs, and contribute to the government's adoption. Therefore, four representatives from Shanghai are attending, and I, Ludeng, was honored to be one of them. In response to the Central News Agency reporter's request for my opinion, I, speaking as a businessman, would like to briefly mention the general opinions of the Shanghai industrial and commercial community. (1) In terms of transportation: I hope that transportation will be smooth so that materials can flow smoothly. (2) In terms of food: I hope that food and vegetables from the suburbs of Shanghai will flow in as much as possible, and I hope that household rice can be rationed on time. (3) In terms of daily necessities: I hope that the control organizations will focus on increasing the availability of daily necessities for citizens within the possible range. (4) In terms of production: Shanghai industrial and commercial enterprises hope to have sufficient raw materials and increased electricity supply so that manufactured goods can be imported into rural areas and agricultural products can flow into cities. In this way, the use of currency will be smooth, which will not only suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, but also greatly contribute to production and national construction.

**Chen Riping's Remarks**

Shanghai was originally an industrial and commercial area with a large population, and its food supply has always depended on various sources. At a time when the war is becoming increasingly fierce, if transportation is blocked and food transport is not smooth, various problems will arise, which is really important. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government, in view of this, has specifically established a Population Evacuation Committee, which is now actively promoting its work. I will briefly state my opinion on this matter as a representative attending this People's Congress.

In order to smoothly promote the population evacuation work in this city, I sincerely hope that the relevant authorities will provide assistance to neighboring provinces and cities so that it can be realized. That is, (1) the security and food of the receiving areas should be thoroughly ensured. Secondly, the business problems of those being evacuated should be facilitated so that they can make a living. (2) Regarding transportation, such as railways, ships, and vehicles, I hope that the authorities and relevant parties will provide assistance to facilitate the process.

In addition, I also hope that the public will automatically cooperate with the evacuation work so that the evacuation work in this city can be carried out smoothly with the cooperation of the government and the people.

**Zhou Yueran's Remarks**

I have great hopes for this People's Congress. Although I am already sixty years old and have "no power to truss a chicken," I should also use some thoughts for the country, and I have already been very honorably elected as one of the four representatives of Shanghai.

After receiving the notification from the municipal government, the four of us met for dinner on the 25th to discuss the matter. What we talked about at that time was nothing more than our hopes for the congress. We hope for "overall peace," we hope for "victory in the final battle"... Our hopes are very big, very many! But later, we thought of three things, three major things related to Shanghai, that it seemed necessary to propose a motion for each. (1) People's food, (2) industry, (3) evacuation. Regarding people's food, we want to ask the government to dredge the source. Regarding industry, we want to ask the government to restore the current. Regarding evacuation, we want to ask the government to protect it. The drafting of each motion has been completed, but because the text is very long and because it has not yet been submitted, I am not at liberty to record it all here.

These three motions may not be proposed, - we are going to be disappointed. We arrived at the station early this morning (27th) (before 8:00 AM) and sat there for more than ten minutes. Knowing that the express train was not running, we wanted to switch to the night train, but as of this moment (3:00 PM on the 27th), the tickets have not been purchased, and I am afraid we cannot leave, - I am afraid we will not make it to the congress. The congress has a fixed date, of course, it cannot wait for us. If we really cannot make it, then we cannot propose motions, we cannot discuss. Our hopes have vanished - we are disappointed!

### Municipal Education Bureau Punishes those who Deceitfully Receive Special Rice Rations

The municipal authorities have issued key rice rations to teachers and staff of public and private schools in this city in order to stabilize the lives of these workers and increase work efficiency. At the same time, in order to prevent double-dipping, it is stipulated that part-time teachers and staff are only allowed to receive rations at one school. If it is found that they have deceitfully received rations from two schools, the schools concerned will be subject to the penalty of having all rice rations suspended. Recently, the Material Distribution Office found that several teachers had concurrently received rice rations, and they have already suspended their special rations for one month to show a warning. Furthermore, Fan Zhixuan, a teacher at Shumin Middle School, fabricated a false name and falsely reported his age and citizen's certificate number in order to concurrently receive rice rations. After investigation by the Education Bureau, he was instructed to be transferred to the police station for investigation and prosecution.

### Enrollment in Free Elementary Schools; Request Assistance from Neighboring Schools; Hope Baojia Chiefs Will Also Actively Introduce

The preparations for the ten free elementary schools organized by this office have been repeatedly reported in this column. In addition to training twenty teachers at the Xinzha Road Elementary School in recent days, enrollment matters are being actively handled. Although we have been vigorously promoting it in the newspapers recently, perhaps few out-of-school children and their parents have the opportunity to read the newspapers. Therefore, the following two methods are used: (1) Please ask the teachers of the neighboring elementary and middle schools around each free school to verbally promote and introduce enrollment to out-of-school children in the various alleys and lanes where they live for students above the upper grades; (2) Please ask the general Lian Bao chiefs near each free school to inform the Baojia chiefs to introduce out-of-school children to enroll. Saving out-of-school children is the most important social cause at present, and I think everyone will show sympathy and will be able to enthusiastically assist.

In order to collect teaching materials for the free schools, we have sent a letter to the China United Publishing Company, requesting donations of teaching methods. Yesterday, we received a reply agreeing to send down elementary school Chinese, arithmetic, common sense, and high school Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, and natural teaching methods, totaling forty-four types, ten copies of each type, totaling four hundred and forty copies. Their enthusiasm for education is truly admirable. The letter is as follows:

**China United Publishing Company Generously Donates a Large Number of Books**

Yesterday, we received a letter stating that your association is holding free elementary schools to help out-of-school children and benefit society, which is deeply admired. We will comply with your request to donate elementary school teaching methods to express our sincerity. Now, the full number is matched according to the list, with a total of forty-four types, ten of each type, attached to this letter. I hope you will receive it.

In addition, the entire student body of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association Third Elementary School donated 723 textbooks, Yu Elementary School 600 textbooks, and Yongguang Elementary School 500 textbooks, whose enthusiasm is equally admirable.

**Ningbo Shanghai Third Elementary School Students Donate Money and Gifts**

A letter from all the students of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association Third Elementary School said: "Your newspaper is founding free elementary schools, launching a campaign to collect textbooks, and soliciting free school funds, which we fully sympathize with. We found the textbooks we had read and saved up our daily snack money. As of yesterday, we have donated 723 textbooks and 20,000 yuan in savings, which we will send first, and we ask our classmates to continue to raise donations, and we hope that other students will respond together."
