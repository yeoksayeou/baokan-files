### Eleven Ships Sunk or Damaged Near Nakagusuku Bay, Okinawa: Result of Japanese Air Force's Nighttime General Offensive

Frontline Base, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In coordination with the duties of the Giretsu Airborne Unit, the Japanese Air Force, from late night on the 27th to dawn on the 28th, used the "Thunder Squad", Special Attack Teams, and heavy bombers to launch a general offensive against enemy fleets attempting new operations in the vicinity of Nakagusuku Bay, Okinawa. As a result, they sank three enemy large transport ships, two cruisers, one battleship, heavily damaged one large transport ship, one medium transport ship, and three ships of unknown type. Furthermore, Army Assault Teams and Navy heavy bomber squadrons, overcoming enemy nighttime fighter interceptions, attacked Ie Shima and seized control of the island's airfield. In this operation, only one Japanese aircraft failed to return.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from the U.S. military base on Iwo Jima, a powerful Japanese "Air Fleet" launched a fierce attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet around Okinawa Island for approximately eighteen hours between the 24th and 25th, reportedly damaging eleven ships.

Naha Area Hills Discolored: U.S. Announces Naval Losses

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A New York Herald Tribune reporter, on the 24th, published the following account of the fierce fighting from the frontline base near Okinawa to the area near Naha: Due to weeks of shelling, the hilly terrain has become discolored. U.S. military vehicles are buried in mud pits, and the vast fields connecting the northwest slope are scattered with helmets, water bottles, and other equipment abandoned during the hasty retreat of the U.S. Marines. Furthermore, on the muddy roads west of the hills, the remains of U.S. tanks and amphibious vehicles are everywhere, all destroyed by Japanese artillery fire.

The *Liddle*, a 2,000-ton elite vessel, had only been commissioned in May of last year.

### Situation in Various Battle Zones

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The war situation this week is as follows: The Battle of Okinawa in the Ryukyus has intensified further this week, with fierce land, sea, and air battles continuing. Since the 19th, after the enemy reinforced their forces, they launched another major offensive. Consequently, fierce battles have unfolded along the entire line from the east coast to the west coast. Especially on the east coast, the enemy made some progress on the 25th, but after Japanese forces counterattacked, especially in the fierce assault northwest of Yonabaru, enemy casualties were even greater. In other areas, such as the central Shuri area, the west coast, and the area in front of Naha, although the enemy launched repeated fierce attacks, the Japanese eastern unit's counterattacks were effective. The enemy's attempts to seize key Japanese positions resulted in only slight advances near Makabi. Some enemy troops infiltrating the area east of Naha City were also repelled to the vicinity of Anri. The enemy, with five divisions – the 96th, 7th, 77th, 1st Marine Division, and 6th Marine Division – using tanks as their vanguard, launched continuous attacks, only to see their losses increase, and the pace of their advance slower than the previous week. As of the 18th, enemy casualties were approximately 52,700, with 565 tanks abandoned or destroyed. Adding in subsequent damages, the land battle alone has already exceeded 60,000. Japanese Special Attack Units and Air Force, responding to the brave fighting of the land units, fiercely attacked enemy ship formations, as well as the northern and central airfields on the main island and the Ie Shima airfield. On the night of the 24th, the Giretsu Airborne Unit forcibly landed at the northern and central airfields on Okinawa Island, seizing enemy aircraft and various airfield facilities on the ground, throwing the enemy's formation into complete chaos, with explosions occurring at over 150 locations. B-29 aircraft from southern bases, to counter Japanese aircraft attacks on Okinawa, have been carrying out tactical bombing of Japanese bases since mid-April. Recently, they have also been carrying out strategic bombing of major cities. After large-scale nighttime bombing of Nagoya on the 14th and 17th, on the nights of the 23rd and 25th, approximately 250 B-29s each time attacked Tokyo, using incendiary bombs. The results of the interceptions on the 23rd and 25th nights totaled 74 aircraft shot down. On the Burma front, because Japanese forces are preparing a strategic posture, and the enemy is also diligently preparing their front, before the rainy season, a situation of stalemate is gradually emerging. Apart from the fierce battles in the plateau area of the Hukawng Valley and nearby battlefields, the situation has not changed much, and the enemy is continuously reinforcing their forces from the rear, their intentions cannot be underestimated.

### Military Commentator Discusses Recent Okinawa Situation: Japan Determined to Fight to the End for Victory

(Central News Agency Report) - A Shanghai military commentator, observing the recent situation on Okinawa Island, notes that the enemy's progress is hindered, and their losses are severe. On the southern Okinawa front, fierce fighting continues along the line from Naha through Shuri to Yonabaru. Since the 24th, the Japanese and U.S. forces have been fiercely fighting along the Asato River. After the enemy secured a bridgehead in the southern part of the area, they repeatedly attempted to advance, but each time they were defeated by the Japanese forces, and they have not yet abandoned their attempts, constantly harassing the area. Recently, the enemy laid bridges again across the Asato River, but the Japanese forces launched fierce attacks against the enemy from the night of the 25th, inflicting heavy damage. Enemy corpses are floating in the river. Although the enemy eventually laid two more bridges across the Asato River, attempting to invade Naha, after the 24th, heavy rains and flooding washed away three of the four bridges that the enemy had laid across the Asato River. In the central Okinawa area, the enemy's 1st Marine Division and the Army's 77th and 96th Divisions are encircling Shuri. The 1st Marine Division and the 96th Division have made some progress, seemingly attempting to invade Shuri. On the eastern front are the enemy's 7th Division and a portion of the 96th Division. The 7th Division's advance is slow, while the 96th Division is planning to encircle Yonabaru. In this operation, the enemy has only advanced two or three nautical miles on average in one month, as clearly indicated by enemy military leaders and in reports.

U.S. Admits to Operational Difficulties

According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 28th, United Press correspondent Warrens, reporting from the Okinawa front, stated that U.S. forces in Okinawa have encountered significant difficulties in operations over the past month, advancing only three miles on the front lines. He also stated, "I had left for only four weeks. When I returned, I saw the roads and airfields reinforced, as well as the U.S. forces. While some optimists had claimed that U.S. forces would soon capture Shuri and advance into Naha, Naha remains uncaptured, and Shuri is still on the periphery. The results of this fierce frontline battle are evident. The Shuri radio station is still under Japanese control. Seven weeks ago, U.S. forces could see the radio station quite clearly, and realistic U.S. soldiers have told reporters that this operation will need until the end of June to be completed. The U.S. generals and soldiers on the front lines deeply recognize the slow progress and the severity of the fighting. At the same time, general army commanders believe that a frontal assault on the Japanese defense forces is tantamount to suicide, at least at the cost of most of the U.S. forces. Therefore, they estimate that the U.S. forces will advance only two and a half nautical miles in one month, and future actions will be quite difficult."

Japanese Forces Inflict Severe Damage on the Enemy

The military commentator stated that, according to the Japanese reporting unit for maritime operations, large Japanese special attack formations have launched three-dimensional attacks on the enemy, and the Giretsu Special Attack Unit has inflicted severe damage on the enemy and destroyed various enemy facilities. According to enemy reports, emergency alerts have been issued for up to eight hours. Based on the above situation, we can infer that the enemy will face numerous difficulties in the future battle of Okinawa Island, especially the long and unsustainable supply lines. We deeply believe that the enemy's possible tactics against the Japanese forces in the future will be strategic bombing. General Doolittle, former commander of the Eighth Air Force, has been reappointed to that position. Doolittle was responsible for the first air raid on Japan in 1942. This man is a specialist in medium-sized bombers, but based on his renowned observations, it will be difficult for him to achieve great things. According to a recent statement by U.S. Foreign Economic Administration Director Crowley, "The Japanese military strength is strong, and its strength is abundant in a long-term war. There are abundant resources in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria, and North China." He also stated that it is currently difficult to "liberate" even 7% of the 3 million square miles of Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, and the Philippines occupied by Japan in 1941. At the same time, Japanese factories have been dispersed for wartime purposes, and the country has always had a large amount of material, and fully developed production." We can see the strength of Japan's combat power. In the future, we should expand our operations to cause the enemy absolute difficulties. Recently, rumors have spread from San Francisco and London that Japan is negotiating peace with Britain and the United States through Soviet mediation. This is absolutely not true. In fact, Britain and the United States have already realized the difficulties of the war and are spreading rumors to cause trouble. The top Japanese leaders have repeatedly stated their determination to fight to the end and achieve a final glorious victory.

Editorial

### Sino-Japanese Cooperation at the Current Stage

Sino-Japanese cooperation, whether during the war or after, whether for the two governments or the people, has long been an established principle, as natural and just as the laws of heaven. Today, it should no longer need to be mentioned, but is a time for practical implementation and fruitful results. However, this does not mean that Sino-Japanese cooperation has been implemented in a satisfactory manner. On the contrary, there are inevitably areas where mutual efforts are incomplete or imperfect. We believe that Sino-Japanese cooperation, in principle and in theory, no longer needs to be discussed. However, in practice, in order to achieve perfection and thoroughness, we should still frankly point out areas for mutual research and improvement. An attitude of "concealing one's illness and refusing treatment" is absolutely unacceptable.

We believe that the Japanese side also feels the same way. In the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, which is becoming increasingly severe, the Japanese government and people have recently expressed great importance to the issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation. For example, the Continental Liaison Conference was held in Tokyo on the 19th and 20th of this month. Foreign Minister and Minister for Greater East Asia Affairs Tōgō, in order to discuss the operation of policies towards China with envoys stationed in China, also held a conference of office directors of embassies in China on the 21st of this month. In his instructions, Tōgō specifically pointed out that "As the situation progresses, the importance of Japan's problems with China is expanding. In addition to assisting China's unification and the completion of its autonomy and independence, Japan seeks equality in the political field and mutual benefit in the economic field, and establishes friendly relations between China and Japan. Japan must overcome all obstacles and realize its fundamental policy, which is closely related to Japan's overcoming of current difficulties." What a clear and frank exposition! On the 28th of this month, the Japan-China Association was established under the leadership of Duke Konoe Fumimaro to strengthen cooperation, promote friendship, and enhance Sino-Japanese cooperation. It is very clear that the motive is to echo what was indicated by Foreign Minister and Minister for Greater East Asia Affairs Tōgō.

From the perspective of the Chinese people, as mentioned above, we should no longer talk about principles and theories. We hope that everyone will be frank and pragmatic, and put the principles and theories of Sino-Japanese cooperation into practice. Today, no one can say that there is still room for hesitation regarding these principles and theories. At the same time, we cannot deny that some people are insincere about these principles and theories, paying lip service and feigning compliance, which has led to unexpected difficulties in the practice of Sino-Japanese cooperation. However, the characteristic of our Eastern nations is not to fear difficulties. The more difficult it is, the more we must strive. We should all have this strong belief in today's Sino-Japanese cooperation issue.

The Chinese people, when discussing Sino-Japanese cooperation at the current stage, believe that the most important thing is to focus on solving the actual problems currently facing the two countries. For China, the most practical and serious problem today is the suffering of the people. Therefore, we believe that to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, the first requirement today is to solve the problem of the suffering of the Chinese people. Only when this problem is solved can we talk about other higher principles and theories. In fact, only by pragmatically solving the suffering of the Chinese people can the true value of Sino-Japanese cooperation be demonstrated. The extremely serious food problem is the best test. Of course, this is a complex and difficult problem, but everyone understands that as long as the responsible authorities on both sides of China and Japan show sincerity and strength, and with mutual restraint and patience, it is possible to solve this serious problem! If this path is opened up, then the entire Sino-Japanese cooperation issue, no matter how gloomy it may seem today, will have hope and certainty of becoming clear!

We have always believed that the practice and completion of Sino-Japanese cooperation should be based on adapting to the national conditions and popular sentiments of both sides and grasping the minds of the people of the two countries. For the Chinese people, the most pressing issue at the current stage is to alleviate the suffering of the Chinese people in a way that is suitable for China's national conditions and popular sentiments. We hope that everyone will show sincerity in Sino-Japanese cooperation through self-restraint, patience, and increased effort.

### Mother of Chen, Madam Wei Passes Away in Nanjing

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Madam Wei, mother of the late Chairman Wang's mother-in-law, Chen Jizu, Chen 　Jun, Chen Shunzhen, and Chen Changzu, passed away in Nanjing at 10:50 PM on the 27th. The encoffining ceremony was held at her residence at No. 39 Yihe Road at 3:00 PM on the 28th. Officials from various National Government agencies also went to offer condolences, with over a thousand people attending from morning to evening. It is reported that Madam Wei assisted Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Nanyang and made many contributions to the revolutionary cause. When the late Chairman Wang advocated for the peace movement, she also deeply supported it, believing that only peace could alleviate the suffering of the people. She was usually in good health and extremely gentle, but she had diabetes. On the 25th of this month, she suddenly felt asthma. After treatment with oxygen therapy, she gradually returned to normal. She was still talking and laughing on the evening of the 27th, but at approximately 10:00 PM, she suddenly felt back pain and weakness.

### Minister of Justice Wu Reports on Work Overview: Reforming Accumulated Abuses and Paying Attention to Prison Hygiene

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Ministry of Justice held a regular meeting with domestic and foreign journalists at 3:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by Minister Wu Songgao himself. He gave the following brief report on the work of the Ministry: When I took office, I immediately ordered the heads of all subordinate courts and offices to strictly investigate their subordinates, and to report any who were derelict in their duties or whose conduct was flawed, so that they could be dealt with accordingly. In addition, I also ordered the responsible divisions and sections to carefully review the civil and criminal cases reported by the various courts and offices. Any personnel found to be negligent in handling cases would be severely punished upon verification. Recently, several cases of negligence in handling cases by judges at all levels have been discovered. The responsible personnel have been given punishments ranging from demerits to dismissal. The National Government promulgated the Amnesty Law this year. After receiving the order, the Ministry immediately transmitted it to all subordinate courts and offices, instructing them to quickly release those prisoners who should be pardoned according to law. Cases that should be commuted must also be completed within two months of receipt of the documents. Many courts and offices that have completed the handling have presented their handling situation and rulings to the Ministry for review. Prison operations and hygiene are extremely important. We have repeatedly issued orders to improve them. The Prison Department Director was sent to inspect prisons in Nanjing, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi last month, and to provide on-site guidance on operations, hygiene, and management. According to the inspection results, the Zhenjiang Prison is the most commendable. In order to improve hygiene in Shanghai prisons and raise medical funds, I personally went to Shanghai. I held a tea party at the Kang Le Restaurant in Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month, inviting enthusiastic donations. The donations will be collected by the end of this month. It is planned to establish a custodial committee locally to be responsible for custody, in order to ensure proper distribution and achieve the practical effect of improving prison hygiene. The provisions on interest rates in the Civil Code's Book on Obligations and the Negotiable Instruments Law are quite unsuitable for the current social and economic situation. Various banking and money lending associations have repeatedly submitted requests for relief. The Ministry has formulated temporary measures on wartime interest rates, which have been presented for approval and implementation.

It is also reported that due to the recent rise in prices, the monthly expenses for prisoner food are insufficient. The Ministry of Justice's Minister Wu went to the Ministry of Finance on the 28th to negotiate an increase in the budget in order to maintain the current situation and ensure that criminals receive reasonable treatment. The matter is currently under negotiation.

### British Labour Party Announces Platform: General Election Competition Worth Watching

Central News Agency - According to sources in Shanghai, the British Labour Party's proposed platform is as follows: Regarding foreign policy, (A) provide full assistance to the Pacific War; (B) maintain the closest cooperation among the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and Chongqing, based on a world organization with the meaning and power to prevent aggression, as a group security guarantee, and absolutely exclude inciting small countries to suppress large countries. Regarding international trade, (A) cooperate with the international economy; (B) eliminate international corporate activities that restrict producers or cause material scarcity for personal gain; (C) protect agricultural interests both domestically and internationally; (D) Britain must use tariffs to maintain priority; (E) strive to promote agreements on international aviation. Regarding the German question, the German nation should be dealt with in a way that prevents it from having the ability to re-engage in war, but its people must be given work to live. As for Indian policy, the affairs of the India Office will be transferred to the Department of Self-Governing Territories, allowing India to expand its powers annually. Regarding domestic policy, (A) revitalize industrial institutions, increase capacity, strengthen production, and expand state management; (B) coal, electricity, transportation, and steel will be nationalized, and other industries and investments will be managed by the state. From this, it can be seen that the British Labour Party's general attitude towards the Conservative Party is that it mishandled wartime measures and is subject to criticism.

Central News Agency - Britain will hold a general election soon. The Labour Party has considerable power. The conference held on the 25th closed under extremely strained circumstances. Therefore, the upcoming British election is particularly noteworthy.

### A Humble Opinion on the Development of West Dongting Mountain

— Pan Jueming

On the 12th of this month, leading figures from Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors organized a Jiangsu Province Visiting Delegation to inspect Jiangsu. I was ordered by Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau to follow them and humbly participate in the tour. The purpose and gains of this trip have been recorded in various newspapers, such as the "Record of the Shanghai Representatives Visiting Team in Jiangsu Province" in the 17th issue of Shen Bao and the "Journey to West Mountain" in the 18th issue of Xinwen Bao, both of which are extremely detailed. I do not wish to elaborate on the geographical environment and social conditions of West Mountain. I would like to offer some humble suggestions on issues such as dispersing the population, improving production, and building schools, for the reference of those concerned about the development of West Mountain.

Dispersing the Population

I believe that the prerequisite for dispersing the population is convenient transportation and guaranteed public security. Otherwise, people will regard it as a daunting task and hesitate to move forward, and the dispersal work will inevitably fail to achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, to talk about dispersal, one must first solve the transportation difficulties and ensure the security of West Mountain. The housing problem is secondary.

Transportation Regarding transportation, it can be divided into two aspects: one is the transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou, and the other is the transportation between Suzhou and West Mountain.

Regarding transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou, although there are railways and highways for land transportation and waterways along the Suzhou River, due to various difficulties, transportation is not smooth and cannot meet the needs of dispersal. Currently, the construction authorities of Shanghai and Suzhou have already invited bids to build a new highway between Shanghai and Suzhou, which can start construction this month and is expected to be completed in late July. This highway runs parallel to the railway, with a total length of eighty kilometers, and cars can travel for about two hours. If this road is completed, it will greatly facilitate transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou. However, the purchase of transportation vehicles and the management of road administration require the construction authorities of Shanghai and Suzhou to plan ahead and make proper arrangements so that the road becomes the blood vessel of transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou and the major artery for dispersing the population. As for the railway, it is hoped that the China Railway Authority can effectively improve road administration and facilitate travel. If transportation between Shanghai and Suzhou is smooth, the problem of dispersing the population can also be easily solved.

Although there is a ferry between Suzhou and West Mountain, the ships are small and the number of trips is limited, which is insufficient to meet the needs of transportation if the population dispersal is implemented. Moreover, the Taihu Lake surface is vast and the depth is quite shallow. In addition, the ports are silted up, and ships with slightly heavier loads are prone to grounding. Therefore, to disperse the population in large quantities, it is necessary to dredge the ports, build docks, and manufacture ships (flat-bottomed and wide-faced ships) to facilitate navigation. This project cannot be completed overnight and relies on the joint efforts of government authorities, local leaders, officials, and merchants to succeed.

Public Security West Mountain stands in the middle of Taihu Lake and, together with East Dongting Mountain, has always been an area where bandits roam. Although it appears peaceful on the surface, the police force is weak, and the self-defense capabilities of the people have not yet been established. In addition, it is surrounded by water, and if something happens, it will be isolated and helpless, inevitably leading to a helpless situation. If the dispersal of the population is implemented, the security of West Mountain should be ensured first. There are three ways to do this:

First, dispatch troops to West Mountain. West Mountain covers an area of ninety li and has two towns and eight townships. If the government can send hundreds of soldiers and police officers, equipped adequately, to be responsible for the security of West Mountain, then public security can be guaranteed.

Second, train civilian police. West Mountain currently has a total of 11,400 able-bodied men between the ages of 20 and 30, and farmers account for 65% of the total population. If strict training can be carried out in the spare time of farming, and 500 people can be carefully selected from among them to serve as civilian police to assist, then in the event of an emergency, they can defend against the enemy together with the military police. Combining farming and defense is easy.

Third, strengthen the Baojia system. Although West Mountain has a Baojia organization, it is still very immature. If it can be given strict training, practical guidance, and implement the "greeting and sitting" method to help each other, then [criminals] will have nowhere to live, which will definitely benefit public security.

Housing Regarding the dispersal of the population, in addition to the two major issues of transportation and public security, the next important issue is housing. The buildings in West Mountain are very solid, and there are many high-rise buildings. All the vacant houses and public properties in the area should be ordered by Director Jin of the district to be investigated and reported by the township heads by the end of this month. If the dispersal of the population is implemented, it goes without saying that the housing in West Mountain will not be enough. However, if leading figures in the industrial and commercial sectors are willing to invest in the development of West Mountain and raise funds to assist in the dispersal, it will not be difficult to build simple housing on the spot. Because local labor costs are low and building materials are abundant (local green-gray stone and granite, with many lime kilns and brick and tile kilns), the costs of labor and materials are not a problem, and building houses should be feasible.

The day before yesterday night, a contact lasting thirty minutes suddenly occurred, resulting in 37 of them being killed and 28 being captured.

### University Students and Special Attack Units in Japan

Dialogue: Lieutenant Commander Matsumoto, Fleet Reporting Department; Reporter, this newspaper

Matsumoto: Professor Tetsuro Watsuji of Tokyo Imperial University had a famous book called "Fudo" (Climate and Culture). Our lives are all born in Japan and grow up in Japan. The climate and culture of Japan are the womb of our lives and the spiritual homeland. The Japanese archipelago is surrounded by the turbulent sea, and the interior of Japan is covered with beautiful mountains and rivers, and the seasons have strong typhoons. The particularity of the climate and culture of Japan is also the reason for the strong character of Japanese youth.

Reporter: Climate and culture are indeed closely related to ethnology. The life force of a nation that is often subjected to periodic storms or earthquakes must be strong, and its will to resist must be firm. On the one hand, the Japanese people have very delicate feelings because of the beautiful mountains and rivers, which are expressed in haiku and short poems. On the other hand, because of seasonal climate changes or geological reasons, they also have very strong feelings, which are often expressed in generous, passionate, and moving practical actions. Special attack unit members are willing to die calmly, and many poems from the time of their sacrifice have been left behind. It can probably be said that the Japanese climate and culture are manifested in the national character.

Matsumoto: Japan and China belong to the same "monsoon" type of climate and culture in terms of climate and culture. The scorching heat and humidity are naturally intertwined, so the national character is also rich in the spirit of perseverance and hard work. Although Japan has a strong sudden character due to typhoons and other factors, it also has a firm and indomitable strength because of the "monsoon" type of climate and culture.

The Decline of Western Civilization

Matsumoto: Oswald Spengler has a book called "The Decline of the West," which is very famous. Although Western material civilization and capitalist culture did not decline during the First World War, they will definitely collapse after this war. We can confirm that light comes from the East. The center of the world's new culture will shift to China and Japan. China and Japan should establish their own ideological systems, and then build a new civilization in Asia through a new union between China and Japan.

Reporter: Western civilization is mostly biased towards materialism, so they have developed a habit of relying on material strength. Of course, we cannot only focus on the spiritual aspect. We should integrate materialism and idealism into a natural whole, and then both material and spiritual strength can be fully utilized. Today's special attack units in Japan are the combination of people and aircraft. The spirit of the special attack is the expression of "mind and matter as one." This is something that Western youth cannot do, and it is also a characteristic of Japanese youth. The true spirit of Eastern culture is expressed in the highest form of practical action.

The Common Destiny of Asia

Matsumoto: There are various elements in the union of nations, such as blood ties, language, religion, etc. However, there is also an important element, which is a common destiny. Two nations will naturally develop a common consciousness under the pressure of the same enemy. Now, China and Japan naturally and spontaneously feel a sense of shared destiny. Therefore, the youth of China and Japan should understand each other and cooperate. Japanese youth are now working hard to defend East Asia with the spirit of special attack. I hope that the Chinese youth can understand our spirit of special attack and strive for their own motherland and for East Asia.

Reporter: Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Without Japan, there would be no China; without China, there would be no Japan." This famous motto indicates the destiny of China and Japan. The two countries can only jointly plan the development of Asia in a situation of affirmation and affirmation. In a situation of negation and negation, it is impossible to find a common future. I believe that the youth of China and Japan can gradually recognize the profound meaning of this motto. Since Japanese youth have expressed the spirit of special attack, Chinese youth cannot but express the so-called "righteous spirit of heaven and earth" and work hard for China and for East Asia. When we think of Wen Tianxiang's Song of Righteousness and Fujita Toko's Song of Righteousness, we feel that the spiritual distance between us seems very close because of the lessons of the ancient sages.

The Achievements of the Japanese Special Attack Units

Reporter: Four years ago, during the Japanese naval battle, Admiral Togo's tactics could also be said to be an expression of a special attack spirit of assault. The Baltic Fleet of Imperial Russia was wiped out under the artillery fire commanded by Admiral Togo. Although the tactics of today's special attack units are different from the tactics of forty years ago, they are indeed consistent in spirit.

Matsumoto: We destroy the enemy with our spirit of transcending life and death, and our firm belief. This is the spirit of Admiral Togo, and it is also the spirit of the inherent Bushido of Japan. The bodies of Japanese youth are filled with the loyal souls left by their fathers and ancestors. When the enemy attacks, they are determined to make the enemy bleed more. The decisive battle on Okinawa Island sank more than 500 enemy ships, and the Tenth Army in the land battle was almost completely destroyed. Furthermore, on the night of the 24th, our special attack unit, the Yirei Airborne Unit, landed on the enemy's North and Central airports, which served as replacements for aircraft carriers, causing great confusion in the enemy's rear. Now the enemy is trying to achieve balance with our spiritual power with material quantity. However, material quantity is limited no matter what, and our spirit is unlimited. If we work hard again, we can break through their material power in one fell swoop.

Reporter: We are pleased to meet the 40th Japanese Navy Day. Recalling the glorious victory of the Japanese naval battle forty years ago, we look forward to the full display of the special attack spirit of Japanese youth and the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Matsudaira: Japan will absolutely be able to achieve victory. The Japanese nation has a traditional spirit of 2,600 years, and Japanese youth have abundant life force. The advantage of the enemy America is scientific analysis, and the spirit of our special attack units transcends scientific analysis. This is the driving force behind our victory, and it is also the concrete manifestation of the Japanese Navy soul today. (The End)

### Third Issue of Gold Certificates to Be Issued Early Next Month: Listed Price Will Not Be Easily Increased

After the first issue of gold certificates of the Central Reserve Bank was issued from the 7th to the 9th of this month, all the gold reserves were immediately handed over to the Gold Certificate Issuance Preparation Committee and stored in the vault. It was decided to start payment on June 7th, a total of 1,500 certificates, to be paid out within 100 days. The gold reserves for the second issue of gold certificates have also been handed over to the Issuance Preparation Committee and will soon be checked and stored in the vault by the monthly inspection committee. As for the third issue of gold certificates, it will be processed in early June. Procedures are currently being expedited. It is heard that the listed value will be similar to the second issue. Reporters have learned from market sources that the recent surge in the black market is entirely due to speculative merchants using loose funds to spread unfounded rumors and incite people, in order to manipulate market prices and attempt to reap temporary profits. The Central Reserve Bank's intention in issuing gold certificates is to stabilize finance, contract currency, and curb inflation. It will definitely not easily increase the listed price according to the illegal market conditions. It is expected that the listing price of the third issue of gold certificates will not change significantly.

### Second Issuance Inspection Report

The Central Reserve Bank issued the second issue of gold certificates for three days from May 21st to 23rd. The gold reserves have been transferred by the bank last week to the designated vault of the Management Committee, where they were received and kept by the committee's storage team. The committee then conducted an inspection of all the reserves in accordance with the detailed rules and announced the results of the inspection as follows:

"Second Inspection Report of the Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee: In accordance with Articles 11 and 12 of the Committee's Rules of Procedure, this Committee conducted a second inspection of the Gold Certificate Issuance Reserves on May 24th, 1945, at the vault designated by the Committee in Shanghai. The inspection results are listed on the left:

Total Amount of Gold Certificates Issued by the Central Reserve Bank as of May 23rd, 1945: 30,602 taels.

Total Amount of Gold Reserves in the Committee's Vault: 3,100 bars, totaling 31,002 taels, 2 mace, 7 fen, and 5 li.

The above-mentioned total amount of issuance and the total amount of reserves were found to be consistent by the Monthly Committee of the Inspection Team of this Committee. This is hereby announced. Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee, Ye Fuxiao, Zhu Yunqing."

### Measures for Interest Payment on Gao Mansion Relief Bonds Determined

The Municipal Government, after considering the situation, has decided on the interest payment method, namely: Those who paid in April will be paid interest for three months.

It is understood that in the previous year, the deed tax in each county was only between 2.4 and 2.5 million yuan, and in the urban area, it was only over 9 million yuan. However, it is estimated that this year, each county can collect over 45 million yuan, and the urban area can collect over 30 million yuan.

### City Government Approves Increased Rickshaw Rental Fees

The Bureau forwarded this request to the City Government. The City Government then convened relevant parties for consultations. Now, approval has been granted to increase the original rental price of 950 yuan by 80%, making the daily rental fee 1,700 yuan per rickshaw. Regarding speculative merchants hoarding rickshaw tires for profit, the City Government has ordered the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs to conduct a city-wide registration of rickshaw tire inventory.

### New Price Limits for Major Commodities Awaiting Study and Finalization; Price Evaluation Committee Met Yesterday

Subsequently, they convened a meeting of specialized committee members and evaluators at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 28th) to discuss the matter. Because the actual cost calculation and market conditions of several major commodities still require study and finalization, the approval of new price limits is pending a decision at the next meeting before being announced and implemented. It is reported that the prices charged by various businesses are currently without any standard, and citizens hope that the Price Evaluation Committee will quickly approve fair price limits.

### Views on Developing Dongting Xishan (Continued from First Page): Improving Production

The significance of this population dispersal is by no means a passive act of refuge, but a transfer of Shanghai's surplus manpower for active development and construction. In this sense, those dispersed must each shoulder the responsibility of developing Xishan and increasing production. Since Xishan's food supply is not yet self-sufficient, improving production is a pressing priority.

### Reclaiming Wasteland

Xishan covers an area of 90 "li" (approximately 45 kilometers), but only 8,985 "mu" (approximately 599 hectares) are cultivated. Vacant land, mountainous land, and marshland together total 65,518 "mu" (approximately 4,368 hectares). If scientific methods are used to reclaim and cultivate this land, planting rice, wheat, and supplementary foods such as potatoes, the projected yield can be increased tenfold compared to today.

### Improving Production Technology

The backwardness of rural living technology is common throughout China. If production technology cannot be improved, increasing production will be like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree. Although Xishan is near Shanghai, it still retains the characteristics of ancient Chinese rural society. Cultivation relies solely on human labor. If simple machinery and animal power can be used, and fertilizer is applied, the production rate will definitely increase. As for fruit trees, if the varieties can be improved and pests prevented, the yield can also be greatly increased. If silkworms and tea leaves can be cultivated and raised using scientific methods, the yield will be significant. As for coal mines, if modern methods are used for excavation, a large amount of production can be obtained with a small amount of labor. In this way, even if Xishan's food supply is insufficient, it can exchange the output of fruits, silkworms, tea leaves, and coal for the food it needs.

### Establishing Schools

Xishan has a beautiful environment, with clear mountains and waters, isolated from the bustling city, making it an ideal educational environment. Xishan currently has two district-run complete elementary schools, eight township elementary schools, and two private schools, with a total of over 1,500 students, which can accommodate the local school-age children. However, once population dispersal is announced, establishing schools will be necessary. One issue is the education of school-age children who are dispersed with their parents. The second issue is dispersing a portion of Shanghai's secondary schools and even colleges to establish joint secondary schools or universities. However, to adapt to the local situation and meet actual needs, in addition to establishing ordinary schools, I believe that establishing vocational schools and short-term vocational training schools is essential. Let's discuss them separately:

### Establishing Ordinary Schools

The education problem is an important issue that must be solved simultaneously with the dispersal problem. The country cannot be without education for a day. Therefore, the government should solve the education problem for the children of those being dispersed. One solution is for the government to open primary and secondary schools locally to accommodate school-age children. Another solution is to plan ahead and, in preparation for any eventuality, have the government initiate the dispersal of a portion of municipal secondary school students and library equipment to start classes (because elementary school students must move with their parents, it is better to start with dispersing secondary schools first). At the same time, the government should encourage and assist private schools to implement dispersal, and if necessary, enforce it.

### Establishing Vocational Schools

In this time of frequent wars and material shortages, when increasing production is paramount, the government has clearly ordered the promotion of vocational education. To develop Xishan's resources and train production personnel, establishing vocational schools in Xishan is particularly necessary. Vocational schools can be divided into two types: One is to train basic production personnel by establishing junior and senior vocational schools, with departments such as group art, animal husbandry (including poultry), and silk production. The other is to train talent for developing Xishan and improving production. Vocational training schools can be established to recruit adult men and women and teach them various life and aesthetic skills so that they can take on the task of increasing production. The results are easily seen, and the benefits will be significant. This can be asserted with certainty.
