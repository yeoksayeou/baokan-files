### Enemy Warships Around Okinawa Island: Japanese Air Force Achieves Success Attacking; US Aircraft Carrier Hit, Over Six Hundred Killed or Wounded

Ryukyu Islands Base, 28th (Central News Agency) – On the 27th, Japanese air force units again launched several attacks on enemy warships around Okinawa. The results of attacks on the 25th and 26th have been confirmed, destroying one enemy warship of an unknown type.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – The US Navy Department announced on the 27th that the US aircraft carrier USS Cabot was attacked by Japanese special forces on Okinawa Island on May 2nd, taking a hit and catching fire. The crew suffered 373 deaths, 264 injuries, and 19 missing.

Zurich, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Swiss newspaper "Zurich Daily News" published an editorial on the 24th titled "The Greater East Asia War," discussing the difficulties the United Nations will face in future operations against Japan, as follows: The Japanese special attack units, with their courageous spirit of sacrifice, launched suicide torpedo attacks on enemy warships. This spirit is a consistent tradition of Japan, a manifestation of their war will. The United Nations is deeply aware of the difficulty in launching an offensive against such a vigorously spirited Japanese army. If we shift our gaze to the Chinese mainland, we can see that although the United Nations has reopened the Burma Road, supplying the Allied forces in China, China's weapons and materials are still extremely insufficient. Furthermore, if the Allied forces wish to land on the Chinese mainland, they must first eliminate the threats posed by the Japanese air force and submarine fleet. Therefore, to suppress Japan, it is necessary to launch operations on the Chinese mainland. Even if we assume that the Allied forces are successful in landing operations, the vastness of the operational area may mean that even if their main force comes into contact with the Japanese army, the war will turn into a protracted one. To avoid a protracted war, the Allied forces will also do everything possible to make a desperate gamble and launch landing operations on the Japanese mainland, hoping to subdue Japan as soon as possible. However, launching landing operations on the Japanese mainland will inevitably be met with fierce resistance from the Japanese army, making it even more difficult than launching landing operations in China.

### Rain Throughout Burma; Only Vanguard Contact; Japanese Commando Teams Prevent British Army from Advancing East

Dianqian, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army stationed in Burma has completed the reorganization of its battle lines and the replacement of troops. They are resisting the British-Indian army launching an eastward advance in Xidan, and are currently engaged in fierce battles. At the same time, on the Southern Shan State Plateau, the Kalatongdong Triangle area, and the Begu Mountains, they are using strong fortifications to prevent the enemy's attempts to invade. Due to the rain and mud throughout the Burmese front, the mobility of both sides is greatly hindered, so there are no large-scale engagements on any front, only contact between small vanguard units. In the southern Shan State Plateau, which is covered by jungle, the enemy is gradually advancing east. Japanese elite troops are using commando teams to constantly attack the enemy's superior forces every day. These commando teams, with their whirlwind-like momentum, launch rapid and surprise attacks on enemy positions, preventing the enemy's attempts to advance. Furthermore, in the valley area southeast and northeast of the Zailawadi Delta, there are also Japanese fortifications, which have caused heavy casualties to the enemy for days. The enemy has acknowledged these sacrifices in their announcements. According to information from New Delhi, the Irrawaddy front is difficult to attack due to the tide-like firepower of the Japanese army. On the Southern Shan State Plateau, the Japanese army has deployed artillery positions everywhere, and it is reported that they have stopped the British army in the mountains of Donggomaqi. A special correspondent for the Indian United Press broadcast: The Japanese army now seems to be deploying strong fortifications on the east bank of the Xidan River, reorganizing its troops, and its equipment is mainly composed of excellent and powerful artillery.

Editorial

### After Reading Mr. Yoshida's "Leisurely Talk on the Veranda"

Mr. Yoshida Dongyou returned from Japan and his first article to meet us "Leisurely Talk on the Veranda" very accurately answered the questions we need to understand now. In addition to agreeing with his observations on the current problems in China in general, we feel that there are still some points to add, and we state them as follows:

Regarding the current major problems in China, namely: Will the US military land in China? Will the Soviet Union participate in the Pacific War? The Soviet Union's attitude towards the Chongqing Communists, Is a compromise possible between Japan and Chongqing? Is a compromise possible between Japan and the United States? Chongqing in the eyes of the Chinese Communist Party, The significance of the reorganization of the Chongqing government, Jiang Jieshi's position. We Chinese people have quite a good understanding of these problems, and the relevant parties in the Allied countries may also have their own unique insights. After Mr. Yoshida's interpretation, it seems that we have gained a further understanding and understanding. This is our first impression after carefully reading his article. If we want to study the current problems in China or further solve the current problems in China, such as unified national salvation and the political discussions that have recently appeared in some publications in Nanjing and Shanghai, we believe that the ability to understand the problem from multiple perspectives and deeply, like Mr. Yoshida in this article, should be a necessary condition.

The questions he answered can be summarized into two: First, the relationship between the international powers and China and East Asia, and second, the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party.

In terms of international relations, regarding the enemy's future movements, he clearly put forward three points: "If the United States launches large-scale operations in Japan and China at the same time, it is something that neither manpower nor transportation can allow." "No matter how great the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are, their outbreak will have to wait until the end of the anti-Japanese war." "The Pacific War has reached the final decisive stage today, and Japan will never conclude a compromise with Britain and the United States." These conclusions are generally correct. In particular, the second and third points can correct the illusions of some people, mistakenly believing that the British and American teams will conflict, and that Japan and the United States may compromise, forgetting their solemn stance of participating in the war for the East Asia of the East Asians. This is a very timely iron correction. However, it seems that the first point, whether the United States will never launch landing operations on the Chinese mainland, is still difficult to say. We must not be negligent in the slightest with regard to all the activities of the enemy! As for Mr. Yoshida's explanation of the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Pacific War, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chongqing, it is very accurate and there is no need for us to add any more words.

Regarding the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party, Mr. Yoshida very objectively analyzed the class, economic, and international relations characteristics of the Communist Party, pointing out that although the Soviet Union will not turn China into a second Spain and will try to avoid this happening, the Communist Party will inevitably adhere to the anti-Chongqing struggle, and Chongqing, in order to unify China and realize an independent and strong force between the Soviet Union and the United States, will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to become another country within the country. This is an inevitable trend. Here, with regard to the struggle between Chongqing and the Communist Party, in addition to producing heartache for the country and the nation, we can only step up the promotion of innovative politics and improved people's livelihood movements in the peaceful areas in order to promote true independence.

In terms of the current overall situation, we do not allow Britain and the United States to move on the Chinese mainland, nor do we allow Chongqing and the Communist Party to poison our people for private disputes. The only way out is to gather the public opinion of the people of the whole country, create a force, seek internal unity and national salvation, and cooperate with the Allied countries externally. We believe that only when the Chinese problem is completely resolved can the East Asian war be completed; conversely, the solution to the Chinese problem is also inseparable from the victory of the East Asian war. Therefore, we hope that both the Chinese and Japanese governments and peoples will work more closely together, overcome difficulties, and move forward!

### Japan's Special Attack Tactics Achieve Significant Results: Military Commentators Analyze the Battle of Okinawa

A military commentator in Shanghai recently reviewed the Battle of Okinawa before and after, stating that the land battle on Okinawa Island has come to an end, but the Japanese air force and special attack units are still continuing to fiercely attack the enemy fleet around Okinawa, so the naval battle is still in progress. The land battle has ended as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters. After eighty days of fighting, the Japanese army fought bravely and skillfully with fewer troops against the enemy's superior forces. It is unfortunate that the island was captured by the enemy. From the perspective of the Japanese strategic aspect, the Okinawa operation has achieved considerable results. The past battles on the island also give us some lessons for future operations, which can be used as a mirror. The following is a brief description:

Lessons Learned from the Okinawa Operation

The enemy's operations are scientific, and the first characteristic is the power of its supply fleet. The supply distance is inversely proportional to the combat power. The US military's attack on Okinawa is a very long distance, and there should be problems strategically, but in order to overcome this difficulty, the US military dispatched the Tenth and Sixth Supply Fleets, which constantly transported supplies.

The second phenomenon is the strengthening of repair capabilities. The US military has built large docks for repairing naval vessels on the Pacific coast, and also uses floating docks to dispatch to the closest point on the front line to repair damaged ships quickly. More than 600 US ships have been sunk or damaged. Usually, 80% of the ships should have suffered damage, but the fact that they were still able to complete their operational tasks must be attributed to the strength of the supply power.

The third is the high degree of mechanization of the engineer and construction units. Regardless of the size of the landing area, the US military's engineers quickly built fortifications after landing, allowing the air force and artillery to be used, thus gaining all the conveniences and air superiority in operations. In addition, the large number of high-performance mechanized units stationed in the fortifications is also one of its characteristics. Its amphibious tanks were used extensively after landing. Flame-throwing tanks and "rocket" artillery are also deployed on the front line. This kind of use of chemistry and quantity is what the Americans boast about the most. We cannot underestimate it; however, how to use it still depends on manpower, so the exertion of its power also has a certain limit, just like the supply fleet, its ability is also limited.

The Enemy Encounters Difficulties in the Mainland Operation

The troop strength used for Okinawa was seven divisions on land, about 100,000 people, 1,400 ships at sea, and about 420,000 personnel, with a total of more than 2,300 ships used. Steirnil once said: If fighting on the Japanese mainland, at least 500,000 troops are required. It can be seen that the supply ships required will exceed 10,000. American military commentator Xie Li said: The US landing operation on the Japanese mainland, even if the largest supply fleet is used, is not enough. It can be seen that the difficulties in fighting on the Japanese mainland are very heavy. Moreover, Japan has a large number of troops on the Chinese mainland, so the beach landing operation on the Chinese mainland is even more difficult. The need for repair capabilities during operations is unlimited and beyond human comparison. Japan's annihilation tactics will definitely be expanded in the future, so the enemy's repair capabilities will inevitably become a major problem. Also, we cannot underestimate the mechanized units mentioned in the third and fourth points above, but we cannot overestimate them either.

The Enemy Has Difficulty Understanding Special Attack Tactics Regarding the lessons of the struggle between Japanese blood and life, what we can say is that the attacks by the special attack units have achieved great strategic results. The essence of the special attack is a guaranteed death and accurate attack. The destruction of one enemy warship with one aircraft has caused the British and American ships to be reduced by more than 600 ships, with personnel losses of more than 300,000. An enemy war correspondent said that the special attack tactics are tactics that the enemy cannot understand, and at the same time criticized the incompetence of the US military's operational command. An enemy military commentator said that under these special attack tactics, its losses at sea have exceeded its losses on land, so the Japanese special attack tactics have caused great threats to the enemy. Japan uses one aircraft to destroy one enemy ship and one person to kill hundreds of people. With Japan's abundant human resources, if this kind of tactic continues, it can cause major losses to the enemy's material and scientific forces, preventing them from exerting their effectiveness.

Facts Prove Who Will Win

The second is the strength of the Japanese fortifications. The cave fortifications created by the Japanese army in the mountainous areas are extremely effective in resisting the enemy's mechanized units. These fortifications in Makiminato and Kadena have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. In this area, fighting with the enemy has lasted for weeks, and both sides are often in a stalemate. As a result, the enemy had to move heavy artillery from the north to fight, and often entire divisions were wiped out. Also, two divisions of Marines were moved from the north to replenish losses. By the second half of the operation, Okinawa's control of the sea and air was unfortunately seized by the enemy, and it was impossible to replenish supplies, so as a result, Okinawa was captured by the enemy. If the enemy attacks the Japanese mainland, there will be mountains on land and an endless supply of reinforcements, which will surely make it difficult for the enemy to move an inch. The great decisive battle with Okinawa as the outpost is about to come. Britain and the United States will hold their quantity and science, and Japan will resist with its special qualities and geographical advantages. The quantity and quality of Britain and the United States have certain limits, while Japan does not. The struggle between the two, whose victory will belong to, will be proven by facts in the future. Looking at the above points, Japan will undoubtedly win.

### Jiangsu Province Decides to Implement Flour and Grain Rationing

Suzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) – Governor Ren is extremely concerned about the food problem.

It is reported that there are many small flour mills in the province. In the past, due to the lack of proper management, the prices of raw materials purchased by each factory and the sale of flour were not statistically recorded. Now, a temporary method for managing small flour mills in the province has been formulated and implemented. In the future, the government will provide assistance and convenience in purchasing raw materials, which will reduce costs, increase production, and stabilize the food problem.

### 34th Division Clears Bandits

Hangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) – The 34th Division of the Army, in view of the bandits' disturbances and the people's suffering, has launched a campaign to suppress the bandits since the 14th. The enemy has repeatedly retreated. After our army occupied Linghu Xiaang and other places, it continued to advance and engaged in fierce battles with the enemy for days. Thanks to the bravery of our soldiers, the enemy suffered great losses. The bandits and puppets who occupy the key points are still rampant. In order to achieve the purpose of clearing them out, the division launched a struggle and advanced rapidly, successively capturing Qianjinshi Tomb, Nanshang Village, Lingshan and other important strongholds. The bandits and puppets, after this setback, fled in panic. The division is currently in pursuit. In addition, the waterway line from Huzhou to Luoshe has been navigated by ships due to the suppression of bandits and puppets by the division, and it will soon be able to directly reach Hangzhou.

### Bose's Overnight Broadcast: Criticizing British Policy, Urging Indians to Seize Independence

Central News Agency, Syonan, 28th – The Indian Provisional Government of Free India, recently due to the drastic changes in the Burma war situation, was forced to discuss relocation to the rear. The British attitude towards India, also due to the end of the European war, is actively attempting to win over India with favorable conditions. As a result, the future of the Provisional Government's independence movement is encountering a major obstacle. The "Wavell Plan," the new policy towards India recently proposed by Britain, is essentially the same as the Cripps Proposal of three years ago, which only granted autonomy in form without actual independence. These are all hypocritical policies. However, some key figures in India, based on objective circumstances, hope to accept this new proposal. Therefore, the current issue is no longer just the Provisional Government, but also all major issues affecting the domestic and foreign independence struggle of India, and its future, will also encounter significant changes. The Provisional Government is now gathering the combined strength of military officers and civilians to overcome the difficulties of the current situation in order to liberate the motherland. Its supreme leader, Bose, since the 19th of this month, has personally broadcast overnight via wireless radio in North Indian, Bengali, and English, vehemently criticizing British policy towards India, and loudly appealing to remind comrades in India to actively launch a political offensive. The main points of his broadcast to India are roughly as follows: We must consider the motive of the Wavell Plan, its purpose being to deceive Indians and use Indian blood and sweat to complete Britain's war of aggression in East Asia. We must pay attention to the deceptive nature of the proposal. The phrase "future independence" in the proposal has not resulted in the recognition of the proposal. The only thing the Congress Party has gained is membership in the Executive Council. Furthermore, the power to appoint members of the Council and the right to reject decisions are still held by the Governor-General of India. The new proposal calls for Indians to hold internal affairs portfolios, but the Commander-in-Chief will still be a Briton, and British war demands will exploit Indians through various means. To complete the war against Japan, Britain has no choice but to encompass Indian resources. However, to extract from India, which has already suffered enormous sacrifices, it is necessary to win over the National Congress Party to ensure its full cooperation with Britain. The greatest emphasis of the Wavell Plan lies in this. The new proposal has stated that equal treatment will be given to the two Indian parties in the Executive Council, maintaining a certain number of seats, while other seats can be freely directed by the Governor-General, so the Governor-General can freely win over any party. If the current proposal is recognized, it means that the powerful Congress Party itself is abandoning the glory of representing India's own independence movement and degrading itself to the status of a small party. I dare to ask a question to the compatriots who support the recognition of the proposal: "Where will our goal of complete independence go? What will be the result of the decision of 1942 that Britain immediately withdraw?" We must warn against pessimists and defeatists. We must carefully consider the value of the blood and sweat sacrifices of our compatriots. The Free India National Army must "persist in fighting to the last man and the last moment." I hope that the people of the whole country, regardless of the outcome of the overall war situation, must step up the struggle for the independence of all of India.

### Soviet Union Makes Two Demands on Turkey: Big Three Conference to Discuss

Central News Agency, Zurich, 28th – A Swiss newspaper reported on the 27th, according to a dispatch from Ankara, that after the Soviet government abandoned the Soviet-Turkish treaty, it had proposed the following two conditions when concluding a new treaty: The Soviet Union monitors the Dardanelles Strait. Modify the Soviet-Turkish border. The Soviet government has communicated these two cases to the Turkish ambassador in Moscow and the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the form of a memorandum. Regarding the Dardanelles Strait monitoring issue, because of its great relationship with Britain and the United States, Turkey must consult with the governments of the United States and Britain before it can respond. Such conditions may be unacceptable to Turkey. Furthermore, the Soviet government previously requested that Turkey transfer the two places of Kars and Ardahan in eastern Turkey to the Soviet Union. This will also be unacceptable to Turkey. Therefore, with the Soviet Union's request as an opportunity, Soviet-Turkish relations will tend to deteriorate.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 28th – According to Reuters correspondent Kish, the Soviet Union has made a request to Turkey to discuss the issue of revising the management of the Dardanelles Strait as stipulated in the Montreux Convention. However, this issue may also be discussed in detail at the Big Three conference. Because this issue includes many other important and complex situations, the British government, as a signatory to the strait's regulations, has not received any notification from the Soviet Union to Turkey requesting a re-discussion, causing outsiders to have suspicions. However, according to speculation in London diplomatic circles, the Soviet Union's proposal to Turkey this time is no different from the situation when the Soviet Union concluded an agreement with Romania on the mouths of the Danube River. Therefore, it is clear that the Soviet Union's suggestion is to abolish the current Soviet-Turkish agreement on jointly managing the Strait, and wants to station Soviet troops in areas related to Soviet interests. However, it is now generally believed that in the upcoming Berlin Big Three Conference, not only will the Dardanelles Strait issue be discussed, but also the management of the Dodecanese and Aegean islands will be brought up for discussion.

### Stalin Promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 28th – According to news received here from Moscow, Soviet Chairman Stalin has been ordered by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to be promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union.

### Mayor Zhou Orders Police Bureau to Investigate Discounting Offenders: All Economic Police Mobilized for Secret Investigation

Regarding the issue of discounting allocation slips, all sectors are quite concerned, and all hope that the authorities will strictly crack down on it and take appropriate measures to solve it thoroughly. However, some illegal merchants still defy laws and regulations, secretly engaging in illegal discounting transactions, so that the discounting trend has not only failed to subside, but in the past two days, the discounting rate has even risen to a huge sum of 28 cents per yuan, threatening people's livelihoods and having a significant impact. It is learned that Mayor Zhou has made the greatest determination to resolutely deal with these illegal merchants. He has instructed the Economic Security Section of the Municipal Police Bureau to actively crack down on it.

This Year's Household Ration Flour Will Be Maintained Monthly: Interview with the Person in Charge of the Flour Control Association

In today's severe food problem, although the government authorities have issued emergency rice and grain measures, and the situation has improved slightly, it is still three or four months away from the new rice harvest. During this so-called lean season when rice and grain are fundamentally lacking, the people's food can only be supplemented by flour and coarse grains. To this end, the reporter visited Mr. Inoue, Deputy Director of the Flour and Wheat Control Association, but he was away on business, so Secretary-General Wang Xiaoshui met with him. The reporter asked questions, and he replied as follows: (Q) It is heard that the wheat harvest is very good this year. I don't know if your association has started purchasing it? (A) The wheat harvest is indeed very abundant this year, but the purchase plan for the end of the year is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan before it can be implemented. It is estimated that about 350,000 tons can be collected. (Q) Last year's flour results were very satisfactory? (A) Last year's wheat flour production situation, due to the stimulation of wheat prices by other commodity prices, continued to rise, coupled with transportation difficulties and power restrictions, the flour production volume ultimately failed to meet expectations, so we do not hesitate to say that we do not consider the results of last year to be satisfactory. (Q) Now that the rice and grain have reached the lean season, the public hopes that flour and coarse grains will be supplemented. Can your association increase household ration flour? (A) Our association has always done its best to provide for the people's food needs. This year's household ration flour will still be maintained monthly, with at least one allocation, and will never be interrupted. In the future, we will continue to maintain it to avoid interruption. As for increasing the amount of allocated flour, we will still try our best to comfort the people. (Q) Key allocation of rice and grain is now hopeless. I don't know if flour can also be allocated? (A) The association's reserve of flour is as mentioned above, so key allocation, while maintaining household allocation, seems beyond our ability. However, in order to take care of the military camps and administrative personnel in this city that are related to public security, after consultation with the relevant parties, we have provided the greatest cooperation, giving more than 10,000 bags. It is a complete exertion.

### The Amount of Bills Receivable and Payable in the Silver Money Industry Doubles

In the current situation of cash shortage in this city, the amount of bills receivable and payable in the silver money industry has been increasing day by day. The number of bills per day has also created an unprecedented record. The banking industry averages about 100,000 bills per day, and the money industry averages about 50,000 bills per day. It is learned that although the receipt and payment of bills by various firms has been assigned to designated firms to share their affairs, the trial operation of receiving bills is still in the initial stage. The total transfer work of the bank's union money quasi-treasury is extremely busy. In addition, due to time constraints, the accounting departments of each association often have difficulty keeping up. If cash is still not fully supplied in the future, and the allocation slip is discontinued and replaced with bank drafts, the number of bills receivable and payable in the banking and money industries will still be large, and the amount of the clearing and payment account will also be inevitably reduced.

### Increase in Fees for Applying for Material Movement

### Li Xianglan on the Art of Singing

— Hai Yan

Miss Li Xianglan held a solo concert at the Grand Guangming Theater, publicly performing songs for three days, resulting in a "streets emptied" sensation. This is an internationally renowned artist: her accomplishments and success in singing, as well as her experiences and insights into singing, must be welcomed and valued by those who love singing!

Miss Li is a diligent, studious, and humble artist who always leaves everyone with the same impression, regardless of whether they are close or casual friends. Although still young, she has already achieved extraordinary accomplishments. Her singing seems to have spread throughout various countries and regions. People are even curious about her nationality. Koreans say she is Korean; Taiwanese and Manchurians say she is Taiwanese and Manchurian; Japanese and Soviets say she is Japanese and Soviet; and Chinese people, in turn, say she is Chinese. When this issue was mentioned, she said, "I am truly grateful for everyone's warm and generous love. To be frank, my company is in Manchuria, my parents are in Beijing, I studied singing in Tokyo, and I film movies in Shanghai. I wander around, and to put it playfully, I should say that I belong to Asia!" This is such a witty response.

Speaking of her formal study of singing, it began at the age of seventeen, with intermittent learning, and some time spent entirely on filming movies. Until recent years, due to her interest, she became particularly enthusiastic about singing again. She has studied with many musicians of different nationalities, and she is almost constantly learning and seeking progress. Her attitude toward learning is serious, conscientious, passionate, and always humble, never complacent. She has a sweet, broad, and bright voice gifted by nature. She can sing the highest scales of the soprano range on the piano. Although this is a great endowment, it also comes from diligent study and training. She also has a strong memory and can sing lyrics in different dialects of various countries: Chinese, Japanese, Soviet, German, French, Italian... Using her multifaceted talent and wisdom, she cultivates a unique ability. She said that when she learns something, she wants to be like it, striving for absolute accuracy and purity. The number of songs she can sing is not necessarily large, but she must achieve "learning something and being like something," completely like a native singing their native song. This is truly a spirit of perseverance and meticulous learning!

She also provided methods and essential conditions for learning to sing, which are also worth learning from. She said that the singing method of ordinary people is mostly from the throat, but those who have a considerable foundation and level of singing will understand how to extract the energy from the dantian (lower abdomen). With abundant and full energy, the singing voice will naturally be deep and mellow, and the tail sounds will also have endless lingering charm. When singing, one must pay attention to articulation and vocalization, and also infuse genuine emotions so that the timbre is beautiful and the singing is pleasant and moving. However, good physical strength, good mental state, and sufficient energy are also indispensable conditions for excellent singers.

As for her experience in learning to sing, she also contributed a valuable insight. She said that when most people learn to sing, they always attribute their success or failure to the teacher, saying that the teacher teaches well or poorly. In fact, the teacher always has some strengths. The whole problem lies in whether the student can truly understand, whether they can fully absorb, or rather, whether they know how to "seize" the essence within and digest it into their own possession. And they must also be able to understand and emulate the meaning of the song, infuse emotion and soul, and then the singing can be controlled freely and reach perfection. This is also an attitude of being loyal to scholarship and learning seriously!

When asked about her mood when performing, her answer was: When I stand on the stage, my heart is filled with tears of gratitude. I feel that if I don't sing well, I will be sorry for everyone, and I will not be worthy of receiving everyone's warm love. She added: I only want to be an artist who belongs to the public (not the patent of the rich)—that is, her achievement in singing. This points out such an accurate path for the future of singing!

Recently, she will hold a performance of Soviet operetta and is also rushing to shoot a film centered on opera, "Night Blooming Cereus." It is said that she has also agreed to do a charity performance for this newspaper to raise scholarships!

Finally, talking about the future of Chinese song, she expressed: Although the Chinese music scene is still relatively immature, like an emerging art, it has only been widely valued and loved in recent years, it is making progress and full of hope.

In short, Miss Li Xianglan is an artist with a clear outlook on life, a firm view on her career, loyalty to art, and a desire for progress. We wish her a limitless future! At the same time, we also encourage the artists who follow.
