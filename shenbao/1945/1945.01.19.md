### Encouraging General Sun Liangcheng

Last October, the National Government officially ordered Xiang Zhizhuang, the Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification, to be transferred to the Governor of Zhejiang Province, and Sun Liangcheng, the Director of the Kaifeng Pacification, to take over as the Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification. Director Sun immediately led his troops to garrison Northern Jiangsu and assumed office. Sun recently came to Shanghai on business. Various Northern Jiangsu native associations in Shanghai held a joint banquet yesterday to welcome Sun, which was quite warm.

Northern Jiangsu was originally part of Jiangsu Province, located north of the Yangtze River. The administrative system was originally under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. In recent years, for practical convenience, an independent military and political area of Northern Jiangsu has formed. On October 31st last year, the Executive Yuan, in accordance with the provisions of the second item of the Provisional Outline for the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Director's Office to Concurrently Manage Northern Jiangsu Administrative Affairs, designated Taixian, Dongtai, Yancheng, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Baoying, Yizheng, Taixing, Jingjiang, Rugao, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Gaoning as the 15 counties of the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Region. The Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification is the actual military and political leader of the 15 counties of Northern Jiangsu.

The various counties of Northern Jiangsu are economically prosperous areas. Since the New Fourth Army's Southern Anhui Incident, they have fled to the Northern Jiangsu area. Over the years, they have expanded their power, won over the people, and permeated the entire Northern Jiangsu region. The original local miscellaneous troops are even more colorful and complex. Under the state of tug-of-war of mutual elimination and fear, the people in various places are exhausted and suffering immensely. For example, if the demands of the troops are hesitant and not allowed, then punishment will immediately follow. In the morning, Troop A arrives and harasses the area, and in the evening, Troop B comes and searches the area. Serving Troop A makes Troop B dissatisfied, and serving Troop B makes Troop A think you are protecting the other side. The ones bearing the brunt are the law-abiding old people, who are supporting these people. Slightly wealthier people are even more the targets of public criticism. Therefore, they cannot sleep peacefully at night, and some hide in ditches and fortresses, while others live in straw sheds. Their homes are emptied, and they must still offer compliments with a smile. The so-called discipline has disappeared, and the so-called not taking a single hair becomes taking every hair, with no one spared. Therefore, among the people of Northern Jiangsu, the mention of people in uniform evokes deep hatred.

Now that General Sun Liangcheng is in charge of the military and political affairs of Northern Jiangsu, with General Sun's past reputation in the Northwest Army, with strict discipline and not taking a single hair, we believe that he will be able to maintain his past reputation and relieve the suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu. As Sun said at the Northern Jiangsu fellow villagers' welcome banquet: "Northern Jiangsu has long been ravaged by the New Fourth Army and harassed by other small and worthless troops. In the future, we will use our strength to eliminate the New Fourth Army and reorganize the miscellaneous troops." Sun also quoted Zhuge Wuhou's determination to "devote himself to the task until his death." We believe that the people of Northern Jiangsu have had the opportunity of "things will get better after they get worse" and can breathe a sigh of relief.

However, while discipline is important in governing the army to avoid disturbing the people, it is still inevitably passive. On the active side, the responsibility of ensuring security should be undertaken. Ensuring security, in the current practical work, is to eliminate the New Fourth Army and reorganize the miscellaneous troops. From an objective point of view, the miscellaneous troops are originally a rabble, without training or knowledge, and are easy to reorganize. The New Fourth Army has disturbed the people in the past, but they can take advantage of various opportunities to seize the hearts of the people. Therefore, it is undeniable that in the people's impression, the miscellaneous troops are not as good as the New Fourth Army. This is a problem that deserves attention. Therefore, we believe that the situation in Northern Jiangsu is particularly complex. Governing Northern Jiangsu requires not only military but also political emphasis. In the military aspect, courage is needed, but also wisdom. Only with both wisdom and courage can one cope with the complex situation and win the hearts of the people. We hope that Director Sun will pay attention to talents who are both wise and courageous at all times.

Finally, the spirit of "devoting oneself to the task until death" is still an honorable failure in modern eyes. We hope that General Sun will go further and do his best to succeed and then rest.

### Road Administration Plans to Improve Railway Traffic Management; Three Measures Under Review

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – Recently, railway traffic management in Central China has been extremely corrupt, leading to the discovery of black market ticket transactions, frequent theft of passengers' luggage, and illegal extortion by black hats at railway stations, which greatly hinders legitimate passenger traffic. In view of this, the Road Administration of the Ministry of Construction convened an emergency meeting in Shanghai a dozen days ago, with the participation of the China Railway Company and other relevant organs, to discuss effective countermeasures. As a result, the China Railway Company was instructed to propose three effective measures and submit them to the Ministry for approval and implementation. The Ministry of Construction is closely reviewing the measures and coordinating with relevant organs to make a decision. According to reporters, the three measures are: (1) How to eliminate black market ticket transactions, (2) How to prevent theft of passengers' luggage, (3) How to crack down on illegal extortion by black hats at railway stations.

### Japanese Military Attaché Leaves Tangier

Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuters quoted a London dispatch that British Foreign Secretary Eden reported to the Lower House yesterday on the situation in Tangier, saying that the Japanese military attaché had left Tangier.

### U.S. Airman Discusses the Conflict Between the Kuomintang and the Communists

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch: Democratic Congressman Mansfield recently went to Chongqing as a special envoy of the President to inspect the political and economic situation. He has now returned to the United States. On the 16th, at a closed-door meeting of the House of Representatives, he issued a report as follows: Both the Kuomintang and the Yan'an regime are more concerned about the preservation of their own parties than about "resisting Japan." The general public is increasingly fearful of the Kuomintang because of the attitude of the troops and tax collectors. Although the Kuomintang claims democracy, it actually engages in dictatorial actions. In addition, the Yan'an regime is not only poorly informed about foreign affairs but also possesses its own troops, claiming to save the country. Although they are trying to find solutions to various internal problems in Chongqing, if they cannot stop this conflict and internal strife occurs, they will be subjected to interference by a certain major power.

### U.S. National Service Law Opposed by All Sectors

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Washington dispatch: President Roosevelt submitted a special message to Congress on the 17th, requesting the swift implementation of the National Service Law. However, Congress and various political and financial circles are strongly opposing it. The future of the National Service Law is difficult. The labor community is even more opposed to the National Service Law. The American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the two major labor groups in the United States, have expressed their absolute opposition because the National Service Law affects the freedom of the labor community. If the bill is introduced in Congress, a strong opposition movement will inevitably unfold. At the same time, the financial community has not expressed goodwill towards the National Service Law. The National Association of Manufacturers, the representative organ of the industrial community, issued a statement opposing it on the morning of the 16th.

### Date and Location of British, American, and Soviet Summit Determined

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the date and location of the summit of the three major powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were determined on the 16th. Roosevelt will depart from Washington soon to attend the summit.

Berlin, 78th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency quoted a telegram from the Exchange Telegraph Company stating that at the upcoming Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin conference, President Roosevelt will request that certain base areas in the Pacific be redistributed under a trusteeship system.

Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reported that according to U.S. sources, the organization of the British, American, and Soviet summit is a difficult task for the countries involved. According to the New York correspondent of the Swedish Daily, if the United States insists on sending 48 representatives to the conference (one representative from each state), then Moscow will also want to send 18 representatives, that is, one representative from each Soviet republic. All parties are paying more attention to Senator Winton Benton's proposal to establish a four-nation alliance to maintain peace. President Roosevelt may submit the plan for discussion at the three-nation conference, but Communist leader Blot has expressed opposition. In a speech in New York, he said that the plan is to prevent the spread of communism in Europe. This attitude is likely to be instructed by Moscow, so Washington political circles are deeply worried. London believes that the return of Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Gusev to his country is a sign that the three-nation conference has more definite principles. Military and political issues will occupy equal positions in the conference. Regarding the Polish issue, Stalin hopes that other countries will express their attitude towards Lublin. He is more willing to guarantee that Mikołajczyk and other Polish leaders in London will return to Poland without interference. The post-war foreign policy of the United States will be the most important issue. Stalin will raise some difficult questions to Roosevelt, such as the period of time the U.S. military will remain in Europe, the responsibility of the United States to Europe after the war, and the scope of U.S. assistance to the reconstruction of Europe. The East Asian war will also be discussed at the meeting. London believes that Stalin is eager to know when this war will end.

### Berlin Newspapers Comment: The War Situation Becomes Critical: German Forces Have Withdrawn from the Ruins of Warsaw

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A German news agency reports that a German military spokesperson announced last night: German forces are disengaging between the Vistula and Narew Rivers, and completed the withdrawal from the ruins of Warsaw on Wednesday. The German withdrawal is proceeding according to plan and was not hindered by Soviet forces. The new German lines have been strengthened on both flanks, and any Soviet attempts at encirclement from the south are doomed to fail. The spokesman further stated that Soviet forces north of Warsaw launched an attack on Tuesday with forty infantry divisions and several tank units, penetrating deeply westward. However, German defending forces at Modlin are holding back the Soviet assault. The Soviet multi-pronged offensive aims not only westward but also southwest and northwest.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German newspapers on the 17th unanimously published commentaries frankly pointing out the critical nature of the Eastern Front situation. The "People's Observer" stated that the vast territory acquired by Soviet forces at the start of the offensive in the Baranow region, and the massive forces deployed, clearly demonstrate that the German mission now is to establish new defensive lines in the rear and seal the Soviet breakthroughs. A German Supreme Headquarters communiqué stated that while German forces are striving to achieve this mission, it is not yet complete.

Soviet Forces Close in on the Krakow Area

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Soviet offensive in south-central Poland has expanded from south of Warsaw to the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German military announced on the 17th that Soviet forces are massing for a large-scale offensive, and the local situation in the Vistula River bend is not optimistic.

### Fellow Subei Provincials in Shanghai Welcome General Sun Liangcheng; Ardent Hopes Expressed to Relieve the Suffering of the People

Since the National Government appointed General Sun Liangcheng as Pacification Commissioner of Subei, General Sun has led his troops to garrison various counties in Subei and established the Commissioner's Office in Yangzhou. Yesterday, Sun came to Shanghai on business. Representatives of the Yangzhou Seven Counties, Jianghuai, and Tongru Chonghaiqi Associations in Shanghai held a joint banquet in his honor at the Cathay Mansion at noon. Commissioner Sun, accompanied by Chen Caifu, Commander of the 26th Division, Fei Bang, Subei Liaison Minister, and Lieutenant Colonel Tenant, attended the meeting on time. More than 80 representatives of the fellow provincial associations, including Gu Nanqun, Jiao Dingkai, Zhu Dexuan, Liu Zhenqiu, Zhu Chuliang, Qian Shusheng, Zhu Jiuxiang, Shen Xibin, and Jin Xuegao, were present. The atmosphere was warm and friendly.

Speech by Gu Nanqun

During the banquet, Gu Nanqun, Chairman of the Tongru Chonghaiqi Five Counties Fellow Provincial Association, delivered a welcoming speech, stating: "General Sun is a famous general of the Northwest Army, known for his strict discipline and care for the people. He has the best military reputation in the Chinese army. His transfer from Henan to Subei is greatly appreciated by the people of the fifteen counties of Subei because, after the Incident, various troops stationed in Subei were numerous and disorganized, causing much hardship to the people. Now that General Sun has taken over the defense with his troops, the past suffering of the people of Subei can be relieved. Secondly, in terms of local politics, there are numerous exorbitant taxes and levies, imposing a heavy burden on the people and leaving them no respite. Therefore, the people desperately hope to have a virtuous official who can rectify both military and political affairs. However, even if senior officials have the will to govern, if the middle and lower ranks do not implement policies effectively, the people will suffer, and the senior officials will remain unaware. This has been the case throughout history, and we hope that this will be taken into consideration in the future. Now that the Central Government has appointed General Sun to be stationed in Subei, we believe that based on his past reputation for strict military discipline, he will be able to save the people of Subei from their dire straits. Commander Chen Caifu is also a fellow provincial from Subei, and by serving his hometown, he will certainly assist Director Sun and achieve quick results." Subsequently, Jiao Dingkai, a representative of the Yangzhou Seven Counties Fellow Provincial Association, and Zhu Dexuan, a representative of the Jianghuai Fellow Provincial Association, delivered welcoming speeches in succession, passionately hoping that Director Sun would relieve the suffering of the people of Subei.

General Sun Liangcheng then gave a reply, saying: "I am very honored and gratified to receive such a grand reception from the fellow provincials in Shanghai today. At the same time, I am also very ashamed because I am afraid that I am not capable enough to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of military and political affairs, and I may fail to live up to the heavy trust placed in me by the state and the expectations of the local elders. However, I will abide by the orders of the Central Government, act according to my conscience, and strive to move forward. Subei has long been devastated by the New Fourth Army and harassed by other unorganized troops. In the future, I will certainly use my strength to eliminate the New Fourth Army and reorganize the miscellaneous troops. As Zhuge Liang said, 'I will dedicate myself to the task until my dying day,' I will also take this as my determination. At the same time, I hope that the local elders will do their best to assist me." Finally, Commander Chen Caifu gave a speech. After the speeches, a meal was held, and the event ended happily at 2:30 PM.

### Health Examination Report: Most Children Are Malnourished

Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Gu Nanqun, Director of Nanyang Hospital, reporting the results of health examinations for students assisted by the Shen Xin and Xin Bao elementary school groups. The original letter stated: "In order to serve the community and emphasize the importance of impoverished students, our hospital, with the assistance of your newspaper, has been providing free health examinations for students supported by the Shen Xin and Xin Bao student aid funds. The examinations have been progressing smoothly for several months, and we are very pleased. The number of students examined totals 1,850, and 810 of them are malnourished. Other students suffering from various diseases requiring urgent treatment will be listed separately in a percentage table and sent for your review." According to the attached table, of these 1,850 students, 32% suffer from trachoma, 13.5% have enlarged tonsils, 12% have tuberculosis, and more than ten other localized diseases are not serious. Only 18% are normal, while 44% are malnourished, almost half of the total. At a time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as valuable as cinnamon, and the price of everything is high, malnutrition is to be expected. According to the general public, this is a very ordinary and unremarkable matter, but in fact, it is a serious problem for society as a whole. The most useful people in the country are often the energetic youth and the innocent children. Today, among the general student population, the impoverished account for 80-90%, and nearly half of them are malnourished, which can easily lead to incomplete development. This is a matter of great importance to the health of the nation! To take a step back, while it is naturally difficult to supplement their nutrition in these times of hardship, we can still find ways to help them avoid dropping out of school. Donating to this newspaper's reader assistance fund is a shortcut!

Advocating for a One-Yuan Bill Student Aid Campaign

A letter from Mr. Chen Shao states: "Your newspaper's efforts to raise student aid funds, help impoverished students, and benefit society are not only admirable but also deeply appreciated by society. In the name of the 'Everlasting Property Team,' I am sending 20,000 yuan. I am also suggesting that, with the rising prices of goods, the one-yuan and small-denomination bills issued by the Central Reserve Bank are almost useless. No one is willing to accept them, and they are often discarded, which is a pity. Why not place a small box at the entrance or by the wall of your newspaper, allowing people to drop in these small bills? After accumulating a certain amount, you can exchange them for larger bills at the Central Bank and use them for charitable purposes. The amount collected may be considerable. Is this feasible? Please consider it."
