### Fierce Battle in the Northern Luzon Plains: Japanese Forces Break Through the Enemy with a Surprise Attack, Engage Main Force Near Lingayen

Central News Agency, Philippines Frontline Base, 17th: The enemy, after landing in the Lingayen Gulf area of Luzon Island to welcome Fabian, attempted to advance further and encroach upon the inland. In response, the Japanese ground forces launched a fierce counterattack, inflicting heavy damage and maintaining control of their positions, preventing the enemy from advancing. Morale is extremely high. On the San Fabian front, after the enemy landed on the 9th, they began to advance eastward on the 10th, invading Bitipolo, with a portion advancing north towards Mabicao. Simultaneously, another enemy force advanced southeast, breaking into Manao. Furthermore, enemy troops newly landed near Damortis and Santo Tomas are currently engaging in fierce battles with Japanese forces within a 10-kilometer radius centered on San Fabian. On the Santo Tomas front, enemy forces numbered over 500 by the evening of the 12th, and approximately 300 in the southern Damortis area. They subsequently attacked Japanese positions, but the Japanese forces bravely launched counterattacks everywhere, achieving significant victories and repelling them. On the Manao front, an enemy battalion, equipped with 15 vehicles, four field guns, and several mortars, is currently advancing from the Cabunaan Heights south of Manao. Several enemy tanks have also appeared in front of Japanese positions, becoming targets for Japanese artillery fire. In the Lingayen Gulf area, the enemy suffered heavy losses from fierce attacks by Japanese air forces and ground artillery. They are currently reinforcing their troops, and it appears that the main force of their tank units landed on the night of the 12th. The enemy forces in that area have moved south from Lingayen and are now in contact with the main force of the Japanese first line.

### Enemy Action Halted Near San Fabian, US Warships Damaged Near Manila

Central News Agency, Philippines, 17th: According to information received on the evening of the 15th, an enemy force of 30 tanks advanced two kilometers east of Damortis on Luzon Island. The Japanese forces immediately engaged and repelled them. Furthermore, two enemy battalions invaded a high ground four kilometers north of Mabicao and are currently engaged in fierce fighting.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The battle situation in the Philippines today is as follows: US forces in the plains of Pangasinan in northern Luzon have gradually come into contact with Japanese forces, and the battle of Luzon is reaching a climax. In particular, the actions of the enemy's left flank east of San Fabian have become more active. The enemy troops who newly landed on the 11th have advanced towards Japanese positions along a 35-kilometer front from Damortis to Gatingban. The Japanese and US forces have engaged in fierce battles over the past few days, but the US forces have suffered heavy losses each time, while the Japanese defensive positions have remained unaffected. Furthermore, in the western Lingayen area, the enemy has approached Japanese positions on the left bank of the Agno River, so the fighting in this area is also expected to intensify. Currently, the enemy's central force has not made any significant progress, and the Japanese forces are conserving their strength, waiting for an opportunity. As for the enemy warships visible in Lingayen Gulf, most have been destroyed or are listing. Correspondingly, the enemy mobile force that attacked Taiwan from the eastern sea of Luzon and later invaded southern China with its main force suffered even greater losses.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th: The US Sixth Army on Luzon Island, after reaching the Agno River, is showing signs of advancing south. According to frontline reports, US forces are attempting to advance on Tarlac with armored units, but their left flank's advance in the San Fabian area has been halted by Japanese forces. Furthermore, according to an Associated Press dispatch dated the 15th, Japanese artillery fire on the US left flank has caused the US position to waver. Another dispatch stated that over the past two or three nights, Japanese heavy artillery from positions behind Moring has heavily shelled the left flank of the US bridgehead. There were also small-scale engagements west of Lingayen on the 15th.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th: The New York Times of the 16th reported on the situation on Luzon Island as follows: There is no doubt that the Japanese forces are gradually concentrating all their forces on Luzon Island. So far, the Japanese attitude has been very cautious. General Yamashita and others are expected to offer fierce resistance north of Manila. It can be predicted that the current US offensive is completely misguided and its advance will encounter extreme difficulties.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th: Japanese air forces carried out air raids on US warships near Bataan and Manila Bay on the 15th. According to the US announcement, they suffered some losses in the operation.

### US Carrier-Based Aircraft Formation Attacks Various Places in South China

Macau Also Bombed

Central News Agency, Mainland Base, 17th: On the 16th, the enemy mobile force in South China again used approximately 370 carrier-based aircraft in total to attack South China, strafing airfields, ships, and other facilities with machine guns. According to reports, starting at 9:00 AM on the 16th, enemy aircraft in formations of several dozen attacked the Hong Kong area. Eighty aircraft attacked the Guangdong area. Starting at 1:00 PM, the enemy again attacked the Xianggang area in formations of several dozen aircraft for approximately two hours. At that time, the Japanese air defense forces immediately engaged, and it has now been confirmed that eight aircraft were shot down. Furthermore, among the enemy aircraft that attacked in the morning, more than 20 illegally violated the neutral Portuguese territory of Macau, strafing it with machine guns.

### General Arima Promoted, Exemplifying Traditional Spirit

Simultaneously Announced by the Japanese Naval Ministry

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The Japanese Naval Ministry and the Bureau of Decorations announced at midnight on the 16th that Lieutenant General Arima, who as Air Force Commander took the lead and boldly attacked enemy ships with kamikaze tactics when the enemy mobile force attempted to land on Leyte Island and appeared in the eastern sea of the Philippines last October, has been specially ordered to be promoted. The results achieved at that time were the sinking of one enemy aircraft carrier, the destruction of two aircraft carriers, causing them to catch fire, and the destruction of one cruiser. Judging from the above results, it can be seen that the true spirit of naval commanders taking the lead has been fully demonstrated. Therefore, the entire army should follow the example of Lieutenant General Arima, continue to be loyal and fight for the country with the spirit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps.

Japanese Youth Corps Resolves to Fight to the Death to Uphold the National Polity

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The Zansho Youth Corps held a general affairs meeting at its hall at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th, the fourth anniversary of its founding. More than 20 people attended, including advisor Baron Kikuchi. Regarding the enemy American bombing of the Ise Shrine, the following resolution was made and the meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM. The resolution reads as follows: "The enemy's bombing of the Ise Shrine is truly frightening and infuriating. The enemy's intention to destroy the national polity of the Imperial State is obvious. Therefore, we, the people, pledge to fight to the death to uphold the group, thoroughly implement support, hold the heart to destroy the bandits and win, and vow before the gods."

### B-29 Aircraft Damage Statistics

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: US Air Force B-29 aircraft based in Chengdu have bombed northern Kyushu and western Japan ten times since June 12 of last year. Furthermore, enemy B-29 aircraft from the Marianas have bombed Tokyo eleven times since November 24, continuously conducting a war of nerves against the vicinity of Tokyo and Zhongcha. B-29 aircraft are purely designed for air raids on the Japanese mainland, but the distance of 2,200 kilometers from Chengdu to Fukuoka and 2,280 kilometers from Saipan to Tokyo places limitations on their activities. Furthermore, the activity of the Japanese air defense forces poses a greater threat to enemy attacks. Judging from the eleven B-29 attacks, the total number of aircraft was 1,250, of which 178 were shot down by Japanese forces and 146 were damaged, with a shooting down rate of 14% and a damage rate of 19%. Among the 178 shot down, 17 were due to ramming. From this, one can imagine the severity of the interception. The destruction of B-29 aircraft can turn their production cost of 650,000 US dollars and 70,000 hours of labor into vapor. At least 12 airmen are killed. Therefore, it can be calculated that the enemy has lost 115.7 million US dollars and 2,136 airmen on the Japanese mainland. In addition, the Japanese Air Force has attacked enemy bases in the Marianas, Chengdu, and Calcutta several times, causing a total of 181 enemy aircraft to be damaged and burned. Furthermore, 11 aircraft have been shot down in Manchuria. The number of aircraft destroyed on the ground and in the air or requiring major repairs since June 16 of last year has reached at least 540 in seven months. Many B-29s have been removed from the command of the enemy's operational headquarters.

### Arnold's Talk

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th: According to a Washington dispatch, US Army Air Corps Secretary Arnold made the following statement on the night of the 13th regarding the war against Japan: The bombing of Japan by B-29s in the past few weeks is only the beginning. More difficult and bitter battles will be encountered in the future. Furthermore, Japan has obtained abundant resources in the Pacific region and is actively developing its industry and agriculture, and is almost self-sufficient, and its scale is three times that of Germany. At the same time, the industrial organization has now been dispersed, so the US Air Force is preparing to bomb it.

### 15 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Air Raid on Burmese Territory, US-Chongqing Forces West of Lashio Damaged

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: On the afternoon of the 15th, a Japanese fighter squadron intercepted six enemy P-47 aircraft that attempted to come to attack, shooting down one and damaging two. Two Japanese aircraft did not return. Furthermore, on the same day, Japanese ground forces' anti-aircraft fire shot down two and damaged two enemy P-47 and Mosquito aircraft formations.

Central News Agency, Burma Frontline Base, 17th: Enemy aircraft are still extremely persistent in their attacks on Japanese airfields. On the 13th, 20 enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese air base in Meiktila, central Burma. Japanese forces shot down two and damaged three with ground fire. On the 15th, three enemy aircraft came to attack the airfield again. Japanese fighter aircraft intercepted and shot down two and damaged one. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

Central News Agency, Northern Burma Frontline, 17th: US-Chongqing forces in northern Burma moved south from Bhamo, echoing the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, attempting to open up the connection between the Ledo Road and the Yunnan-Burma Road. In the west of Lashio, they moved at a place 19 kilometers away and suffered heavy damage after being bravely countered by Japanese forces. From January 1 to January 11, Japanese suicide squads killed 270 Chongqing soldiers and captured one rocket launcher and a large amount of military uniforms and ammunition. In the counterattack against the Yunnan Expeditionary Force in early January, countless Chongqing soldiers were killed and countless guns and ammunition were captured.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Wuhan Again, Counterattack Launched, Approximately 30 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: On the afternoon of the 14th, approximately 90 US Chongqing-based Air Force P-40, P-47, P-51, and B-29 aircraft attacked the Wuhan area again, blindly dropping bombs on the urban area. Japanese fighter squadrons and ground artillery engaged the enemy aircraft in a counterattack for four hours, shooting down approximately 30 enemy aircraft. Five Japanese aircraft self-destructed. Damage to military facilities was extremely light. The details of the results are as follows: (1) In aerial combat, 7 P-47s and 5 P-51s were shot down, and 2 P-47s and 5 P-51s were damaged. (2) Ground artillery shot down 3 P-47s and 3 P-40s (2 unconfirmed), and 2 P-51s, and damaged 2 P-47s and 2 P-51s (1 unconfirmed).

### Handover Ceremony Held Yesterday Between New and Old Propaganda Ministers, Minister Zhao Encourages Staff to Continue Efforts

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: The handover ceremony between the new and old Propaganda Ministers was held at 10:00 AM on the 17th. All new and old staff members of the Ministry participated in the ceremony. First, the outgoing Minister Lin transferred the seal to the receiving Minister Zhao. Minister Lin then gave instructions to the old staff, encouraging all members to work hard to promote the propaganda cause under the leadership of the new director, and introduced the beginning and end of the new Minister Zhao's work in the propaganda department for peace. Before the return to the capital, when Zhao established a propaganda committee in Shanghai, he was responsible for propaganda. Later, the reprinting of the China Daily was also due to Zhao's guidance. After the speech, the new Minister Zhao gave instructions, expressing his deep admiration for the achievements of Minister Lin's leadership of the Propaganda Department in the past, and the hard work and endurance of all members of the Ministry in their efforts in the propaganda cause. He hoped that all members would continue their efforts in the same spirit. The members were very excited after listening to the instructions. Finally, Minister Zhao introduced the new Deputy Minister Sun Lifu to meet with the new and old staff members.

Minister Zhao's Talk

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: After formally taking office at the Ministry on the morning of the 17th, the new Propaganda Minister Zhao Zunyue met with the capital's Chinese and foreign press corps at the Ministry's press room at 4:00 PM and gave a speech on taking office as follows:

At this time when the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, on the eve of our country's quest for independence and freedom, all our people should work doubly hard to jointly achieve this goal. I am now ordered to take over the duties of the Minister of Propaganda, and I know deeply the importance of my responsibilities. I can only follow the late Chairman Wang's legacy, the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, and do my best in my position to ensure that public opinion grows day by day, the people's will is fully expressed, and the entire country is united in sincerity, externally to achieve national freedom and independence, and internally to seek national peace and unity.

The propaganda mechanism is an important policy of the country and a pivot for the government to communicate its policies and the people's will. Under the leadership of Minister Lin, it has been well-established and has achieved brilliant results over the years. I will certainly follow the old practices and strive to use it vigorously so as not to fail Minister Lin's achievements. However, since the war is now at its climax and there is a lack of materials, how can we make the effectiveness more highly developed and the materials can be saved to a considerable extent, so as to adapt to the wartime environment and needs? I will discuss this with all parties after taking office to obtain a suitable solution.

Our country's public opinion has made progress in recent decades, and the people's clear opinions have been expressed a lot. The newspaper business has also progressed accordingly. However, since the military uprising, there have been reasons for decline. After the return to the capital, it was able to regain its development due to the government's promotion. The prosperity of the publication of newspapers and magazines in various places can be seen. In the future, how should we strengthen the equipment of various newspapers and fully disclose the local customs so that they can fulfill their mission of improving society, promoting construction, and leading the people to achieve the final victory of the war? This is what I deeply hope to devote myself to.

I have been involved in the news industry for many years, and my comrades and colleagues have always had high expectations. This time I was ordered to be the head of the department, which is like re-engaging in my old business. However, I feel that the responsibility is heavy, and I hope that all parties will continue to urge and cooperate with me in the future so that propaganda and public opinion can be harmoniously integrated, and we can work together to boldly move forward on the path of building a new China. This is what I hope for.

Editorial

### The Necessity of Evacuating the Population and Rectifying Transportation

It is unavoidable for important wartime cities to be bombed by enemy aircraft. Especially during tense decisive stages, it is expected that the enemy will attempt to disrupt our rear and implement psychological warfare through indiscriminate bombing. Shanghai is an important base in the rear of the Greater East Asia War, so it is also possible that it will become a target for enemy bombing. We are not deliberately creating alarmist statements to sensationalize. We must pay special attention to the possibility of the current environment.

Shanghai has a dense population, and innocent sacrifices are inevitable under indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft. Therefore, on the active side, it is necessary to strengthen air defense facilities and improve air defense effectiveness. On the passive side, it is important to understand air defense knowledge to reduce the risk to life. At the same time, those who do not need to stay in Shanghai should evacuate as much as possible to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Therefore, the issue of population evacuation in wartime cities is, in principle, beyond discussion.

The public should actively prepare for population evacuation, and the authorities should also plan and deploy as soon as possible. Do not harbor a wait-and-see, lucky, or complacent attitude. Once the situation arises, you will be at a loss and in chaos. In our editorial on December 26 of last year, we raised several points that should be considered for population evacuation. Here, we must first determine the scope of the population to be evacuated, such as unemployed vagrants, charitable organizations such as homes for the elderly and orphanages, high-ranking idlers without fixed occupations, elderly, weak, women, and children in families, and other residents who do not need to stay in Shanghai. Secondly, the authorities should organize an evacuation committee, and the most important task is to arrange the transportation for evacuation back to their hometowns in a thorough and convenient manner. It is necessary to establish contact with transportation agencies such as trains and ships, and to dedicate special cars and ships for evacuating people. For those evacuating to the outskirts of the city, organize walking teams and divide them into walking stations. Provide rest stops along the way to provide care and services, reducing the suffering of the evacuees. Depending on the economic ability of the evacuees, consider offering free or reduced fares. From another perspective, among the current residents of the city, there are quite a few who are willing to evacuate and return to their hometowns. For example, laid-off employees of various agencies, organizations, and businesses, as well as those who feel that life in Shanghai is difficult to maintain, want to take the opportunity to return home. However, due to transportation difficulties, they cannot do so. Train and boat tickets are difficult to obtain, and luggage cannot be carried. There are many demands along the way, and the theft by "black hats" at the station is disgusting, making travelers afraid. Therefore, the availability of transportation is a prerequisite for population evacuation. Evacuees need to carry their belongings with them for use, and no one wants to abandon them. Therefore, while transportation needs to be increased, the service of transportation workers must also be particularly enthusiastic.

Recently, the "car attendants" on the trains—the "black hats"—extort and steal from passengers, acting extremely arrogantly, which is deeply hated by every passenger. If this is not severely cracked down on, not only will population evacuation be impossible, but even ordinary passengers will be afraid, making it a great stain on railway management. "Car attendants" are just attendants on the train, so why are they so arrogant, and why does the railway authorities turn a deaf ear and allow them to be so unscrupulous, damaging the reputation of the railway? It is incomprehensible. If the entire railway management organization cannot manage even the lowest-level attendants, how can it manage the entire railway administration, let alone serve the passengers? In our editorial on January 6, we cited cracking down on extortion by "black hats" as a touchstone for whether official corruption can be eradicated. Is the power of politics not as strong as the power of the "black hats"? We hope that the authorities will thoroughly crack down on the arrogant behavior of the "black hats" within one month. This will not only facilitate the realization of population evacuation but also wash away the stain on railway administration. Currently, the city's police department has added a branch at the North Station to guard the station's order and inspect passengers on trains. We further hope that the extortion behavior of "black hats" will be corrected first.

### Japan-Italy Association to Reopen Regularly, Promoting Strong Political Measures; Government Emphasizes the Preparation of a Sure-Win Situation

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The 86th Japanese Diet will reopen on the 21st. The Japanese government plans to prepare bills and budgets in this Diet. The Prime Minister's policy speech in this Diet has made it clear that the government is determined to implement decisive battle measures and promote national arousal. At the same time, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association attaches great importance to the following points: (1) This Diet should focus on promoting strong political measures and enhancing the morale for the decisive battle. The situation in the Philippines has become increasingly serious, and the rise and fall of Japan will be determined here. At the same time, under the decisive battle system, the implementation of measures for total mobilization is also an urgent task. At present, it is necessary to unite 100 million people into a "whole-body special attack team," organize them, and train them. Therefore, the important task of this Diet should be the promotion of strong political measures. (2) From the above point of view, it can be seen that this Diet under the decisive battle is well-timed for its task to be undertaken. Therefore, if we avoid the government, avoid the people, and stick to our own position, we will ignore the true essence of the Diet convened in this major crisis. (3) The speech in this Diet must be active, and the questions raised by the various committees must be actively and decisively implemented by the government after this Diet. (4) If so, the content of the discussion, on the government's side, attaches more importance to the closer ties between national affairs and command and the preparation of a sure-win situation. At the same time, it also attaches great importance to issues such as the enhancement of national morale, military production, labor transportation, air defense system, and national production. However, looking at the recent trends, it can be seen that the issue of unifying the domestic system is regarded as a problem of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association itself, and the atmosphere of seeking a solution is extremely strong. In the past, regarding this issue, most of the committees advocated the dissolution of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and the internal situation of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was also extremely complicated. Since the entry of President Kobayashi into the cabinet, the government has used the Imperial Rule Assistance Association as a background to reorganize it, in order to unite with the parliament and carry out the operation of strong political measures. Therefore, to the maximum extent, we should make use of this Diet, gain the support of the people, and seize the opportunity to implement decisive battle measures.

### Unprecedented War Launched in Southern Poland; German Army Abandons Kielce

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The fiercest battle on the Eastern Front is in southern Poland. The Soviet First Ukrainian Front crossed the Nida River on a 56-kilometer front line, turning its vanguard northeast to attack Kielce. According to German reports, the city has been abandoned after street fighting. In the triangle between the Vistula and Bug rivers and the Narew River bridgehead, the Soviet army also formed a deep penetration with a considerable advantage in troops. The German reserve army is now counterattacking. There are no major changes in the fighting on the East Prussian border.

Soviet Reserves Deployed to the Front

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - H.T.S. reports: A German military spokesman pointed out yesterday that the German army's brave resistance on the Eastern Front and the heavy losses of the enemy can be proved by the fact that the Soviet commanders have transferred large numbers of reserve troops to the war zone.

Three Objectives of the Winter Offensive

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - H.T.S. reports: The Eastern Front war will be closely watched by the world in the future. The Soviet winter offensive is now underway between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian Mountains. The Soviet army has gathered a large number of troops. Stalin's purpose is not only to break into the Upper Silesian industrial area, but also to defeat the strong German positions in the Warsaw area, or to carry out a large-scale pincer attack on East Prussia, in order to determine the outcome of this war. The Soviet army's winter offensive has the above three objectives, and it is doing its best to defeat the German army on the Eastern Front in one fell swoop. But the question now is why the Soviet army did not launch an offensive at the same time when the British and American forces launched their offensive last autumn to determine the outcome of this war. The answer that we can give is that the Soviet army was not ready at that time, and Eisenhower wanted to take the credit for conquering Germany alone, so he launched an offensive without waiting for its ally. Secondly, Stalin may have expected that the British and American autumn offensive would fail, so he did not attack, waiting for the German army to be exhausted on the Western Front and the Eastern Front defenses to be weakened, so that the Soviet army could easily attack. In fact, these are all his miscalculations.

### Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls Stationed in Turkey Prepare to Return Home

Zurich, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Ankara: The Japanese Ambassador to Turkey and his staff, as well as consuls, are preparing to return home. All other Japanese residents will also return home via the Soviet Union recently.

Soviet Control of the Dardanelles

Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) - D.N.B. reports: According to newspapers here, Roosevelt may encounter unprecedented serious problems at the future Rochus Conference. Stalin wants to discuss the Dardanelles Strait issue at the conference. The Soviet Union wants to control the strait to maintain peace.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Ankara: Anti-Axis ships have passed through the Dardanelles Strait in recent days. The Turkish government has confirmed that the strait is open for anti-Axis shipping.

### German Troops in the Ardennes on the Western Front Engage in Disengagement Movement; Little Change in the Southern Wing

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - H.T.S. reports: There have been no major changes on the Western Front in the past 24 hours. The German army in the Eastern Ardennes is carrying out a disengagement movement according to plan in order to preserve its strength. The anti-Axis forces have suffered heavy losses as a result of this movement. The German army has increased pressure from the north and east of the Salm River basin and from the south between Wilz and Diekirch, so that the American army has not been able to break into the German positions. In other sections of the Western Front, the American actions in Remich, Saarlautern, and other places are only an attempt to divert attention. The pressure exerted by the American army east and southeast of Saargemünd is concentrated on the flanks of the German army in the Vosges area, but it has not achieved significant results. On the Hatton and Rhidahofen fronts, the anti-Axis forces are fighting hard within the Maginot Line without making progress.

### Germany Releases Soviet Prisoners of War

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - H.T.S. reports: The first batch of 173 Soviet prisoners of war, who have made special contributions in Germany, have been released in front of General Vlasov. The German Director-General of Prisoners of War said that although the Soviet Union is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, Germany, standing on humanitarian grounds, has released them in accordance with the regulations.

### The Breakdown of the Chongqing-Communist Negotiations (Part 1)

The reports and documents submitted by both the Chongqing (Nationalist) and Communist parties at the third session of the Chongqing Political Consultative Council on September 15th of last year were sufficient to fully expose the intensity of the Chongqing-Communist conflict and the impossibility of compromise. Excerpts of these were published in this newspaper on October 7th and 9th of last year. Now, having rediscovered the full text, we are reprinting it in its entirety to provide a complete overview.

Speech by Chongqing Representative Zhang Zhizhong to the Political Consultative Council

Regarding the progress of negotiations on the Communist issue, esteemed members of the National Political Consultative Council have requested a report. I, Zhang Zhizhong, have been ordered to represent the government and provide a concise report on the course of these negotiations, as follows:

I

In January of this year, Guo Zhongrong, the liaison staff officer sent by the Military Affairs Commission to the Eighteenth Group Army, reported to the Military Affairs Department via telegram, stating: "In a conversation on the sixteenth of this month, Mr. Mao Zedong indicated that the Communist Party of China (CPC) intends to select one or three individuals from Zhou Enlai, Lin Zuhan, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De to travel to Chongqing to meet with the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek) for instructions. He also requested that this be reported for instructions as to whether this is permissible." On February 2nd, the Military Affairs Department replied via telegram to liaison staff officer Guo: "We warmly welcome Zhu, Zhou, and Lin to Chongqing. Please telegraph in advance of their arrival." Subsequently, liaison staff officer Guo telegraphed on February 18th: "Mr. Mao Zedong stated that the CPC has decided to send Mr. Lin Zuhan to Chongqing first." In April, we received another telegram from liaison staff officer Guo, stating that according to Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and Lin Zuhan, Lin was scheduled to depart on April 28th. Upon receiving this report, the Central Government dispatched Mr. Zhang Zhizhong and Mr. Wang Shijie to Xi'an on May 1st to hold preliminary talks with Mr. Lin Zuhan. Mr. Lin and we arrived in Xi'an successively on the 2nd of May. From May 4th to 11th, we held a total of five meetings in Xi'an, producing a record. This record was sent to Mr. Lin for review, and after Mr. Lin made additions, deletions, and modifications, he handed it back to us in person and signed his name on the record. At that time, Mr. Lin asked us if we would also sign it. We believed that since this represented Mr. Lin's views, or at least his agreement with some of our views, only Mr. Lin should sign it. As for the Central Government's views, we would formally present them after returning to Chongqing for instructions. Now, the original text of the record signed by Mr. Lin is transcribed below:

Items Expressed in the Meetings from May 4th to May 8th

A. Regarding Military Matters

1. The Eighteenth Group Army and the troops formerly under the "New Fourth Army" will obey the orders of the Military Affairs Commission.

3. The military, political, and economic issues in the guerrilla areas shall be subject to the leadership of the National Government and the Military Affairs Commission and shall be resolved in accordance with principles that are conducive to the war of resistance. Lin Zuhan, May 11th

Attached are the four points proposed by Division Commander Lin Biao last spring:

(1) On party issues, to obtain legal status under the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction and to implement the Three Principles of the People, the Central Government may also establish party offices and newspapers in CPC-controlled areas; (2) On military issues, to be organized into four armies and twelve divisions and to receive the same treatment as Central Government troops; (3) The Shaanbei Border Region should be changed to an administrative region based on the original area, and other regions should be reorganized separately, implementing Central Government laws and regulations; (4) Regarding combat zones, to accept in principle the Central Government's regulations to move north of the Yellow River, but this can only be prepared and arranged for now. Implementation will be guaranteed immediately after the war. If the wartime situation allows—such as during a general counteroffensive—movement can also be discussed and agreed upon.

II

Because Mr. Lin Zuhan had already expressed concrete opinions, we returned to Chongqing with Mr. Lin Zuhan on May 17th. At that time, the Central Government was about to hold the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and the National Administrative Conference. Despite being extremely busy, we still reported the content of the talks in Xi'an and the opinions expressed by Mr. Lin Zuhan to the Central Government, so that the Central Government could consider concrete solutions to this issue. On June 5th, when we met with Mr. Lin Zuhan, we handed over to Mr. Lin Zuhan a document titled "Central Government's Proposed Political Solution to the CPC Issue." Its original text is as follows:

June 5, Year 33 [1944] Central Government's Proposed Political Solution to the CPC Issue

Based on the opinions expressed by Representative Lin Zuhan in Xi'an, the following proposal is made:

A. Regarding Military Matters

1. The Eighteenth Group Army and all its troops in various locations shall be combined into four armies and ten divisions. Their designations shall be determined by order.

2. The Group Army shall obey the orders of the Military Affairs Commission.

3. The number of personnel in the Group Army shall be in accordance with the standard establishment of the National Army (promulgated by the Ministry of Military Administration). No detachments, sub-detachments, or other designations shall be established outside of the establishment. All previous establishments shall be abolished within a time limit approved by the Central Government.

4. Personnel appointments in the Group Army shall be approved in accordance with personnel regulations.

5. The military expenditures of the Group Army shall be issued by the Central Government in accordance with the general provisions for the National Army and shall be handled in accordance with financial regulations, implementing independent military supply.

C. Regarding Party Issues

1. They shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction during the war of resistance. After the end of the war, in accordance with the Central Government's resolution, a National Assembly shall be convened to formulate a constitution and implement constitutional government. The Communist Party of China, like other political parties, shall abide by national laws and enjoy equal treatment.

2. The Communist Party of China should again express its faithful implementation of the Four Pledges.

After handing the Central Government's proposal to Mr. Lin Zuhan, we stated that if the CPC implemented the above measures, the Central Government would consider withdrawing the garrison troops in the defense areas, restoring commercial traffic between the region and its neighbors, and leniently bailing out CPC personnel arrested for illegal activities. Mr. Lin then took out a letter from his pocket, attached with a document titled "Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on Solving Several Urgent Current Problems," and handed it to us for review. Its original text is as follows:

Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on Solving Several Urgent Current Problems

The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the war of resistance has lasted for seven years. The CPC's loyalty to the country, its bravery in combat, its implementation of the Three Principles of the People, its practice of the Four Pledges, and its support of the National Government and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in the war of resistance and national reconstruction have been consistent and are evident to all. However, the current situation in the war of resistance is extremely serious. The Japanese army continues to attack, but the domestic political situation and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not yet moved onto a track suitable for the needs of the war of resistance. In order to overcome the current difficulties, resist the Japanese army's attack, and earnestly prepare for a counteroffensive, the CPC believes that the only way is to implement democracy and strengthen unity. To this end, the CPC hopes that the government will solve the following extremely urgent problems. Some of these problems concern national politics, and some concern the unresolved issues between the two parties. They are listed frankly below:

A. Regarding National Politics

1. The government should implement democratic politics, guarantee freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and person.

2. The government should lift the ban on parties, recognize the legal status of the CPC and various anti-Japanese parties, and release patriotic political prisoners.

3. The government should allow the implementation of genuine local autonomy for the people.

B. Regarding the Unresolved Issues Between the Two Parties

1. Based on the needs of the war of resistance, the achievements in the war of resistance, and the actual number of existing troops, the government should organize the CPC troops into sixteen armies and forty-seven divisions, with 10,000 men per division. For the sake of compromise, at least five armies and sixteen divisions should be designated for now.

2. The government should recognize the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the popularly elected governments in the North China base areas as legal local governments and recognize the various facilities needed for the war of resistance.

3. The defense areas of the CPC troops should remain as they are during the war of resistance and be negotiated separately after the end of the war of resistance.

4. The government should fully provide material assistance to the Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Since 1940, the government has provided no bullets, no medicine, no money, and no grain. This situation should be changed immediately.

5. Weapons, ammunition, and medicine provided by the Allied countries to China should be fairly distributed to all Chinese troops. The Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army should receive their fair share.

6. The government should order military and political organs to lift the military and economic blockade against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various base areas.

7. The government should order military organs to cease military attacks against the New Fourth Army in Central China and the guerrillas in Guangdong.

8. The government should order party and government organs to release arrested personnel in various places, such as Ye Ting and other officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army captured during the Southern Anhui Incident, Liao Chengzhi and Zhang Wenbin in Guangdong, Xu Jie, Xu Mengqiu, Mao Zemin, Yang Zhihua, and Pan Que in Xinjiang, Luo Shiwen, Che Liangxian, Li Chun, and Zhang Shaoming in Sichuan, He Bin in Hubei, Liu Ying in Zhejiang, and Xuan Xiafu, Shi Zuoxiang, Li Yuhai, Chen Yuanying, and Zhao Xiang in Xi'an. These personnel are all patriotic people and should be restored to freedom.

9. The government should allow the CPC to establish party offices and newspapers throughout the country. The CPC also allows the Kuomintang to establish party offices and newspapers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various democratic border regions.

The above are just the main points. The CPC sincerely hopes that our National Government will give them a reasonable and as prompt a solution as possible. If our Kuomintang and Communist parties can not only continue to cooperate but also refresh domestic politics and improve party relations, it will not only greatly benefit the current situation but also cast a solid dawn on next year's large-scale counteroffensive in coordination with the Allied countries. We hope that our government will act in its best interests.

Lin Zuhan, Representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, June 4, Year 33 [1944] At this time, we said to Mr. Lin Zuhan: Because the twenty items you presented last time on May 22nd differed greatly in content from the opinions expressed in Xi'an, they could not be accepted and were taken back by you. Although the twelve items presented this time are fewer, the content has not changed and cannot be accepted. However, not wishing to entirely dismiss your intention, we only agreed to keep them but could not submit them. At that time, Mr. Lin also said that it would be good to keep them with you two for reference.

III

On June 6th, we received a letter from Mr. Lin Zuhan, making two points of clarification regarding the Central Government's proposal: First, he believed that the proposal differed greatly from the opinions formally presented by the CPC on June 4th. In addition to reporting the proposal to the CPC Central Committee for instructions, he requested that the twelve articles proposed by the CPC be forwarded to the Central Government for a reasonable solution. Second, he believed that the statement at the beginning of the proposal, "Based on the opinions expressed by Representative Lin Zuhan in Xi'an," was inconsistent with the facts. He believed that the Xi'an record was "a preliminary opinion jointly created in the end" and that he agreed to "each seek instructions from their respective central committees before making a final decision." Therefore, he still hoped that the Central Government would consider the opinions formally presented by the CPC recently. We immediately replied to Mr. Lin in a letter on June 8th, addressing the two points he clarified: First, the letter submitted by Mr. Lin on June 5th was not forwarded because the differences were too great, as had been stated. Mr. Lin said in the end: "It would be good to keep them with you two for reference," so we only agreed to keep them at the time but still stated that we could not forward them. Second, the content of the Xi'an talks was recorded, modified, and then rewritten by Mr. Lin before being signed. We have already forwarded this to the Central Government, so the Central Government's proposal is based on Mr. Lin's opinions and has accommodated Mr. Lin's opinions as much as possible. We hope that Mr. Lin can fully accept it.

IV

On June 11th, we received another letter from Mr. Lin, who believed that "there are two points that are very difficult to understand" in our letter of June 8th: First, since we have recognized him as the representative of the CPC, we should not fail to report the opinions formally presented by the CPC to the Central Government but only unilaterally require him to accept the Central Government's proposal. How can he make the decision on his own? Second, he admitted that the twelve articles submitted on June 5th were "slightly different" from the opinions negotiated in Xi'an, but the Central Government's proposal also differed from the opinions negotiated in Xi'an. He believed that such differences in the negotiation process were normal for both parties and should not be considered strange. He has now telegraphed the Central Government's proposal to the CPC Central Committee, and we should not refuse to forward the opinions formally presented by the CPC to the Central Government for instructions.

In fact, the two points that Mr. Lin said he could not understand were very clear. Precisely because Mr. Lin is the representative of the CPC, his expressed opinions can of course be taken into account. As for the twelve articles subsequently proposed by the CPC, the content differed greatly from Mr. Lin's opinions, and the CPC did not express its fundamental concept of obeying military and political orders but only made one-sided demands. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand why we solemnly stated at the time that we could not forward them. However, because we hoped that the problem would be resolved one day, we were unwilling to cause misunderstandings, so we still forwarded the twelve articles submitted by Mr. Lin to the Central Government. The Central Government then instructed that "The Central Government had already submitted the proposal to Representative Lin on June 5th to be conveyed to the CPC. All opinions of the CPC that the Central Government can accommodate have been accommodated as much as possible in the proposal. We hope that the CPC will accept it."

On June 15th, we conveyed the Central Government's instructions to Mr. Lin and stated that the basic spirit of this negotiation must be based on the principle of unifying national military and political orders as a prerequisite for improving the current situation and strengthening unity. The content of the twelve articles proposed by the CPC did not mention how to implement the military and political orders of the Central Government and improve measures to reorganize troops. As for the number of troops to be reorganized, we said in Xi'an that the possible number of troops to be reorganized was three armies and eight divisions. Now, the Central Government's proposal has decided on four armies and ten divisions, which is two divisions more than what we said. This shows that the Central Government has accommodated as much as possible.

V

After we replied to Mr. Lin on June 15th, the CPC did not respond to the Central Government's proposal for more than ten days. On July 3rd, Mr. Lin met with us and verbally proposed two points for discussion regarding the Central Government's proposal: First, regarding political issues, he hoped that the Central Government would relax the scope of "democracy"; second, regarding military issues, he hoped to expand the reorganization to five armies and sixteen divisions. At the same time, he said that there was a telegram from Yan'an welcoming us two to Yan'an for negotiations. At that time, we explained that the government was already taking various measures to promote the implementation of democratic politics, such as abolishing the method of compulsory censorship of books and strictly ordering the completion of the establishment of county councils in various provinces in the rear, and that the Central Government was about to announce laws to protect the personal freedom of the people, as well as many other measures regarding democracy that are being planned, which need not be listed. As for the issue of the number of troops to be expanded, the Central Government is implementing a policy of streamlining troops and tightening units as much as possible. It has already accommodated the CPC's demands to the greatest extent. If one compares the number of National Army troops in the early stages of the war of resistance with the current increase in numbers, one can understand the Central Government's difficult position in seeking compromise. Finally, we believed that continuing to talk like this was somewhat like deliberately delaying. It seemed that the Central Government's proposal should be given a comprehensive and accurate response as a basis for concrete discussions, and it was not appropriate to continue to go back and forth with empty words and bargain over prices, which would only increase complications. We stated that if a conclusion could be reached in Chongqing, we could consider visiting Yan'an.

VI

On July 13th, Mr. Lin came to meet again. At that time, he again asked the Central Government to give some "instructions" on the twelve items they had proposed, but he did not mention how to respond to the proposal given to them by the Central Government. At that time, we had already explained most of the issues raised by Mr. Lin in the past and did not need to argue further. We only replied that Mr. Lin's intentions were clear and that we would schedule another meeting to discuss and then dispersed.

VII

On July 23rd, Mr. Lin sent another letter, the content of which was still asking whether we had requested instructions and replies regarding his proposed twelve items and asking us to go to Yan'an.

On July 25th, we met with Mr. Lin again and gave a more detailed explanation of the various items in his proposed twelve items and informed him that the proposal put forward by the Central Government was the Central Government's specific opinion, but the CPC had not responded to it for a long time. We also said that the CPC's attitude was very much like deliberately delaying and unwilling to solve this problem.

### Public Works Bureau Staff Discovers Embezzlement Case Reported in the English-Language "The Times"

According to reports in this city's English-language "The Times" on the 13th and 15th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau recently discovered a major embezzlement case. The contents are translated and recorded as follows:

Among the embezzlement cases in the Public Works Bureau, the fact that attracts the most attention is the illegal felling and sale of trees along Great Western Road and Hongqiao Road. It is also said that trees in municipal parks, such as Zhongshan Park (formerly Zhaofeng Park), have also been secretly felled and sold.

This public welfare facility, which was completed at great expense for the benefit of Shanghai citizens, is now being destroyed. The highest municipal authorities should immediately investigate and punish those responsible.

After obtaining the above information, "The Times" conducted an investigation into the activities of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. It is understood that some employees of the Public Works Bureau, due to insufficient salaries to maintain their livelihoods, are using their positions to collect illegal fees from outside sources. This situation is not unique to the Public Works Bureau, but is also occurring in other bureaus.

Illegal Tree Felling The newspaper further learned that the scale of the embezzlement case in the Public Works Bureau must have been tacitly approved or colluded with by its superiors. It is said that some people in the Municipal Government Secretariat are also involved in this large-scale embezzlement case. Regarding the illegal felling and sale of trees, the Parks Section of the Public Works Bureau is the most suspected. This section originally belonged to the Road Administration Section, but was recently transferred to the Architectural Section.

At that time, the authorities did not explain the reason for the transfer of this section, and it seemed very unreasonable. It is said that the pruning of trees on various roads this winter could yield as much as 8 million yuan in firewood. Furthermore, the trees felled and sold along Hongqiao Road and Great Western Road numbered up to 200, which are estimated to be worth about 1 million yuan in firewood.

It is understood that when the city's first and eighth districts were merged, the municipal government commissioned experienced personnel to take leadership positions in various departments and sections of the Public Works Department. However, 24 of these appointment letters were "switched" by others, resulting in the use of people who were not originally appointed.

Receiving Kickbacks These people have no knowledge of practical technology, which has led to the current state of corruption. It is an open secret that the department adds a 20% kickback when purchasing materials from outside. Anyone who deals with the department knows this. The department purchases approximately 12 million yuan worth of materials each month, so this kickback is very considerable.

Even worse, materials stored in the municipal government warehouse, if purchased by the person in charge of the Public Works Department, are calculated at the original price. For example, the market prices of cement and steel plates have already increased a thousandfold, but the Public Works Bureau can purchase them from the municipal government warehouse at a price of one-thousandth of the market price, and then resell them, making countless profits in a single transaction. Of course, this illegal activity requires the approval of their superiors. A large number of municipal government stockpiles, such as cement, steel plates, and coal, are cleared out under various pretexts. For example, the warehouse in the former eighth district was well-stocked before the merger, but now all important materials, such as coal, automobile parts, cement, steel plates, canvas, and other parts, are all empty.

Under the bureau's budget, the construction and repair costs in the suburban areas originally accounted for a significant portion. Each repair cost requires about 10 million yuan. However, at present, citizens rarely pay attention to the road administration and construction situation in the suburbs, and the municipal government has not sent personnel to inspect it. Therefore, after receiving the repair funds, the department only perfunctorily performs the work, and distributes the remaining funds to private individuals. For example, the contract for the construction fee of Zhongshan Road was 7 million yuan, and the department also supplied 8 million yuan of asphalt. However, the work was not completed according to the plan, and it will still need to be repaired soon.

Fictitious Payroll Furthermore, it is said that the salaries of personnel in various departments and sections of the bureau are paid to hundreds of people who do not actually exist. Repair work costs are extremely difficult to estimate accurately, so it is easy to falsify them. At least 20% of the repair costs of various projects are due to extra increases. The municipal government-approved construction of municipal memorial pavilions is now subject to a 40% increase in the budget by the department, totaling 20 million yuan.

Regarding the obtaining of building permits, regardless of whether there are violations, "tips" must be paid before they can be obtained. Even without obtaining a permit after paying the tip, construction can begin, and the safety of building materials is not considered at all. The "tip" required for each building is approximately between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan.

In order to prevent unlicensed peddlers from setting up stalls in the roads and alleys, investigations were conducted, and approximately 20,000 private vendors were found to exist. However, since the municipal merger, they have not been prohibited. Instead, under the pretext of investigation, they privately collect tips. The fee ranges from several thousand to tens of thousands, depending on the size of each stall.

Extorting Tips Regarding the registration of construction contracts and projects, their qualifications are rarely investigated, and the registration fee is about 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Furthermore, in the name of ensuring industrial safety, the bureau often issues warnings to various factories, hoping to extort tips when the factories request inspections. The fee standard depends on the size of the motor and boiler. Once the tip is paid, safety issues are not taken seriously at all.

The bribes collected by the bureau are split in a 40/60 manner, distributed among upper and lower staff. The bureau's seal supervisor also routinely demands tips of 1,000 to 10,000 yuan from the applicant before printing contracts.

The new municipal authorities have now taken office, and it is said that they will conduct an investigation into this embezzlement case. It is expected that the truth will come to light soon. (Translated from "The Times")

### Director Liu of the Propaganda Department Talks About Policy Guidelines

Mr. Liu Dexuan, the newly appointed Director of the Municipal Propaganda Department, recently announced the following policy guidelines: "I have been appointed to head the Municipal Propaganda Department. I am deeply concerned about the heavy responsibilities and my limited abilities. However, since I have been appointed, I will strive to advance in the area of propaganda based on the established national policy. In my work, I will follow the instructions of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo and gradually promote it. The censorship of comedies and cultural registration will be handled in accordance with laws and regulations, without favoritism or abuse of the law. All colleagues in this department have a fixed living allowance. If there is any bribery between each other, once it is verified, I will request the superiors to investigate and deal with it. In short, the situation in Shanghai is complex and the temptation is great. If we do not invigorate people's hearts, we cannot reverse the decadent trend. I will not consider success or failure, praise or criticism. Fortunately, the city's cultural elders and advanced figures in the newspaper industry are all old friends. I hope they will give me guidance and assistance at any time, for the benefit of both public and private interests."

### Personnel Adjustment in the Municipal Economic Bureau

After Xu Jiang took over as the Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, he made some adjustments to the internal organization.

### Police Officers Solve Cases Quickly The Authorities Award Bonuses

Li Shiyu, the Director of the Judicial Department of the Police Bureau, investigated the "murder due to long-standing resentment over extortion without results" and "strangulation of wife and children" tragic murder cases that occurred in the jurisdiction of the Laoza and Taishan sub-bureaus. The murderer in the former case, Wu Quanhai, and the criminal in the latter case, Li Ziying, were both arrested within 24 hours by the judicial sections of the respective sub-bureaus. This is highly commendable. Therefore, 150,000 yuan was allocated from the crime prevention fund as a bonus to encourage them. The Laoza district blood case was relatively complicated and took time to investigate, so 100,000 yuan was allocated. Director Li (Deputy Director Xian'erlang acting on his behalf) and Yang Xionghua, the chief of the Crime Prevention Section, went to each sub-bureau yesterday to award the bonuses, which were awarded by Deng Zhaojin and Liu Junqing, the directors of the respective judicial sections. A meeting of all staff was immediately convened for instructions.

### Reader Scholarship News The Kuguan Troupe Performs "Autumn Begonia" for Free to Raise Scholarship Funds for Two Newspapers All Proceeds from the Two Charity Performances Are Donated

Speaking of the "Kuguan Troupe", everyone admits that it is the most progressive and strongest troupe in Shanghai, with talented playwrights and actors who look down on everything; speaking of "Autumn Begonia", it is also recognized as the most famous and popular spoken drama on the stage, which was performed continuously for five months in the past and was indeed a rare masterpiece. The Kuguan people have always held the belief that "serving life is our ultimate goal." This shows the progress of their thinking and the philosophy of their lives. In the past year or more, they performed charity performances for our newspaper's scholarship fund for six months in the early stage, and then worked hard for the drama for ten months in the later stage. Now, as the "Paris" lease expires and performances are stopped, they are holding five public performances at the Lyceum Theatre to raise funds for the development of the troupe. This spirit of "self-improvement" is worthy of admiration! Recently, the Kuguan people, because the difference in the scholarship fund of the Shen and Xin newspapers is very large, decided to add two performances after the public performances. All proceeds, except for necessary expenses, will be used to fill the scholarship fund for the two newspapers. Gentlemen, you are enthusiastic about helping students and brave in doing good. The colleagues of the two newspapers express their sincere gratitude. They also stated that they have been performing day and night for more than a year and are exhausted physically and mentally. After the charity performance is over, they will temporarily part with the audience for a considerable period of rest. This time, the two newspapers are grateful for the kindness of the Kuguan people and will of course respectfully accept it. At that time, we will specially select the best seats and issue "honor tickets", divided into two types of 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan. Today, the authorities of the two newspapers will send out special letters to invite enthusiastic people from all walks of life to appreciate the famous drama. Because the deadline is approaching, we hope that you will give your support so that we can gather a sufficient amount to enhance the effect of helping students, benefiting the poor and cultivating talents for the country, which is a great merit!

### Splendid Tea Party at the Municipal Government: Four Allied Dignitaries

Among the Allied guests present yesterday, four were particularly noteworthy. The first was the most senior member of the National Government, who, despite his advanced age, did not hesitate to travel far and wide, embodying kindness and harmony, and serving as a role model for future generations. The second was Mr. Takashima, President of the Central China Revival Company, whose hair was as white as silver, but whose complexion was as rosy as a young man's, demonstrating his mastery of maintaining good health. President Takashima is deeply absorbed in Chinese calligraphy and painting, possesses extensive knowledge, and is an authority in the economic circles of Central China. The third was Colonel Okada, the newly appointed advisor to the Municipal Government. Colonel Okada is extremely familiar with the situation in our country, has friends all over the country, and is known for his intelligence and competence. The fourth was Mr. Inoue, Deputy Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee. Dressed in formal attire, he had an imposing figure. Mr. Inoue is an aristocrat from an Allied nation, yet he condescended to serve our country, not only holding an important position in Mitsui & Co., but also assisting Mr. Sun Zhongli as the Deputy Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee.

Gathering of Five Elders

It was reported that the elders Lan Ting, Li Sihao, Pei Yunqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou gathered in a corner for a pleasant conversation. Elder Li was late to the event due to another appointment. Guests all came forward to greet them, and the newly appointed bureau directors also exchanged cordial greetings, demonstrating that the ancient tradition of respecting the elderly remains unchanged.

Tuition Issues

In one corner of the venue, Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Zhao Jinqing, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, Mr. Chen Binhe, all members of the Municipal Advisory Committee, and Mr. Dai Yingfu, Director of the Education Bureau, were seen engaged in earnest conversation, focusing on the issue of school fees. It is said that the Municipal Advisory Committee will hold a meeting this Friday to further discuss the matter with the Municipal Education Authority, benefiting students and rescuing those who have dropped out of school, which are two important objectives.

Control Groups

Officials from various control committees attended the event. Mr. Sun Zhongli, Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, displayed a dignified demeanor, clearly a person willing to take responsibility, which explains why his committee has achieved outstanding results among the control organizations, which is no coincidence. Mr. Luo Nezhai, Chairman of the Daily Necessities Control Committee, is talented, competent, and insightful, and is a prominent figure among the rising stars. Mr. Dai Yunlu, a member of the Rice Control Committee, arrived before the former chairman, Mr. Chen Guoquan. Mr. Dai was modestly dressed and extremely amiable. Mr. Tong Lüqing, a member of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, and Mr. Kurimoto, Deputy Chairman of the Oil and Grain Control Committee, also attended yesterday's event. Mr. Kurimoto has been living in China for over thirty years, is fluent in Chinese, and is a most enthusiastic friend of China.

Within the Press Circle

Many figures from the press attended the event. Mr. Jin Xiongbo, President of the Ping Bao newspaper, had temples as white as flowers, yet was full of energy. Mr. Chen Riping, Deputy President of the Xinwen Bao newspaper, was elegant and refined. Mr. Huang Jingzhai, President of the Guomin Xinwen newspaper, possessed the spirit of a young and vigorous person. Mr. Lu Feng of the Xin Zhongguo Bao newspaper was enthusiastic. Mr. Hidaka, the editor-in-chief of the Dalu Xinbao newspaper, and reporter Takemoto were actively moving around, engaging with others.

Two Rare Guests

Two rare guests attended yesterday's tea party. One was Mr. Cen Xing Shu, whose demeanor exuded the composure of a great statesman. He studied at Gakushuin University in Japan, an institution where only Allied nobles could study, and commoners were not allowed to enter. Mr. Cen and his brother were granted special permission to enter the university by Prince Konoe Atsumaro (father of Prince Konoe Fumimaro), becoming the only foreign students in the university. Mr. Cen is familiar with the Allied national conditions and is a true expert on Japan. The other was Mr. Zhou Zuomin, an authority in the financial circles, who arrived at the event very early. Both rarely attend various gatherings, making them particularly rare guests at this tea party.

The Hosts' Side

Mayor Zhou Qun was slightly late due to official duties. He, along with Secretary-General Luo and the newly appointed Director of the Economic Bureau Xu Jiang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Xu Jidun, Director of the Material Distribution Office Liu Xingchen, and Director of the Propaganda Office Liu Dexuan, greeted guests at the entrance, shaking hands as a gesture of courtesy. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo were dressed in black national attire, displaying a solemn demeanor and keen eyes, revealing both determination and enthusiasm, suggesting a firm resolve to reform municipal affairs in the future. The new bureau and office directors exchanged business cards with the guests, remaining extremely busy. Li Shiyu, the Director of the Judicial Affairs Department of the Police Bureau, who also newly serves as the Chief Secretary of the Municipal Government, both old and new, was a noteworthy figure on the host side. (Cheng Guan)

Our City's Transferred Officials Departed for Anhui Yesterday

Former Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Ye Xuesong, Director of the Propaganda Office Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Shanghai News Inspection Office Liu Shike, and others who have been transferred to work in Anhui Province, along with a group of people, departed from Shanghai by train at 8:30 AM yesterday (the 17th), passing through Nanjing and heading to Bengbu. Many people from various circles went to the station to see them off.

Collection Methods for Municipal School Fees

The collection methods for tuition fees for municipal primary and secondary schools in this city have been announced by the authorities. The fee collection dates for each school have also been specified: from January 20th to January 31st for schools in the old city, and from January 15th to January 20th for schools in the former 182 districts.

Soaring Prices of Daily Necessities: Authorities are Thoroughly Investigating

Recently, the prices of various daily necessities in this city have risen sharply, significantly impacting people's livelihood. The reason for this is nothing more than manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. Relevant authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation, and those found to be manipulating the prices of daily necessities will be severely punished.

Furthermore, a dispatch reports that the arrival of firewood is plentiful, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 loads per day. However, due to the recent unusual tightness of credit and the imminent start of prioritized electricity distribution for factories by the authorities, the purchasing power is extremely weak, and sales are sluggish. According to industry insiders, the general price of firewood is unlikely to rise during the Lunar New Year.

Sports

### Recent Situation of the First Division Football League: Portuguese Merchants in the Lead, Lianyi and Overseas Chinese Federation Have High Hopes

The schedule of this year's First Division Football League is already over half completed. Yesterday, the Football Federation announced the recent situation of the group as follows:

According to the above situation, Portuguese Merchants have won nine games, making them the only team to maintain a perfect record. This is because the Overseas Chinese Federation lost to Lianyi, and Lianyi shook hands and drew with German Merchants last week. Donghua has lost twice and their future looks bleak. Portuguese Merchants have the highest chance of winning the championship. The Overseas Chinese Federation and Lianyi still have some hope. There are four games left, and the outcome of this year's title will depend on Lianyi vs. Portuguese Merchants, Donghua vs. Overseas Chinese Federation, Lianyi vs. Donghua, and Portuguese Merchants vs. Overseas Chinese Federation. The battle between Portuguese and Overseas Chinese teams is scheduled for 10:00 AM this Sunday at Yiyuan. This major battle is worth paying attention to. If Portuguese Merchants win, only Lianyi remains as a barrier. Otherwise, the Overseas Chinese Federation and the Portuguese team will be neck and neck, which will create a different situation. The bottom two teams will definitely be one of the Three Provinces or Russian Sports, because both teams have lost every game and have not yet won.

### Basketball League: Hualian Defeats Renyu, Yikang Wins Over Lianyi in Women's Group

In the second act of the Shanghai Basketball League last night, Hualian defeated Renyu 36-24. In the first half, Renyu led all the way before Hualian tied the score at 17 each. Renyu fought fiercely last night. Hualian did not use its formal lineup in the first half, which created this tense situation. Jingsheng beat Huaqiang 34-19. The first half ended with a score of 13-11. Huaqiang is a group of veteran players from the Paramount, including the Gu brothers, Lu Dazhen, Qian Jingyong, and others. Unfortunately, the generals are old, and their hearts and strength are mismatched. In the women's group, Lianyi and Yikang performed equally and were indistinguishable. Lianyi led by one point with a score of 12-11 in the first half. In the end, Yikang defeated Lianyi 28-23.

News released at 6:50 PM yesterday.

### The Breakdown of the Chongqing-Communist Negotiations (Continued from Page 2)

During this period, we continued to study this issue and considered having another face-to-face meeting after the last verbal reply. We explained that we were preparing to put the opinions from the last verbal reply into a written reply, and at the same time, we waited for your definite reply to the Central Government's proposed plan. Only then would we consider further negotiations and the question of whether to go to Yan'an. After this conversation, on August 10th, we wrote a letter based on our previous intention and sent it to Mr. Lin. The main points are as follows:

"More than three months have passed since we met in Xi'an on May 3rd, and more than two months have passed since we handed over the Central Government's proposed plan on June 5th. Until now, we have not received a definite reply from the Chinese Communist Party, which is beyond our initial expectations. The content of this Government's proposed plan not only accommodates almost all of the requests made by Commander Lin Biao last year, but also accommodates most of the opinions expressed by you in Xi'an. Since the Chinese Communist Party has expressed its support for unity and unification, please urge it to accept it.

Regarding the Chinese Communist Party's twelve points of opinion, the first to third points have been clearly stated in the Government's proposed plan: To implement the program of national reconstruction during the War of Resistance against Japan, which is accepted by the Chinese Communist Party and all parties; to implement constitutional government within one year after the end of the War of Resistance against Japan, giving all parties equal status. The meaning is clear and specific. It would only increase disputes in the future to promote some abstract statements that have no bounds beyond the declaration. The current policy established by the Central Government is to gradually expand the scope of people's freedom and promote local autonomy according to the progress of the War of Resistance against Japan, the approaching victory, and social stability. On the one hand, the Government hopes that the Chinese Communist Party will accept the proposed plan and submit opinions on implementing the program of national reconstruction at any time, and actively participate in the work of the Political Participation Council and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association, so that the views of each other will gradually converge, and the true unity and unification of the country can be realized. This is the fundamental meaning of a political solution.

Four of the twelve points concern the army's organization, number, stationing, military pay, and weapons: The Eighteenth Group Army was originally organized into three divisions, and now it is allowed to expand into four armies and ten divisions. During the period when the Government is implementing a policy of streamlining troops and reducing units, this is a great effort to seek common ground while reserving differences. Regarding the army's stationing, the proposed plan instructs the principle of concentrated use on the one hand, and stipulates the training of the command system before concentration on the other hand, which is thoughtful in every aspect. As for military pay, it has been stipulated that the National Army will enjoy the same treatment. As for weapons, the Government will make a reasonable distribution at any time according to the needs and tasks it undertakes.

One of the twelve points requires the Government to recognize the 'Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region' and the 'Elected Governments in the Anti-Japanese Base Areas in North China'. Regarding the problem of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Government's proposed plan has put forward a very lenient approach. As for the administrative institutions in any other region, they should be taken over by the provincial governments under their jurisdiction after the proposal, so as to avoid disputes.

There are some other requirements that are either inconsistent with the facts or inconsistent with reason. We have already explained them to you verbally, so I will not repeat them here."

Nine

Later, we received a letter from Mr. Lin Zuhan on August 30th, replying to our letter of August 10th on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. The gist is:

"1. It is considered that our letter of August 10th contains the meaning of blaming the Chinese Communist Party for unreasonably delaying, which is a completely unrealistic and erroneous view. Because the Government's proposed plan is too far apart in principle from the Chinese Communist Party's written twelve points and verbal eight points, and cited (1) the proposed plan does not mention a word about implementing democratic politics, recognizing the legality of all parties, and releasing political prisoners; (2) the number and organization of the army, the abolition of troops outside the organization, and the concentrated use of troops; (3) it only requires the border area government to implement central laws and regulations, but does not mention the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, and does not recognize the current facilities and laws; (4) the abolition of the democratic governments elected by the people in the anti-Japanese base areas, etc., believing that they are too far apart. 2. It is believed that the obstacle to the fundamental solution of the problem is due to the great distance between the views of the Central Government and the Chinese Communist Party and the 'broad masses of the people' throughout the country, because the Government has always been unwilling to immediately implement the Three Principles of the People and the democratic system. 3. It is hoped that the Central Government should put the interests of the entire country and nation first in solving the national political problems and the problems of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and should proceed from the point of view of being conducive to national unity and resistance to Japan and promoting democracy. The latter repeated the 'political issues', 'army issues', and 'border areas' and 'base areas in Central China, South China, and North China' that had already been listed above, reaffirming the attitude held in the first item, while expanding many scopes. 4. It is stated that the Chinese Communist Party has always faithfully implemented the four promises, faithfully implemented the Three Principles of the People, and adhered to the policy of democratic unity and political solution, proving that the Chinese Communist Party does not want to break down the negotiations."

After reading Mr. Lin's letter of August 30th, we felt surprised. To what extent is the truthfulness of the various situations mentioned in it? I think you all will have a very accurate judgment, so there is no need to add more explanation. We were ordered to negotiate specific issues. From going to Xi'an to now, we have talked about the issue more and more remotely. The reasons for this remoteness can be seen from the above documents. We cannot but feel sorry for it. However, we do not despair. In order to enable the Central Government to clearly understand our meaning, we then wrote a reply, the gist is:

"It is stated that the Central Government ordered us to negotiate with you in seeking the true unification of the whole country, that is, to seek the Chinese Communist Party to earnestly fulfill its four promises (see footnote) and earnestly support the unification of national power. If, as you said, the Chinese Communist Party has always fulfilled the four promises, then why have there been so many facts of infringement by the Chinese Communist Party against the National Army in various places? Why does the Central Government still have to order us to negotiate with you on issues such as obeying military orders and political orders today?

The Central Government ordered us to negotiate with you on unification, originally to establish a strong foundation for the future constitutional government and the implementation of the entire Three Principles of the People. Regarding democratic politics and party issues, the Central Government's proposed plan already has relevant clauses, and our letter of August 10th contains a detailed statement, so why say 'not a word'? The letter said that the Chinese Communist Party thoroughly implemented the Three Principles of the People in the border areas and various anti-Japanese base areas, and that in all areas of the Chinese Communist Party, all people and groups enjoy all freedoms and rights, but there are many facts that force us to deny. That is, with democracy and freedom, the legacy of the national father, we want to use the separation of powers to be the right track of democracy and the guarantee of the people's freedom. Is there any independent fact of judicial power and supervisory power in the Chinese Communist Party's region? Do the people in the Chinese Communist Party's region, even the Communist Party members, have the guarantee of freedom of speech and freedom of the body? Our previous letter hoped that we would not raise abstract demands without limit on issues such as democracy and freedom, and asked the Chinese Communist Party to discuss the solutions to various issues with the Central Government, the Political Participation Council, and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association at any time. Not only is it appropriate, it is also necessary.

It is explained that the various issues mentioned in the letter have already been answered one by one. One point is that the Central Government's proposed plan has already 'largely accommodated' the opinions put forward by Commander Lin Biao last year and by you in Xi'an recently. This is absolutely true, but you still emphasize that 'the distance is too far'. However, the reason why the distance is far is nothing more than because the Chinese Communist Party's demands are increasing with time. What you put forward in Xi'an is more than what Commander Lin put forward last year. The twelve points put forward by the Chinese Communist Party are more than what you put forward in Xi'an. This time, the letter added the so-called 'verbal eight points' to the twelve points. Since the requirements are increasing with time, the distance cannot but be far. For example, the problem of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the so-called 'other base areas'. What Commander Lin put forward was 'the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region will be changed to an administrative region according to the original area, and other regions will be reorganized and implement central laws and regulations'. The documents you signed in Xi'an did not include 'other base areas'. In the twelve points put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, it is required to recognize the 'Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the elected governments in the anti-Japanese base areas in North China'. Your letter further said that 'the recognition of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government and the elected governments in the base areas in North China, Central China, and South China'. Under this situation of gradual changes and gradual expansion of demands, if negotiations cannot be approached, who is responsible for it?

It is explained that the Central Government and the Kuomintang will never put the interests of one party and one faction above the interests of the country and the nation. It is hoped that the Chinese Communist Party can also abide by this purpose.

Finally, it is said that as long as it is beneficial to the facts, we are happy to go to Yan'an. Now we ask whether the Chinese Communist Party can send a responsible representative to Chongqing to solve the problem, and who will be sent back to Chongqing with us as a representative.

Footnote: The four promises made by the Chinese Communist Party in September 1937

(1) The Three Principles of the People of Mr. Sun Yat-sen are necessary for China today, and our party is willing to strive for its thorough realization.

(2) Abolish all policies of overthrowing the Kuomintang regime and the Red bandit movement, and stop the policy of confiscating landlords' land by force.

(3) Abolish the current Soviet government, implement civil rights politics, in order to unify the national regime.

(4) Abolish the name and number of the Red Army, reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, and be under the command of the Military Commission of the National Government."

The important contents of the negotiation process and relevant documents are reported above one by one. Today, the problem of the Chinese Communist Party, for the sake of national unity and striving for victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and the success of national construction, the people of the whole country are eagerly hoping for a reasonable solution as soon as possible. We have been ordered by the Central Government and shoulder the task of negotiation, and of course, we also hold the greatest enthusiasm and hope. What the Central Government requires is only the unity of revolution and political orders. Only in this way can there be true unity, can the military and civilians of the whole country be united, and only in this way can it be conducive to the War of Resistance against Japan and national construction. Under this major premise, the Central Government has spared no effort to seek common ground while reserving differences based on the harm of the matter, and has tried its best to accommodate the opinions of the Chinese Communist Party. This can be clearly seen in the Central Government's proposed plan. As for the issue of democracy and freedom, the Central Government has always focused on seeking truth from facts, doing it in reality, and not wanting to engage in empty talk. Under the principles of the program of national reconstruction during the War of Resistance against Japan, such as opening up speech, guaranteeing the freedom of the people, and expanding the powers of the people's organs, are all being carried out step by step, and we will continue to devote ourselves to this policy in the future, so that we can smoothly promote constitutional government after the end of the war. At that time, the problem of the party can naturally be solved. Now, although the Chinese Communist Party has not yet accepted the Central Government's proposed plan and expressed its intention to abide by the national military and political orders, we hope that the Chinese Communist Party will adhere to the true meaning of unity and resistance to Japan, and fulfill its promises with facts and actions to realize the true unification of the country. The Central Government will never change the policy of political solution, and sincerely expects the Chinese Communist Party to revise its views and solve this problem as soon as possible to comfort the expectations of the compatriots throughout the country. Because we know the urgency of you gentlemen on this issue, we have come to report on the negotiation process on this issue, and solemnly explain the attitude and wishes of the Central Government. We also ask you gentlemen for your advice.

### IV. The Twelve Articles Proposed by the Communist Party, June 4th, Year Thirty-Three

Honorable Mr. Bai Xueting: The opinions of our party's Central Committee regarding the resolution of urgent issues, consisting of twenty articles, were submitted to you and Mr. [Another name] on the 22nd of last month but were not accepted. I immediately reported to Yan'an. Now I have received a reply from our party's Central Committee. In order to respect your opinions and facilitate negotiations, and to show our sincerity in resolving the issues, the twenty articles have been changed to twelve, and the minor issues have been changed to a memorandum. I am now specially copying a copy and request that it be forwarded to your party's president and your party's Central Committee for reply. Respectfully,

Lin Zuhan, June 4th, Year Thirty-Three.

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party presents to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang its opinions on resolving several urgent issues:

The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the War of Resistance has lasted for seven years. The Communist Party's loyalty to the country, its bravery in combat, its implementation of the Three Principles of the People, its fulfillment of the Four Pledges, and its support for the National Government and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction have been consistent and obvious to all. However, the current situation in the War of Resistance is extremely serious. The Japanese army continues to advance, and the domestic political situation and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not yet moved onto a track suitable for the needs of the War of Resistance. In order to overcome the current difficulties and earnestly prepare for the counter-offensive, the Communist Party believes that the only way is to implement democracy and strengthen unity. For this purpose, the Communist Party hopes that the government will resolve the following extremely urgent issues, including those related to national politics and those related to outstanding issues between the two parties. They are listed frankly as follows:

A. Regarding National Politics

1.  Please the government implement democratic politics and guarantee freedom of discussion, publication, assembly, association, and personal freedom.

2.  Please the government lift the ban on parties, recognize the legal status of the Communist Party and all anti-Japanese parties, and release patriotic political prisoners.

3.  Please the government implement people's local autonomy that is worthy of the name.

B. Regarding Outstanding Issues between the Two Parties

1.  Based on the needs of the War of Resistance, the achievements of the War of Resistance, and the actual number of existing troops, the government should organize the Communist Party's troops into sixteen armies and forty-seven divisions, with 10,000 men per division. To compromise, at least give the designations of five armies and sixteen divisions at present.

2.  Please the government recognize the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the elected anti-Japanese governments in the North China base areas as legal local governments, and recognize their military facilities needed for the War of Resistance.

3.  The defense areas of the Communist Party's troops shall maintain the status quo during the War of Resistance, and shall be negotiated separately after the end of the War of Resistance.

4.  Please the government provide sufficient material assistance to the Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Since 1940, the government has not provided a single bullet or grain of rice. Please change this situation quickly.

5.  Weapons, ammunition, and medicines provided by the Allied countries to China should be fairly distributed among the Chinese armies by the government. The Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army should receive their due share.

6.  Please the government order military and political agencies to lift the military and economic blockade of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various base areas.

7.  Please the government order military agencies to cease military attacks on the New Fourth Army and the Guangdong guerrillas in Central China.

8.  Please the government order party and government agencies to release arrested personnel in various places. For example: Ye Ting and other officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army captured during the Southern Anhui Incident, Liao Chengzhi and Zhang Wenbin in Guangdong, Xu Jie, Xu Mengqiu, Mao Zemin, Yang Zhihua, Pan Qi and others in Xinjiang, Luo Shiwen, Che Zhuxian, Li Chun, Zhang Shaoming and others in Sichuan, He Bin and others in Hubei, Liu Ying in Zhejiang, and Xuan Xiafu, Shi Zuoxiang, Li Yuhai, Chen Yuanying, Zhao Xiang and others in Xi'an. These people are all patriotic people and should be restored to freedom.

9.  Please the government allow the Communist Party to establish party offices and newspapers throughout the country. The Communist Party also allows the Kuomintang to establish party offices and newspapers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various democratic border regions.

The above articles only cite the main points. The Communist Party sincerely hopes that our National Government will resolve them reasonably and as quickly as possible. Because the Japanese army is launching a large-scale offensive that threatens the War of Resistance front, if our Kuomintang and Communist Party not only continue to cooperate, but also refresh the national politics and improve the party relations, it will not only be of great benefit to the current situation, but also cast a solid dawn on next year's large-scale counter-offensive with the Allied countries. I hope our government will benefit from it. Lin Zuhan, representative of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. June 4th, Year Thirty-Three of the Republic of China.

V. Reply from Wang Shijie and Zhang Zhizhong to the Communist Party's Twelve Articles, August 10th, Year Thirty-Three

Respected Mr. Boqu: It has been more than three months since we met with you in Xi'an on May 3rd and negotiated back and forth. It has been more than two months since we submitted the Central Government's proposed plan to you on June 5th, but we have not yet received a concrete response from the Communist Party. This situation is beyond our initial expectations. Before the government put forward the proposed plan, it specially ordered us to go to Xi'an to meet with you for as long as two weeks in order to fully listen to the opinions of the Communist Party. The intention was extremely prudent. The content of the government's proposed plan not only accommodated almost all the requests made by the Communist Party representative Master Lin Biao last year, but also largely accommodated the opinions you recently expressed in Xi'an. All these facts can be clearly understood by simply comparing and analyzing the relevant documents. We believe that political resolution has been expressed as agreed to by the Communist Party, and unity and unification have also been declared as supported by the Communist Party. Today, we cannot but earnestly request you to thoroughly present to the Communist Party leaders and urge them to accept the government's proposed plan and quickly reply to us. As for the twelve articles of opinions submitted by you on June 5th, we had already sent the government's instructions and our feelings to you in writing on June 15th. Now, because you have repeatedly urged us, we will provide a more detailed reply and explain the government's intentions in more detail to you:

1.  The first, second, and third articles of the twelve articles involve the implementation of democratic politics, guaranteeing freedom, recognizing the legal status of the Communist Party, and local autonomy. Regarding these issues, the government's proposed plan has already clearly stated two points: that during the War of Resistance, we will implement the Guiding Principles of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction that have been accepted by the Communist Party and all parties, and that within one year after the end of the War of Resistance, we will implement constitutional governance and give all parties equal status. This statement is clearer and more specific. If the Communist Party wants to put forward some abstract sentences with no boundaries, such as "implement democratic politics" and "guarantee freedom," in addition to this statement, what benefit will it ultimately have for the facts? It will only increase disputes in the future. Because the "democratic politics" and other things that the Communist Party believed in in the past or today are not necessarily the same as what Kuomintang members and even general democrats believe in. Now, there are two things I want to tell you: (1) The established policy of the Central Government is to gradually expand the scope of people's freedom and promote local autonomy according to the progress of the War of Resistance, the approach of victory, and the stability of society. (2) The government hopes that after accepting the proposed plan, the Communist Party will put forward opinions on the implementation of the Guiding Principles of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction at any time and actively participate in the work of the Political Participation Council and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association. If we can do this, our views will gradually converge, and the true unification and unity of the country can be realized. The fundamental meaning of political resolution lies in this.

2.  The four articles of the twelve articles involve the number of troops, the location of the troops, the military salaries, and the military equipment. The original approved establishment of the Eighteenth Group Army was 45,000 people. The government's proposed plan allows the organization of four armies and ten divisions, which is indeed a lenient approval. Because it is originally unacceptable for commanding officers to expand the army on their own, and the government is implementing a policy of streamlining troops. During this period, it is only the Eighteenth Group Army that is allowed to expand into four armies and ten divisions, which is the ultimate compromise. Regarding the location of the troops, the government has also considered it again. The proposed plan indicates the principle of concentrated use on the one hand and stipulates that they should be reorganized and commanded by the commander of the war zone where they are located before the concentration. The principle and the facts have been taken into account. If, as proposed by the Communist Party, the defense areas of the troops are maintained throughout the entire War of Resistance, how can the Central Government plan a counter-offensive or direct combat? As for military salaries, the proposed plan has already allowed the Eighteenth Group Army to enjoy the same treatment as the general National Army. The supply of military equipment will be fairly and reasonably distributed by the government at any time according to the needs of the counter-offensive and the tasks undertaken by each army.

3.  One of the twelve articles of opinions lists a request for the government to recognize the "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" and the "elected governments of the North China base areas." The government is willing to consider the issue of the Shaanbei Border Region and has put forward a very generous solution in the proposed plan to accommodate the opinions of the Communist Party. As for the administrative agencies in any other region, they should be taken over by the governments of the provinces concerned in accordance with the instructions of the proposed plan in order to avoid differences and prevent abuses.

4.  Some of the twelve articles of opinions are inconsistent with the facts (such as setting certain conditions on the Central Government's reporting in Shaanbei, etc.). We have explained them to you orally and will not repeat them here. As for the two requests in the twelve articles of opinions regarding the lifting of the "military blockade" of Shaanbei and the release of some criminals, we have orally stated to you that we will consider them after the current negotiations have achieved concrete results.

In summary, the government has accommodated the opinions of the Communist Party to the greatest possible extent. As for the government's fundamental wishes, they lie in the thoroughness and unity of military and political orders. When the Communist Party put forward the twelve articles of opinions, it did not include the subordination to the Central Government's military and political orders as an item in the clauses. Even the introduction of the document did not provide a clear and clear expression of the Communist Party's future attitude towards this fundamental issue. We did not dare to forward it at the time, mostly because of this. Later, because you stated orally that the Communist Party had no problem with obeying military and political orders, we dared to forward your oral statement and the twelve articles of opinions to the government together. This is also what we want to solemnly state as an aside. This is a special notice. I hope you will consider it and wish you all the best. Respectfully, Wang Shijie and Zhang Zhizhong, August 10th, Year Thirty-Three.

VI. Lin Zuhan's Reply, August 30th, Year Thirty-Three

Respected Mr. Xueting and Wenbai: After receiving your letter of August 10th, which replied to our party's twelve articles of opinions, I immediately telegraphed it to Yan'an. There were many errors in the telegraph codes sent back and forth, and it took some time to correct them. Now, I am conveying the opinions that our party's Central Committee ordered me to reply to. Please forward them to Chairman Chiang and your party's Central Committee again.

(1) Your letter states that the government's proposed plan has been given to the Communist Party for more than two months, but "no concrete reply has been obtained from the Communist Party," which is "beyond your expectations," and that this proposed plan has been able to "largely accommodate" the opinions of the Communist Party, which seems to contain the meaning of blaming our side for unreasonable delays. It should be stated that this is completely inconsistent with the facts and a wrong view. Because I have stated in several talks that the government's proposed plan is too far apart in principle from the twelve written articles and eight oral articles proposed by our party and cannot be accepted. For example, in the government's proposed plan: (1) It does not mention a word about the implementation of democratic politics, the recognition of the legality of various parties, the release of patriotic political prisoners, and the release of arrested personnel such as Ye Ting, which we urgently request to be resolved. (2) It only recognizes the number of troops to be organized as four armies and ten divisions, and regardless of the needs and the war environment in the guerrilla areas behind enemy lines, it wants to "cancel within a time limit" the hundreds of thousands of troops who are fighting the war outside the ten divisions, and wants to "concentrate the use" of the ten divisions. (3) It only requires the border region government to implement the laws and decrees of the Kuomintang Central Government, and does not mention the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, and does not recognize the various democratic facilities and democratic laws that have been implemented and have achieved great success as needed for the War of Resistance. (4) It requires the abolition of all democratic governments elected by the people in all base areas. Because the distance between the opinions of the two parties is so different, our party's Central Committee is still unwilling to stop or break down the negotiations, and has ordered me to invite you to Yan'an to discuss changes, and to report the negotiations to find a way to continue the negotiations, so that the problems can be finally solved under the principles that are conducive to the War of Resistance and unity, and conducive to the promotion of democracy. You have already stated that you are asking for instructions on the trip to Yan'an, and I hope it can be realized as soon as possible.

(2) The negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on national political issues and the relationship between the two parties did not start with this negotiation between me and you. Since the peaceful settlement of the Xi'an Incident, the Communist Party has been constantly suggesting to the Kuomintang that only by immediately implementing democracy and implementing the revolutionary Three Principles of the People put forward by Mr. Sun Yat-sen at the First National Congress of the Kuomintang can the strength of unity and resistance be enhanced. Only by following the democratic path can the Kuomintang-Communist relationship and all other domestic political issues be resolved fairly and reasonably. We support unity, and we support unity based on democracy. We support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the National Government, and we ask him to resolutely resist the war and implement the Three Principles of the People. This is not only the request of the Communist Party, but also the request of 99% of the people of the country. In order to seek the Kuomintang Central Government to accept the suggestions of our party and the requests of the vast majority of people across the country, the Communist Party put forward a guarantee to implement the Four Pledges in its declaration on September 22, 1937. Over the past eight years, we have completely implemented these four pledges and have adhered to them to this day. There are sufficient facts to prove this. In his speech at the memorial meeting for the 19th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Yan'an on March 12 this year, our party comrade Zhou Enlai has talked about this in detail and can be referred to. Over the past eight years, the Central Committee of our party has also constantly sent me and comrades Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Lin Biao to patiently request the Kuomintang Central Government to resolve national political issues and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Comrades Zhou and Dong have been stationed in Chongqing for several years, but they have never achieved results. Where is the obstacle to the fundamental solution of the problem? It must be pointed out that it is because the views of the Kuomintang Central Government and our views and the views of the vast majority of people across the country have a great distance. The government officials in charge have always been unwilling to immediately implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the democratic system that can unite all parties and all levels of combat power across the country. This is the real reason why the current negotiations are so far apart.

(3) We hope that the Kuomintang Central Government will put the interests of the entire country and nation first in resolving national government issues and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and not put the private interests of one party, one faction, and one person first. We should start from the viewpoint of being conducive to national unity and resistance, and conducive to promoting democracy, and not from the policy of maintaining the rule of one party, so that the negotiations between the two sides can be easily approached, and all issues can be resolved fairly and reasonably. However, the government's proposed plan and your letter of August 10th unfortunately do not meet this expectation. For example, (1) regarding the issue of the national political system, the three requirements we put forward, (1) Please the government implement democratic politics and guarantee the people's freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and personal freedom, (2) Recognize the legal status of the Central Government and various patriotic parties, and release patriotic political prisoners, (3) Implement local autonomy that is worthy of the name, are precisely a reflection of the most urgent demands of the people across the country today, and are precisely the measures that must be implemented immediately to unite the forces of the country and earnestly prepare for the counter-offensive. If this can be done, it will not only benefit the entire country and nation, but also benefit the Kuomintang. However, your letter still insists on the "established policy of the Central Government," which is to implement constitutional governance and democracy only after the War of Resistance, and criticizes the democratic requirements we put forward as "abstract sentences with no boundaries," believing that they are of no benefit to the facts and "only increase disputes in the future." But according to our experience, in our difficult and arduous environment, the people can still conduct universal elections, discuss state affairs, elect democratic governments, and implement local autonomy. There is no reason why the great rear cannot implement democratic politics. Therefore, all problems depend on whether the Kuomintang has the determination and sincerity to implement democratic politics. If it does, it should implement constitutional governance immediately during the War of Resistance, rather than postpone it until after the War of Resistance. (2) Regarding the organization, defense area, salary and equipment of the 477,000 regular troops led by the Communist Party, if we look at the past combat performance of this army and the needs of preparing for the counter-offensive today, it has persisted and developed three major battlefields (North China, Central China, South China) in the extraordinarily difficult combat environment over the past eight years, established many strong combat base areas, liberated more than 88 million people, organized more than 2.2 million militias, and became the vanguard of the general counter-offensive in the future. In order to prepare for the needs of the counter-offensive, the government should reward him, equip him, and strengthen him. First of all, he should be fully recognized, which is more reasonable. In our proposal, we requested the government to "organize into sixteen armies and forty-seven divisions, and at least give the designations of five countries and sixteen divisions at present," in order to make the negotiations easier to approach. Regarding the defense area, maintaining the status quo during the war, and requesting a fair and reasonable distribution of Allied aid to China, etc., are all suitable for combat needs and are not objectionable. However, the government's proposed plan's "cancellation within a time limit" and "concentrated use within a time limit" methods failed to take into account the needs of combat and the environment of guerrilla warfare. Your letter of August 10th emphasizes opposition to the "independent expansion of troops" by the commanding officers and opposition to maintaining the status quo of the defense area of the troops, and accuses us of not following the unity of military orders. However, you have just overlooked a truth that ordinary people understand, which is that today our China is in the War of Resistance. If we oppose the development of people's combat forces, or attempt to weaken or destroy this combat force, and want to make the people's combat forces leave the area, all of this will objectively become favorable to the enemy. (3) Today, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government and the elected governments in various base areas in North China, Central China, and South China are fully implementing the revolutionary Three Principles of the People. Persisting in the War of Resistance is implementing nationalism. The War of Resistance regime is completely democratic in nature. In our various anti-Japanese base areas... all people and anti-Japanese groups enjoy all freedoms and rights, and exercise direct democracy, and organize local governments with a three-thirds system. We also implement policies such as labor mutual assistance production, frugality, disaster relief, land reclamation, rent reduction, interest reduction, streamlining troops and simplifying administration, popularizing education, supporting the government and loving the people, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the anti-Japanese war, reducing the burden on the people, and improving the lives of workers and peasants, which are all in line with the principles of people's livelihood. Because we thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People in the border areas and various combat base areas, we can unite all the people, overcome all difficulties, persist in the War of Resistance for a long time, and have the strength to counter-attack. Such a democratic government should be recognized as a legal local government, and should be given the right to local autonomy. The various democratic facilities and democratic laws of this kind of government that have been implemented and have been very successful should be rewarded and promoted, and promoted throughout the country. This is the attitude that the Central Government of the Kuomintang, which truly adheres to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People, should take. However, the government's proposed plan and your letter of August 10th only seek to implement the laws and decrees of the Kuomintang Central Government in the border region government, and require the abolition of the elected governments and various democratic facilities that are beneficial to combat in various base areas, which is also unfavorable to the needs of combat today.

(4) In short, according to the current situation, to win the final victory, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must unite, and the problems existing between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must be resolved as soon as possible. This solution can only be achieved by the Kuomintang officials in charge immediately implementing democratic politics and resolving the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party fairly and reasonably from the democratic path. Only in this way can we enhance the national unity and combat power, can everything be on the right track, can we stop the current enemy offensive, cooperate with the future comprehensive counter-offensive, and can we establish domestic peace and cooperation, and international peace and cooperation after the war. We communists hope with great enthusiasm that the Kuomintang officials in charge will quickly change their old government on the basis of democracy and unity, so as to open up the current political deadlock and complete the sacred cause jointly expected by the Allied countries. We here have absolutely no intention of taking advantage of the Kuomintang's unfavorable situation to put forward any excessive demands, and even more so, we have no intention of taking advantage of the Kuomintang's difficult situation to delay and unwilling to solve the problem. (Some ignorant people are spreading such rumors) All the propositions are for the purpose of winning the victory of the entire nation in the War of Resistance, which must be realized. We are loving and helping the Kuomintang to progress, rather than sitting idly by and watching the Kuomintang's difficulties. Genggeng's loyal words will be appreciated by the Kuomintang's enlightened people. I hope you will forward the above opinions to Chairman Chiang and your party's Central Committee again. Time is running out, I hope you will make a decision soon. We communists have always faithfully implemented the Four Pledges, faithfully implemented the Three Principles of the People, adhered to the policy of democratic unity and political resolution, and looked forward to the reply from the Central Government of the Kuomintang. The invitation to you to go to Yan'an to continue negotiations, which was proposed by our party's Central Committee, not only expresses our party's sincerity in not wanting to break down the negotiations, but also wants the important responsible personnel of the Kuomintang Central Government to personally go to the border area to see how faithfully we are implementing the Four Pledges and thoroughly implementing the Three Principles of the People. The various constructions of our border areas and various base areas can be used as a reference for the implementation of democracy throughout the country. I think this will make it easier for the negotiations between the two sides to be resolved. I don't know if you have agreed with the government and your party's Central Committee on this matter? I hope to reply soon, and I pay tribute to Xunqi.

Your brother Lin Zuhan, August 30th (to be continued)
