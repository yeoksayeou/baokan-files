### Swiss Newspaper Advocates Intervention Against Indiscriminate Bombing by American Aircraft

Zurich, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Lausanne "News Authority," in a Monday editorial, supported the Swiss authorities' opposition to the United States' indiscriminate bombing of Japanese cities, stating that such brutal cruelty was no less than the "extermination camps" established by the Nazi Party in the past. The news authority also criticized the United States for excessive propaganda, stating that while American "Super Fortresses" were distributing millions of leaflets across Japan announcing the joint declaration of the Potsdam Three Powers, they were also distributing countless leaflets in Japan warning residents that their cities were listed as bombing targets. This contradictory American propaganda could not be ignored. Furthermore, the American propaganda identified many Japanese cities listed as bombing targets that were not actually wartime industrial areas. We now deeply regret that the cruel "extermination camps" of Europe have ended, but we must consider that tens of millions of Japanese women and children are currently being innocently slaughtered in Japan. At the same time, the British and Americans could impose a comprehensive blockade on Japan to force its surrender or destroy all Japanese military facilities to achieve the same result, so why resort to such cruel means? Switzerland, as a neutral country, is deeply concerned about this issue, but Switzerland will ultimately take on the significant responsibility of considering this issue in its capacity as the "founder of the Red Cross."

Editorial

### A Second Discussion on the Kuomintang and Constitutionalism

Yesterday, after reading Mr. Chen Gongbo's article "Re-examining the Kuomintang," we discussed the issue of the Kuomintang and constitutionalism. Today, continuing to read the article, we wish to further express our views.

Discussing the nature of the Kuomintang, Mr. Gongbo observed with a calm mind, pointing out that the Kuomintang was fundamentally detached from the masses and had transformed from a revolutionary party opposing feudalism and imperialism into a feudalistic group, with major policies controlled by large capitalists, leading to the Kuomintang's fatal wound. Such frank recognition and acknowledgement of reality is worthy of a statesman's demeanor. Therefore, we are reminded that the Kuomintang has a long and bright future, as long as all Kuomintang members equally face and acknowledge reality and exert themselves to seek future revival with the same rigorous attitude of self-examination.

Mr. Gongbo said, "The Kuomintang's advocacy was originally against feudalism, but recently it has become a feudalistic group. Originally, it was supposed to supervise party-affiliated officials, but as a result, it has become an appendage and decoration of officials within the party. The party has become a countless number of private systems, naturally becoming a feudalistic group." Indeed, this is the biggest fatal wound of the Kuomintang today. Especially at this time when the whole country is unanimously demanding "national unity to save the country" and opposing the Communist Party of China's disguised "feudal separatism," if the Kuomintang itself, which occupies a leading position, is still a "feudalistic group," is this not a great contradiction? We know that the Chinese revolution and nation-building movement has involved bloodshed, sacrifice, and struggle for fifty years, but has not yet been fully successful because feudal remnants of thought and institutions have infiltrated the revolutionary camp, corrupting the leaders and the entire revolutionary party. Now we must urgently seek to save it! Facts at home and abroad prove that the most effective panacea for washing away the remnants of feudalism is the implementation of a democratic system. As Mr. Gongbo said, "If the party becomes feudalistic, any ideals of democratic centralism become empty talk; if the party is not democratic, how can it be centralized? If power is systematized, how can it be democratic?" Therefore, today the party seeks self-salvation and should seek democracy; extending its meaning, the country seeks strength, and should even more so seek democracy. Only by realizing democracy can all feudal remnants be finally eliminated, and can the revolution and nation-building be completed.

Another fatal wound of the Kuomintang, as Mr. Gongbo has indicated, is that "since the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929], those in power have become capitalists, and the party has no power to sanction them, not even the courage to criticize a party member who holds power; and the individual who controls the highest power is too worried and lacks broad awareness, so party members naturally rely on their position to accumulate private gains." We believe that this fatal wound of the Kuomintang, as described by Mr. Gongbo, is actually the fundamental reason why Chinese politics today are not on track, and at the same time, it hinders the political reform movement. Therefore, in the future, we must pay attention to: first, giving party members and the people the opportunity and power to criticize those who hold political power; second, "those who control the highest power" cannot "be too worried and lack broad awareness," allowing a small number of people to "rely on their position to accumulate private gains." To achieve these two major requirements for saving the party and strengthening the country, the first step is to establish a civil society to promote the authority of public opinion; the second step is to implement democratic constitutionalism. Apart from this, there is no other shortcut.

As for the Kuomintang's failure to publicize its political program and policies to the public, leading to alienation from the masses, Mr. Gongbo also expressed his views earnestly, saying, "The Kuomintang can still nominally rule today, not because of the party's political program, nor because of the party's strength, but because the masses are thinking of the past achievements of the Kuomintang's martyrs in building the country, and the country is in such a difficult situation that they cannot find a party to replace the Kuomintang, so they can only have the last hope for the Kuomintang." However, precisely because the Kuomintang has a glorious history and had thousands of martyrs who sacrificed for the country, the people still hold great hope! I remember that before Sun Yat-sen began preparations for the Kuomintang's reorganization in the 12th year of the Republic [i.e., 1923], the corruption and division within the party, the collapse of the party's political status, the party's lack of organization, training, and propaganda, and the national people's indifference or even hatred of the party, were even worse than today. However, after Sun Yat-sen and his true comrades' thorough reorganization, from the 13th year [i.e., 1924], the situation immediately changed for the better, becoming a vigorous party, a revolutionary party with organization, training, and propaganda, a political party with mutual trust and unity with the national masses, and the initiator of the subsequent successful Northern Expedition revolution! We believe that there is a Sun Yat-sen in the Kuomintang today, and we believe that every Kuomintang leader can sincerely learn all of Sun Yat-sen's methods. Not only the Kuomintang party, but also the entire Republic of China will embark on a new and bright path because of this!

### Proclamation of Declaration of War by the National Government

On December 8th of the previous year, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with its friendly nation, Japan. Since then, it has embarked on a New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding security, and improving the people's livelihood, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, the British and Americans still adhere to their century-old policy of dividing East Asia and have intensified their efforts, even colluding with the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called British-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, their violence has been gradually defeated by the armed forces of friendly nation Japan, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have been lost. Therefore, they are increasingly resorting to cunning schemes and are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's controlled areas, instigating the Chongqing faction to continuously harass and obstruct the progress of various construction projects. They have even directly used their own aircraft, using the Chongqing faction as a base, to repeatedly bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction, willing to be driven by the British and Americans and acting as traitors to East Asia, is, of course, shameful; while the British and Americans, who have been scheming against East Asia, doing their utmost to sow discord and dissension in order to achieve their ultimate ambition of annexation, are even more deserving of the common hatred of the East Asian nations. Therefore, the National Government declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States and will exert its full strength to cooperate with its friendly nation Japan to eradicate the brutality of Britain and the United States and seek the restoration of China and the liberation of the East Asian people. The two countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share a common understanding of the co-prosperity of East Asia. In the future, we should further promote cooperation with a view to jointly building a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been engaging with British and American forces in the West for several years and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country is now joining the Greater East Asia War and should echo them with a view to contributing to the just new order of the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, the restoration of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world; they should unite their hearts and minds and strive to the end to carry out this great and sacred mission. January 9th, 32nd year of the Republic of China [1943], Chairman Wang Zhaoming

The governments of Romania and Finland announced in response to this decision of the Soviet government that they fully agreed with the above-mentioned decision and expressed their satisfaction.

### Relief for Bereaved Families of the Victims of the Awa Maru Disaster

### Commander of American Occupation Forces Broadcasts to the German People, Hoping to Realize a Democratic Way of Life

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Frankfurt on the Rhine, Eisenhower, the military governor of the American military occupation of Germany, said in a radio address to the German people in the American-occupied areas on the evening of the 6th: The Nationalists who are important to the people of Germany are as important as the Nazis, and in order to maintain law and order, we have planned wars to reduce the various difficulties that the German people will face this winter. Therefore, the Nazi doctrine and militarism of Germany are being eliminated, war criminals are being executed, and the German arms are being lifted, but we will give all kinds of help to the German people who are relying on democracy to build a daily life. The Hall and School of Justice will be open as usual after the Nazi influence is removed. You have already issued newspapers and participated in the military government, and this method will be implemented gradually in the future. The U.S. military always approves the organization of local trade unions and the pursuit of political activities, but the main purpose of trade unions and political parties must be to find ways to help the German people in their daily lives in winter. Life this winter will be quite difficult. According to various situations, there will inevitably be a shortage of food, fuel and housing, but you should encourage each other to help each other, so that you can reduce some difficulties. This year's autumn harvest can still be expected, but in order to ensure a solid autumn harvest, all residents of cities must move to the countryside to work, and it seems that it will not be possible to use coal for heating this winter, so we must now collect more firewood for winter use. Secondly, there is the problem of housing. Houses that can be repaired should be repaired quickly. The German National Civil Affairs Bureau established by the military government will assist you in various places where you are unable to govern yourselves. As for whether Germany can realize a sound democratic life and join the United Nations camp, it depends on your attitude.

### Turkey's Newspapers Bitterly Denounce the Soviet Union's Unreasonable Demands

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a New York Times dispatch from Ankara: The increasingly strained relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey are causing considerable unease among the Turkish people. Leading editors of newspapers in the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Monday, severely criticized the unreasonable demands made by the Soviet authorities to the Turkish government from various perspectives. They stated, "In the view of the Turkish people, the Potsdam Conference has not improved the situation between the Soviet Union and Turkey. The Turkish people would rather fight a war with no hope of victory than submit to oppression by force. Although there are reports circulating in the capitals of Britain and the United States suggesting that the authorities of both countries have asked the Soviet Union to moderate its demands, these reports do not bring any reassurance to the people of Ankara. In particular, the joint communique issued at the end of the Potsdam Conference has not only failed to increase Turkish confidence in Britain and the United States but has instead plunged the situation between the Soviet Union and Turkey into further chaos. The Turkish government is currently studying the matter in detail. Even if the Soviet Union and Turkey reach an agreement, it will not change the status of the Dardanelles Strait. Therefore, to resolve this issue, the nine signatory nations of the past Montreux Convention must jointly attend and discuss a proper solution. Currently, the absolute reasons for the Soviet Union's demand for Turkey to cede the regions of Kars and Ardahan are unclear. However, in recent months, people throughout the Near East and Middle East have speculated that the Soviet Union seeks to intensify Armenian nationalism. In mid-February of last year, Radio Yerevan broadcasted to the people of Syria and Lebanon, claiming, 'The two countries of Syria and Lebanon now have tens of millions of Armenians who have fled from Turkey.' At the same time, according to Armenian sources, 'A Soviet delegation issued a type of unofficial special pass to stateless Armenian refugees.' While this news does not involve major politics, it does indicate that Soviet policy lies in supporting Armenian aspirations. Yesterday, a prominent Turkish newspaper also carried a scathing protest against the Soviet Union's unreasonable demand to redraw national borders, stating, 'This kind of demand by the Soviet Union should be presented to the world peace conference, at which we can defend our sacred rights.'"

### Continued News of Pétain's Trial - Cavalier's Witness Testimony

Paris, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Paris: In yesterday's trial of Marshal Pétain, the chairman of the Committee for the Deprivation of Nationality of Jewish People, established by the former Vichy government, appeared in court and testified, "Marshal Pétain and Laval both expressed disagreement with Germany's proposal to revoke the nationality of Jewish people who had generally acquired French citizenship by 1927." The fourth witness that day was Mr. Maitre, a 44-year-old lawyer, who testified, "In 1941, when Marshal Pétain appointed me as the administrative director of the Menton region in southern France, I was well aware that Marshal Pétain intended to choose someone who opposed Germany to govern the region." After his statement, Cavalier, the former Minister of Education and Health of the Vichy government, continued to testify, "Mr. Dubé, the former Canadian ambassador to Vichy, presented me with a private letter from British Foreign Secretary Halifax, stating that Halifax intended to reestablish relations with Vichy. The contents of the letter roughly stated, 'To my French friends, the friendship between our countries remains very strong. We should not destroy each other. We should maintain Article 9 of the armistice agreement. What we now ask of France is: Maintain all of your fleets, maintain all of your colonies, and never cede any of the colonies that have fallen into our possession to other countries.'" At this point in the testimony, the trial was adjourned again.

### Inside Story of the Anglo-American War Agreement - Yu Qi

The Anglo-American military agreement is a byproduct of the Potsdam Conference. The anxieties of the top military and political leaders of the United States and Britain are very evident. Regardless of the gradual decline in the fighting spirit of the American and British people, it is necessary to urge them to rise up and complete the war against Japan. According to the joint statement issued by the new British Prime Minister Attlee, who returned to London from Potsdam, and the U.S. President Truman, who returned home aboard the USS Augusta, the military chiefs of staff of the U.S. and British combined staffs had already drafted a coordinated plan to completely defeat Japan. However, the content of the plan of the U.S. and British military and political leaders, who dreamed of invading Japan with the remaining might of their victory over Germany, turned out to be unexpectedly hollow. This made the United Allies doubt whether the United States had any confidence in completing the war.

According to what has been reported about this military agreement, the British side agreed to commit all of its naval, land, and air forces to the war against Japan. But why does Britain need to reconfirm its efforts to fight against Japan now? The British people exhausted their full strength in the war against Germany and are weary of war, wanting only a peaceful life. This trend in public sentiment can be seen in the recent British general election, in which the hawkish, imperialist Conservative Party was rejected, and the Labour Party, which focused on post-war domestic reconstruction, won an overwhelming majority. However, if Britain were to withdraw from the war front at this time, it would be a major blow to the United States. To prevent this trend, it is necessary to make Britain reaffirm its continued war efforts. Therefore, the exhausted British people will once again be whipped and driven to the war front.

Although Britain will continue the war, it will strive to obtain favorable conditions as a price. Therefore, the command scope of the Southeast Asia and Southwest Pacific Commands has been revised. Although detailed announcements have not yet been made on this point, it is clear that Britain wants to regain the lost interests in Southeast Asia from Mountbatten. The United States saw through Britain's psychology and therefore agreed to cede a part of the Dutch East Indies in the East to Britain's operational area. From this, it can be seen that they want to treat the southern resource zone as a part to be divided and exploited in the future.

Furthermore, this military agreement also decided to use the forces of the British and American dependencies and the small countries that declared war on Japan in the war against Japan. This is yet another exposure of the U.S. and British military and political leaders' worries about insufficient soldiers and low public fighting spirit, and their use of the blood of small countries as a sacrifice to wage war.

In summary, it can be seen that this Anglo-American military agreement is by no means an important matter of new regulations, but rather aims to prevent the exposure of disunity within the Allied camp before the war against Japan. From this, it can be inferred that their "advice for Japan's unconditional surrender" can also be seen as aimed at uniting the Anglo-American camp. The British people are already weary of war, and the situation inside Chongqing is also on the verge of collapse. At this time, it is even more necessary to clarify the war goals of the United States and Britain and to coordinate the steps of the United Allies. This "advice" is a declaration issued with the clear knowledge that the Japanese side will not heed it.

The enemy was disappointed because the Japanese side did not respond to the "advice for Japan's unconditional surrender," so they wanted to use the Soviet Union to make their case. According to a United Press report on the 6th, the views of U.S. news interpreter R.H. Seifert seemed to suggest that the declaration was issued with the understanding of Chairman Stalin. The fact that the United States hopes the Soviet Union will participate in the war against Japan is well known. Seifert's interpretation can only be seen as an observation of this hope. But where did this observation of hope come from? It is because the United States' victory in the European war was due to the cooperation of the Soviet Union, and it is believed that without the Soviet Union's participation, the war against Japan would be difficult to complete. In other words, it implies that the United States has lost confidence in completing the Pacific War independently.

### Re-examination of the Kuomintang (3)

— Chen Gongbo

In short, from the reorganization of the Kuomintang to the present day, there has been no sound institutional method between the government and the party headquarters, nor has there been any attempt to divide the work and cooperate between the government and the party headquarters. At the central level, there is still a Central Political Committee, which seems to be positioned between the party and the government, while at the local level, there is simply no organization to connect the party and the government. Moreover, according to my experience, the resolutions of the Central Political Committee and the Standing Committee of the Central Party Headquarters are often full of contradictions. In the past, everyone followed the old rules, and today, they simply make do with what they have. No one is willing to intervene, and no one pays attention. Nothing is more painful than this.

Secondly, regarding training, I have also said that the Kuomintang's training of party members is not even as good as that of the British Conservative Party. The Conservative Party's method of training party members is to first identify talents who support the party's platform in the election districts. Once they have talents, they must first make them do the local work within the party. At the same time, they must also have them follow a member of parliament or a state councilor with political experience as a secretary. After they are proficient, they are then recommended to serve in various departments of the parliament. The parliament has libraries and archives, debates and struggles, and political, military, and economic strategies. After these people are proficient in everything and are recognized as capable of handling major events, they are then promoted as members of parliament in the electoral districts. After having several years of experience and achievements in the parliament, they are then recommended by the party to participate in the cabinet. Naturally, this method is only suitable for Britain, which has a conservative and constitutional tradition for a long time. Even if our country does not imitate its method, it should imitate its intention. However, what is our training like? The small groups are nominally existent, not to mention that every so-called training session involves a large-scale gathering of personnel from various party headquarters for training, lasting for three months at most and two weeks at least. What is taught is only theory, not practice. Even if it emphasizes practice, there are no practical materials. They have already understood the theory, but they are still at a loss after the training. As a result, after several months of training, they still return to running the party, still propagating empty words, and still training the lower levels in the same way, without any influence on politics, military affairs, or economics. Holding training is like performing a routine, and those who are ordered to receive training are just going through the motions. As for every party member who holds government office, whether it is a minister or a county magistrate, they never think of finding talents within the party. Even if they do, there is no way to find them. Because the party's training institutions do not have detailed training for each party member, nor do they have records of the personality and skills. Even if they do, they are kept in the party headquarters, and there is no suitable organization to send them to. Even if there are people who are enthusiastic about the party, they can only find people outside the party, not within the party. Therefore, when every official takes office, the first thing they think of is their own brothers and relatives, the second is their friends and classmates, and the third, when they have no choice, they find specialized technical personnel, and then they think of talents. Even if there are party members with specialized skills, this leader will definitely think that they are party members and probably only know how to run the party. After running the party for a long time, they will inevitably have some doubts about their professional knowledge. We think that everyone who joins a political party has political aspirations. If they are involved in running the party but have nothing to do with politics, then why would these party members join the Kuomintang? Moreover, there are many factions within the party, so even if a party member does not want to engage in politics but only wants to run the party, it is unlikely that they can do as they please. There is an ancient saying: "To not teach the people to fight is to abandon them." Now I can change this to, "To not teach party members politics is to abandon them." The Chinese Kuomintang has abandoned party members for a long time, unless the party member has special skills or has a special relationship with so-called important people. Otherwise, they can forget about struggling at the lower level and hoping that the higher level will recognize their talents. Naturally, there are also a group of impetuous people who overestimate their abilities and vainly desire high positions, but it is no wonder that they do so, because there are really too many people who are less talented than them but hold higher positions. This phenomenon is really terrible. If there is a sound organization and meticulous training, it will surely enable everyone to use their talents to the fullest, and it will also enable people to know their own talents and correct this unreasonable reality.

Thirdly, strategy, that is, tactics. The Kuomintang does not talk much about strategy in the open. Since the reorganization in 1924 and the allowance of Communists to join the party, it has been infected by the Communist Party to a certain extent, and party members have begun to talk about strategy. Especially after the split with the Communists, in order to deal with the Communist Party's conspiracies, some party members have also been talking about strategy. In political struggles, it is sometimes inevitable to use strategy. However, what I find most surprising is that these so-called strategies are not the strategies of the party but have become the strategies of individuals. The party does not give party members instructions, they can only rely on individuals to use them. The party also does not supervise, they can only rely on individuals to act. Therefore, the strategy is not successful, and the person has fallen. Once the person falls, the party collapses. For example, if a party member wants to have an effect within a warlord or bureaucrat, soon this party member will become an appendage of the warlord or bureaucrat. He cannot make a warlord or bureaucrat believe in the party's program. On the contrary, he uses this warlord or bureaucrat to assert himself and demand his own rights from the party. For example, in order to adapt to the environment, he has to associate with local tyrants and evil gentry, but soon this party member not only cannot influence the evil gentry and local tyrants, but becomes the protector and spokesperson of the local tyrants and evil gentry, or even becomes an evil gentry himself. In this way, the party loses its strategic role, and the party members also fall because of the use of strategy. This phenomenon cannot be said to be the fault of the party members but the fault of the party. If the party has an organization, why would it provide resources to the enemy, harm itself, and even harm the country? To put it bluntly, the nature of the party in China today has changed, and its organization and training are corrupt. If the party members, especially those who consider themselves to be the backbone, do not reflect and reform, the party will surely decline, and they themselves will also decline with it. If we want to solve the problems of China in our ideals and shoulder the great responsibilities of the country, we can only let other parties do it.

The people are dissatisfied with the party members, and the party members are also dissatisfied with the party. Especially I personally am even more dissatisfied. Before the implementation of constitutional government, everyone is dissatisfied with the Kuomintang. After the implementation of constitutional government, everyone may be even more dissatisfied with the Kuomintang. From this point of view, it seems that there is no need for the Kuomintang to exist. However, I am still not concerned about the future position of the party, but about the future of the party itself.

My criticism of this party seems to be more direct and harsh than the criticism of this party by other people outside the party. I am not deliberately criticizing this party today before the imminent implementation of constitutional government to please people outside the party. I am a responsible member of the Kuomintang. Because I love it deeply, I speak earnestly.

At the same time, I want to call the attention of the people of the whole country, do not think that my criticism of the Kuomintang is to despise the Kuomintang, or even to think that the Kuomintang is not capable of undertaking national affairs. The Three Principles of the People as the highest principle of national construction has been recognized by people in every corner of China. Mr. Sun's will requires China's freedom, equality, and joint struggle with the world's nations that treat me equally, which is also what people in every corner of China require. Kuomintang members naturally have many who do not implement equal land rights and control capital, but no party member has ever opposed equal land rights and control capital. If we in China still recognize that feudalism must be broken and social revolution must be prevented, then the Kuomintang will eventually have its place, its value, and its future. We should be fully affirmed of this point. The Kuomintang initiated the revolution and has a long history. In modern China, it is impossible to find a party that is longer than it. The Kuomintang established the Republic of China and unified China and has a great contribution. In modern China, it is impossible to find a party that is more meritorious than it. We calmly criticize, China is originally lacking in talents, it is undeniable, the Kuomintang is lacking in talents, and all parties and factions are also lacking in talents. However, comparatively, the talents of all parties and factions are not necessarily more and higher than the Kuomintang. There are naturally many dissatisfactions with the Kuomintang, especially those who advocate the immediate implementation of constitutional government will not be satisfied. However, based on history or based on propaganda, the general people still expect more from the Kuomintang than other parties. Therefore, if someone wants to reduce the Kuomintang by force, it is impossible, and it is impossible to solve the Kuomintang by politics, and it is impossible to soften the Kuomintang by tactics. I hope that all patriotic or willing national protection youths should rise up and love the Kuomintang with the enthusiasm to protect the Republic of China. National construction cannot exclude the Kuomintang, and anti-communism cannot exclude the Kuomintang. Therefore, based on this observation, whether before the implementation of constitutional government or after the implementation of constitutional government, I deeply hope that young people should criticize the Kuomintang as much as possible and cooperate with the transformation of the Kuomintang. At the same time, our party member comrades should also reflect, should also be humble, and should also strive to rise up and reform to cooperate with the general youth in the requirements of the nation and the times.

The Kuomintang today should restore its original spirit and innovate, otherwise it is not another party that overthrows the National Revolution, but the Kuomintang. I am very strange, the Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, and today it is already 1932, the advancement and change of the times, and yet the Kuomintang, in addition to the deterioration of its nature, all the organization and training methods are still stagnant and unchanged. Based on this point, I already feel that there is innovation

I am vigilant about the future of China, and even more vigilant about the future of the Kuomintang. Since 1932, I have been seeking the unity of the party every day, and I am even more afraid that my opinions will hinder the unity of the party. Therefore, I have been silent for fourteen years and have not said anything. Now I have to say, this remark is not only for comrades in a certain area, but for comrades across the country. This remark is my last hope for the Kuomintang. After that, I hope that the general party members and young people will rise up together. (The End)

The purpose of this committee is to concentrate civilian efforts to promote air raid relief and rescue work.

The members of this committee are naturally the directors of the Citizens' Welfare Association, and external experts may be invited to participate, who will be hired by the Citizens' Welfare Association.

This committee temporarily establishes the following groups, whose responsibilities are as follows:

1. General Affairs Group: Responsible for the custody of documents, seals, personnel, accounting, and matters not belonging to other groups.

2. Finance Group: Responsible for the custody, disbursement, and auditing of donations.

### Key Points for Training Implemented on the 20th Air Defense Day

Initial Fire Prevention

Regarding initial fire prevention: Recent examples include fires caused by the impact of explosions. Despite witnessing the spread of these fires, people merely stand by and watch, resulting in large fires that necessitate the deployment of fire brigades. Therefore, attention must be paid to the initial bucket of water, which can prevent a major fire. The handling of embers is also equally important. After the fire brigade extinguishes the fire, citizens should immediately handle the remaining embers. Thus, a small amount of water and attention can completely extinguish the fire.

Shelter Training

Regarding shelter: According to past war lessons, standing in the road, lingering without seeking shelter even when enemy planes are flying overhead, or sitting or lying indoors can all lead to unfortunate consequences. Therefore, it is essential to seek shelter within air defense walls or utilize terrain and objects for shelter when enemy planes are approaching from one's direction, upon hearing nearby anti-aircraft fire, or hearing the sound of enemy planes.

Rescue Training

Regarding the rescue training of Baojia (neighborhood self-defense unit) rescue teams: Based on recent bombing lessons, there is a real need to implement rescue for the injured as quickly as possible at the bombing site. This point is highly expected of the Baojia district rescue team's activities. Therefore, emergency treatment for the injured is important.

Comprehensive Training

Regarding the comprehensive training of specially established air defense corps: Baojia air defense corps have always conducted training in various places on air defense days, achieving good results. However, the training for occupational workplaces, i.e., the activities of specially established air defense corps, tend to be too idle. Therefore, on this training day, comprehensive training must be implemented for each specially established air defense corps.

Light Control

Regarding light control: Training for light alert control will be conducted from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM. Training for light air raid control will be conducted from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM. During this time, joint military, government, and civilian inspection teams and guidance teams will be formed, and the principle of joint responsibility will be adopted for problem areas. The military will take measures to cut off power to those areas.

News for Readers and Students

### Subsidizing Tuition Fees Should Be Done to the Best of Our Ability

General Reply to Petitioning Students

The *Shen Bao* Reader's Scholarship Office has recently received many letters from university students, and the opinions can be summarized as follows: The target of the *Shen Bao*'s 9th Special Fundraising is 30 million yuan, and there are over 3,500 students to be assisted, so each student can receive an average subsidy of about 100,000 yuan. This amount can fully subsidize primary school students, but the tuition fees for universities and colleges are at least 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Even if a university student can receive a subsidy of 200,000 yuan, it only subsidizes half of the tuition, and the rest is still unresolved. Parents cannot afford it, and there is still a risk of dropping out of school. Given the current situation of donations from all walks of life, which can be described as enthusiastic, what about extending the time and continuing to fundraise? The more donations, the more subsidies can be given, and the grand aspiration of all sectors of society to rescue students from dropping out of school can be fulfilled as much as possible, so as not to be like building a mountain one basket at a time and failing at the last step.

The staff of the *Shen Bao* Scholarship Office deeply sympathize with the above-mentioned letters and have conducted thorough research. Here is a general reply: The insufficiency of subsidies that everyone is concerned about has already been considered by us from the beginning. Because of the many difficulties, we are deeply afraid that fundraising will not be easy, so we have tentatively set a target of 30 million yuan, knowing that the average amount received by each person will be less than half. Fortunately, this fundraising has been successful, and it has now been decided to extend the fundraising period in the hope of increasing subsidies. If we can subsidize the full amount, this is our greatest wish. We believe that this wish is also the wish of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. If the tuition fees of the students being assisted can be fully covered, it is the greatest goal of providing scholarships. Subsidizing half or less than half is originally an incomplete solution. We also hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will work together to make the lovely children feel unexpectedly satisfied, and the scholarship work will also achieve complete success.

### Autumn Business Tax: Finance Bureau Stipulates That Business Volume of All Industries Must Be Reported Accurately

The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's summer business tax collection deadline expired at the end of last month. From the 1st to the 10th of this month, all merchants and civilians who have not yet paid will be charged a 10% late payment penalty in accordance with regulations. From the 11th to the 20th, the penalty will increase to 20%, and so on. In addition, the Bureau has determined that the autumn business tax collection for all industries in this city will begin on August 21st and end at the end of September. The autumn business tax will be levied on the actual business volume of each industry in April, May, and June in accordance with the rate. The Bureau will send personnel to distribute declaration forms and payment forms in advance. Those who have not received them can obtain them from the Bureau's tax collection office in each district and submit the tax declaration and payment on time to avoid penalties for exceeding the deadline. In addition, due to the recent soaring prices, the business volume of various industries has greatly increased compared to before, and the Bureau's tax revenue will also inevitably increase accordingly. However, all businesses must declare according to the actual business volume and must not intend to evade taxes. If discovered by the authorities, they will definitely be punished.

Revision of Livestock Special Tax Valuation

The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, considering that the recent selling prices of pigs and cattle in the market have soared, and the gap between the original valuation of pigs and cattle in the livestock business special tax and the market value is too large, has revised the valuation, estimating it conservatively based on the market value. The new valuation is 800,000 yuan per pig, with a tax rate of 5% as stipulated, resulting in a tax of 40,000 yuan. Yellow cattle, water buffalo, and horses are valued at 3,000,000 yuan per head, with a tax of 150,000 yuan. Calves are valued at 400,000 yuan, with a tax of 20,000 yuan. Goats and sheep are valued at 200,000 yuan, with a tax of 10,000 yuan. The new valuation will be uniformly applied for collection starting from August 11th of this year.

### Cash Withdrawal Limit for Money Shops Doubled

According to news from the financial sector in this city yesterday, banks and money shops had previously stipulated at the beginning of last month that customers could withdraw cash at a rate of 20% to 30% of the previous week's deposit amount. Since the authorities have relaxed the adjustment and supply of cash, the cash withdrawal methods of various banks and money shops have been changed to increase uniformly by 100%, that is, 40% to 50% of the lowest deposit amount in the previous week can be paid.

### Post Office to Issue Air Defense Stamps Starting Today

The Shanghai Postal Administration has specially printed Hong Kong version unwatermarked paper airmail stamps with the words "Air Defense" printed and the value changed to publicize the significance of air defense. These stamps are approved to be issued starting today (9th), and on this day, the words "Air Defense" will be stamped on imported mail for one day instead of the ordinary date stamp for publicity. Those who apply to cancel various unused stamps currently in use can also do so at the Bureau. However, the total value of the stamps that can be canceled is a minimum of 40 yuan, regardless of the number of stamps. Those who do not meet 40 yuan will not be able to do so. The Postal Bureau's philatelic office is specially approved to keep the stamp for one month to meet the needs of philatelists.

### Mayor Zhou's Wife Leads Women's Circle in Air Raid Relief

Mr. Wen Lanting, Chairman of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, in order to raise more funds for air raid relief and to maximize the effectiveness of relief efforts, specially wrote to Mayor Zhou's wife, requesting that she immediately lead the women's circle to jointly respond to the relief fundraising work. Mrs. Zhou greatly agreed after receiving the letter and will invite the women's circle to hold a tea party within the next week to discuss and promote steps.

### Increased Salaries for Municipal School Teachers and Staff

The salaries of teachers and staff in municipal schools in this city have been adjusted and increased in accordance with the new central regulations starting from July, and a local living allowance will be given separately, in accordance with the same treatment as civil servants. It is also heard that the July salaries have been signed and issued yesterday according to the new standard and have been handed over to the Education Bureau for collection, and will be distributed completely within a few days.

### One-Month Grace Period for Field Tax in Urban Areas

The collection of in-kind field tax for this period was originally scheduled to begin on June 1st, and the initial deadline was the end of July. Late payments were subject to a late payment penalty of one-tenth in accordance with regulations. Due to the fact that the actual collection in urban areas was later and that many local areas were repeatedly subjected to air raids, affecting the recovery due to the people's relocation and avoidance, the Municipal Finance Bureau decided to grant a one-month grace period until the end of August for the sake of relieving people's difficulties. Late payments will be subject to late payment penalties. All collection offices in Pudong, Huben, and Huxi have been notified to comply.

Social Services

### Zhenjiang Native Place Association: Scholarship Registration Begins

Fellow villagers who wish to return to their hometown should bring their residence permit and fare to register at the Association from now on to buy the tickets and handle all procedures.

### Huang Jingwan Thanks Relatives and Friends in a Letter

To all relatives and friends: Jingwan suddenly suffered from dental disease this summer and has been bedridden for two months. I am grateful for the care of relatives and friends who have given me material and spiritual assistance. Your love for me makes me appreciate the value of friendship even more. Jingwan has always known to serve society and does not care about himself. He has never had extravagant expectations for material life. Especially in these difficult times, he advocates a simple life so that we can overcome difficulties together. I often examine myself when I am sick, and this ambition is firm. In the days to come, I will be more motivated to continue serving to repay the sympathy of society and reward the expectations of relatives and friends. Once I recover, I will thank you again. I will first express my thoughts and hope to receive your kindness. Huang Jingwan, with illness, pays respects on Father's Day, August 8th.

### Record of Returning Home

— Hou Qianli

It is like having a home but being unable to return, cuckoos, stop crying in my ear.

As soon as Mrs. Wu entered the door, she exclaimed in a panic:

"A stray bullet hit number 25 and made a hole in the wall!"

"It's lucky it didn't hurt anyone," Mr. Wu said, looking up from his newspaper.

"Lucky?" His wife rolled her eyes at him. "How can you call that lucky! What if a stray bullet hits our house?"

"If it really hits, there's nothing we can do. What can we do!"

"Living in Shanghai is just suffering," his wife grumbled as she worked, "Living peacefully in the countryside, but we had to travel thousands of miles to Shanghai to die!"

"To die?"

"Isn't it like going to die?" Mrs. Wu glanced at her husband. "If we actually get hit by a bomb, what kind of end would that be?"

"What can we do?" Mr. Wu explained, "Like those civilians who were bombed to death in Nanshi, do you think they had any kind of end in mind?"

"That's why I'm saying, we should think of a way, like the people at number 13 across the street, who all moved back to the countryside early this morning. They've lived in Shanghai for over ten years, with two brothers, one working and one studying, but they didn't care about any of that, they prioritized their lives and moved back to the countryside all at once."

"They still have a countryside to return to, but we, we have a home but can't return. Who doesn't want to go back, but where can we go? - Besides, we have so many people in our family, old and young."

Mrs. Wu was silent. Just as her husband said, where could they move to? Of course, they also had a countryside home, but recently, people had come from the countryside, telling them stories of suffering that made those of us wandering in a foreign land even more unwilling and afraid to return. They were familiar with countless stories of people suffering all sorts of fates because they couldn't pay their rent, and mentioning home would naturally send shivers down their spines.

"The newspapers talk about evacuation all day long," his wife grumbled again, "But I haven't heard of many people leaving. The streets are still crowded with people, what's the point?"

"Most people living in Shanghai are in a similar situation to us. There's nothing the newspapers can do. In short, everyone wants to leave, but no one can leave!" Mr. Wu angrily threw down the newspaper.

"However, leaving or not is secondary," his wife returned to the main topic. "We have to think of a way. These past few days of bombing have made things terribly expensive. Deep-fried dough sticks cost five hundred yuan. If this continues, a family of seven, not to mention anything else, the rice alone will be unbearable for a month. If we don't think of a way, we'll just starve to death."

Mr. Wu had been pondering all along. He shouldered such a heavy burden. Was there ever a moment when he forgot to think of a solution? But the reality was never as good as he hoped. Like himself, he originally wanted to make some profit from the small amount of cash that could be distributed to each person in the industry every week, so he could buy some rice, but by the time he had accumulated enough, the price of rice had jumped up again. At this moment, he was pondering what his wife had just said.

"I think," he finally said slowly, "When necessary, let's go. It's better to go to the countryside, at least we won't be threatened by firewood and rice."

"That's right," his wife immediately continued, "Last time, Mother said that even if the countryside is worse, firewood and rice are always cheaper. Besides, Mother is not young anymore, and Shanghai is often bombed now. What if something happens?"

"Actually, it's all the same," Mr. Wu saw through it, "Worrying about this doesn't stop us from worrying about that. But speaking of it, it always seems like the countryside is better. If it weren't for firewood and rice, I really wouldn't want to go back. Going back is still the same." The matter was decided. The old lady was overjoyed to hear that they were going back. She had really had enough of living in Shanghai these past few years. As for the children, they were as happy as their grandmother. Mrs. Wu was busy with packing all day long. She couldn't bear to part with this and couldn't let go of that. Although Mr. Wu kept telling her to bring as little as possible, the return was not a move.

The first thing that Mr. Wu found difficult to deal with was securing cash. Borrowing travel expenses from relatives and friends was relatively easy. Even though he would see some unpleasant faces, he managed to scrape together the amount. But securing cash was really a matter of life and death. He had to endure the pain and go to the black market. So, even though he got a million, after all the discounts, he was left with only seven hundred thousand when he exchanged it for a stack of cash.

However, there was another piece of news in the newspaper: train tickets tripled in price!

Mr. Wu's entire plan was overturned. His expenses had to be increased by some amount. In other words, he had to raise another sum of money from others and go to the black market again.

The second step was to buy military tickets. People told him that buying ordinary tickets at the train station at dawn would be a deadly squeeze, and some people waited from before dawn until night without getting a single one. Buying them from a travel agency was also inappropriate, and he might end up buying fake ones. Mr. Wu's money didn't come easily, and he couldn't be a fool.

A relative enthusiastically found someone to buy the tickets for him. They weren't too expensive, a little more expensive than ordinary tickets, but cheaper than black market tickets. With the military tickets in hand, Mr. Wu felt half relieved.

He flipped through those few small blue cardboard pieces, thinking that they were exchanged for over three hundred thousand in cash, and suddenly felt heavy again.

"I hope we can get home safely this time and live a peaceful life," he thought. He carefully put them into his wallet.

Mrs. Wu was busy packing things all day long. When she had almost finished packing, she looked at the large pile of luggage and was just anxious:

"What are we going to do? So many things!"

"Check the excess baggage, what else can we do? The poor suffer," Mr. Wu said, "We have to bring some personal belongings, surely we can't just throw everything away?"

"Did you report to the neighborhood chief?" his wife suddenly remembered something, "Otherwise, it will be unclear later."

"I'll report it when I come back to Shanghai. One less thing, one less trouble, and it will delay us for another ten days."

That night, Mrs. Wu went to say goodbye to the neighbors in the alley. Those kind neighbors all treated her politely, wished her a safe journey, expressed envy that her family could return to the countryside, and hoped that when Mrs. Wu came to Shanghai again, she would visit their homes.

The next day, before dawn, the whole family got up, and several pedicabs took them to the train station.

People! People! - Everywhere was full of people!

The old lady was shocked. She had never seen so many people crowded together. In the blink of an eye, her son was swept into the crowd. Just as she was about to call out to him, her daughter-in-law said to her, "He's calling for a porter."

The crowd continued to gather from all directions, full of people, full of people's voices. Shouting, calling, crying, yelling...

Mr. Wu ran over in a hurry, with beads of sweat the size of pearls on his face:

"Tickets...give...me..." Even his lips were white.

"Ah?" Mrs. Wu was shocked. "What's wrong?"

"I don't know what happened, I touched it, ...my pocket was empty, the wallet, ..." His lips were trembling, and beads were dripping down.

"The wallet was also stolen?" Mrs. Wu almost fainted.

Mr. Wu nodded, unable to speak. He wanted to cry, with the loss of the wallet, everything was over, one million, the one million he borrowed from others!

"That son of a bitch deserves to die!" Mrs. Wu stamped her feet and cursed, also blaming her husband, "Why are you so careless!"

Mr. Wu stood there, not moving. His eyes were lifeless.

Just then, a crowd of people squeezed over, shouting and yelling. Suddenly, the old lady was thrown to the ground.

"Ah-oh!"

Mr. Wu helped his mother up and shouted frantically:

"Call for a pedicab... Call for a pedicab... Go back!"

### The Skeptic

— Xiong Chiguang

——"Yu Ming:

Have you read Mao Dun's "Pursuit"? Shi Xun, the skeptic, initially doubted others, eventually doubting himself, even doubting his own existence. To others, he becomes a terrifying shadow. He suspects that everyone's every move is disloyal to him, and he holds negative and dismissive opinions about everything. - In the words of Max Nordau, this should be called the disease of the "fin de siècle."

Yu Ming, as I expected, your letter this time is full of complaints and pessimistic arguments.

Yu Ming, you must admit it yourself! Isn't this your perversion? It is easy for a person to go crazy, as long as he keeps thinking deeply -- thinking along a pessimistic path all day long, before long, he will go crazy and become a terrifying madman!

We are all suffering people. Nietzsche has a powerful saying: "Those who suffer have no right to be pessimistic."

Life remains the same, without progress or regress. What about you? Wishing you well. Xia Ying."——

I took this letter and hid it in my luggage. I began to smile. I dared not laugh like a terrifying madman, but I thought:

"Those who suffer have no right to be pessimistic!"

Therefore

"Those who are pessimistic should enjoy suffering?"

These words have "power," and this power brings me another layer of doubt, forever swaying in my journey.
