### Fierce Fighting Unfolds in the Shimajiri District of Southern Okinawa; Japanese Special Attack Units Continue Kamikaze Tactics

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese forces in Okinawa, holding strategic points on both the east and west coasts, are fiercely striking at the enemy attempting to break through the central position of the Shimajiri district in southern Okinawa Island, inflicting significant damage. Since the 21st, a full-scale battle has unfolded in Shimajiri, with the scorched earth of the two armies fighting around the northern highlands of Shinzae-Haruhira and their southeast, including Mabuni in the eastern coastal area. The enemy continues to launch a general offensive in an attempt to completely suppress the Japanese positions in the Shimajiri district, making the operational environment increasingly difficult for the Japanese forces. However, the morale of the Japanese troops remains very high.

Ryukyu Islands Base, 23rd (Central News Agency) - On the night of the 22nd, despite the adverse weather, Japanese air units bravely attacked enemy ships around Okinawa. Around 10 PM, they sank an enemy ship of unknown type and achieved considerable other results, which are currently under investigation. That same night, another unit attacked enemy airfields on Okinawa Island.

Forward Air Base, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The waiting Japanese "Shinbu" Special Attack Unit, to support the Japanese ground forces in the southern Okinawa Island area, carried out kamikaze attacks on enemy fleets south of Okinawa Island at dusk on the 21st and dawn on the 22nd, when the weather was clear. As of now, confirmed results include the confirmed sinking of two enemy battleships and fourteen ships of unknown types.

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - A Washington dispatch reports that a U.S. Associated Press naval correspondent on the Okinawa front reported that the destroyer USS "Abel," while on patrol in Okinawan waters, was attacked by a Japanese kamikaze plane on May 2nd, causing the ship to break into two sections and sink. On the day of the attack, the kamikaze plane and naval fighter aircraft passed through the barrage of anti-aircraft shells fired by our ships at the time and crashed into the starboard side of the "Abel," penetrating the bottom of the engine room. The bombs loaded in the engine room exploded, causing the "Abel" to explode, catch fire, and sink.

### U.S. War Correspondent Reports Cruiser Destroyed

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco, a U.S. Associated Press naval correspondent, who had sailed on the U.S. cruiser USS "Nashville" during the Philippine Sea battle last year, recently reported on the ship being attacked by a Japanese special attack unit off Mindoro Island. This news was recorded on December 13th last year, but due to censorship, it was only released on the 20th of this month. The following is the correspondent's account: The cruiser USS "Nashville" was destroyed by a Japanese special attack unit on December 13th. The ship was escorting off Mindoro Island when suddenly a Japanese kamikaze plane flew directly at the "Nashville" from low altitude, crashing into the front of the bridge. The Japanese plane did not fire a single shot or drop any bombs, it crashed directly and exploded violently, black smoke filled the sky, and the groans of the wounded spread everywhere. Crew members rushed to the bridge with firefighting equipment and began firefighting operations. During this time, successive induced explosions occurred throughout the ship. Crew members immediately transported the wounded to the interior of the ship, but the rooms were extremely hot and almost unbreathable. There was little time to rescue those who died on the deck. At the time, we all felt that the wounded being rescued inside the ship were even more unfortunate than those who died on the deck.

### Reviewing the Anhui, Huai, and Henan Troops; Chairman Chen's Address (Continued from yesterday's unfinished draft)

Currently, the methods of England and America in dealing with post-war Europe are extremely harsh. A third world war is inevitable in the near future. Moreover, the cooperation between England, America, and the Soviet Union is only a matter of temporary interests. The Soviet Union, having gained military victory, is desperately seizing the Balkan Peninsula and various important points on the European continent. On the other hand, England and America are also cultivating the forces of Western Europe and France there as their own bulwark. Sooner or later, there will be conflict. Sooner or later, there will be a second world war. At that time, all of humanity will suffer even more tragic misfortunes. Therefore, for the sake of China's freedom and independence, and for the liberation of East Asia, we have only to carry through our original intention of participating in the war, strengthen our cooperation, complete the war, strive for victory, and thoroughly destroy the ambitions of England and America to invade East Asia.

Secondly, regarding the anti-communism issue, everyone knows that this Sino-Japanese Incident was caused by the instigation and alienation of the Communist Party. Since the incident, they have stood by as observers, taking advantage of opportunities to expand their own power. Therefore, the power of the Communist Party is expanding day by day, and the suffering of the people is deepening day by day. For the sake of the future of this country and for the survival of the nation, we will never allow the Communist Party to succeed in its cunning plans. The goal of the Communist Party is nothing more than to establish a Chinese Soviet government and make China a vassal of the Soviet Union. The Republic of China was founded by the Father of the Nation, and every citizen has the natural duty to protect the Republic of China. The Communist Party wants to sacrifice the Republic of China. This attempt is fundamentally incompatible with the survival of the Republic of China. Therefore, the anti-communist policy of the National Government was the same when the capital was restored, it is the same now, and it will be the same in the future.

Thirdly, regarding the unification issue, everyone also knows that if a country cannot be unified, its organization cannot be sound. If the organization is not sound, then the government has no power. Therefore, when I first assumed the post of Acting Chairman, I first raised the slogan "The Party must not be divided, the country must be unified." Since the incident, there have been many abnormal phenomena within us, which is undeniable, but in order to strive for national independence and freedom, and in order to contribute more to the Greater East Asia War, we must first start with internal unification, and then expand it to achieve national unification. Only with unification can there be strength, and only with strength can we undertake greater tasks. Anhui, Huai, and Henan provinces are located in a strategic position in the north and south, and bear great responsibility in military and political affairs. If local work is done well, national unification can naturally be completed sooner. After China is unified, it will naturally generate greater strength and, of course, make a greater contribution to the war.

Now the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Our national policy will not only not change due to the passage of time, but because of the urgency of the situation, your responsibilities are even greater. It is hoped that all administrative officials, soldiers, and civilians will unite sincerely and work hard towards the above three major goals.

### Military Special Measures Law Announced, Applicable Throughout Japan; Political Association Establishes Wartime Discipline Rectification Department

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Due to the rapid progress of the war situation, in order to concentrate the total strength of the nation, rapidly rectify the necessary military facilities, and prepare for the defense of the country in case of emergency, the Japanese government submitted a Military Special Measures Bill to the 86th Diet. The law, which came into effect on May 5th, applies to parts of the Empire where the situation is urgent. In view of the imminent mainland decisive battle, the Information Bureau announced on the 23rd that: from the 19th of this month, the law has been applied to the entire territory of the Empire. The Information Bureau's announcement is recorded as follows: In light of the Greater East Asia War, in order to rectify the construction of fortresses, camps, and other necessary military matters, and to ensure the complete defense of the country, the Military Special Measures Resolution was first formulated and implemented from May 5th, applying to a part of the territory of the Empire. In view of the development of the war situation, from February 19th, it has been changed to apply to the entire territory of the Empire.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - In order to smoothly promote the wartime emergency measures law and concretely realize the system of rewards and punishments and enhance the civilian wartime strength system, the Greater Japan Political Association decided at its General Affairs Committee on the 22nd to establish a "Wartime Discipline Rectification Department" (tentative name) within the association. The position of department head will be filled by a figure of the Vice President class in order to activate activities. The specific guidelines and personnel for the department head and committee members will be decided at the General Affairs Committee on the 26th.

### Casual Chat from the Veranda

— Yoshida Toyu

Will the American Military Land in China?

Question: I have many questions to ask you when you return from Japan. The current situation has reached a critical juncture. I would like to know what the future holds and who will emerge victorious. The first question I want to know is whether the United States will eventually land in China? This question, in particular, is what the general Chinese people urgently want to know.

Answer: This question was very difficult to answer before the United States began its Okinawa operation. Now, let me say a few words that are slightly off-topic: When I was in Japan, I heard that before the Okinawa operation began, Roosevelt had planned to land in China first, but Chiang Kai-shek was unwilling to let the Chinese mainland become a chaotic battlefield for the life-or-death struggle between Japan and the United States, so he requested that the United States land on the Japanese mainland. As a result, the United States considered that if it could occupy Okinawa, the second step of landing in Japan or China would become an excellent springboard for invincibility, so it hurriedly landed on Okinawa. Although I dare not say whether this rumor is true or false, I believe that the Okinawa landing operation itself can prove that the United States is unwilling to attack the Japanese mainland directly from the Mariana Islands via Iwo Jima, risking the world's great danger, and can also prove Chiang Kai-shek's unwillingness to let foreign fire burn down China's fields and gardens. Now that the United States has gained a firm foothold in Okinawa, its main force may still advance north, directly targeting Japan. The reason is that if the United States wants to fight alongside Chongqing in China and compete with Japan for victory, it will need to send at least a million troops. Even if it can defeat the Japanese army on the mainland, it will certainly not be able to declare the end of a drama on the Pacific Ocean because of this. Given this, it is believed that it is better to move the troops north and directly target Japan in order to obtain decisive results. If the United States were to launch large-scale operations in both Japan and China at the same time, this is not an option that its military strength and transportation capacity would allow. Therefore, it wants to arm the Chongqing army as much as possible and make it fight desperately with Japan. This idea, at least, meets the wishes of the Americans in the following two points. First, if a large number of American troops land in China, it is very likely that the Chinese people in the anti-Japanese war zones will change their friendly attitude towards the United States. Second, shedding a lot of blood for China is, in the eyes of Americans, a complete foolishness in their view of the Asian race. From this, it can be seen that even if the United States sends troops to China, its purpose is only to obtain a transportation line to supply Chongqing with military supplies or to have other political effects from a small-scale troop deployment, and not to launch a main battle.

Will the Soviet Union Participate in the Pacific War?

Question: You seem to have said before that the United States' strategy for fighting Japan is to create an absolute advantage on the battlefield. To achieve this goal, the United States urgently hopes that the Soviet Union will participate in the Greater East Asia War (see my book "Reassessment of China," page 61). If the U.S. military begins to land on the Japanese mainland, or if the U.S. military is sailing smoothly on the mainland battlefield and approaching the border of Manchuria, I am afraid that the Soviet Union will replay a scene of entering Poland and send troops from Siberia!

Answer: I have talked about the Soviet Union's attitude in an article on "The Reorganization of the Kuomintang and the Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party": "To avoid your impatience, let me tell you the conclusion first! I believe that Stalin has no intention of participating in the anti-Japanese war in the current situation, and the Soviet people do not have this intention either. What the Soviet Union hopes for most today is to recuperate. The Soviet Union suffered great losses to its national power in the war against Germany. The people are all looking forward to restoring the country's vitality after the end of the European war. Stalin has no intention of driving these people to engage in war again." Although the situation has changed slightly later, I believe that this view has remained essentially correct until today. As for the reasons, let's discuss them in more detail:

Stalin said in his letter to the Soviet people on Germany's unconditional surrender: "For hundreds of years, the Slavic people's desperate struggle for survival and independence has now been victorious. The German invaders and thugs have now been completely defeated." "The era of the war in Europe has passed, and the era of peaceful development has arrived." The Soviet people initially believed that the war against Germany was a war of defense against aggression to protect their homeland, and now that they have achieved victory, they believe that the purpose of the centuries-old struggle has been accomplished. This national sentiment cannot be insulted. In a country like Russia, even Stalin can hardly shift this national sentiment and remobilize the people to participate in the Pacific War. Stalin and the Soviet people eagerly hope to establish a solid state of peace around their country. This can also be seen from the statement issued to Britain, America, France, and Chongqing on the Syrian issue, which provides a clear clue. Now, in such a small country on the Mediterranean coast, the flames of war are beginning to burn again. The Soviet government is vociferously calling this insignificant war a violation of the spirit of the Crimean Conference and proposing that urgent measures be taken to restore peace. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's desire for peace is extremely fervent.

Second, if participating in the Pacific War is closely related to the survival and independence of the Slavic people, they would naturally be willing to fight at all costs. However, the Soviet Union's interests in the Far East are not only several times more distant than the distance from Moscow to Berlin to Tokyo, but also Japan is not currently threatening the independence and survival of the Slavic people. What is particularly important is that the Soviet Union believes that the Pacific War is an imperialist war between Japan and the United States to seize the Chinese market, and of course it will not set foot in a place it deems shameful. Many people believe that when the Japanese army stationed in Manchuria is partly transferred due to the tense situation, the Soviet Union may demand the rights and interests of the former Tsarist Russia and take advantage of the situation. In addition, we must also consider the various conspiracies of the United States to constantly entice the Soviet Union to participate in the war. However, the Soviet Union today is less concerned with obtaining a part of the rights and interests than with obtaining the rights and interests of the entire world, so it is unlikely to be manipulated by the United States.

Third, the Soviet Union's neutral attitude towards the Pacific War itself plays an incalculably important role in European issues. For example, on the Polish issue, the Tito regime's occupation of Trieste, the Austrian Renner regime issue, etc., in order to make Britain and the United States concede, the Soviet Union can use its undecided attitude towards Japan as a bargaining chip, which is particularly effective.

In summary of the above three points, I believe that the Soviet Union will not participate in the Pacific War as long as it is not subjected to any act of provocation. (To be continued)

Weekly Commentary

### To the Japanese Thought

— Mo Wen

I left Tokyo in April, when the cherry blossoms were just beginning to bloom, and now it is the season of continuous rain in Jiangnan. During my years in Japan, I received considerable education in scholarship and thought, and I deeply miss all the professors in the Japanese intellectual circle with whom I had many opportunities to contact. On the one hand, I am constantly worried about the safety of the professors under the air raids, and on the other hand, I imagine the situation of the professors striving hard in today's difficult situation.

Looking back, the debate between Mr. Murofushi Takanobu and Mr. Hu Shih before the Incident was very famous, and it still leaves an indelible impression today. After the Incident, Mr. Murofushi also repeatedly wrote letters to the Chinese intellectual class, and many Japanese thinkers also had many similar writings, the main point of which was to point out the necessity of Sino-Japanese cooperation or to hope that the Chinese people would reflect. Unfortunately, I have never been moved by this kind of writing published by the Japanese intellectual circle after the Incident. I think, perhaps the general feeling of the Chinese intellectual class is just like this.

However, I have received profound enlightenment from a few thinkers, which is also an undeniable fact. Perhaps the published writings inevitably have elements of embellishment, and personal conversations are more sincere. Perhaps because of the trend of speech, it is necessary to strengthen the superior tone, and without true concern for the country and the people, the enthusiasm cannot be fully expressed. However, because of this incident, there is still an undeniable gap left in the intellectual circles between China and Japan, which is a great pity.

Today, the time has come when we must sincerely confide in each other and jointly seek to resolve this unprecedented crisis. Why should we have elements of embellishment now? Why should we deliberately put on a superior tone? Japanese intellectuals and friends, now is not the time to seek response with words or to gain reflection with teachings. It is indeed time to speak truthfully and honestly, and to seek sincerity with sincerity.

Two

Last month, the Shanghai newspapers reprinted Mr. Nakayama Yu's essays. Of course, this was not a waste of paper. Many Chinese readers had carefully read them, but what was the response to this article? Superficially, it may not have been as enthusiastic as Mr. Nakayama expected. However, I believe that in the bottom of the readers' hearts, there is indeed an unexpressed response. Whether there is disgust or resonance in this response, in short, it can still be admitted that Mr. Nakayama himself is truthful and sincere.

However, Mr. Nakayama's position, in addition to being personal, also has official duties, so even if he has sufficient truthfulness and sincerity, he cannot be free from various constraints. However, why are the figures in the Japanese intellectual circle, whose position is more free than Mr. Nakayama, silent on the Sino-Japanese issue in today's urgent situation?

A few years ago, the theories of East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere and integrated body were widely discussed, and Chinese magazines and newspapers also discussed them. However, now it seems like an era has passed. Apart from the speculation of the war situation, there is no construction of theory. It is said that Dr. Kada Tetsuji, who was temporarily regarded as a theorist of co-prosperity in Japan, recently came to Shanghai. Apart from discussing the current economic problems or writing "The Character of Modern Japan," he did not publish any other grand texts. From this, it can be seen that Japanese thought and the Chinese people are no longer just saying what they want to say. They are quietly observing the current situation between China and Japan, and are gradually changing. In today's silence, it can be seen that they are preparing to speak truthfully and honestly. I hope that this guess is correct, and I hope that Japanese thought can quickly publish truthful and sincere opinions from silent reflection.

Also, it is said that Mr. Yoshiyama Toyu, who has been active in Shanghai's public opinion with long treatises in recent years, has returned to Shanghai from Japan. In Shanghai today, where prices are rising and the situation is complicated, of course, Mr. Yoshiyama has unavoidable remarks to make. Moreover, Mr. Yoshiyama has experienced the wartime homeland this time and has returned to Shanghai again, and his feelings are of course more profound. I hope that Mr. Yoshiyama can use his unique worldview to represent the Japanese intellectual circle and show his face again in China.

Three

Now is the season of plum rain, and the Japanese intellectual circle may also be brewing in depression. I hope that the Japanese intellectual circle, which bears the "knowing the machine is like a god," can bravely take on the responsibility, eliminate the embellishments of the past and the superior tone, and meet with Chinese readers with truthfulness and sincerity.

I deeply miss the Japanese intellectuals. If they can write words that are truthful and every word is to the point in today's urgent situation, they will be able to open a new path for the future of China and Japan.

I remember that Okakura Tenshin wrote "The Awakening of Japan" when the Russo-Japanese War was in full swing. Japan should now also have thinkers with the spirit and vision of Tenshin, who can, on the one hand, add to Tenshin's unseen current stage of "The Awakening of Japan," and on the other hand, realize Tenshin's first sentence of "The Ideal of the Orient," the famous teaching of "Asia is one."

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency telegram) – The Japanese Kure Naval Base announced at 11:30 AM on the 22nd that approximately 280 enemy B-29 aircraft, in formations of nine to thirty-two planes in nine echelons, invaded the Kure area from an altitude of five to six thousand meters between 9:30 AM and 11:40 AM on the 22nd, dropping bombs on military facilities before retreating southward. During the attack, the Japanese ground anti-aircraft fire fully demonstrated its power, and as of now, the confirmed results are as follows: eight planes shot down and three damaged in the Kure area, and one plane shot down in the Kochi area. Damage to Japanese facilities and naval vessels was slight.

Fukuoka Airfield and Ibaraki Airfield Attacked

Fukuoka, 23rd (Central News Agency telegram) – Approximately twenty enemy F6F fighter planes and seven rocket-powered P-38 fighter planes from the Okinawa base invaded from the direction of Koshiki Island in several formations at 7:40 AM on the 23rd, strafing airfields around Fukuoka and dropping bombs in mountainous areas of Nagasaki Prefecture before retreating southward at 8:30 AM.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency telegram) – At 12:30 PM on the 23rd, approximately seventy-five P-51 fighter planes, led by three B-29 aircraft, moved northward along the Izu Islands. The main force of fifty planes invaded the mainland near Mito and Kujukuri Beach, attacking airfields in Ibaraki Prefecture, and retreated from Kujukuri Beach at around 2:00 PM. There was almost no damage to the Japanese side.

Japanese Small and Medium-Sized Cities Possess Strong Resilience

Tokyo, 23rd (Correspondent's Telegram) – The American Air Force, which had been indiscriminately bombing large Japanese cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Kobe, and Yokohama, has now gradually shifted its focus, successively devastating historically significant small and medium-sized cities such as Shizuoka, Fukuoka, Hamamatsu, and Kagoshima, changing their original appearance. In the future, enemy air raids on these small and medium-sized cities will continue with their characteristic insane and brutal nature. However, when we observe the demeanor of the small and medium-sized cities that have suffered these disasters, they are actually different from the disaster areas of large cities. The result is to inspire the Japanese people to exert their fighting spirit and accelerate production. Taking the emerging Shizuoka as an example, Shizuoka was originally a city with feminine beauty. Although it suffered a major fire in 1940 and an earthquake at the end of last year, it was able to rebuild itself into a magnificent city with a strong fighting spirit. On the 20th, the enemy dropped incendiary bombs on the city, as if raining down. When the alert was lifted at 4:00 AM, the police officers and police training school students waiting in the prefectural office were divided into several teams, one team heading into the city and the other towards the outskirts. The team heading into the city provided comprehensive assistance to the disaster victims. The teams heading towards the outskirts sped off on motorcycles or tricycles to summon the volunteer corps in the nearby towns and villages. The women's volunteer corps, loaded with rice balls, rode in trucks from the outskirts to Shizuoka City. The Shimizu City team was the first to arrive, followed by the fire and defense volunteer corps from Fujieda, Shimada, Numazu, and Mishima, who jointly carried out firefighting work. By around 4:00 PM that afternoon, all roads were cleaned and tidied up. The rice balls made by the women's volunteer corps were exceptionally abundant, and by around 9:00 AM, the disaster victims had each obtained warm rice balls for breakfast. The towns and villages nearby that had not suffered war damage also actively contributed, offering food. Resting places for the disaster victims were designated in the suburbs. As a result, Shizuoka Station was not in a state of chaos, and there were no special restrictions. At certain factories and ironworks of major military-industrial significance, more than 80% of the workers had settled their families with relatives and friends in the suburbs by that evening and returned to the factories, and production began on the 21st without delay. This air raid did cause considerable damage, but the citizens of Shizuoka did not waste a moment. From this, we can see the strong resilience of Japanese small cities.

### Agreement Reached on the Organization of Polish United Government

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency telegram) – According to an official Moscow announcement today: An agreement has been reached on the organization of the Polish United Government.

### Section Chief Shimada Reveals Enemy American Conspiracy Against Chongqing - Making Every Effort to Expand Sphere of Influence

Colonel Shimada, head of the Shanghai Japanese Army Reporting Section, made the following statement at yesterday afternoon's press conference regarding the joint statement issued by the American diplomatic and military representatives stationed in Chongqing:

Joint Statement Desires to Cover Up

According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch on June 20, the content of the joint statement issued by US Ambassador to Chongqing Hurley and US Military Commander in Chongqing Wedemeyer stated that the rumors that there were differences of opinion between ourselves and our subordinates, or even in public and private matters, were pure fabrications and that even if we have differing opinions, we will be able to resolve them satisfactorily. American diplomats and military representatives in China are currently working together diligently and will continue to do so in the future. Upon investigation, the sudden public announcement of this joint statement indicates that its contents are not as simple as they appear. The statement's attempt to strongly deny any discord between the two, or any differences of opinion between subordinates or in public and private matters, only reveals that the issue is not as simple as it seems. It is clear that since the appointment of Stilwell, there has been no complete agreement between the American diplomatic and military sides in Chongqing. At that time, Stilwell made strong demands to Chongqing, which were met with vigorous opposition from Chongqing and the American diplomatic mission. Wedemeyer's appointment seems to have eased the atmosphere slightly, but the issue has not yet been completely resolved.

American Military Observers in Chongqing's Power

When Stilwell was in office, the United States made every effort to expand its sphere of influence in Chongqing, both militarily and economically. For example, the American military stationed in Chongqing was often disliked by Chongqing, and the Chongqing army in the war zone repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the American soldiers' arrogance and comfortable lifestyle. The New York Times correspondent in Chongqing also clearly stated this. However, after Wedemeyer's arrival, he ignored the criticisms and, in mid-May, moved two American divisions in North Burma to Zhijiang, which marked the beginning of the American army's presence in Chongqing. Initially, the American army's arrogance in considering themselves superior white people was even greater, and at the same time, in order to defend the South, they even asked Chiang Kai-shek to blockade 60,000 Communist troops, which Chiang agreed to, creating the biggest political problem for Chongqing in recent months. Since the arrival of the US Tenth Army in Chongqing, Wedemeyer's direct negotiations with Chongqing on military matters have become even more stubborn. Chongqing has already severely criticized Stilwell in the past, but Wedemeyer seems to be gradually falling into Stilwell's footsteps, which shows the general intentions of the United States towards Chongqing. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 20th, Wedemeyer decided to establish an American tactical command in the Chinese theater of war, which is proof of American aggression. Regarding the issue of lending military supplies to Chongqing, Wedemeyer has the right to speak when Chongqing can use them, and Yan'an has recently expressed strong dissatisfaction with Chongqing's rent-seeking military supplies. The American diplomatic mission in Chongqing has been contacting the Chongqing government to tolerate it temporarily.

Enemy American Conspiracy is Quite Obvious

According to the agreement on the plan to assist the Chongqing army in reorganization by the American military stationed in Chongqing, the purpose is to strengthen the Chongqing army. He Yingqin is the commander, and the American side has appointed McLoghlin to assist He. However, according to a New York newspaper report, Stilwell opposed the transfer of the American military stationed in Burma to Chongqing to prevent the Yunnan Plateau, and also made statements regarding the use of internal war. Hurley, on the other hand, had to speak out for the Chongqing government. In short, based on this joint statement, the United States is superficially assisting Chongqing, but its conspiracy to regard China as an American colony is quite obvious. Therefore, it is difficult for the Chongqing government to obtain American agreement when it makes a claim.

### Banking and Money Industry Conference Decides to Stop Using Bank Drafts, Notice to All Banks and Firms Effective July 3

The banking and money industry in this city previously faced a shortage of cash. The member banks and firms have been using bank drafts from the Union Treasury to make adjustments, but these drafts have been circulating in the market, transferred and accepted. There have been delays in presenting them for payment, and the amount is quite large. The bank drafts issued by each bank and firm have been insufficiently prudent, leading to frequent cases of counterfeit bank drafts in the market. Merchants have also taken the opportunity to discount them for profit, which is inappropriate. In order to strengthen the financial system and ensure security, a joint meeting of the banking and money industry was convened on the 20th of this month, jointly deciding to stop using bank drafts for interbank transactions starting from July 3. At the same time, the meeting also discussed the large amount of cash needed by each bank and firm for business operations in the future. After the理事长 and监事会 of the two industry associations discussed the detailed implementation rules for stopping the use of bank drafts, they were separately decided, and the银钱库 formulated six measures for stopping the use of bank drafts for interbank transactions, which were officially notified to all member banks and firms for compliance. Furthermore, this measure by the banking and money industry is of great importance to the interests of the clients of each bank and firm. It is also planned to notify all clients in the near future to facilitate business.

### Chen Shizhang Discusses Food Supply Issues in Shanghai, and Studies Adjustments to the Control System

In order to strengthen the policy of controlling materials, the National Government decided to make stricter adjustments to the control policies for various major commodities in the second half of this year, so as to balance military and civilian needs and make operations smoother. It is also necessary to adjust the control mechanism. It is learned that Minister of Industry Chen has come to Shanghai recently and once studied the overall issue of adjusting the control mechanism with relevant parties, and made detailed discussions on various serious issues such as疏通 of rice sources and抑平 of commodity prices.

Freight Car Transportation of Rice Reduces Freight Charges

After the National Government implemented emergency rice countermeasures to stop purchasing and revoke shipping restrictions, the supply of civilian rice has become more smoothly, and rice prices have stopped rising and fallen back. The Central China Transportation Group (Central China Railway), in order to assist this countermeasure, decided to reduce freight charges for freight car transportation of rice by 20% starting from June 24, so as to make rice transportation smoother and relieve the Shanghai citizens' food supply panic.

### Stamp Tax Bureau Prohibits Underpayment of Stamp Tax

The Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol, because the merchants in the city do not issue receipts for daily door-to-door transactions, underpaying stamp tax, or even issue invoices without affixing stamp tax, has become a common practice. Previously, merchants were repeatedly advised to comply with regulations and affix stamp tax in full, and not to neglect it, so as to重視 national tax and avoid punishment. However, since April 15 of this year, when the Finance Bureau of the Municipal Government stipulated the filling out of special tax invoices, merchants have often misinterpreted this, thinking that filling out special tax invoices for customers exempts them from affixing stamp tax. There are even those who fill out self-made double-form invoices stamped with the Finance Bureau's seal, neither handing them over to customers nor actually affixing stamp tax, thinking that they can be used for checking special taxes. There are many tricks to evade taxes, which is very wrong and should be corrected immediately. Therefore, all merchants are once again warned that whether they fill out special tax invoices stipulated by the Finance Bureau or self-made double-form invoices for door-to-door sales, they must comply with the regulations to affix stamp tax in full, and absolutely must not omit any. If they continue to violate this deliberately, or deliberately do not issue invoices, once discovered, they will be transferred to the court and fined 500 times the amount of tax evaded, according to the recently passed tax evasion penalties of the National Defense Conference.

### Summer Health Movement to Open Tomorrow

Leading Baotian personnel and other personnel from various agencies will hold a major cleanup. From the same day to the 30th, the Health Exhibition will be held at the Youth Association on Ningxia Road at the same time, open to the public for visiting. Every night at 8:00 PM, health experts will be invited to give special lectures in the auditorium of the Youth Association. The topics are as follows: Day 1: Leprosy, Day 2: Tuberculosis Prevention, Day 3: Summer Health Knowledge, Day 4: Nutrition, Day 5: Typhoid and Dysentery, Day 6: Rabies. Those who wish to attend the lectures can first obtain admission tickets from the Youth Association Exhibition. Hygiene movies will be shown from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM.

### City School Staff Salaries to be Changed to One Bag of Flour

The Economic Bureau has scheduled the distribution of salary rice certificates for the municipal schools,馆 teaching staff, and staff for May and the first half of June from the 23rd of this month to July 6th. The city's education bureau issued all the above salary rice certificates from the 20th to the 23rd. It is learned that the Economic Bureau approved the issuance of one bag of No. 1 flour per person for the salary rice of the staff of each school and馆 in April, and it is also scheduled to be issued at the Qimen Road Public Sales Office from the 23rd of this month to July 6th. The City Education Bureau has scheduled to issue the second batch of salary rice certificates from the 25th to the 27th. Each school and馆 should immediately fill out the sales report and the总收据, each on one sheet, according to the on-duty staff in April, and receive the second batch of salary rice certificates from the Education Bureau, transfer them to each staff member, and take them to the Qimen Road Public Sales Office. Each certificate can be used to get a bag of flour for free.

### Establishment of Consumer Supply Society to Improve the Lives of Civil Servants

The plan is for the municipal government to provide funds to purchase relatively　 affordable daily necessities to distribute to civil servants within the government. It is learned that the municipal government has appointed Deputy Secretary-General Hu Zewu as the director of the society to prepare for everything, with the aim of officially establishing it by the end of June.

### Industrial and Commercial Registration Must Not be Delegated

The City Economic Bureau has been very strict in handling industrial and commercial registration since it started handling it itself. It has recently been rectified to make it more meticulous. It is heard that all industrial and commercial firms in this city who need to apply for registration must go directly to the bureau to apply, and must not delegate or　辦, so as to 核发 the certificate quickly, and to prevent all kinds of abuses. It has recently been heard that one or two trade associations claim that they can handle the registration on behalf of the firms. This is not true. It is hoped that all industrial and commercial circles in this city will pay attention to this in order to avoid losses.

### China Salt Industry Company to Close at End of Month

### News Association Held Current Affairs Lecture Yesterday - Captain Matsumoto and Others Gave Speeches

The Shanghai branch of the China News Association held a current affairs lecture yesterday (the 23rd) at 5:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel. Captain Matsumoto of the Allied Fleet Press Department, as well as Mr. Akiyama and Mr. Uzaki, were invited to speak. Captain Matsumoto, Mr. Akiyama, and Mr. Uzaki were specially invited to attend. They were received by Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Branch Council, and Chen Riping, Director and Secretary-General of the Council. Over 500 guests from the cultural and educational sectors attended.

Chairman's Address

First, Chairman Chen Riping delivered an opening address, stating: "The current war situation is becoming increasingly urgent, especially the battle on the eastern sea of Okinawa. The enemy Americans have invaded Okinawa and have been fighting for over eighty days. The Japanese army is bravely resisting, causing significant damage to the enemy Americans. The deaths of important commanders such as General Buckner, commander of the US Tenth Army, and Acting Division Commander Ishlai of the 96th Division, who participated in the Okinawa campaign, show the fierceness of the offensive and defensive battles at the time. However, in the past, we have only seen this situation in the newspapers. To give everyone a detailed understanding and recognition of the current situation, we have specially invited Captain Matsumoto and Mr. Akiyama and Mr. Uzaki, who are involved in Allied reporting."

Lecture Circumstances

Mr. Uzaki and Mr. Akiyama then delivered clear lectures on the trends after the Okinawa battle and the possibility of mainland China operations. They estimated the time it would take for the enemy's American forces in Europe to move to Asia, pointing out their attempt to use Chinese manpower to fight against Japan. The latter also elaborated on the difficulties of transporting American aid to the Chongqing army, pointing out that the materials were scarce. Based on the enemy Americans' troop strength, he considered their mainland China operations to be a natural course of action, but cautioned that we should pay attention to the dangerous schemes behind it and take strict precautions. Finally, Captain Matsumoto gave a speech entitled "The Destiny of East Asia and the Mission of Youth." After the speech, a musical film was shown, and the meeting adjourned after three hours.

Captain Matsumoto's Speech

The past and future developments of the Pacific war situation have already been clarified by Mr. Akiyama and Mr. Uzaki, so there is no need for further explanation. I will focus on examining the future of East Asia and the mission of youth. Originally, Asian nations were rural communal societies, living in harmony with nature. It was only after the introduction of European and American culture that they became modern, English-American style societies. Of course, in addition to the harm, the so-called European and American culture also has many aspects that can develop Oriental culture. However, the methods and paths by which China and Japan accepted European and American culture were inappropriate, leading them astray into "making a living under English and American culture."

English and American Forces Promoted Conflict

The reason for the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident in 1937 was, in essence, caused by the struggle between the different English and American forces in China and Japan. Now that the Sino-Japanese Incident has occurred, in order to resolve it, we must urgently eradicate the remaining English and American forces in both countries. Therefore, Japan promoted the incident under this subject, so the Greater East Asia War was launched, which is also an inevitable historical phenomenon. Japan's most important objectives in fighting against England and the United States were to destroy England and the United States and to resolve the Sino-Japanese problem, eliminating the English and American forces in Japan. However, in the early stages of the Greater East Asia War, after the Japanese army gained considerable victories in the Pacific, the country forgot the important task of "resolving the Sino-Japanese problem and eliminating the English and American forces in the country." As such, Japan's understanding of the evolution of the situation was lacking, leading to the situation from the start of the American counter-offensive in 1942 to the present.

At this point, the Japanese people and leaders began to repeatedly consider the necessity of researching and solving the Sino-Japanese problem and adjusting the domestic situation, and began to work hard. As the saying goes, "Worry and hard work can revitalize a country," and Japan is just like that.

At the same time, when we look at China again, there is the National Government and the two regimes of Chongqing and Yan'an, forming a tripartite balance of power. Now Japan is seriously observing and trying to find appropriate ways to solve and adjust various problems. With a sincere and introspective attitude, we are moving forward on a new path, and we have great expectations for China's efforts and struggles. At this time of transition, we should recall Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, and not let the war situation confuse our vision. We should work realistically for the path that should be followed in the future.

Chinese and Japanese Youth Work Together

In the future, those who will truly bear the responsibility of leading Greater East Asia are the Chinese nation and the Japanese nation. Since the 17th century, in order to support world culture, two world wars have occurred, and now we are on the verge of destruction. German Dr. Stepaula said: "European culture is gradually declining, and a new culture will rise from the Pacific, bringing the light of dawn to the whole of Asia. That is China and Japan, and the driving force is the youth of China and Japan, youth with excellent ideas." There is a Japanese saying: "Young students should study hard and play hard." But in addition, they should have ambitions for the current situation and future of China, so that they can become a community for the revival of East Asia and the construction of East Asia in the future. We believe that the above are common tasks for China and Japan to work together.

### Special Gold Tax to be Levied from July 1st - 0.5% to be Levied on the Actual Transaction Amount

In order to enrich the city treasury revenue, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government formulated temporary measures for levying a special tax on gold. These measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan, then to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval, and have been publicly announced by the Yuan and ordered to be implemented by the Municipal Finance Bureau. A gold special tax collection committee has also been established. It is now known that the date for the collection of the gold special tax has been set for July 1st. The tax rate will be 0.5% of the actual transaction amount, with half collected from the buyer and half from the seller. It is also known that gold securities will not be taxed because they are issued by the state.

Registration of Gold Trading Businesses

There is no organization for gold trading businesses in this city, so they should be managed and rectified. The registration of management matters for trading businesses has been ordered by the Municipal Government to be handled separately by the Economic Bureau and the Finance Bureau. Standards for registration and licensing have been drafted in accordance with Article 2 of the published regulations, and registration is required within a limited time for management purposes. In the future, all gold trading businesses operating in the city, whether or not they have been registered in the past, must apply for registration and licensing in accordance with the regulations. However, this is limited to those who have operated gold businesses, and outsiders are not allowed to apply, in order to show restrictions and avoid speculation.

Changning Police Bureau Seizes Black Market Tickets

Yao Benyuan, the head of the Changning District Police Branch in this city, has strictly ordered his subordinates to pay close attention to the police stationed at the four stations in the jurisdiction, and to report any illegal activities of black marketeers and the oppression of the people by black market tickets. At around 4:00 PM on the 23rd of this month, Zhou, a patrolling officer stationed at the station, discovered that Tan Ma, Ma Hu, Han, and Jiang, three female third-class passengers who were going to Jiaxing, were holding tickets purchased from the black market. Upon questioning, it was revealed that they had been purchased from the black marketeer Hu Jinke for 4,000 yuan each, a price clearly from the black market. The criminal Hu was immediately arrested and transferred to the District Procuratorate for handling. The money defrauded from the victims was returned in full by the management bureau.

County Management Office Urges Compilation of County Administration Reports

The County Administration Office previously stated that the content of the work reports sent by the counties and districts was scattered, the descriptions were not detailed enough, and the formats were inconsistent. In order to achieve uniformity, a table of contents for the administration overview was specified, and all were instructed to comply, re-draft, and submit the report for verification within one week of receiving the document. Now, it has been found that the above reports have been overdue for a long time and have not yet been submitted, which is a serious delay. The office is now about to draft a four-month work report since its establishment. All administrative situations in the counties, as well as relevant survey tables, are to be included separately. Therefore, another order is issued urging the detailed drafting of the administration overview report in accordance with the previously received table of contents, and it must be submitted for verification within five days of receiving the document, without delay.

### Private School Teachers and Staff Eagerly Await Special Rice Allocation

It is a well-known fact that teachers and staff in education lead a hard life. Therefore, they have gained the sympathy of the public, and they have also received decent treatment from the authorities, giving them the same treatment as civil servants, enjoying key allocations. Employees of regional private schools can receive a special allocation of three *dou* of rice per month.

However, in reality, three *dou* per month has never been received. Moreover, since the supplementary issuance of one *dou* and five *sheng* for the first half of March (thirteenth period) in mid-May, more than a month has passed, and there has been no news of continued issuance.

At a time when prices are rising crazily, the salary of teachers and staff for a semester is only enough to buy one *dou* of rice - or even less than one *dou*. Without the enjoyment of special rice allocations, how can they maintain their lives?

Police officers and municipal school employees have already been given their salary rice for June. Why is it that employees of private schools have not yet received the allocation for the second half of March, causing general employees to be greatly threatened by their livelihoods!

Currently, schools have begun final exams, and teachers and staff are relatively busy. They hope that the authorities will consider their hard lives and issue the special rice allocation for private school teachers and staff in advance, and hope to make up for April, May, and June, in order to stabilize the lives of more than 10,000 people, and prevent them from neglecting their duties during this end-of-semester period due to worrying about their lives. This is the utmost hope. (Jin Yuan)

### Commemorating the Seventh-Seventh Memorial Service - Donations to Help the Needy

Reader Hasegawa Gitaro from Allied Nations writes: "Dear Sir, I am writing to inform you that on the occasion of the seventh-seventh day after my late wife's death, I am sending 50,000 yuan in savings, which I would like you to distribute to your charity funds for poverty relief, small education medical aid, small capital loans, medical aid, and childbirth assistance, 10,000 yuan each, to help the needy and to leave a memorial." Hasegawa's enthusiasm for charitable deeds is worthy of admiration.

### Origins of the Student Mutual Aid Association

Seeing the increasing number of young people dropping out of school, well-known figures in this city, including Lin Kangyi, Yuan Ludeng, and Shen Siliang, have sponsored the development of welfare programs. The origins of the association are recorded below: "Prices are rising, and life is becoming more difficult, especially for the education sector, which has been greatly affected. As the ancients said, 'Saving the dying leaves no time to govern rites and righteousness.' What the world sees is mostly short-term gains and quick success, while the education that forms the foundation of the country is often ignored. However, there is also the hardship of helplessness. The greatest desire of people is to survive. Only when the conditions for survival are complete can one attend to other things. It has never been heard that starving to death is a small matter, and dropping out of school is a big matter. Moreover, in addition to the tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by schools, the students themselves also have to bear significant expenses. Therefore, the burden on parents is heavier, the number of students dropping out of school is increasing, and the cultural level is declining. Seeing this, we and others have received generous donations from enthusiastic people in this city and enthusiastic support from various organizations, so we have formed this association, contributing our meager efforts, calling for support from all parties, and further expecting our classmates to participate in order to seek mutual assistance. As for the current plans of the association, there are student clubs and student announcements."

(The association's office is located at Room 107, 2nd Floor, 267 Jiangxi Road. The association's rules can be obtained by mail or in person.)
