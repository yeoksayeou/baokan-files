Tokyo, 15th - Central News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 15th, regarding the situation in Lingayen Gulf, as follows: (1) Enemy forces are gradually approaching the Japanese positions on both sides of the Bangasinan plain from the vicinity of the coast. (2) Another portion of the enemy forces landed near Damortis, north of San Fabian, on January 11th. Japanese ground forces are engaging them in a counterattack. On the 11th and 12th, the following losses were inflicted on the enemy in the vicinity: Over 14 landing craft sunk or destroyed, and over 1,000 personnel killed or wounded. (3) Japanese air units continue to attack enemy ships. The confirmed results of the attacks on January 12th are as follows: 7 transport ships sunk, 4 heavily damaged and ablaze, and 1 destroyer destroyed. Japanese losses: several Special Attack Flight teams, and 2 other planes not returned. (4) A Japanese submarine sank a battleship in the waters west of Luzon Island on January 12th.

Philippine Front, 16th - Central News Agency: In addition to advancing from Lingayen towards Aguilar, enemy forces have also landed at Damortis and San Fabian, attacking the Bangasinan plain head-on. They are attempting to invade the Bangasinan plain from the north and southwest via the Brod River area, with the main enemy effort gradually focusing on the Brod River. The enemy seems to be targeting the fortress of Manao, 10 kilometers east of the Brod River, for their main crossing assault, attacking Japanese positions north and northwest of the Brod River. However, due to vigorous Japanese counterattacks, they have been largely repulsed, with enemy forces only advancing through gaps in the Japanese lines. The enemy appears intimidated by the strong Japanese positions north of the Brod River, and is using local people to guard their own positions and harass the Japanese rear, etc. However, the main Japanese forces remain strong, preventing the enemy's advance, and are poised to crush them in one fell swoop, awaiting their opportunity. On the 13th night, a fierce artillery barrage struck enemy supply depots near Damortis, causing explosions throughout the night.

Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Discusses the Battle South of Lingayen

Japanese Base in the Philippines, 15th - Central News Agency: The battle south of Lingayen is extremely fierce. A Japanese Lieutenant Colonel who recently returned to a certain base after inspecting the front lines described the situation in the Lingayen battlefield in the two days following the enemy landing, as follows: When I arrived at a certain high ground east of Lingayen on the afternoon of the 10th, I saw approximately 300 enemy landing craft entering the gulf. Adding the enemy ships outside the gulf, the total number was approximately 600 or more. Nine-tenths of these craft were carrying troops, while the rest were carrying tanks and landing equipment, entering the gulf in an endless stream. The Japanese remained silent and waited for the opportune moment to strike. At 5:30 PM, they launched a simultaneous attack on the enemy ships. At that time, one enemy ship sank. In an instant, the air above the battlefield was filled with smoke, and countless large enemy ships were engulfed in flames. Subsequently, the Japanese artillery fire became even more intense. By 6:00 PM, the enemy ships, seeing the unfavorable situation, attempted to retreat towards the mouth of the gulf. The Japanese unleashed a fierce artillery barrage, and the enemy also subjected Japanese positions to heavy naval bombardment and aerial attacks. The Lingayen headland was transformed into a bloody, ghostly, and grim battlefield. The artillery duel continued until dawn the next day. During this time, enemy landing forces, centered around San Fabian, moved within a five-kilometer-wide area, engaging in fierce field battles with the Japanese front lines defending the eastern high ground. On the 11th, the enemy continued to desperately land reinforcements, using two large destroyers or cruisers, ten large transport ships, fifteen smaller transport ships under 5,000 tons, and dozens of landing craft to enter the sea between Damortis and San Fabian. The enemy aircraft attacks were also relentless. The Japanese front-line soldiers' fighting spirit grew even more intense, invigorating the entire special attack force, launching a fierce counterattack against the enemy reinforcements, and inflicting heavy losses.

Burma Front, 16th - Central News Agency: Japanese forces inflicted heavy losses on the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Army's Seventh Division, which attempted to enter Burma along the Yunnan-Burma Highway at Wanting, a key point on the Sino-Burmese border. The Chongqing army, attempting to break through the border, crossed the Longchuan River near Muse with a portion of the 53rd Army, and even attempted to attack Wanting. The Japanese forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack, ultimately forcing them to retreat. Furthermore, the main force of the Chongqing Tenth Army Group, launching an attack from the east of Wanting, concentrated artillery fire under the cover of fighter planes, launching a fierce assault. Consequently, tank warfare has recently intensified. The local Japanese forces, in response, infiltrated Chongqing army positions with suicide attack squads, disrupting their artillery positions. They also lured the main force of the Chongqing army, attempting to break through the Japanese lines, to the front lines, and then launched a devastating attack, inflicting heavy losses on the Chongqing army, ultimately repelling them. From the 1st to the 12th, the Japanese side recovered 764 corpses of Chongqing soldiers. Therefore, from all perspectives, the casualties of the Yunnan Expeditionary Army in the defense of Wanting are estimated to be at least 23,000 or more. Due to repeated failures, the morale of the Yunnan Expeditionary Army has further declined.

### Minister of Home Affairs Ōta Worships at the Ise Shrine. Christians Outraged

Tokyo, 16th - Central News Agency: Minister of Home Affairs Ōta formally worshiped at the Ise Grand Shrine on the 15th, offering thanks to the great deity and praying for the destruction of Britain and America.

Tokyo, 16th - Central News Agency: The bombing of the Ise Shrine in Japan by enemy B-29 aircraft has aroused extreme resentment among the Japanese people. Even Christians throughout Japan are extremely indignant at this brutal act by the American military. Recently, Mr. Tomita Mitsuru, the Secretary General of the Japan Christian Council, stated as follows: The bombing of the Ise Shrine by enemy aircraft confirms that Americans have no religious sensibility, and it is a serious desecration of the divine. Japanese Christians have lost faith in the religious heart of the Americans, and it is believed that worldwide public opinion will feel the same. The enemy not only destroyed religious buildings in Germany and Italy, but also targeted similar buildings in Manila for bombing. Just as with the bombing of the Ise Shrine this time, this kind of barbarity has ignited extraordinary anger among the Japanese people. From this, all Japanese Christians understand that the American religious heart is only a formality. In the past, the enemy, America, sent many missionaries to China and various places in the South to preach Christianity, promoting their politics and exploiting religion. However, once war broke out, they took off their masks and did not hesitate to desecrate the divine. America, with such barbarity, has lost its qualification to preach in the world in the future. This American, who desecrates the divine and is the enemy of mankind, will sooner or later be destroyed by the punishment of the gods.

### Hubei Intensifies Winter Defense

Hankou, 16th - Central News Agency: As it is currently the critical period for winter defense and air defense, the provincial government believes that this year's winter defense work is particularly important. Therefore, yesterday, it separately instructed all counties to intensify winter defense work, and to protect distressed civilians separately. Subsequently, the police and security departments of each county, in addition to maintaining local security according to past precedents, should also establish emergency communication between neighboring townships.

### Japan's Defense Fortifications are Solid; Fire Fighting Equipment is Complete

Tokyo, 16th - Central News Agency: Every time B-29 aircraft raid Japan, they inevitably suffer great losses, while the losses suffered by Japan are extremely slight. The reason is none other than the solidity of Japan's defense fortifications. Here is an example: The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department specially established a fire brigade and a security brigade last year. Recently, the strength of both teams has been greatly increased. The number of personnel in the fire brigade has been increased by 2.5 times, and the number of water pumps has been increased by about 1.5 times. The necessary fire fighting equipment has been completed. In addition, the entire Tokyo has been divided into 13 districts. Under the commander of each district, a unit is formed by four fire stations to prevent any unexpected fire. The security brigade takes the headquarters as the operational command center. Under the headquarters, more than 30 police stations in the old city are supervised, with the Central Battalion as the head, and the Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern, and Southwestern Battalions, which supervise the police stations in the new districts, have been arranged in a perfect formation. At the same time, these six battalions are organized into company organizations. Only the Central Battalion has three companies, while the other battalions each have two companies. Each company is further divided into two platoons, and each platoon is divided into four squads. Also, in terms of the team members, their average age is lower than that of lower-level police officers. Most of them are young people in their twenties or forties, or brave soldiers who have returned from the front lines of the army and navy. Therefore, those who are willing to participate, or those who have been carefully selected, are all excellent young people. Therefore, sending these elite police teams to the scene to extinguish fires or rescue victims is sure to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Japanese Flying Defense Aircraft Defend the Homeland

Tokyo, 16th - Central News Agency: Japanese fighter planes intercept B-29 aircraft raiding the Japanese mainland in the skies over Tokyo or the ocean, shooting down their so-called "unsinkable fortresses" and achieving brilliant results.

The Hiei aircraft has light and high speed. For example, when B-29 aircraft raided Tokyo on November 3, the Sugu aircraft, which dared to collide with it and shoot it down, and then returned safely, was also a Hiei aircraft.

In the future, I will follow the intentions of the past minister, following the old ways. As for the treatment of naval comrades in the future, I will try to improve it. I still hope that everyone will work hard together. After the speech, the entire Navy Department took a photo as a souvenir. The previous minister then left the Navy Department in the midst of military music, with the entire staff lining up to send him off respectfully.

Nanjing, 16th - Central News Agency: The new Minister of Propaganda, Zhao Zunyue, is scheduled to officially report to the ministry at 10:00 AM on the 17th, and will hold his first meeting with domestic and foreign journalists in the capital in the ministry's press room at 4:00 PM.

### Collecting Tuition Fees: Outline of Adjusted Measures; Ministry of Education Notifies Provinces and Cities to Comply

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In the last semester, various provinces and cities moderately increased tuition fees to improve the compensation of school teachers and staff. Considering that a few localities still collected tuition in rice or charged tuition based on rice prices, the Ministry of Education noted that with the soaring rice prices of today, this would only lead to a sharp increase in the number of students dropping out of school, which is highly unreasonable and should be strictly corrected. Therefore, the Ministry specially notified the provincial and municipal governments to stop all methods of collecting tuition in rice and charging fees based on rice prices. The Ministry of Education also formulated an outline of adjusted measures for tuition fees to be collected in various localities, which was distributed to the provincial and municipal governments for compliance. The outline of adjusted measures is as follows: (1) The tuition fee standards for each semester in public and private schools at all levels in various localities shall be carefully stipulated by the educational administrative authorities of each province and city, and all schools under their jurisdiction shall be strictly ordered to comply. (2) All tuition fees shall be collected in national currency as the unit, and rice or other materials shall not be used as the standard. All methods of collecting tuition in rice and charging based on rice prices shall be stopped. (3) Simplified primary schools and short-term primary schools implementing compulsory education, as well as all types of normal schools training teachers, shall not collect tuition fees. (4) The tuition fees collected shall be used to improve the compensation of teachers and staff in each school. The educational administrative authorities shall properly determine the distribution methods to ensure prompt disbursement. (5) The tuition fees charged by private schools should, in principle, not exceed one time the tuition fees stipulated for public schools in the same locality. If the local educational administrative authorities find that private schools are not complying with the regulations and are excessively charging exorbitant tuition fees, they should promptly stop them. (6) After collecting tuition fees, schools should not engage in soliciting donations or compulsory contributions, except for voluntary donations from students' families. Local educational administrative authorities should also pay attention to preventing this. (7) Each school should set up free tuition quotas to accommodate students from poor families. The proportion of these free quotas to the total number of students should be no less than 20% for primary schools, no less than 15% for secondary schools, and no less than 10% for colleges and universities, and should increase year by year. (8) The standards for school tuition fees stipulated by each province and city should be reported to the Ministry for record within one month before the start of each semester. Detailed methods for the distribution of tuition fees and the establishment of free tuition quotas should also be separately formulated by the competent educational administrative authorities and reported to the Ministry for record. (9) At the end of each semester, the educational administrative authorities of each province and city should compile a report on the collection and distribution of tuition fees and the establishment of free tuition quotas, and submit it to the Ministry for review. (10) This outline of measures shall be implemented from the date of its distribution to the provincial and municipal governments.

Editorial

### After Reading Secretary Luo's Inaugural Speech

The new Mayor of our city and Secretary-General officially took office the day before yesterday. We have already expressed some thoughts on Mayor Zhou's address to the citizens in yesterday's editorial. Today, we would like to further comment on Secretary-General Luo's speech at the time of his inauguration.

Secretary-General Luo pointed out that the key points of the city's administration in the future are the following three points:

1.  Work diligently and lead by example;
2.  Rectify discipline and practice clean governance;
3.  Increase production, stabilize people's livelihood, and cooperate with the Greater East Asia War.

The above three points are indeed what those in power should pay attention to and strive to achieve. Secretary-General Luo's fairness, integrity, and cleanness during his tenure as Minister of Justice and more recently as the head of Anhui Province are well known. His spirit of breaking through sentimentalism and courage is especially well-reputed. The difficult Shanghai municipal government is now headed by Mr. Zhou Fohai, who is not afraid of difficulties and is determined to work hard and apply the principle of "using severe penalties to govern a chaotic world," with Secretary-General Luo assisting him. We believe that the Shanghai municipal government will definitely be renewed in the future and become a model of governance within the peace zone. However, precisely because of the harsh environment in Shanghai, we hope that Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo will have a deep observation and careful plan for this matter beforehand, and then carry it out decisively. Then, the Shanghai municipal government will achieve brilliant results, which can be predicted.

The so-called burying oneself in hard work, we believe, is a working attitude that many Chinese political workers who are accustomed to superficiality must strive to adopt. Burying oneself in hard work should embody the spirit of tough work, practical work, and quick work. Hard work means being assiduous and enduring hardship, not being afraid of difficulties, and putting personal interests aside as long as it benefits the public; Tough work means being able to bear hardship without complaint, not being afraid of offending people, not being afraid of making enemies, and not avoiding any obstacles. It should be done as soon as it should be done, and it must be done if it can be done; Practical work means doing it in a down-to-earth manner, without being empty or hypocritical, being pragmatic and realistic, and only stopping after achieving concrete results; Quick work means being swift in making decisions and being decisive, without procrastination or dragging one's feet, doing it as soon as it is said, in order to achieve administrative efficiency in the shortest possible time. If these can be achieved, then there can be truly working people, and we believe that things will definitely be done well. And with Secretary-General Luo's special emphasis on leading by example, if all the superiors can follow this spirit and practice it personally, then the top will influence the bottom, and there will be no problem with the administration getting on track.

Rectifying discipline and practicing clean governance is what we have always advocated. We have repeatedly and emphatically called for rectifying discipline and establishing clean governance. Embezzlement and bribery are the tumors of today's politics. If they are not strictly rectified, the future will be unimaginable. Especially in Shanghai, where the remnants of Anglo-American imperialism have not been completely eliminated and extravagance and depravity are rampant, the need to rectify discipline and establish clean governance is even more urgent than in other places. We hope that Mayor Zhou, Secretary Luo, and other superiors will, on the one hand, do their best to increase the compensation of on-the-job staff to ensure their minimum living standards, and on the other hand, severely punish those irresponsible people who take advantage of their positions to engage in embezzlement and bribery and harm the people with resolute measures. Moreover, right and wrong must be fair, and rewards and punishments must be clear. Only under the principle of fairness and clarity can clean governance be truly established. In addition, the extravagant and dissolute lifestyle that is currently felt among the special class and the nouveau riche should also be strictly rectified. Shifting the unnecessary consumption of these people to proper use and transferring the special waste of a few people to the enjoyment of the majority of people is the most reasonable thing to do. The allocation of electricity is one example.

Regarding increasing production and stabilizing people's livelihood, although this is also a cliché, there are ultimately very few who can truly strive to do it. There are many difficulties in these two matters, but it is clear that not enough effort has been made in the past. Currently, various production industries in Shanghai are in extreme decline due to restrictions on electricity, difficulties in raw materials, and various other obstacles, and some are even on the verge of extinction. If we do not seek to save them urgently, the crisis is too deep. An active way to stabilize people's livelihood is to increase production, while suppressing and leveling prices is an emergency measure. In recent years, the suffering of citizens from high prices has been truly indescribable. High prices can even be said to be the source of all the current suffering of citizens. The rise in prices is certainly due to the lack of material sources, but the speculative merchants' stirring up trouble, the collusion and hoarding by unscrupulous officials, and the condoning of the pursuit of exorbitant profits should also bear great responsibility. Therefore, in the process of rectifying discipline, how to eliminate the evildoing of corrupt officials and merchants colluding with each other should be one of the main objectives. In this way, the people's livelihood can at least be prevented from deteriorating further, and more strength can be used to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War.

As for the aspect of compensation, they should consult with the mayor and find ways to improve it in order to secure a livelihood. At this time, in the midst of the Greater East Asia War, we should pay attention to thrift." He also instructed the future work direction: (1) All sections and offices should be closely linked to form a concrete manifestation of unified distribution, so that work can be smoothly advanced. (2) Work must be swift and efficient, and we should have the spirit of completing today's work today. (3) We must be truly responsible for our own work and must not engage in perfunctory fulfillment of duties. It is also heard that Chief Liu has adopted a talent-based approach to all staff members in the division. If they can fulfill their duties, they will be given considerable protection.

Readers' Scholarship News

### The Minimum Wish: 10,000 Per Person - Total Need is 45 Million; Already Secured 20 Million - Still Short 25 Million

The eighth session of the scholarship fund managed by this newspaper was originally budgeted to require 30 million, which was the estimate in November of last year. Based on the price index at that time, it was thought that increasing it by one time compared to the seventh session would be sufficient. Little did we know that the budget had just been confirmed when we encountered a sharp change in prices in December. Therefore, this newspaper's budget of 30 million for the scholarship fund inevitably had to be increased to 45 million. How could this have been anticipated by this newspaper? And it finally became a shocking and sad reality! The staff of this newspaper, given the urgency of the scholarship movement, could not bear to sit idly by, and had no choice but to run around and appeal, and revive the spirit of "carrying on the past and opening up the future," and "catching up from behind." In addition to hoping that schools at all levels will cooperate closely to reduce tuition fees for poor students, we have decided to raise funds widely in order to achieve the goal of each person being able to obtain an average scholarship of 10,000. On this basis, 4,500 old students will require 45 million, while there is still no guarantee for new students. It is joyful to say! At this moment, 20 million has been raised, and 25 million is still short. It is planned to raise the full amount within 20 days, and then the merit will be completed, and everyone will be happy! It is hoped that our dear readers will keep this in mind and intensify their mobilization in order to be effective!

Capital Correspondence

### The Work of the Wartime Construction Department

— Our Reporter Min Xian

Before the Incident, the affairs of the Railway and Transportation Departments, as well as urban water conservancy construction, were all merged into the Construction Department, making the department's work extremely important. Taking advantage of my stay in the capital, I paid a special visit to the department. It happened that Minister Chuan Shishuo was attending a water conservancy meeting, so I was received by Mr. Liu Chuanliang, the department's chief secretary. Mr. Liu previously served as the Administrative Inspector Commissioner and concurrently Security Commander of the Second District of Zhejiang Province, and was known for his governance and bandit suppression.

China Electricity Postal

The reporter first inquired about the situation of roads, electricity, mail, and aviation. Mr. Liu commented on the current difficulties in transportation, saying: "Taking the railways as an example, discipline is indeed worse than before the Incident. The department has previously made its best efforts within the possible scope to crack down on the black market for train tickets and to facilitate proper transportation. We will continue to advance along this path in the future, always striving to reduce all unreasonable situations. Regarding postal fees, they have already increased significantly, but postal workers still find it difficult to maintain a living due to rising prices. However, the department will pay attention to improving the sluggish delivery situation at any time. As for inland waterway navigation, unfortunate incidents have occurred several times in the past, resulting in many deaths, which is very distressing. The department will strictly enforce pre-incident crackdowns and post-incident punishments, hoping that such unfortunate incidents will not happen again in the future. However, during this extraordinary period, the four administrations of roads, electricity, mail, and aviation must prioritize military affairs, which will inevitably cause inconveniences."

Reclamation Project

Regarding the reclamation of East Tai Lake and the filling of Yinshan Lake, Mr. Liu said: "The national government has issued construction bonds to fund the reclamation of the lake and marsh areas of East Tai Lake. 13,000 mu of new farmland have been reclaimed, which can increase rice production by 48,000 shi per year, and also increase wheat production by the same amount. The Yinshan Lake project costs 50 million yuan, and the filled area reaches 10,000 mu. The above two projects are still being actively promoted, and will have a considerable effect on increasing production in the future." Finally, talking about the Nanjing Taihuai River dredging project, Mr. Liu said: "A dredging plan was drafted long before the Incident, but unfortunately it could not be realized. Minister Fu attaches great importance to the river's relationship to the capital's appearance and the people's health. When funding is available in the future, we will cooperate with the Nanjing Municipal Government to dredge it."

New Year's City Sounds

### Establishing a Wartime System in Shanghai

— Wang Yang

It has been a full year since our country officially joined the Greater East Asia War on January 9th of this year. How much have we contributed to the war in this year? I am afraid that those who answer this question will be ashamed. Not to mention the contribution to the war, even the atmosphere of war in the country is very weak, and the breath of civilian participation in the war is very weak. Especially in Shanghai, it is still a world of singing and dancing, making people forget that most countries in the world are currently suffering from unprecedented war.

A long time ago, we saw in the newspaper that Germany closed all theaters and Japan also stopped performing songs and dramas to adapt to the wartime system. Looking around Shanghai, the hotels are still filled with the sound of mahjong tiles, the restaurants are still full of guests, and the dance halls are still filled with singing and dancing. I feel that the degree of luxury and debauchery in Shanghai is not less than before. Shanghai is also a city of participating countries. Anyone with a little brain will not only be ashamed, but simply heartbroken. How can we face the Allied nations who are doing their best under great hardships? At the same time, the authorities are shouting "Establish a wartime system" and "Implement a decisive battle life," but why not actively correct the various phenomena that should not exist in Shanghai during the war?

Historically, if the people remained dissolute and extravagant during wartime, it was a sign of national subjugation. Modern warfare is a total war. The decadent and disorganized lives of the people directly waste materials, time, and energy. As the Greater East Asia War evolves to a fever pitch today, we must loudly call out: "Establish Shanghai's wartime system"!

We hope that the new municipal authorities will deeply consider the following points. If they think it should be so, then resolutely implement it, without fear of any obstruction.

(1) Close all gambling institutions and convert these venues into public sports fields for citizens to exercise their bodies.

(2) Dance halls, song halls, and brothels should all be ordered to close.

(3) Reduce the number of theaters (including movies, dramas, storytelling, and local operas), and limit performances to those with meaning. All erotic, farcical, and decadent performances should be prohibited.

(4) Hotels should only allow legitimate lodging for travelers, and strictly prohibit all misconduct, such as gambling, drug use, and prostitution.

(5) Restaurants, tea houses, and cafes should not be allowed to sell expensive food, and increase the banquet tax as much as possible to reduce wasteful customers.

(6) Ban the manufacture and sale of luxury goods, such as cosmetics, fine clothing materials, and sweets and pastries.

After the above items are implemented one by one, the decadent atmosphere of the city will be greatly reduced. The entire city of Shanghai will be filled with the vitality of new life and the ability to fight a decisive battle, which will reduce a large amount of consumption and inspire the people. Therefore, establishing Shanghai's wartime system is a matter that brooks no delay, and we urge the municipal authorities to consider and implement it as soon as possible!
