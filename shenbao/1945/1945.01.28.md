If the enemy continues its illegal acts, it is necessary to severely punish all prisoners of war by burning them.

### Four Problems in Shanghai

â€” Liu Yusheng

Recently, Shanghai's politics have appeared clearer due to personnel changes and the generally increased expectations of the people. But in reality, Shanghai is still Shanghai. The many difficult problems that Shanghai politics needs to address and resolve are the same as in the past. Aside from superficial reforms, it is not easy to present a fresh image, and thorough improvements are even more difficult to achieve. However, the unnecessary suffering endured by the people today has penetrated and touched the hearts of everyone, and is becoming increasingly difficult. The people's demand for light is not only a case of "crying out for food," but almost a state of utter restlessness. Therefore, promoting municipal affairs in Shanghai at this time is like "sending charcoal in the snow." It can not only gain widespread sympathy and support, but if this is not done, the result will inevitably be a state of great suffering, collapse and chaos beyond repair! A careful analysis of the major issues facing Shanghai today can be roughly divided into four categories: time, place, people, and affairs.

The first item is the "time" problem. Nowadays, many people shake their heads and sigh when talking about life, feeling that each day is worse than the last. If they want to find a solution, they can only dream of a total solution in the future. But we believe that no one can predict what the so-called total solution will be. The current suffering of the people definitely needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Whether this total solution is driven by a comprehensive plan, or by partial reforms by the authorities responsible, whoever can give the people this is a fair record of the merits and demerits of the current administrative officials and public officials to the nation and the people. From the perspective of the average person, the timing of political techniques, the complexity, and the breadth of vision and ambition are all things they understand and trust. But whoever can best protect the dignity of their country, without sacrificing effort and fatigue, to alleviate the suffering of the people and seek their welfare with the spirit of "treating the hunger and drowning of others as their own" is especially the refuge they admire and rely on. Because the times are difficult and the world is dangerous, everything hinges on the progress of the political situation, so people's expectations of politics are even more urgent and earnest. Because time is pressing and there is no room for delay, only when the municipal authorities and their cadres are willing to embrace great determination to act quickly and efficiently can they most easily gain widespread sympathy.

The second is the problem of "place" and the problem of "affairs." The current Shanghai Special Municipality has a vast territory, including the city and suburban areas, as well as the seven counties of Nanhui, Fengxian, Baoshan, Jiading, Chongming, Chuansha, and Shenjiang. The problems we usually focus on, such as illegal extortion by the police, corruption in tax collection, traffic congestion, scarce and delayed distribution of supplies, soaring prices, and hoarding, are all issues related to the welfare of every citizen. For example, if rations can be distributed on time and the quantity can be increased; if prices can be reasonably increased and the value of currency stabilized; if black market train tickets can be eliminated and military vehicle training can be thoroughly rectified; if finances can increase tax revenue; if police can be prevented from extorting: each item being realized can directly benefit the livelihood needs of the people, and indirectly increase the government's prestige and strengthen wartime production capacity. However, this is only one aspect of symptomatic treatment. To talk about fundamental treatment, we must consider the suffering of the people on the outskirts of Shanghai, that is, in the counties and suburban areas. The suburban areas are close to the city and easier to assist, while the county areas are vast, with intersecting seaports. In addition to the location of government offices (such as county governments, district offices, and township offices), there are often two forms of government, guerrilla groups, and the need to pay taxes and grain. In fact, some areas are not within the jurisdiction of the county government. Local bullies are not worth mentioning, and the tax collectors, district chiefs, and township heads of each county often have the qualifications of "knowing everyone." However, when it comes to the political awareness, treatment, equipment, and the stability of the lives of public officials, educators, and the care of the dead, our situation in the past has really been far behind. Therefore, the so-called three major policies of the government, namely ensuring security and rectifying ideology, are fundamentally difficult to implement. As for increasing production, due to various reasons, the countryside is almost bankrupt, and instances of corruption, extortion, and seizure are often heard. I donâ€™t know how much has been achieved. This is the problem of "place," which is the biggest hidden concern in today's municipal affairs.

Humans are political animals, and politics is the business of all people. Therefore, to seek reform, the main crux lies in the problem of "people." How to understand the government's national policy and the center of the current situation, and everyone strives to sacrifice the individual to exchange for the freedom and independence of the nation, is to temper people's minds. How to improve the treatment of military police, public officials, and educators, increase the number of household rations, strengthen production mechanisms, and adjust electricity is to stabilize people's lives. How to eradicate local bullies, eliminate corruption, and boldly break open a new path of honest politics, cultivating an atmosphere of integrity, is to establish people's character. The correlation between the four problems of time, affairs, people, and place is what we hope to use Shanghai to set an example for the compatriots of the whole country, so that the realization of full peace is not impossible.

Weekly Review

### Several Preconditions for Population Evacuation

â€” Xu Weizhou

In the past, after air raids, the anti-aircraft authorities talked about evacuating the population as a necessary measure for air defense. After rice prices soared, the municipal authorities also politely advised citizens to evacuate the population. Recently, the newspapers have been unanimous in advocating the evacuation of the population. With Shanghai citizens today facing the threat of air raids and livelihoods, even if the government does not implement mandatory evacuation, the number of people who do not need to stay in Shanghai and feel the threat to their livelihoods will inevitably be quite large if they want to return to their hometowns voluntarily. However, due to the trouble of moving the Baojia, inconvenient transportation, difficulties in inspections along the way, and the arbitrary levies in the inland areas, all make those who want to evacuate voluntarily regard it as a daunting task, holding on to the mentality that it is better to remain still than to move. As for the threat of air raids, on the one hand, there is still a lack of accurate imagination of the tragic situation of real air raids, so foreigners often secretly laugh at the fact that pedestrians on the road do not decrease during air raids. On the other hand, resigning oneself to fate, life and death are a great number, is the key to dealing with chaotic times inherited by ancestors for thousands of years. Those who advise danger will be regarded as greedy for life and afraid of death, or even as mentally ill. Some even rebut with the fact that Shanghai has a population of more than five million, and there are many people of value. Some even compare it to winning the lottery jackpot. Therefore, the threat of air raids does not have a very panicky effect on the psychology of citizens. However, the soaring prices of rice and daily necessities, this is a burning issue, which is enough to make those who have a little foresight quickly seek a better plan to move. Therefore, if the authorities can make some efforts on the following issues, then with a wave of their hand, they can encourage citizens who do not need to reside in Shanghai and feel the threat to their livelihoods to evacuate voluntarily to various places. This will be beneficial to the convenience of air defense and the easing of price increases. Because Shanghai is the economic center of the country, the rise and fall of prices in Shanghai are enough to stimulate prices throughout the country. Regarding what I believe are several preconditions for population evacuation, I will describe them separately as follows:

(1) Baojia Movement For applications to obtain a return-to-hometown certificate or movement certificate, each place must be stamped, from the head of the household to the head of the Jia, the head of the Bao, and the police station. This should be handled as soon as possible. If there is any delay or extortion, once verified, they should be severely punished. Each Baojia section in each district should set up a movement inquiry office. If there are illiterate people or those who do not know the procedures, they should be told truthfully by those inquiring about applying for return to their hometown or movement affairs. Or fill out various application forms on their behalf, and order train or ship tickets on their behalf. The office staff should not be bothered and deal with them with a kind attitude.

(2) Land and Water Transportation The evacuation routes will be started on a trial basis using the land routes of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, and the water routes of the inland rivers and China Airlines. This is because the living expenses in the villages along the above routes are indeed lower than those in Shanghai. As for the evacuation methods, for example, the Beijing-Shanghai line designates a slow train at a certain time every morning as a special train for evacuating the population. The tickets are sold by the police station and Baojia office, numbered and sold, and assigned seats. For transport ships, several shifts are designated in each month, and the ticket sales method is the same as for trains. Each evacuee returning to their hometown is subject to regulations regarding the luggage they carry and the additional fees charged, and no extra demands are allowed. If the Baojia office staff who sell train and ship tickets are found to be engaged in favoritism or bribery, or do not follow the order of priority, they should be severely punished once verified.

(3) Police and Military Inspection For special trains or special ships for evacuating the population, the police and military inspections should be avoided if possible, otherwise they should be implemented in a very rapid manner. For example, inland transport ships must require passengers to disembark and line up for inspection at the two ports of Beizhuang and Ji Wang Temple, regardless of wind or rain, which urgently needs to be improved.

(4) Arrangement in the Interior The customs in the interior are different, and there are some discriminatory opinions towards visitors from other places. For example, renting a house requires a very high tip if proper arrangements are not made in advance. Even if the procedures for changing to a residence permit are extremely complete, there are still many inconveniences. Local authorities should be asked to set up reception centers in various places and make proper arrangements in advance to reduce the suffering of the evacuated population.

### Authorities Plan to Stabilize the Lives of Military and Police in the Capital; Extreme Punishment Will Be Imposed on Those Who Hinder Supply and Demand

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - It is inevitable that there will be a lack of materials in wartime, and it is also an inevitable trend that prices will rise and living expenses will increase. Recently, the central authorities have established the "Capital Materials Fair Price Maintenance Committee." The main purpose is to restore the normal and stable supply of essential materials for life in the capital, and to universally improve the treatment of the military, police, and security forces to stabilize their lives and allow them to serve with peace of mind, so as to thoroughly assist the authorities in maintaining price control. It is reported that specific measures have been formulated, including investigating recent prices, calculating the minimum monthly living expenses for each person, and issuing subsidies in addition to their original monthly salaries. In addition, those with families in the capital will also be given subsidies to support their direct relatives. In addition, there will be the issuance of rice and firewood. It is expected that the lives of the general military, police, and security forces will become stable after receiving this subsidy, which will be of great benefit to maintaining discipline and cooperating in price control in the future.

Organization of the Maintenance Committee Determined

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since the establishment of the Capital Materials Fair Price Maintenance Committee, the organization of its internal temporary institutions has been largely determined. Under the committee, there will be a secretariat, and four groups will be established: "point release," "fuel," "supervision," and "military law," each responsible for its specific duties. Among them, the supervision group will carry out strict supervisory activities in designated areas for the seven essential living materials and related areas. The military law group is the adjudication body, and can apply the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and the Special Criminal Law in Wartime, various regulations on punishing corruption by public officials, and the Criminal Law. For the seven essential living materials, anyone who uses violence, coercion, fraud, or other illegal actions to hinder their supply and demand relationship, thereby affecting the city and causing adverse phenomena, will be dealt with by military order in wartime with the death penalty. If anyone illegally extorts donations or uses their power to extort people's property by violence, coercion, fraud, or other illegal crimes in order to obtain illegal profits, whether they are unscrupulous merchants or public officials, they will be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years.

Efforts to Smooth the Source of Pigs

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - After the authorities formulated a fair price maintenance plan for the seven items of rice, firewood, oil, vegetables, and pork, there were also regulations for pork. The reason for the high price of green pork is that, in addition to the fact that it cannot be transported to Beijing due to transportation relations along the Jinpu line, the important factor is that the operation of the publicly operated community for pigs is imperfect. The authorities have now ordered the public community to temporarily suspend its activities for one month and temporarily allow pigs to be freely bought and sold, and the municipal government will give reasonable valuations. The authorities plan to try it for one month, observe its effectiveness, and then decide on measures. It is expected that the source of pigs in the capital will be unblocked as a result, and prices will also tend to fall as a result.

### Diligent Work, Correcting Conduct and Thought: Mayor Zhou Instructs Secretariat Staff

Mayor Zhou convened a meeting with senior staff of the Municipal Secretariat at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 27th) in the City Hall's VIP room. Those present included Shen Guanzhun, Councilor and Director of the General Accounting Office; Councilors Pan Da, Ling Xianwen, and Wang Deyi; Secretaries Ge Yujiu (also head of the First Group), Yang Shi (also head of the Second Group), Liang Senzhang (also head of the Third Group), and Ling Dating (also head of the Fourth Group); Secretaries Tang Yuhao and Liu Langji; Cao Jingang, Chief of the General Affairs Section; and Sun Guangdi, Specialist and Director of the Printing Office, totaling over forty people. After briefly inquiring about each person's background, Mayor Zhou gave the following instructions:

"I have been appointed as the Mayor of Shanghai with the determination to rejuvenate the Shanghai Municipal Administration. This requires each responsible bureau and department to carry out their respective tasks. However, the Municipal Secretariat is like the main driving force of a factory. If the driving force itself is not sound, it will undoubtedly be impossible to promote the various parts of the machine to operate actively. The Municipal Secretariat is the foundation of all bureaus and departments, and must generate a great driving force to propel the subordinate agencies.

Two Hopes

The personnel situation of the Municipal Secretariat is very complex, involving the merger of personnel from the old Municipal Government and the former First and Eighth Districts. The will and thoughts of each person are not unified, and emotions are not entirely harmonious. Among the personnel, there are bound to be those who are good and those who are not. In the past, there have been many criticisms of this office from the outside. From now on, regardless of each person's past history, their thoughts and will must be unified. No matter which agency each person came from in the past, they must not harbor any more factionalism. Since Secretary-General Luo took office, everyone must strive to invigorate themselves, unify their thoughts and will, harmonize everyone's emotions, and eliminate all past prejudices. This is my first hope for you all.

Secondly, I hope that this office will stand in a position of proactive attitude, to promote municipal administration, and cooperate with municipal administration, so that municipal administration can be smoothly promoted, and various agencies can accept the guidance of this office. You must understand that this office is the staff of the highest guiding agency in the city, that is, the General Staff Headquarters. If you do not actively use your minds to think of solutions, and hope to direct subordinate agencies to reform the municipal administration, it is absolutely impossible. Therefore, you must stand in the capacity of staff members of the highest guiding agency, to actively promote the work, and absolutely must not adopt a passive attitude to deal with everything.

In the past, there have been various undesirable phenomena in this office. For example, the processing of official documents was often delayed for a long time. From now on, whether it is an order from the central government or an official document from a subordinate agency, it must be processed quickly. The above orders must be prompt, and the official documents of lower agencies must be even more prompt. You must do your utmost to speed up the review or communication. Whether the processing of official documents is prompt or not is like the speed of blood circulation in a person's body. If the blood vessels in a person's body circulate quickly, his body will be very strong. Conversely, if an agency cannot transmit official documents, this agency, although it exists, is equivalent to being dead. I hope that from now on, everyone will not delay unnecessarily when processing official documents.

Reforming Bad Habits

In the past, subordinate agencies of this government often had to negotiate conditions when applying for funds from this office. This is the responsibility of the General Accounting Office. Not only was it necessary to negotiate conditions for requesting temporary funds, but it was also necessary to negotiate good conditions and give a discount when receiving regular funds. This is the most hateful thing. From now on, this is absolutely not allowed to happen again, otherwise, severe punishment will be imposed according to the law. There will be no leniency. Furthermore, in the past, there were cases of falsely reporting accounts when buying things. For example, if you bought something for one hundred yuan, eighty yuan of it was a fake account, which was taken and divided up by everyone, while the public received only twenty yuan worth of goods. This is simply too outrageous. From now on, such shameful phenomena are absolutely not allowed to happen again. If this happens again, once verified, it will be immediately sent to the court for strict handling, and there will be no tolerance. In addition, once this kind of atmosphere becomes habitual and continues, the people in this office and the entire municipal government will be looked down upon by the people, and the entire municipal government will also be looked down upon by the people. At that time, I will have no face to be the mayor. Regarding this point, those responsible for purchasing and other personnel must be especially cautious and careful. If such adverse events occur again, they must be strictly sanctioned by law.

Striving for Self-Discipline

Finally, I hope that everyone will act in accordance with their own conscience, stand in the position of staff members of the highest municipal guidance agency, on the one hand work hard, and on the other hand correct their conduct and thought, so that the Shanghai Municipal Administration will usher in a new era, make contributions to the society, and create a stable social status for themselves, and receive glorious criticism from all sides. I hope that everyone will earnestly follow the ancient teachings of "correcting mistakes when they exist, and encouraging when they do not," so that they can live up to themselves and the government, and have something to answer to the country and society. Otherwise, if you continue to muddle along like this, there will be no benefit. It is better to automatically strive for self-discipline and do a glorious career to live up to the nation."

### Kyoto Imperial University Alumni Association Welcomes Mayor Zhou

The Shanghai Alumni Association of Kyoto Imperial University of Japan, in view of alumnus Mayor Zhou's new leadership of Shanghai's administration, held a welcome tea party at the Capital Hotel yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM to express their welcome. More than one hundred Chinese and Japanese alumni, including Masutaro Kimura, attended. After Mayor Zhou arrived on time, Mr. Kimura, as the representative of the Alumni Association, delivered a welcoming speech, stating that Mayor Zhou is a modern Chinese politician. China's future depends on the practical abilities and firm beliefs of great politicians. We, as alumni, are very pleased to welcome Mayor Zhou's leadership of Shanghai's administration. Subsequently, Mayor Zhou delivered a speech, briefly describing his student life in Kagoshima and Kyoto, and recounting his experience in organizing the Communist Party, participating in the revolution, and the various changes in his thinking. Finally, regarding his leadership of Shanghai's administration, he stated: "My most prominent characteristic is that I can say what I can do, and I can do what I say. This is my determination. When preparing to organize the Central Reserve Bank, the situation was extremely difficult, and many people opposed it. However, I believed that a central bank must be organized, so I disregarded all difficulties and eliminated all opposing arguments, and succeeded. This is my personal determination. The situation in Shanghai is even more difficult, but after dozens of days of consideration, I am determined to improve the Shanghai administration. Once I have made a decision, no matter what difficulties or opposition there may be, I will work hard to implement it according to the planned plan. Now, I am like an athlete in a competition, and everyone is like a cheering team on the sidelines. If you want to win the competition, your cheering team must do their best to support. There are many thorns ahead, and I hope that everyone will give me advice and assistance as fellow alumni." After Mr. Zhou finished his speech, Mr. Yasui delivered a speech. The meeting was adjourned after a group photo was taken at 6:00 PM.

### Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Attacking Shanghai: Public Exhibition Opens Today at the Racecourse Airfield

### Director Liu Discusses Propaganda and Governance: First Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday

The regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office, after the new Director Liu Dexuan took office, was held for the first time at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 27th) in the City Hall conference room. More than ten newspaper reporters from various newspapers in the city attended. Director Liu gave a speech on the future work plan of the Propaganda Office and the general implementation, as follows:

The Propaganda Office is an official guiding propaganda agency. I have been a reporter for many years. Now that I have been ordered to lead the Propaganda Office, I sincerely hope that everyone will cooperate. The Propaganda Office mainly handles the review and registration of propaganda-related matters. In the past, there were numerous abuses in handling the review and registration procedures, which need not be detailed here. From now on, we will adhere to the intentions and determination of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, strive to correct them, and absolutely eliminate the matter of extra extortion.

Regarding the registration of general publications, we have decided to conduct strict reviews, follow the orders of the Propaganda Department and the Municipal Government, and will not be partial to any party. We also plan to have small newspapers publish current affairs and war news to assist in wartime propaganda.

Regarding the priority rationing of news reporters, I am very concerned about this. Director Liu of the Materials Allocation Office has just taken office, and he is actively organizing the priority allocation for reporters. However, general news practitioners, such as managers, are also assisting in news, and should be given the same allocation. I sincerely hope that the Shanghai Branch of the Journalists Association will strengthen its work. The priority allocation matters can be reviewed by the Shanghai Branch of the Journalists Association, and then handed over to the Propaganda Office for execution and negotiation. The paper problem for newspapers is becoming increasingly serious, and we are actively reviewing it to find a solution.

Answering Reporters' Questions

After the speech, the reporters from various newspapers jointly brought up the matter of the Civil Defense Office's unreasonable refusal to allow newspaper reporters to enter the tea party to welcome Mayor Zhou and other newly appointed municipal officials on the afternoon of the 25th of this month, and questioned Director Liu and demanded a guarantee of freedom of news coverage. Director Liu inquired in detail and reviewed the matter for a long time.

### Mayor Zhou Instructs Judicial Officials to Strictly Handle Corruption Cases and Strengthen Cooperation Between Judiciary and Administration

Since taking office, Mayor Zhou Fohai has been determined to rectify discipline and eliminate corruption. However, if the judicial organs cannot cooperate with the policies of the administrative organs, the effect of rectification will not be easily achieved. Yesterday, he specially invited Prosecutor Zhao of the District Prosecutor's Office and President Feng of the District Court for a discussion. In his capacity as Deputy Executive Yuan, he earnestly instructed that cases of malfeasance and corruption sent by the Municipal Government must not be released on bail at will, must not be delayed, and must not be lenient. He urged that prosecution and trials be conducted with extremely expedient and strict methods. It is expected that cooperation between the judiciary and administration will be further strengthened in the future.

### Shanghai Branch of the New Association Feasts Director Liu

The Shanghai Branch of the Journalists Association hosted a luncheon yesterday (the 27th) for Liu Dexuan, the new Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, and invited senior officials of the Propaganda Office to accompany them. Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Association, and all the directors and general managers attended. Chairman Chen first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by Director Liu, who gave detailed explanations on priority rationing for news practitioners, the paper problem for newspapers, and how to strengthen the New Association.

### Minister Zhao Xuan Arrives in Shanghai on Official Business

Zhao Zunyue, the newly appointed Minister of Propaganda of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on official business a few days ago. It is reported that he will formally meet with all sectors of the city in the coming days.

### Economic Bureau Urges Collection of Overdue Licenses

Director Xu of the Municipal Economic Bureau, in view of the large number of pending cases of approved registration licenses for various companies, factories, and businesses that have applied for registration in the past, which has actually hindered the right to legitimate business operations, will immediately notify all businesses and factories. If they are indeed operating legitimately and have completed the legal procedures for registration and have been approved for registration, but have not yet collected their business registration licenses, they should quickly bring their receipts to the bureau within the specified time limit to collect them.

### Reader's Aid to Education News

Xie Xiaochu Donates Chemistry Scholarship

Xie Xiaochu of China Chemical Industry Company wrote in a letter: "Recently, Xiaochu has suffered a recurrence of stomach disease and has received condolences from friends and relatives. I have no way to repay their kindness, so I have specially donated funds for good deeds, to bless all my friends and relatives, and to respond to your newspaper's advocacy of social education. In addition to donating 100,000 yuan myself, I will also provide tuition fees for six chemistry students in the university department from this semester, named 'Xiaochu Chemistry University Scholarship', to be provided until graduation. If they drop out halfway, excellent students will be selected to fill the vacancies at any time. Please ask your newspaper and the News Daily to handle three students each. If my ability allows, I will increase the number of students at any time. In addition, I have raised a total of 300,000 yuan in goods and cash. Together with my own donation of 100,000 yuan, the total is 400,000 yuan. I will now donate the raised 200,000 yuan in goods, which are the old brand Wei Ying Wei Feng seasoning powder produced by the Second Factory of the China Chemical Industry Company, Zhongnan Wei Ying Factory, according to the price limit of 200,000 yuan. These will be donated to the market for auction to rescue out-of-school students. The remaining 200,000 yuan will be donated to Puyutang. I hope you will send staff to give instructions on the procedures so that I can comply."

You Huaigao Promotes Aid to Education

You Huaigao of China Milk Powder Factory said twice: "Respected Sir, I have always admired your newspaper's role in leading public opinion and developing culture. The provision of scholarships in recent years has enabled poor students to avoid dropping out of school, benefiting the people. I am willing to do my best for the cause of education, so I have taken the initiative to consult with relevant organizations. Together with my own donation, I have raised five teams, totaling 100,000 yuan in foreign currency. I am sending a check and a list for your review."

Saving Congratulatory Gifts to Be Used for Aid to Education

Nian Zi wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, your newspaper's advocacy of aid to education has become a social trend, and its contribution to society is admirable! My wife gave birth to a son last month. My colleagues heard about it and wanted to congratulate me. I believe that this would be a waste of money and of no benefit. Therefore, I have a way to be economical: the rescue of out-of-school children is very urgent today! Everyone is enthusiastic. If you must congratulate me, you can convert it into cash to save out-of-school children, which is more meaningful. Everyone agreed. Therefore, in the name of saving banquet fees, a total of 63,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates was collected, and I donated an additional 2,000 yuan, totaling 65,000 yuan. I am enclosing a check with this letter, and I hope you will collect it to show sincerity and to promote this idea."

### Leyte Island Front: Human Bombs Conquer Machines â€“ A Record of Conversations with Lieutenant Tetsuyuki Kawanishi

The front lines on Leyte Island are now completely intertwined. The US military, attempting to secure the sea lanes, advanced their amphibious assault warfare along the west coast and attempted to penetrate Ormoc, but the landed US troops were unable to connect with each other due to fierce Japanese attacks, and were isolated into several sections. Therefore, on the western battlefield of Leyte, the two armies were interwoven and engaged in continuous chaotic battles. Below is a record of conversations with Lieutenant Tetsuyuki Kawanishi, who recently returned to base from the fierce Leyte front. Although the language is simple, it provides a glimpse into the decisive battle between the Japanese and US forces on Leyte Island.

Advancing Rapidly with Light Equipment

After landing in Ormoc, I followed the unit northward towards Carigara. This landing operation was very smooth. We advanced from the sea, about one kilometer from the shore, using amphibious assault craft to unload weapons and ammunition, while the soldiers waded through the water, which reached chest level. The landing operation took two nights, during which we were attacked once by 20 "Unified" type aircraft, but the damage was minimal. The vanguard unit advanced towards Cari on the same night, and we also marched day and night. Ormoc, with its alternating red and white roofs, soon fell behind us. We advanced on the wide, flat asphalt road. Green coconut groves frequently appeared along the roadside, spread out under the scorching sun. Our troops were pulling artillery pieces by hand along this motor road. Seeing the soldiers covered in sweat, I wished we had tractors or horses to replace them, but in reality, in order to carry as many cannons as possible, we had almost no horses or tractors. Moreover, food and supplies were extremely scarce, so on the fourth day after landing, we had to eat dry bread, drink coconut juice, and use taro and corn to fill our stomachs.

Enemy Discovered

On the morning of the third day, we were attacked by twelve or thirteen P28 type aircraft. They flew very low, circling and strafing with machine guns, and we immediately returned fire. At this time, the vanguard had reached the summit of Mount Limon, overlooking the sea off San Miguel Bay, and discovered countless enemy landing craft gathering in front of Caraga. Coinciding with the landing of our elite troops, the enemy was also landing more than a division of troops in front of us. Near the summit of Mount Limon, we were being heavily shelled by enemy mortars, and our battle began. The enemy's operation relied on material quantities and machinery. In the battle on Leyte Island, they used mortars and radio wave weapons as much as possible. The mortars had a considerable caliber, and their shells, when they landed, could create holes two or three meters in diameter. Moreover, these heavy mortars were operated and aimed by various radio wave weapons. As long as there was the sound of leather shoes dragging or iron rubbing against iron, the enemy's artillery would open fire. In addition, the enemy also had a peculiar observation aircraft, which the soldiers nicknamed "Dragonfly". From about 7:00 AM, it would circle above us. It was a monoplane carrying two or three people, equipped with a large radio antenna, and flew very slowly, with a speed of less than one hundred kilometers per hour. When it soared overhead, if smoke rose, enemy heavy mortars would soon fire upon us. This type of "Dragonfly" was mainly in wireless communication with artillery units on all sides. Once, I and two soldiers, a total of three people, went to conduct reconnaissance of the position, and were accidentally discovered by the "Dragonfly". Immediately, enemy mortar shells rained down, but they were not accurate. Also, the radio waves of the radio signal squad would cause a barrage of gunfire to fall nearby. However, although the shells hit extremely close, casualties were surprisingly few, indicating that the effectiveness was not great.

Suicide Charge

Another point is that the enemy fully used long-range artillery. They fired from heavy artillery positions near Palo towards the streets of Ormoc, throwing a large number of shells. By mid-November, the streets of Ormoc had become ruins, and a portion of the pier in the harbor had also been destroyed by artillery fire. We responded to this challenge from the enemy with suicide squads, shaking the enemy's formation and directly attacking their nests. The vanguard members wore soft-soled shoes, carried Japanese swords, held specially made spears, and carried several hand grenades, infiltrating the enemy's artillery positions in the dark. The enemy had deployed countless listening devices in the dense forest, and the surrounding machine guns were set up with strict vigilance, but our suicide squads were able to skillfully use hand grenades to destroy their machine gun nests. Our suicide squads charged into enemy positions almost every night. As soon as the enemy soldiers knew that suicide squads had entered their positions, they scattered in panic, covering their heads and fleeing, allowing our suicide squads to leisurely destroy their positions. The defenses built by the enemy relying on material and machinery became useless waste once they were broken.

Our suicide squads had almost no casualties, which is truly commendable. It was almost as successful as a regular exercise. Only when comrades occasionally died in battle did we realize that this was a real war. Soldiers departing for suicide charges often said, "There is nothing more satisfying than killing the enemy in the vanguard!" This soaring spirit deeply penetrated the hearts of those of us living in the dense forest. In the battle between human bombs and iron weapons, the victory of human bombs relied on the overwhelming courage.

There is no terrible malaria on Leyte Island, and the water is relatively clean. Living in the roadless jungle does not cause much inconvenience or hardship for our well-trained warriors. As for food, coconuts, corn, and taro are abundant and can be found everywhere. (Special Correspondent's Report, Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, December 26)

European Eastern Front Situation Map

On the Eastern Front, the fighting is most intense in Upper Silesia, southeast of Oels (OleÅ›nica). The Soviet side has concentrated large forces to attack, and the German army is also continuously sending reinforcements to the front. Currently, fierce battles are taking place in KÃ¶nigsberg, Elbing, Danzig, SchneidemÃ¼hl, Thorn, Bromberg, Posen, Breslau, and other places.

### Lion Rock

â€” Yema

"Look, that prominent hilltop is Lion Rock."

Travelers passing along the official road can all see Lion Rock. It is a hilltop that protrudes from a range of mountains running parallel to the official road. The summit is high and precipitous, and at the top of the mountain there is a large rock, devoid of vegetation. It is unknown when someone said it resembled a lion's head, and so "Lion Rock" became its official name. The small village with only seven or eight households at the foot of the rock is also called Lion Village.

To ascend this hilltop, one must traverse it from the side of that mountain range. Besides lumberjacks and the monks from the ancient Lion Temple, which is named after the mountain, who occasionally go up, few villagers from Lion Village ever ascend it. Therefore, the mountain is covered in dense trees and thorns, and snakes often appear and disappear among them. Since a mottled giant snake appeared and frightened a playful young novice to death, even fewer people dared to go up the rock. The villagers warned each other, and the small path up the mountain was gradually obscured.

One late night, the old monk in the ancient Lion Temple had just finished his evening service and walked out of the main hall. He looked up and saw a streak of light, or perhaps mist, rising from the Lion Rock, reaching straight into the sky, all the way up to the clouds. A strange and mysterious idea arose in his mind, coinciding with the plots in the strange and supernatural novels he had read in the past. He spoke of it, and people passed on the story that a sword immortal was refining elixirs on Lion Rock. The white light seen every late night was the sword light from his elixir refining. Only those with a karmic connection could see it; ordinary mortal eyes could not. As a result, Lion Rock was shrouded in even more mystery. The giant snake that had frightened the young novice to death was regarded as the guardian of the sword immortal guarding the mountain.

"Look, that prominent hilltop is Lion Rock."

When the villagers pointed out Lion Rock to passersby on the official road, their tone was full of mysterious implications. If you asked further:

"What about Lion Rock?"

Then, they would tell you a fantastical story of a sword immortal, fabricated out of thin air.

It is not known in which year an elderly man from the city came to practice Buddhism, cultivate himself, and repent of his sins. He brought a large amount of earth and wood and workers, and built a small hermitage halfway up the mountain. After it was completed, a corner of red wall was added to the forest on the mountainside. Often, at dusk or dawn, the sound of morning and evening chanting bells would drift out in the mountain forest along with the misty clouds, echoing the sound of the bells from the ancient Lion Temple at the foot of the mountain. Some pilgrims from the ancient Lion Temple also conveniently climbed the mountain, and Lion Rock was thus a little less lonely.

Five, no, six years later, the elderly man who had quietly cultivated himself died without illness. After his death, apart from the monks from the ancient Lion Temple going up the mountain to chant sutras and pray for his salvation every seventh day, none of his family members came to take care of his affairs. The small hermitage on the mountain became the upper courtyard of the ancient Lion Temple, and some servants who cleaned and swept also lived there. One day, a daring visitor from outside, ignoring the advice of the servants, risked climbing to the top of the mountain to see what Lion Rock was all about. After he returned, he said that Lion Rock was just a larger rock. There was no vegetation or animals on it. However, no one believed his report. Whenever passersby traveled along the official road, the villagers would still point out the hilltop in a mysterious tone and say:

"Look, that prominent hilltop is Lion Rock."

### To My Younger Brother Ming

â€” Shidi

We are not flowers and plants of the greenhouse,

Surrounded by fragile glass;

Uninterested in the mud and sand under the window,

Let the torrential rain wash you to the ends of the earth.

Cherishing ambitions of a thousand miles,

Alas, there is no swift steed to cover a hundred!

Stand tall and upright,

Welcoming the chilling frost flowers.

Almost three years have passed,

The turbulent life has been more than a thousand days and nights,

The head of a twenty-two-year-old youth is turning white!

Only one's own weakness is to be pitied;

Even if you get a steed that can run a thousand miles,

You will only sadly gaze at the distant clouds and smoke.

Compose a "Returning Home" poem,

Although the dilapidated homeland always adds endless warmth to the weary traveler.

Why are you silent again?

Is it that the mountains and passes are too high and difficult to cross,

Or are you afraid of shattering the golden dream in your heart?

### Past Emotions

â€” Fang Xuan

I am a person who does not smoke, but occasionally I light one up, especially in the dark of night. I love the glimmer of light and the faint wisps of smoke. They allow me to think further and more ethereally, forgetting the honor and disgrace of the world.

Although I have only lived for twenty years, my worries are greater than those of a fifty-year-old. I matured so early, and I was sickly since childhood. When I was eight years old, I would still fall down when walking. Yet, when I was ten years old, if I even came across a girl, I already felt embarrassed to be close to her.

I did not have a childhood. It seems that as soon as I left my mother's embrace, I knew what "trouble" was. I remember that a poet once praised the time when a person is around twenty years old as "golden, worthy of a lifetime of treasure!" Yet at this age, I feel most lost and most tormented!

During the day, I indulge in my own dreams. I am such a dreamer! I weep or laugh in my dreams. At night, someone comes to adorn my dreams. I feel my heart beat and my face flush, and sometimes, when I get anxious, I cry out in a sobâ€¦

â€”I am still young, why be so impatient?

I buried my head in the quilt, secretly pondering.

But after I was bullied by a not-so-reputable girl, I could no longer calm my mind. She looked down on what I cherished. In her eyes, Tao Yuanming was just a poor old man. "A scroll of Tao's poems is not as valuable as a diamond ring!" (I remember when she said this, she was evenly applying powder to her face, turning the corners of her mouth into an arc, and rolling her eyes.) She was infatuated with a "young master" who could give her a good life. â€”This "young master's" father was a man of influence in Shanghai, with nearly ten thousand followers under his command. A single word from him could stir things up and make a mess!

(My heart trembled. I heard that after this woman gave birth to a girl, she had already attached herself to this "young master's" estate. If I had another chance to approach her, how should I treat her?â€¦)

That very winter, I left my warm home and went to live in a mountain city where I had no relatives. I used the hardships of life to forget the wounds in my heart. I was not saddened by my "broken love," but what made me gnash my teeth and hate was that I thought I was accommodating her (who was she!), but she deliberately humiliated my self-esteem!

In these few months, I followed a "life" mentor, from whom I experienced hunger, cold, and poverty. I no longer reacted emotionally to even the smallest joys and sorrows of the world.

But when I returned to Shanghai, the old surroundings stirred up my resentment again. I want revenge! I want revenge, but the one I harmed was such a kind child!

She was always regarded as my little sister. She didn't seem to understand much about the world, and she was somewhat reserved. I remember one time she came to my classroom to find me, and after my classmates teased her, she cried with swollen eyes. At the time, I thought it was funny, little did I know that half a year later, I would be extracting her pain to soothe my wounds.

One day, I was chatting with her in her living room when one of her elders came, and I excused myself. The next day, she called me, hoping that I would go to her place again. As soon as I stepped into her house, she clapped her hands and stomped her feet, laughing.

"Someone asked me, what kind of guest are you?"

How could I answer? I shook my head, feigning ignorance.

"If you don't know, how would I know!"

Saying that, she laughed again.

Humans are emotional animals, I don't deny it. When I felt that I was also somewhat in love with her, I was startled: I can't do this, I didn't have good intentions from the start! So, I used a small, willful thing she did as an excuse and broke up with her.

There was an unspeakable guilt in my heart. I could no longer live quietly at home. One morning with a mix of rain and snow, I left Shanghai again. I settled down in a backward trading port. It was not far from my hometown and had my relatives and friends. They all cared about me, even an elder who liked to drink advised me to drink less and not to ruin my body too much. I'm not a big fan of gambling, but during that month, I gambled madly. I had already lost so much that my heart was beating violently, but I still trembled and threw all the money in my pocket in for a last-ditch effort!

Finally, I fell ill. I had a fever every day, and my skin was covered in hives. At first, I saw a Western doctor. His diagnosis was blood poisoning. But after injecting a few times the serum drawn from my own blood vessels, it still didn't have much effect, and I had to consult a traditional Chinese medicine doctor. For the sake of decocting medicine, I moved to live with a relative.

This relative was originally very close to me, but after the death of a female elder with a blood relationship to me, I became a very polite guest here. On the day of the lunar New Year's Eve, the eldest cousin secretly shed tears in front of her mother's portrait, not even noticing when I approached her. I softly called her name, and she looked at me silently with glistening tears on her eyelashes.

"What can be done? She passed away so young!"

Before I could finish my comforting words, she burst into tears. I was at a loss, I moved closer to her body and took both her hands. But before I could say anything more, she broke free of my hand and left me in the room!

â€”Was there anything about my actions that offended you?

I wanted to ask her this several times, but I never succeeded. Why should I embarrass a pure girl? My lifestyle is different from hers, and my moral standards may not be acceptable to her. So even now, she has already given birth to a child for me, and I still don't understand her feelings at the timeâ€¦.

### I Love the Guitar

â€” Meimo Zhi

In the corner is my beloved quiet instrumentâ€”the guitar, I love its ardor, more than I love myself ten thousand times.

It always lies quietly in that dim, lonely corner, and its outline is enough to imagine the exquisite beauty of its true form.

That corner is always swept very clean. The place could originally accommodate a chair or a bookshelf, but now it is suitably placed with this wonderful instrument, which can accompany the calm of the owner of this house.

I love this guitar, because in these cold and harsh winter days, having lost warmth and sunshine, with the bad state of mind, and the knot in my heart, there needs to be a kind of childish joy to inspire my life, to sing my hopes, to entrust my infinite enthusiasm.

Guitar, this quiet and drawn-out melody, this full and steady rhythm, these few strings can play out the magnificent, poignant, yearning, sorrowful, ardent, love and hate, joy that I can imagine!

The famous tunes in the world will remain in history because of it, and the stories of joys and sorrows, partings and reunions in the world will all become the objects of its playing.

I love it, precisely because it is the most sacred, holy, and the most faithful recorder of history. As long as you have the ability to learn from it, it will give you supreme comfort.

When a person is lonely, has lost maternal love, and has shattered his dreams, he entrusts his life to it so that his life can play the musical score of youth that it should have.

So I deeply love it. The more severe the cold, the deeper the length, the more ruthless the sharpness, the more powerful the ice and snow, the more I cultivate ardent love for this thing that does not flatter the world. I hope that one day, I can use its strings to play out my current grief and anger, and ardent hope.

### A Wonderful Scene from the Third Basketball League: A Commentary on the Zhongbei Victory Over the Shantou Team, Introducing the Strengths of Each Team in Groups A and B

Since the beginning of the Third Shanghai Basketball League last week, Group A is composed of the first-class players in Shanghai, while Groups A and B are composed of outstanding up-and-comers. The women's teams have shown great progress with both old teams and emerging powerhouses, so it's no wonder that the games are so exciting. This week, the game between Zhongbei and Shantou on Friday evening (the 26th) was the most noteworthy. It not only demonstrated the full potential of basketball skills, but also displayed sportsmanship and morality, a satisfactory gain for all, so I am pleased to comment on it.

As Shantou had previously defeated Zhongbei in the Shenbao Cup, Zhongbei has now taken revenge for this defeat. Regarding the situation of this battle, Shantou initially led 4-0, but soon Zhongbei surpassed them and remained in pursuit behind Shantou. Zhongbei's ability to control the situation and maintain the lead was truly remarkable. Now, let us discuss the reasons for Zhongbei's victory and the key to Shantou's defeat.

Proper Lineup Allocation: The Main Reason for Zhongbei's Victory

Zhongbei currently employs a man-to-man defense, so the measures for guarding opponents must be carefully considered. Assigning Zhuo Guorong to guard Lin Weiting, Bao Songyuan to guard Chen Qingjiang, and Li Zhenzhong to manage Ma Canxi were all well-targeted deployments. This is the primary reason for their victory. The secondary reasons were their efforts during the game and the successful display of their basketball skills. However, observing that the Zhongbei team, which is known as the master of the Northern style, has recently adopted a "gum-like" style. The agility and dazzling skills of the Northern style were only occasionally displayed. This is certainly an improvement in tactics, but those who praise it commend it as a combination of the strengths of both the North and South, while those who criticize it regret that it has hidden the characteristics of the Northern style.

Although Shantou Suffered Defeat, Their Performance Was Very Satisfactory

Shantou has always been known for its meticulous training and liveliness, and its excellent teamwork. In this game, they were able to display these two qualities to their fullest extent. Victory or defeat is another matter. All five players were full of energy. Ji Nankang, in particular, directed the center with good order and has the demeanor of a great general. Ma Canxi's interceptions under the basket, utilizing his position and timing among Zhongbei's tall players, were often surprising. Overall, although Shantou suffered defeat in this game, it was indeed a successful game for them.

Two More Good Games Next Wednesday and Weekend

Next week, there will be two more of the most exciting basketball games in the League, namely, on Wednesday (the 31st), Hualian will face the Shantou team. On the weekend (February 4th), Zhongbei and Hualian will have a major battle. These three teams are currently the three giants of Shanghai, and they will surely compete with each other in intelligence and courage, and use their strategies to win praise.

### Introducing the Strength of Each Team in Groups A and B

Furthermore, regarding the teams in Group AA and the women's group, I described them in the previous issue. The eight teams joining Groups A and B can be considered leaders in Group B and outstanding emerging talents. Therefore, I am happy to introduce them here as well.

Zhongbei B: This time, in addition to the original lineup, they have recruited famous players such as Li Ruixiong and Liu Fushan from the former South China team, and Wang Jinghu, Shen Da, Shi Jiuquan, and Zheng Guoli from the Star team. Their strength has suddenly increased several times, giving the impression that the championship is surely theirs. In fact, with such a strong lineup, dominating this group seems very possible.

Donghua: They demonstrate the skills of famous football players in the confined space of a basketball court. Their strength is more than sufficient. Moreover, Mai Youliang, Li Yao, Zhang Banglun, and Han Longhai are all versatile players and experienced veterans. However, recently, they seem to have focused more on football, with less basketball practice. Therefore, it's difficult to discuss their tactics and cooperation, relying solely on their basic skills and considerable strength. But within this group, only Donghua is capable of threatening Zhongbei B.

Team V: This group of young players, under the leadership of Wu Zibin, strives to improve. Therefore, they participated in Group A during the Shenbao Cup. Although they finished last, they gained a lot of experience. Zhu Mingxing and Xia Wanyou are particularly outstanding. Therefore, within this group, there is a strong hope for a high ranking. What I admire most about this team is its ability to progress entirely according to the rules, making it a very good team.

Fat Team: This time, with the assistance of the "Little Fatty" Yan Youlu, and Dong Yangfeng temporarily residing in Shanghai, coupled with the lineup of Song Qihou, Lu Hanjun, Sun Lingxin, Ling Peng, and Hu Youcheng, the team is quite impressive. Furthermore, the "fat" players have their own characteristics. Their weight exceeds others, making them difficult to bump into. Competing with them easily leads to fouls. Therefore, this team is indeed a special one, possessing a unique characteristic to excite fans.

Shandui B: The fact that a group of young players surrounding You Qinggou was able to win the Shenbao Cup Group B championship is evident here. This time, with the participation of Lin Zhiren, a famous player from Group A, it feels like adding wings to a tiger, adding a central figure. However, ultimately, because they still need to hone their skills, it may be difficult to have the most ideal results, but they can be expected to achieve a middle-level position.

Qingxie: All of them are young and strong players. In terms of strategy, they can adapt to the current situation, using a five-man zone defense or man-to-man marking, improvising as needed, which is most commendable. Therefore, this team has a very promising future. Liu Zuxi and He Lide have the demeanor of great generals.

Lusheng: The entire team is tall, which is one of their prerequisites. The team members train diligently, so their shooting accuracy is remarkably high. It's a pity that they lack experience. Looking at their strength, they cannot be underestimated. However, during matches, the team sometimes has unusual errors. Given time, they have great potential.

Qianghua: This team is formed from former second-tier players of the Paramount Ballroom. Speaking of which, all of them were once famous players, such as Qian Jingyong, Yaleikang, Senkang, Lu Huozhen, and Wang Wenji. Their past glory can still be remembered. Ultimately, because they are old, it is difficult to compete with the young. The fourth-place position may be seized by this team.

### Simple Fitness Training Methods (24)

â€” Written by Tom, translated from German by a German translator

This exercise can be seen at a glance to be similar to riding a wooden horse. The upper part of the body uses the body as a pivot, and moves forward and backward, and the legs also alternate, stretching forward and backward.

Hands on the waist, extend the right leg forward, and swing the body backward. When the right leg returns to its original position, the left leg immediately extends backward, while the body swings forward. Alternate touching the ground with the left and right feet (only the root of the toes touches the ground). It is best to touch the same spot, or close to it.

Wooden Horse Exercise: Hands on the waist: Prepare: Mount: Rest: (Three times).

Note: Continuous exercise for a few seconds. For individual practice, continue until breathing becomes deep and labored.

Thirty-nine: Climbing Stairs Exercise

The reason it is called climbing stairs exercise is because most people, when climbing stairs, are actually climbing, especially women.

Among all kinds of exercises, the most effective for strengthening the body and invigorating the mind is climbing up and down stairs, but the air in the room must be clean.

This exercise has three benefits: (1) strengthens leg muscles, (2) increases lung capacity, (3) regulates breathing.

If primary school teachers know the benefits of this exercise, they will no longer fear the labor of climbing stairs, but will instead regard it as a blessing, and will arrive at school early and go up and down several times as practice. When the day's work is finished, if you feel physically and mentally fatigued, you should go up and down several more times before going home to rest. In fact, if you can train students to do stair climbing exercises for ten minutes in the morning and afternoon, you will definitely not feel tired.

However, when practicing this exercise, you should pay attention to the following three characteristics:

First, when climbing stairs, only step on the stairs with the roots of the toes. If the whole foot is on the ground, and the heel hits hard, it will shake the brain and directly violate physiological principles.

Second, lean the body forward, but do not bend your back. Stick out your chest to avoid hindering breathing.

Third, the mouth should be kept tightly closed. (This is extremely difficult, especially if two or three people are traveling together, it is difficult to keep silent.) Every breath is a diaphragmatic breath, not a clavicular breath.

Do not talk when climbing the stairs, and it is best to remain silent when approaching the top of the stairs. Do not exhale all of the remaining air. Do not open your mouth under any circumstances until your breathing returns to normal. If breathing is adequate, deep, and labored, it is best to keep your mouth tightly closed; only open your mouth when your heart and lungs have returned to normal. This last point is the most important. If you can abide by it, you can increase lung capacity, and you can also benefit a lot in terms of pronunciation.

When descending the stairs, the body should be straight, only the knee joints should bend, and you can only step on the stairs with the heels of your toes. When walking down, walk slowly and silently, with graceful posture; each step must be firm and hidden.

Forty: Practice on Time

The way to fitness has been briefly described here, but there is still one thing to say before the end of this book. If scholars want to get the most harvest from the above-mentioned exercises, they must practice on time every day, regard it as a religious duty, and be as devout and punctual as zealous religious people are to prayer.

Get up every morning and do fifty flexion and extension exercises, without stopping for the rest of your life. Exercise your joints in the morning, and exercise your muscles before going to bed in the evening. After a long period of mental exertion, often do special exercises, such as lifting your heels and touching your toes to the ground.

Between breakfast and lunch, doing various strenuous exercises is most suitable in terms of the body.

After exercising in the morning and evening, if the body is strong and the reaction is good, you can wipe your body with cold water, otherwise use lukewarm water to avoid cold.

Do not catch a cold while bathing. Put a little salt in a bowl of water and wipe your body with it to strengthen your spirit and prevent colds or being attacked by cold air.

Finally, there is one more point. If you want to make this body a suitable dwelling for the soul, you must pay careful attention to the following three things: what you eat, what you drink, and what you think. These three are closely related to human health and cannot be ignored in the slightest. (End of full text)

### Two New Stars in Women's Basketball

â€” Mei Jie

In recent years, women's basketball and volleyball in Shanghai have been rising rapidly, full of vitality. Emerging strong teams such as Lianyi and Yikang can be said to be at their peak for a time, which is indeed a good phenomenon in the sports world. However, what we regret is that there are not many rising stars. Currently, among the women who are famous and enjoy the highest reputation, none are better than the Green Team. Unfortunately, the soldiers under their command are still generally veterans, such as Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Weizhen, who are all well-known early on. Recently, after Huang Xingfen, Zhang Jiazhen, Shi Ruijuan and others successively got married and left the basketball career, it made us feel the need to discover new stars even more. In this season's open basketball game, the reporter recently discovered two new comets, one is Xie Lijian from the Overseas Chinese team, and the other is Le Jiasai from the Three Provinces team. Now I will briefly describe the advantages of the two new comets to encourage the rising stars.

Xie Lijian

Miss Xie is the captain of the Overseas Chinese team. She is beautiful and healthy. She deserves the name "Lijian." Like her name, her ball-handling movements are crisp, alert, and calm, and she has the demeanor of a great general. In the crowd, her one-handed probe, standing up and shooting, is accurate in angle and is indeed a rare feat, which is admirable. In terms of skills, even compared with the Green Team's generals, she is not inferior. Given time, her attainments will be unlimited. I hope Miss Xie will take good care of herself. There are high hopes.

Le Jiabao

Miss Le is the daughter of the famous football referee Le Xiurong. As the daughter of a general's family, she has a family background and is of moderate height, lively and exquisite. She is currently a formal forward in the Three Provinces team. Her passing is agile, her basic movements are extremely commendable, and her shooting is extremely accurate. When the ball enters her hand, the opponent's defender cannot plunder it, which is especially commendable. It is said that Miss Le has not practiced basketball for many days. This season, she joined the Three Provinces team and immediately showed her talent, which is not easy. If it is not for rich talent and diligent hard work, it is difficult to achieve this, and her father's good guidance should not be ignored.
