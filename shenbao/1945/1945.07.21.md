### Recovery of Guangzhou Bay Leased Territory: National Government Issued Statement Yesterday; Administrative Rights Transferred on the 16th

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency): Regarding the recovery of the Guangzhou Bay leased territory, the National Government issued the following statement at 4:00 PM on the 20th: The Qing Dynasty, Guangxu 25th year, that is, 1899 AD, France, in order to equalize efforts with other nations in China, forcibly concluded the Guangzhou Bay Leased Territory Treaty with our country. The lease period was ninety-nine years, during which they would exercise governance over the area. After the European War, due to the heightened global situation, our country long held the determination to recover the leased territory. The French government declared at international conferences that it would return the leased territory. Furthermore, on March 20th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, a statement was issued on returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, and the return of concessions was gradually implemented that year. However, the Guangzhou Bay leased territory has not yet been returned. After March 10th of this year, France ceased exercising administrative power in the leased territory, and French military equipment and arms in Guangzhou Bay have also been dismantled. Therefore, the Guangzhou Bay Lease Treaty concluded in Guangxu 25th year (i.e., 1899 AD) has completely lost its contractual purpose between the two countries, China and France. In order to achieve independence, autonomy, and territorial integrity, the National Government of the Republic of China directly recovered the administrative rights of the leased territory on July 16th, 34th year of the Republic, and hereby declares this.

### Japanese Minister Togo's Statement

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Government, in accordance with the wishes of the Chinese government, transferred all administrative rights of Guangzhou Bay, the former French leased territory, by the 16th of this month. The Guangzhou leased territory was a treaty forcibly concluded by France during the opportunity of the British and American invasion of China in 1899, i.e., the 25th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, with a term of ninety-nine years. This time, the National Government accepted the administrative rights of the territory on the 16th, which is the appropriate 47th year since it was invaded and occupied, to recover Chinese territory and immediately appointed Mr. Zhen Xuedan, an influential figure in the area, as the chief of the Guangzhou Bay administrative district. Moreover, Togo, the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, issued the following statement regarding the National Government's recovery of the French leased territory of Guangzhou Bay: The Empire has always fully cooperated in restoring Chinese sovereignty regarding the National Government's recovery of the French leased territory of Guangzhou Bay, and it is truly cause for celebration. The recovery of the Guangzhou Bay leased territory, which France forcibly acquired during the British and American invasion of China in the 25th year of Guangxu, coincides with the remarkable progress in the cause of liberating East Asia, and we deeply rejoice in the National Government's completion of the reception of this leased territory. Currently, Britain and the United States are again employing their old tricks, once again placing the liberated East Asian nations under their yokes, displaying their rampant aggression and willfulness. The National Government is gradually completing its sovereignty, actively unifying its administration, aiming to crush the unscrupulous ambitions of imperialist countries, and possesses an even firmer determination.

### Battles in Burma: Japanese Army's War Results

Burma Frontline Base, 20th (Central Fire News Agency): In early July, the Japanese army crossed the Xitang River and launched a counteroffensive, gradually strengthening their position. The enemy army was greatly shaken and dispatched the Indian 7th Army near Bloom to the Xitang area to actively defend. They also mobilized the Mandalay 3rd Army to the Mandalay Highway. The battle lines are now concentrated on the Xitang River front.

Burma Front Frontline Base, 20th (Central News Agency): The enemy is eager to seize Burma, so they concentrated a large number of troops to attack Kalaw and Loiilem, attempting to break through Gama in one fell swoop. The Japanese army relied on the steep terrain to counterattack the invading enemy. A unit of the Japanese army also sneaked into the enemy's position in the rain. Since early July, they have annihilated 200 enemies near Kalaw and Loiilem, capturing many weapons.

### General Okamura's Remarks: Guangzhou Newspapers Support

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency): General Okamura, commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces stationed in China, recently made remarks to Chinese reporters regarding the movements of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces and the relationship with the former Yan'an. On the 19th, various Chinese and Japanese newspapers here published them with large headlines, and continuing reports appeared on the 20th, attracting much attention. Especially at a time when the enemy's (America's) military offensive target since the Okinawa campaign is whether it is the Japanese mainland or the Chinese mainland, General Okamura frankly disclosed the position of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces and their future attitude, candidly conveying their beliefs to the Chinese people, showing the solemn attitude of the Japanese army stationed in China. Because the voices of peace are quite high at the moment, some believe that a decisive battle between Japan and the United States will be fought in this devastated Chinese mainland, which will increase the suffering of the Chinese people even more, or they speculate that the Japanese army will seek a decisive battleground in other regions, and even hastily discuss the issue of Japan's troop withdrawal. General Okamura's words have corrected these erroneous ideas, so they are highly appreciated. Especially the news media, standing in the position of guiding public opinion, fully approve and trust the decisive attitude of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces, which will have a great impact on their future guidance of the people.

### Landing Forces Clearing Ternate Island

Southern Frontline Base, 19th (Central News Agency): After sweeping the remaining enemy forces in the Sotoma area east of Ternate Island, the Japanese army annihilated another 200 enemies by the 16th, and as a result, the enemy landing forces on the island have been completely cleared.

### Strategy for Certain Victory in Saving the Nation

â€” Lieutenant General Ishihara Kanji of the Japanese Army

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): Lieutenant General Ishihara Kanji of the Japanese Army, in this extraordinary situation, specially communicated his three grand ideals for saving the nation to the country's court, which is noteworthy. The full translation of his article is as follows: The war situation is not in our favor, and the Empire is already facing the prospect of a decisive battle on the mainland, which is truly a difficult autumn for the nation. After reflecting on the Manchurian Incident, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Greater East Asia War, I am filled with emotion. Today is not a time for empty talk, but rather for considering how to overcome this crisis and advance with three strategies for certain victory in saving the nation, hoping the entire nation will:

### Promote the Essence of the Japanese National Polity

First, the essence of our national polity, where the Emperor personally governs, should shine even brighter. The Emperor is the supreme commander of the army and navy, and all matters are referred to him. That is, the Emperor has overall control of general governing power and command authority. This is the strength of our national polity, unmatched by other countries. Other countries may experience inconsistencies between political and military strategies during wartime, but this will never occur in a setting that promotes the essence of our national polity. Once a sacred decision is made, everyone will set aside everything and follow it wholeheartedly, advancing in unison. In this way, we can develop the best strategy externally and integrate combat power to the highest degree internally.

### Complete Freedom of Speech and Association

Second, there should be complete freedom of speech and association. Speech cannot be suppressed by force. If it is forcibly suppressed, it will cause the people to blindly follow, and without spiritual strength, rebellious and rash remarks will emerge from among the people. Long-term wars absolutely prohibit the reporting of falsehoods. In short, the people should be consciously and gradually informed of all facts except for military secrets. In addition, the ideal state of mind, where the people share joys and sorrows, can be created without effort. Freedom of association is the root for generating the vigorous power of the people. In the past, almost all national organizations were controlling in nature. Although they possessed vigorous strength, the control from above ultimately led to unpredictable results. To make rash remarks, to have a passion for saving the nation, and then to form alliances, this is the true way of fighting, and the emergence of new heroes can be expected.

Third, to form a truly national force, practicing a battle-ready formation. At this critical juncture, it is even more evident that the concept of total national war effort has been completely wrong in Japan. The world believes that total war effort means that the military authorities can concurrently manage politics, economy, and everything else. In reality, the opposite is true. The military should only focus on combat operations, and the government and people must transform into pure soldiers, so the military can have no worries and devote all their energy to politics, economy, and all aspects, which is the true meaning of total war effort. Since the military is engaged in combat, they have no time to attend to political matters. Japan, where the military and people trust each other and fight together, transforming into a true total war effort formation, even if the opportune moment is slightly missed, cannot be denied. But it is not too late to implement it urgently.

### Those Remaining Should Be Moved to Burned Areas

Regarding homeland operations, the first major issue is how to defend against enemy air raids. The enemy will not land rashly, but will first carry out intense air raids, aiming to thoroughly scorch the entire Japanese mainland. How will we respond? I have long advocated the redistribution of the domestic population, that is, to scientifically consider the three elements of population, food, and factory production, and redistribute them to various regions. Those who have been burned out or will be burned out in various cities should be completely evacuated to the burned areas. The population evacuated from the cities should be systematically relocated to rural areas.

### Large Cities Are Unsuitable for War

If Japan's war effort can not rely on large cities, the food supply can also be secured. Factories can be built underground and in rural villages, making Japan stronger for war. That's why I have long argued that large cities are unnecessary. From the perspective of the deepening war, large cities are no longer suitable for modern warfare. With the appearance of new weapons with the ability to destroy war effort, if the nation still concentrates most of its production in large cities, it can be said to be exposing its greatest weakness.

### Yan'an Prepares to Establish a Co-operative Government

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency): In order to confront the Chongqing government's National Assembly, Yan'an intends to convene the People's Representative Conference of the Chinese Liberated Areas on November 12th and is currently making preparations. The Chongqing authorities were quite excited upon hearing this news. According to a United Press report from Chongqing, Yan'an has plans to unite various factions to establish a cooperative government, which has particularly stimulated Chongqing. Yan'an's goal is to form a democratic and unified cooperative government. The cracks in the relationship between the KMT and the CCP were born from this. If this news is confirmed, then they will have long separated from the Chongqing government and established a cooperative government guided by their own faction. However, due to the lack of definitive reports from Yan'an, the truth is unclear. The United Press reported the attitude of the Chongqing authorities as follows: The Chongqing government has not received accurate information and therefore its spokesperson was unable to formally express an attitude at today's meeting with the press corps.

### Chongqing Political Council Passes Important Proposals

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency): According to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing National Political Council passed the following resolutions on the 17th: (1) To immediately ratify the International Charter; (2) The four countries of Chongqing, Britain, the United States, and France should conclude a military alliance. The proposal for the alliance advocates that the four countries should emulate the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance between Britain and the Soviet Union, and France and the Soviet Union, concluding a four-country alliance treaty for a period of twenty years, with negotiations initiated by the Chongqing government. According to United Press, the reason the United States is not included in the alliance is because the treaty clearly contradicts the traditional policy of the United States, so they did not bring the United States in. As for the sudden resolution of unexpected matters by the National Political Council, it is because progressive elements, including representatives from Yan'an, had previously boycotted the meeting, causing widespread discouragement. In order to attract national attention and to reverse the general impression that the "general counteroffensive against Japan is nominal rather than real," Chongqing proposed to develop the joint front of the United Nations into an alliance relationship in order to meet domestic expectations, with a very clear intention.

### Over 100 B-29 Aircraft Attack Fukui and Amagasaki; Confirmed 24 Shot Down and Destroyed

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): Approximately 170 enemy B-29 aircraft from the Southern Base attacked the Kinki region for an hour and a half starting at 10:30 PM on the 19th.

As for the Japanese side's war results, the Osaka Garrison Headquarters of the Central Military District Command announced the following at 10:00 AM that day: Currently confirmed, 5 enemy aircraft were shot down and 19 were destroyed.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): Approximately 80 enemy B-29 aircraft, for two hours starting from midnight on the 19th, invaded near Okazaki City from the Shima Peninsula and attacked with incendiary bombs, causing fires in the city. The fires were completely extinguished by dawn.

### Air Raids on Several Small Cities in the East

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): Approximately 150 enemy B-29 aircraft, for about three hours starting at 11:00 PM on the 19th, in single aircraft or small formations, attacked various small cities scattered throughout the Eastern Military District, dropping incendiary bombs. The first wave of approximately 80 aircraft dropped incendiary bombs on Hitachi City, Takahagi Town, Toyoura Town, Taga Town, Otsu Town, etc., in Ibaraki Prefecture from 11:10 PM to 4:45 AM the next day. The second wave of approximately 60 aircraft attacked Choshi City with incendiary bombs between 0:30 AM and 3:00 AM on the 20th, causing fires in various places, but they were soon extinguished. In addition, 80 B-29 aircraft dropped naval mines in the sea near Niigata between 0:45 AM and 1:30 AM on the 20th. The Japanese army's anti-aircraft artillery shot down two aircraft and damaged three.

Editorial

### Calling on All Citizens to Rescue Victims of the Sudden Raids

On the 17th and 18th, our city was bombed by enemy aircraft. The miserable suffering of the innocent citizens in the affected areas was witnessed or heard by all citizens, and we believe that everyone has been left with a very deep impression. For the sake of humanity, for the sake of public morals, and for the sake of the future safety of the citizens of our city, all citizens who have not suffered disasters today have a real responsibility to engage in relief efforts for those who have been unfortunate. Therefore, we earnestly appeal to all citizens to contribute money if they have money, and contribute strength if they have strength, to jointly establish a unified organization for air raid disaster relief, and to quickly advance the real disaster relief work. If this organization is sound and the work is quick and practical, not only can countless people who have already suffered disasters be rescued now, but also when enemy aircraft come to wreak havoc again in the future, we can reduce many losses or mitigate the extent of damage because we have this organized and planned relief work.

The most urgent issues to be resolved are, first, the burial of those killed in the air raids. In this hot season, exposing corpses in the streets and alleys is extremely harmful to public health and should be buried as soon as possible. Second, the treatment of the injured, especially the seriously injured, relies on the public and private hospitals, medical offices, and doctors in each district and street to stand up together and assume this emergency rescue work. Third, among those who have suffered in the air raids, some elderly people have lost their children, some children and teenagers have lost their parents, and some women have lost their husbands, or have lost their means of support due to severe injuries and disabilities, and their lives have no direction. They should be rescued in a unified manner.

For the sake of emergency relief for air raid victims, the Citizens' Welfare Association of our city specially convened a board meeting at our newspaper's conference room yesterday and invited Secretary-General Luo of our city to attend and provide guidance. From this meeting, it can be seen that in this critical moment, the municipal authorities and leaders from all walks of life in our city have great sympathy, concern, and agreement on the issue of disaster relief. Secretary-General Luo further affirmed that the people must automatically rise up to cooperate with the authorities in carrying out relief work, and that the people's organizations must be unified to concentrate their efforts and take unified steps to achieve results quickly.

Relief work requires funding first, and under the current price situation, a large amount of funding is especially needed. Therefore, we must temporarily solicit donations from the citizens. The directors of the Citizens' Welfare Association immediately pledged 10 million yuan at the meeting. In addition to allocating a portion of the relief bonds, the city government allocated another 10 million yuan, despite the difficult financial situation, to achieve greater results. Our newspaper has always taken the lead in social welfare, and although its own economy is in extreme difficulties, it would rather take out a loan and donate 10 million yuan. The newspaper company of the same industry also voluntarily donated 10 million yuan, and the New China Daily and tabloids also voluntarily raised 1 million yuan. The Shanghai News will also donate all of its evacuation assistance funds, all of which are intended to demonstrate advocacy from the standpoint of the media. Our newspaper's social service department has been collecting donations from all walks of life since the 19th, and in two days, it has reached nearly 30 million yuan, which shows that there are many people who sympathize with us, which is gratifying. We still hope that all sectors of the city will unite and continue to act righteously to jointly complete this relief work.

Currently, many sectors are spontaneously organizing air raid relief work, and their spirit of public service is admirable. We hope that under the same goal, for the sake of concentrating efforts to achieve greater results, all organizations should establish close contact with the Citizens' Welfare Association. On the one hand, it can meet the expectations of the authorities to promote relief work in a unified manner, and on the other hand, it can avoid dispersion and other inappropriate tendencies.

Finally, we still have three points to appeal to all citizens: First, a portion of the relief bonds issued by the city government not long ago was originally designated for air raid relief expenses. However, there are still some who have subscribed but not paid or who have not paid enough for the original civilian subscription. We hope that the responsible persons of the various industry associations will pay attention. If they have not been paid in full, they should be paid in full as soon as possible so that they can be used for relief work as soon as possible, and do not wait and see again, so as not to leave a bad impression. Second, the Citizens' Welfare Association has decided to establish various committees and establish first-aid medical stations in various districts. This is to ensure that the victims can be treated nearby in each district and street in the future. We hope that hospitals and doctors in various districts will automatically stand up and participate in the rescue work. Third, air raids will become more frequent in the future, and the need for medical supplies and medicines will increase. On the one hand, we hope that large and small pharmacies will supply them at affordable prices as much as possible. On the other hand, we hope that all those who are hoarding gauze, cotton wool, red potion, camphor oil, etc. will quickly find their conscience and sell them in large quantities (it would be even better if they could donate!). You must know that bombs are merciless, and there will be many opportunities for them to be completely destroyed in the future, so it is better to sell them earlier!

Air raid relief is urgent and imminent. We hope that all citizens will unite and rise up to complete the organization and actively promote the work as soon as possible.

This person used to be the Iranian Prime Minister, and was elected as a lower house official last year. When the Soviet Union and Iran were negotiating the division of oil rights, he insisted on a tough stance against the Soviet Union and was the central figure in the Iranian government who opposed the cession of rights. Also, according to Tass News Agency of Pravda, the reactionary atmosphere in Iran has been extremely strong recently.

### Civic Welfare Association Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Disaster Relief, Secretary-General Luo Delivers Speech Encouraging Mutual Assistance

The city suffered two enemy air raids on the 17th and 18th, resulting in a large number of innocent civilian deaths and injuries. The disaster area is in a terrible state. The municipal authorities are very concerned and hope that the public will demonstrate a spirit of mutual assistance and actively undertake relief work. To concentrate efforts, a unified organization should be formed to coordinate everything, cooperate with the city government's various relief facilities, and achieve maximum efficiency. Mr. Wen Lanting, Chairman of the Shanghai Civic Welfare Association, recognized this and, witnessing the tragedy, felt deep sympathy. Therefore, he convened a meeting of all directors at the Shen Bao building on Hankou Road yesterday afternoon. The attendees included Chairman Wen Lanting, Vice-Chairmen Li Sihao, Zhao Jinqing, Yuan Fudeng, Lin [blank], Chen Bin[blank], Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Nanqun, Pei Yunqing, Dong Shaoyi, Chen Riping, Wang Boyuan, Jin Xiongbo, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, and Secretary-General Hu Shouqi.

Secretary-General Luo delivered a speech, encouraging the public to demonstrate compassion and mutual assistance, contribute money and effort, and assist the municipal government in carrying out relief work. He emphasized that relief work must unify civilian organizations to concentrate efforts and achieve great results. Previously, the municipal government issued relief treasury bonds, with 20 million yuan designated for temporary relief. However, some relief treasury bonds have been subscribed but not fully paid. He hoped that the payments would be made as soon as possible. In addition, although the municipal government is facing severe economic difficulties, it has allocated another 10 million yuan to increase the effectiveness of relief efforts. Subsequently, discussions began, and four resolutions were passed:

Urge Payment of Relief Treasury Bonds

There is still 13 million yuan that has been subscribed but not paid in full or only partially paid. The deadline for full payment is one week, with no further notice. Please pay attention to the chairmen of the various associations that have not paid, and do not delay or hesitate. Wen Lanting and Li Sihao will temporarily advance the funds. 20 million yuan of treasury bonds will be allocated for air raid relief.

### Transportation Guild Notifies Members to Transport Wounded Citizens in Case of Air Raid at Any Time

Recently, the city has suffered repeated air raids. The civil defense authorities have paid close attention to rescue work. Immediately after an attack, rescue personnel are dispatched to drive ambulances to the affected areas for emergency treatment. However, vehicles are often insufficient. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Cui Shifu, chairman of the city's Transportation Trade Association, to inquire whether transportation vehicles could assist in rescue work and transport wounded citizens after an attack. He replied: "This issue has already been considered, and concrete measures have been drafted. All member vehicle companies (approximately 400 vehicles in total) were notified on the 19th that in the event of an air raid, regardless of where vehicles are parked or driven, they should assist civil defense or Baojia personnel in transporting dead or injured citizens, without any excuses for refusal. In particular, managers of each vehicle company should warn drivers not to avoid transporting injured citizens on their own. In other words, in the event of an air raid, Baojia or civil defense personnel can order parked or moving transportation vehicles to assist in the task of transporting dead or injured citizens. Those who refuse without a valid reason will have their car numbers recorded and reported to the association for punishment."

### Economic Bureau Approves New Milk Price

The city's Milk Farm Association previously submitted a request to the Municipal Economic Bureau on June 30, to adjust the price of fresh milk from July 6. The bureau, considering that the previous case had been approved not long ago, did not approve it, and ordered that the original price of June 21 should still be sold, and the price increase notice issued on the 2nd should be withdrawn to all customers. Recently, the association again requested an adjustment from July 21, citing the continued increase in the price of feed materials, in order to avoid losses. After investigation by the Economic Bureau and verification of the cost sheet submitted by the association, which was found to be consistent, it has been approved to take effect from July 21. However, before that date, all customers should still pay the original price of June 21. The agreed price list is recorded as follows:

(A) Pasteurized Milk Grade A (tested for tuberculosis), 2-pound bottle 6640 yuan, 1-pound bottle 3360 yuan, half-pound bottle 1840 yuan. Grade A, 6320 yuan, 3200 yuan, 1760 yuan. Grade B, 6000 yuan, 3040 yuan, 1680 yuan.

(B) Unpasteurized Milk Grade A (tested for tuberculosis), 2-pound bottle, 5600 yuan, 1-pound bottle 2880 yuan, half-pound bottle 1600 yuan. Grade A, 5280 yuan, 2720 yuan, 1520 yuan. Grade B, 4960 yuan, 2560 yuan, 1440 yuan.

### Special Court Sentences Accomplice in Case of Forcibly Extorting People's Wealth, Zhai Suozeng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

According to the reporter's inquiry from the Shanghai branch of the Special Court yesterday, the court previously approved the execution of the main criminals Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping in the case of forcibly extorting people's wealth, and the execution was carried out at the Racecourse. It is now learned that there was another accomplice in the case, Zhai Suozeng. At that time, he was hospitalized due to illness. After his recovery, he was escorted to the court for trial. The trial ended last month and was submitted to the Chairman of the National Government for approval. He was sentenced yesterday (20th) at 9:00 AM. Zhai Suozeng was sentenced to life imprisonment with a fine of 50,000 yuan for jointly intending to obtain illegal benefits, using power and coercion to extort people's property, and was deprived of public rights for life. If he is unable to pay the fine, the fine will be converted into labor service at the rate of the total amount of the fine divided by the number of days in six months. The illegal gains of 70,000 yuan will be recovered and confiscated.

It is noted that Zhai Suozeng was previously a police officer at the Huashan Police Branch in the city. After being laid off, he colluded with Li Hongxin, Du Zhiping, and Gu Weiliang (who are already executed or at large) at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Jiangsu Road at 5:00 AM on April 5 this year, under the guise of checking residents' permits, in an attempt to obtain illegal benefits. However, Zhai Suozeng had been laid off at the time of the crime and did not have the status of a civil servant. Therefore, the court did not sentence him to death.

### Hongyu Money Exchange Ordered to Suspend Business, Not Approved by Ministry of Finance

The Hongyu Money Exchange on the second floor of 105 Jiangxi Road in the city was ordered to suspend business and fined 200,000 yuan as a warning because it had not applied for registration with the Ministry of Finance, but operated without authorization, and its name was the same as that of Hongyu Money Exchange at 518 Hankou Road in the city. The Ministry of Finance investigated and consulted with the municipal government to instruct the Finance Bureau to send personnel to order the suspension of business and impose a fine of 200,000 yuan in accordance with Article 3 of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions.

### Silver Money Houses Extensively Provide Cash

However, each household is allowed to withdraw cash each week based on the lowest deposit amount of the previous week, not exceeding 1 million yuan.

### Urgent Need for Scholarship Funds, Appeal to Silver Money Industry to Take the Lead

It would be good to sponsor one team, even better to sponsor several teams

It is said that the accounts of silver money houses at the end of June showed profits for every one of the hundreds of houses. Therefore, we earnestly request that the responsible persons of the hundreds of houses on the sea come forward to support the scholarship movement, donate some scholarship funds, no matter how much, and we hope to do so as soon as possible. It would be good to sponsor one team, even better to sponsor several teams. For the houses, donating 100,000 or 200,000 yuan is not a drop in the bucket, but our scholarship fund records are indeed accumulating day by day, and we can complete the target of 30 million yuan as soon as possible.

The scholarship movement is the most active work and the most far-reaching plan of all good deeds; it is a century-long plan for cultivating talents for the country, directly related to rescuing out-of-school children, and indirectly preparing materials for the country, cultivating valuable vitality, the reason is very clear. The reason why we earnestly hope from the silver money industry is that the silver money industry is the mother of all industries, the confluence of all streams. Once it is advocated, all industries will rise up, like the response of the mountains. We hope that the leaders of the silver money industry will not have a wait-and-see attitude, do not follow the example of looking at Yue from afar, we cannot but pray sincerely, and bow our heads to thank you on behalf of thousands of poor students!

Social Service

### All Circles Spontaneously Sympathize with Air Raid Victims, Actively Donate and Make Further Efforts

Since this city has been subjected to air raids, all sectors of society have actively promoted relief work. Since this office began collecting donations on behalf of those in need, enthusiastic people have donated one after another yesterday, like wildfire, receiving over one million in donations again. This is based entirely on the human heart of compassion, self-motivation, mutual assistance, so the amount of donations, the size of the donations, are self-evident. However, disaster victims are displaced, wandering in distress, and in need of assistance; how urgent their needs are! It depends on influential people to make greater efforts, generously donate, actively provide assistance, helping themselves and others, achieving immeasurable merit. The following are excerpts from incoming letters:

The entire staff of the Shilu Branch of HSBC Bank wrote: "Recently, the northeastern area of our city has been repeatedly bombed, the disaster is serious, and the displaced are miserable to witness. We are all filled with sympathy upon hearing the news. We are sending 1.5 million National Currency dollars to be used for relief expenses. We pray that this be divided and donated to the air raid disaster relief fund, 500,000 dollars each to the Pushan Villa and the China Children's Welfare Association, contributing a trickle of soil to form a mound."

The staff of the Pudong Electrical Business Office of Huazhong Water and Electricity Company wrote: "Our city has suffered a terrible bombing. Our staff cannot stand idly by, so we have gathered 300,000 dollars in donations, hoping you will check and forward it to the relief agencies. We know that a drop in the bucket is not enough, but we hope to gather together small things to make a big contribution."

Christian Churches Providing Relief

The Shanghai Christian Association, in view of wartime needs, organized a temporary relief association three months ago and divided the city into six districts, each district forming a unit. Larger churches in the districts were set up as shelters and first-aid stations, recruiting service personnel and training them in first-aid knowledge for relief purposes. On the one hand, funds are raised to pre-purchase food and firewood for use in emergencies. Recently, when the northeast area of Shanghai was bombed, many civilians were killed and injured. The district's first-aid station immediately mobilized all service personnel to go to the rescue and opened the church as a temporary shelter, which was quite effective. If the bombing situation in Shanghai expands in the future, the need for the association will be even greater, so the association has been extremely busy in recent days.

### Mr. Huang Jingwan Hopes for Friends' Assistance

Former Director of this office, Mr. Huang Jingwan, has spared no effort in serving social, cultural, and charitable causes on a daily basis. He lived frugally and has no savings. Recently, he suddenly suffered from a toothache and was hospitalized in Antang Hospital for treatment. He has been there for almost two weeks, and he has not yet recovered. He is unable to bear the medical expenses, and it is even more difficult to maintain the livelihood of a family of several people. Although Mr. Huang's old friends, the Masters of Yuzhai and Nanzhai, and Layman Rong, have donated medical expenses, they are concerned that Mr. Huang has not yet recovered from his illness, and that he will need to continue to recuperate after his illness. His financial situation is dire. Colleagues at this office, out of sympathy, plan to ask Mr. Huang's friends to lend a helping hand by providing financial assistance, which will be collected and forwarded by this office. We would be most grateful.

### Authorities in This City Strengthen the Promotion of Air Raid Rescue Work, Director Noguchi and Others Talk at Press Conference

The regular press conference hosted by the City Propaganda Department was held at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 20th) at the City Hall, attended by Zhou Yuying, Director of the City Social Welfare Bureau and Director of the Social Relief Department of the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, Noguchi, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters and Deputy Director of the Social Relief Department, and Gu Senqian, Director of the Propaganda Department. They spoke in detail on the necessity of strengthening air defense equipment and enhancing rescue and relief work during sudden attacks, as well as the public's desire for the Social Welfare Bureau to actively manage relief matters. Details are recorded as follows:

Director Gu's Speech

Director Gu said: In Shanghai, which is now being subjected to surprise attacks by enemy aircraft, it is imperative to actively strengthen air defense equipment to protect the lives and property of citizens. The air defense authorities have long been aware of this. As for popular relief and rescue organizations, leaders from all walks of life have spontaneously initiated organizations to respond to emergencies. Some hospitals lack humanitarianism and demand exorbitant pre-payments of cash for medical expenses from people in distress, even refusing to admit patients. The authorities attach great importance to this matter and plan to completely control all rescue and medical supplies needed by patients during air raids to meet any emergency. Regarding the issue of rescuing and providing relief to citizens injured or affected by enemy air raids, we have invited Director Zhou and Director Noguchi to report on this.

Welfare Bureau Director's Speech

Director Zhou said: What this bureau has long been paying attention to is the issue of social relief in peacetime, while the issue of social relief in emergencies is the work of the Social Relief Department of the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters. Regarding the general relief issues of the enemy air raids on Shanghai on the 17th and 18th of this month, in addition to the Social Welfare Bureau shouldering full preparation, we also hope that leaders from all walks of life will set up relief and rescue organizations as soon as possible to popularize relief work. Director Noguchi is also very concerned about this matter and will do his best to assist in promoting relief matters.

Director Noguchi's Speech

Subsequently, Noguchi said: I will briefly report to you on the rescue and relief situation during the enemy air raids on Shanghai on the 17th and 18th of this month. In the past, the Air Defense Headquarters was prepared for the possibility of enemy aircraft attacking Shanghai, so it vigorously trained members of the rescue and stretcher teams as a backup. As a result, enemy aircraft recently came and carried out indiscriminate bombing. The majority of those killed and injured were Chinese, while only a very small number were Japanese. Due to this surprise attack, the citizens of the city should pay more attention to the measures taken by the Air Defense Headquarters. During the enemy air raids, the members of the rescue and relief teams worked extremely hard, but it was still not satisfactory. The headquarters will sincerely accept all suggestions from all sides.

Hope for Citizen Preparation

Regarding the patients admitted by various private hospitals this time, the headquarters will provide the necessary medical supplies to ensure that they can proceed smoothly. If an air raid occurs south of the Suzhou River, the headquarters has also made full preparations for rescue matters. Citizens should use this experience to gain a deeper understanding of the Air Defense Headquarters' preparations for air defense. In addition, the authorities and all parties are making every effort to assist the headquarters in its work. There should be no difficulty in obtaining the necessary rescue materials, and we are absolutely responsible for supplying the necessary medical materials. However, in the event that a certain place is air-raided or multiple places are air-raided, the need for materials will be extremely urgent. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life will donate generously.

Hospitals Extorting Consultation Fees

The headquarters' rescue teams are composed of Chinese and foreign personnel and are prepared to be deployed in the future. During the previous air raid on the northeast area of Shanghai, two Hungarian expatriate doctors in the foreign air defense team voluntarily went to the rescue. It is regrettable that some hospitals actually demanded cash before providing medical treatment, which is the greatest disgrace to the medical profession. Doctors should contribute their skills to society unconditionally during this wartime, but the headquarters will prepare to reduce the materials they consume.

Food and Clothing, Planning Ahead

Under air raids, not only is there a problem of food, but clothing is also needed. I once had a plan to hope that every citizen can donate one Sheng of rice and store it in various places. By accumulating small amounts, we can achieve comprehensive relief. In the event that disaster victims in air-raided areas are in urgent need, there will be no food panic. Although people's lives are more difficult at this time, as long as citizens share this goal, even if each family donates one Sheng of rice, they can prepare for air raid food relief. As for the clothing problem, citizens can also pack their excess clothes in a bag and send them to the police station in charge for use in case clothing is needed. If there is no air raid disaster, it can be taken back. However, this headquarters does not take the initiative on these food and clothing preparations, and it is best if citizens can prepare on their own.

The Matter of Digging Air Raid Shelters

Before a considerable period of time, citizens did not understand the purpose of the headquarters' facilities. When we launched the digging of air raid shelters, many people were uncooperative. Now, in this air raid, all the citizens who hid in the air raid shelters were actually able to save their lives. From this experience, citizens should gain a deeper understanding of the importance of digging air raid shelters.

Setting Up First Aid Stations in Each District

South of the Suzhou River, 13 air defense districts will be established based on the police jurisdiction. Each district will have a team leader, and below that, there will be first-aid stations, and below the stations, there will be first-aid stretcher teams. Each district will also have surgeons and obstetricians as first-aid workers. The headquarters is now establishing five rescue teams to undertake specially assigned tasks. All municipal hospitals are basic hospitals for rescue. At the same time, we hope that citizens will pay attention to the methods of stopping bleeding for injuries. They should trust the instructions given by the authorities and should not arbitrarily apply unsterilized products, which could lead to accidental death or injury.
