### The "Heroic Paratrooper Unit" of Japan's Daring Feat: Landing on Enemy Airfields in Okinawa, Achieving Significant Results in a Moonlight Raid

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 25th: The "Heroic Paratrooper Unit," a special attack force commanded by Army Captain Michiro Okuyama, landed at the northern and central airfields on Okinawa Island on the night of May 24th. They immediately destroyed enemy aircraft and military supply warehouses on the ground, as well as airfield facilities, throwing the enemy into confusion and currently reaping significant war results. A special flight attack unit supporting the above attack is currently launching fierce attacks on enemy warships around Okinawa Island.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The special attack force "Heroic Paratrooper Unit," led by Army Captain Michiro Okuyama, suddenly landed on the enemy's northern and central airfields on Okinawa Island on the moonlit night of the 24th. Since the enemy landed on the island, ground combat has lasted for five weeks. During this time, the Japanese garrison has met the enemy's attacks and maintained the northern defense line of Shuri. Since the 24th, the enemy has added new elite forces, fiercely covering their advance, but the Japanese defenders have not yielded an inch and bravely counterattacked, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Understanding the timing and location, after successfully infiltrating the northern and central airfields, they used the bombs they carried to destroy enemy aircraft, military supply warehouses, and airfield facilities at the airfields. The enemy airfield garrison was thrown into great confusion, and they are currently continuing to expand their gains. Prior to the Heroic Paratrooper Unit's surprise attack, the Japanese air fleet launched a large-scale attack on the northern and central airfields, as well as the Ie Island airfield. The Heroic Unit took advantage of this opportunity to daringly land. Therefore, although both locations attempted to flee to aircraft carriers, most were buried on the ground or in the sea. Due to the special attack operations from both land and sea, the enemy camp suffered a tremendous blow. The Japanese garrison in the northern area of Naha's Shuri district, seeing the heroic fighting of the Heroic Paratrooper Unit and the special attack units, had their morale boosted even higher.

### Large Pillars of Fire Erupt Repeatedly on the Waters off Kadena and Kerama: Japanese Special Attack Flying Units Launch Fierce Attacks

Southwestern Islands Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese special attack units and air force units attacked enemy warships and airfields around Okinawa on the 24th. Two large explosions and several large fires occurred at the northern airfield on Okinawa Island. The detailed battle results of the attacks on warships have not yet been determined. On the waters off Kadena and in the Kerama Islands, nineteen large pillars of fire were identified. Japanese military units continued to attack from the 24th to the morning of the 25th. In addition, from the night of the 23rd to around 3:00 AM on the 24th, two vessels of unknown type were identified on fire in the sea northwest of Naha.

Japanese Garrison: Outnumbered and Facing a Strong Enemy

Southern Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 21st and 22nd, the enemy forces on Okinawa Island, who resumed their regular offensive, deployed a number of tanks and approximately three thousand soldiers on the front line to forcibly approach the main Japanese defense positions. The officers and soldiers of the Japanese garrison, outnumbered and facing a strong enemy, shattered the enemy's attacks in various places and prevented their intrusion. Currently, the confrontation line between the Japanese and American forces is along the lines of Yuntamumori, Mount Yuza, Ishimine, Ona, Hirara-cho near Shuri, Mount Go-nana, the south side of Gushichan, and Shuri. The enemy's offensive focus is placed on the flat coastal area directly facing Yuntamumori and the areas of Nishihara, Oma, and Iri west of Okinawa, launching concentrated attacks. On the morning of the 23rd, approximately 500 enemy soldiers, deploying over ten tanks, invaded Yonabaru on the southern coast of Yuntamumori and are currently engaged in combat with Japanese forces there.

Central News Agency report - According to a New York broadcast, New York Times reporter Roth, who is serving with the military in the Ryukyu Islands, reported to the newspaper, stating that the U.S. First Division is now twenty yards from the Shuri Castle fortress. The castle walls are five feet thick, and even the U.S. military's sixteen-inch shells cannot penetrate them. Japanese forces on the western end of Okinawa still hold Sugar Loaf Hill.

Okinawa Air Operations: Combat Trends

Frontline Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The trends in air operations in the Okinawa area are gradually shifting from cooperating with ground combat to attacking the rear sea areas. Air operations are entering a new phase, which is worthy of attention. The enemy aircraft attacks on Okinawa Island, compared to the beginning of this month, when the daily total reached approximately 700 aircraft, have gradually decreased in scale. In recent days, there have been almost no full-scale attacks. However, their attack force seems to have been focused on the Amami Islands. Observing the fact that 170 aircraft attacked during the day on the 22nd and that a formation of 50 fighter-bombers attacked in the afternoon of the same day, one can discern the enemy air force's target. Although this is due to weather conditions, on the one hand, because they feel there are insufficient aircraft, they are attacking the Japanese supply route before cooperating with ground combat to improve the situation. Other than this, there is no better strategy. As of the 15th, the estimated number of enemy aircraft is 132 small aircraft and 28 large aircraft at the northern airfield, including some transport aircraft and B29 aircraft, nine medium-sized aircraft, over ten small aircraft at the central airfield, and seventy to eighty small aircraft, mainly P51 aircraft, at the Ie Island airfield, totaling approximately 300 aircraft. Therefore, the future movements of the enemy's mobile units and the new intentions of the enemy air force must be strictly guarded against.

Japanese Newspaper Analyzes: Enemy Intentions

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun correspondent Miyamoto recently analyzed and observed the future movements of the enemy forces at the Okinawa front line base, stating that this good opportunity should not be missed. The main points are as follows: The decisive battle for Okinawa has lasted for two months, twice as long as the one month on Iwo Jima. The enemy has spent twice the effort, and the future of the battle is still unpredictable. In order to break this battle situation, the enemy will definitely launch an active offensive. The turning point of the battle depends on new supply power. After two months, the enemy has finally obtained new reinforcements. The enemy's mobile unit strength is now approaching Kyushu, a mere 20 minutes flight away, possessing a strong force of four formal aircraft carriers, two converted aircraft carrier cruisers, six battleships, twenty cruisers, and twenty-two destroyers, intending to break the balance of power in the Okinawa decisive battle in one fell swoop, seize absolute air supremacy, and consolidate their foothold in Okinawa. Analyzing the enemy's intentions, there are the following two points: In order to disperse the attacking power of the Japanese forces gathered around Okinawa, they will launch landing operations in other locations; To strengthen Okinawa as the top priority, attempting to directly strike the Japanese special attack units and their rear is the goal. Currently, the enemy force in the waters off Okinawa, excluding transport ships, is approximately 120 vessels, including 11 aircraft carriers and 13 battleships. Judging from the recent enemy situation around Okinawa, it is predicted that the enemy will adopt the above two methods, pouring all their strength forward. The so-called new landing attempt by the enemy will be at a small island close to Okinawa, but the enemy currently has over 130,000 troops tied down on Okinawa Island, so a new landing operation is extremely difficult. Also, this time the enemy's mobile unit attack will be carried out simultaneously in the north and south of the archipelago. The target of their attack is probably the Japanese air bases and intercepting fighter planes. In addition, the enemy has gathered five to six battleships, eight to ten cruisers, and forty destroyer fleets near Okinawa Island. Therefore, if the enemy intends to make a new landing attempt, it would be best to concentrate this powerful fleet on Okinawa Island.

### Second Lieutenant Kimura Awarded Commendation: Japanese Army Announces

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 24th that on the night of March 27th of this year, when B29 enemy aircraft invaded northern Kyushu, Army Second Lieutenant Morimitsu Kimura intercepted them and successively shot down six enemy aircraft in a short period of time. This time, he was specially awarded a commendation and presented to the Emperor.

### Peleliu and Terakan: Japanese Forces Fighting Bravely; Fierce Battles in the Balete Pass in Luzon

Frontline Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese soldiers and officers in the Palau Islands and Peleliu Island areas are still fighting bravely, especially in the northern part of Peleliu Island, where operations began in early April. Since April 14th, they have sunk or destroyed three submarines and fifteen small vessels, killing or wounding over 920 enemy soldiers.

Southwest Pacific Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the 21st, enemy forces on Terakan Island have repeatedly subjected the entire line to naval gun fire and aerial bombing, especially northeast of the airfield and northeast of the water purification pond, where the two armies have engaged in mortal combat, which has been the fiercest. Japanese garrison forces have prevented the enemy from advancing. On the 21st and 22nd, under the cover of artillery fire, Japanese forces daringly launched surprise attacks on the airfield and enemy positions, killing or wounding over 150 personnel, destroying seven barracks and five trucks, throwing the enemy forces into confusion.

No Island Frontline Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese garrison forces on the Philippine Islands are still continuing to fight fiercely with superior enemy forces. Currently, the enemy's strength on Luzon Island has reached ten to eleven divisions, with its main force of approximately six divisions moving towards the northern part of Luzon. Since the Japanese military units in that area withdrew from Baguio, they have been taking advantage of the steep terrain and the harsh weather of heavy rain, launching active attacks everywhere. At the same time, they have been continuously implementing surprise attacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Recently, the enemy has attacked the Balete Pass with a portion of its forces, and Japanese military units have also launched fierce counterattacks. Also, the enemy's air power on Luzon Island, centered in the Clark area, together with the Lingayen area, has approximately 1,050 aircraft.

### Pray for Determined Progress to Certain Victory

— Japanese Navy Fleet Reporting Department Chief, Colonel Matsushima

During this most intense decisive battle period, today we welcome the 40th anniversary of the Navy Day. Reflecting on the traces of the Japanese Navy's development over the past forty years and the outstanding achievements left behind by the senior officers and soldiers, and further contemplating the fierce battles of the Japanese Navy in the Greater East Asia War, I truly feel immeasurable emotion.

Currently, the decisive battle in Greater East Asia is centered on Okinawa, where the two armies are engaged in heated battle. Its direction and the fate of the war thereafter are of great importance and are being watched intently by the world. Our army, navy, air force, and surface forces are fiercely attacking the enemy mobile units and vessels gathered around the island, and the brave fighting of the soldiers is greatly reducing the enemy's landing forces. The enemy is already on its last breath, relying solely on the naval bombardment and air support to defend their acquired positions and attempting to advance further. However, looking at the movements of the enemy forces in the Mariana and Philippine areas and the enemy air force's attempts to invade the Japanese mainland, we must fully guard against future operational developments.

Moreover, after the end of the European war, the enemy, Britain and the United States, have gradually gathered their forces in the Pacific area. The domestic and international situation has faced Japan with unprecedented difficulties in its history. Indeed, our Imperial government has resolved to stand firmly in the Greater East Asia War and thoroughly advance for the sake of the Greater East Asia Self-Defense Holy War. This point has already been declared in advance by Prime Minister Suzuki and the military authorities. The enemy is gathering all its land, sea, and air power to encircle Japan and, with its abundant resources, attempting to destroy Japan in one fell swoop. However, embracing the spirit of the Divine Land, the entire nation is united, upholding the special attack spirit, and pouring all our energy to bravely decide the outcome against the arrogant enemy. Our future still holds many difficulties, but the hundred million people, with the Japanese flag at the center, will raise this sacred banner and fight together and advance together. Over the past forty years, the Imperial Navy has established a glorious tradition and an indomitable fighting spirit. At this time when Japan faces a crossroads of survival, we will definitely display its brilliance, wield the demon-slaying sword, and swing it over the enemy's head. This is the spirit of our navy. Under the belief that life and death are one, embracing the fervent will to destroy the enemy, we will single-mindedly advance to complete our duty and the lasting mission that must be accomplished.

Today, on this glorious Navy Day, we remember the teachings of the great General Togo: "Defend against those who come from the sea at sea." Recalling the past spirit of the Imperial Navy, we deeply believe that the future will be even more glorious, morale will be even more boosted, and we wholeheartedly pray for determined progress to certain victory.

### Togo's Tactics and Modern Naval Warfare

— Chen Binhe

——Speech given at the Shanghai Radio Station on May 25th

The 40th Japanese Navy Day is approaching. At this current stage of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, we cannot help but recall the scene of the Battle of Tsushima forty years ago, which raised the eyebrows of our East Asian nations.

Forty years ago, on May 27th, the Japanese and Russian fleets encountered each other east of the Tsushima Strait and engaged in fierce battle. As a result, the Japanese Combined Fleet decisively defeated the Russian Baltic Fleet, achieving a great victory and finally laying the foundation for the ultimate victory of the Russo-Japanese War. This battle, historically known as the "Battle of Tsushima," is a classic example of a decisive naval battle. Its characteristic is that Admiral Togo's operational plan was very meticulous, exactly the opposite of the tactics of British general Nelson at the "Battle of Trafalgar." At that time, in order to thoroughly annihilate the Baltic Fleet, the Japanese Combined Fleet under Admiral Togo planned to complete the entire operational plan between four periods of the day, dividing the 600 nautical miles of naval combat from the vicinity of Jeju Island to Vladivostok into the first and second phases of the plan. However, due to bad weather, they were not able to carry out these plans. Therefore, the true battle began from the third phase, progressing sequentially to the fourth and fifth phases, while the sixth and seventh phases were no longer necessary because the battle ended earlier than expected. During the battle between the Japanese and Russian fleets, Admiral Togo adopted the so-called "enemy front turn" tactic, striking the Russian fleet head-on. Within thirty-five minutes of the start of the gun battle, the outcome of the battle between the two armies had already been decided.

Naval warfare is different from land warfare. In operations, there is no influence of terrain such as mountains, rivers, or forests, and the vast sea is the stage. Except for limitations imposed by weather, actions are relatively free. However, it is quite difficult to search for the enemy's whereabouts in the vast sea, especially at that time when aircraft had not yet been developed. The quality of the fleet commander, the quality of the performance of the ships, and the strictness of personnel training, as well as the precision of gunnery, etc., all had a decisive effect on the victory or defeat of the naval battle. For example, in the Battle of Tsushima, the tactics used by the commander of the Baltic Fleet, Rozhestvensky, imitated Nelson's actions in the "Battle of Trafalgar," while Admiral Togo's tactics, although similar to those of the French fleet that suffered a disastrous defeat at that time, fully demonstrated the subtle effect of suppressing the enemy's vanguard. Therefore, the losses suffered by the Japanese Combined Fleet were also far smaller than those of the British Navy at that time. The reason for this is, as Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama said: "The progress of naval vessel weaponry is certainly one reason, but the morale and gunnery skills of the Japanese Navy were far superior to those of the enemy army. This was the greatest reason for the victory. Moreover, from a strategic point of view, Admiral Togo's plan was more meticulous and superior to Nelson's."

The naval decisive battle between the Japanese and Russian fleets became the main reason for ending the overall situation of the Russo-Japanese War because at that time, all countries adopted a standing army elite soldier doctrine, with very few reserve forces. In addition, the construction of battleships and cruisers took a lot of time. Once annihilated in a naval battle, it was difficult to immediately reorganize. This is the reason why the victory or defeat of a naval decisive battle could dominate the overall situation.

But today, modern naval warfare has changed in nature, because of the progress of aircraft, naval tactics have taken on a new look, which is very different from the past. Aircraft are not only the eyes and ears of the fleet, but also the vanguard of naval warfare. For example, the Pearl Harbor naval battle is a prime example. Other examples include the naval battle in the Malayan waters, the aerial battle over the Taiwan Strait, the aerial naval battle east of the Philippines, etc., as well as the great battle achievements of the Japanese Kamikaze special attack squadron at Leyte and Okinawa Island, all of which can prove the importance of air force in naval warfare. Since the Pearl Harbor naval battle, the enemy America has devoted itself to the production of aircraft carriers and aircraft, and the reason for this is also here. However, although the enemy America has many aircraft carriers and fighter planes, due to the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, in order to get close to Japan, it has had to adopt the so-called "island hopping operation," relying on its material quantity, not hesitating to make sacrifices, and risking an offensive. Looking back since the common launch of the so-called Pacific counteroffensive, under the cooperative counterattack of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, the ships, aircraft, personnel, and materials lost have been countless. Taking only the Okinawa Island area as an example, from March 23rd to the morning of May 10th, in just one and a half months, according to the announcement of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, the number of ships sunk or destroyed by the Japanese military reached as many as 515.

According to the observation of military experts, the closer one gets to Japan's inner defense zone, the greater the difficulties encountered and the greater the losses suffered. This is something that the enemy America knew long ago, and it has already been proven by actual combat. Looking at the fact that the enemy America's invasion of the Ryukyu Islands has lasted for sixty days, and it has not yet escaped the hardship of battle and is still far from its original goal, the reasons are nothing more than difficulty in supply, difficulty in reinforcement, and the strength of the Japanese military's counterattack, especially the activity of the Japanese air force, which has caused it to suffer painfully. Because the Japanese mainland is a large air fortress, in this air force sphere of influence, the enemy's operations are certainly very difficult.

The current Greater East Asia War is a battle that will determine the survival of Japan and the East Asian nations. With the glorious history of the Japanese Navy in the past and the intense morale of the Japanese military, and with the final decisive battle taking place in Japan's inland sea, it is expected that the enemy America will suffer a fatal blow.

Although the tactics and preparations for naval warfare are different now than in the past, the brave spirit of the Japanese Navy is the same now as in the past. On the occasion of the 40th Japanese Navy Day, we review the glorious history of past victories, and at the same time, we must strengthen our belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### One U.S. Flagship Undergoing Repairs Due to Damage

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from Washington states that the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 24th: The replacement for the former flagship of the U.S. East Asia Fleet, the Houston, which was sunk by Japanese naval forces in the prelude to the Greater East Asia War, suffered severe damage after being struck by two torpedoes off the coast of Borneo and sailed directly to the Brooklyn Naval Yard in New York City for repairs.

### Revision of the Trusteeship System Articles

Passed at the San Francisco Conference

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - San Francisco News: The Trusteeship Committee of the San Francisco Conference passed four standard documents in the chapter on the international charter on trusteeship on the night of the 23rd, with slight revisions. The trusteeship system applies to the territories currently under trusteeship, the territories seized from enemy countries, and other territories voluntarily subjected to trusteeship. All trusteeship issues must be resolved with the consent of the directly related countries. Any country in the United Nations that holds territory under trusteeship must agree to the trusteeship agreement. If there is no agreement on the trusteeship agreement, this chapter shall not change or interpret the rights of the people or countries of any territory or the conditions of the trusteeship. The trusteeship agreement may designate strategic bases, sometimes including applying them to part or all of the territory covered by the agreement. Agreements on strategic bases shall not prejudice any decisions made by the World Security Organization established to fulfill its responsibility for maintaining peace. Among the above regulations, it is noteworthy that the Soviet Union's proposed amendment that "strategic bases shall be designated by the Security Council" was ultimately withdrawn. The biggest obstacle in the trusteeship regulations, the question of whether the "purpose of trusteeship" clearly uses the words "independence," has not yet been resolved.

### Over a Hundred Carrier-Based Aircraft Scattered to Attack Kyushu; Japanese Reports Claim Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Enemy carrier-based aircraft, mainly the giant F6F, including some PBF3 Swallow reconnaissance bombers, totaling 180 aircraft, launched a scattered attack on Japanese air bases in Kyushu around 3 PM on the 24th from Shibushi Bay and the waters west of the Satsuma Peninsula, in formations of ten or twenty aircraft each.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Yesterday morning, when B26 aircraft attacked Tokyo, they were fiercely intercepted by Japanese air defense forces. In Tokyo alone, ten enemy aircraft were shot down. The Yomiuri-Hochi Shimbun of the 25th reported on the circumstances of the downings as follows: Frequently, enemy B29 aircraft are reduced to a ball of fire before the eyes of the citizens and then fall, disappearing without a trace. One of the downed aircraft, after being intercepted by Japanese air defense forces, disintegrated in the air and fell in a certain place within the city. As it spiraled down, it caught fire and burned. The bodies of two pilots, wearing flight boots, presented a crude and grotesque sight. Inside the downed plane, a large globe was painted, with a B29 taking off from the center, and an outer circle depicting a small island actively flying towards hell.

### Churchill Starts Organizing a Provisional British Cabinet; The Labor Party Prepares for General Election Competition

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Reuters Dispatch) - It is generally hoped that Prime Minister Churchill will announce the establishment of a provisional cabinet after the holiday, and Churchill is busy organizing a governmental structure to temporarily handle British affairs. Currently, there are over one hundred important vacant positions in the provisional cabinet, awaiting Churchill's selection and filling. Since Churchill is the leader of the majority party in the British House of Commons and is entrusted by royal mandate, he will use the Conservative Party exclusively to organize the cabinet. However, in fact, the important vacant positions will be filled by ministers who are nominally non-partisan. As for the key figures who are under Churchill's consideration to enter the provisional cabinet stage, they are none other than the following: Foreign Secretary Eden (probably will still be Churchill's right-hand man), Minister of Production Lyttelton, Lord Privy Seal Beaverbrook, Secretary of State for India Amery, Minister of Information Bracken, Minister of Education Butler, Minister of Agriculture Hudson, Minister of Health Willink, Minister of Food Llewellin, Minister of Works Sandys (Churchill's son-in-law), Minister of State Lawther, and Minister of Town and Country Planning Morrison. These are all major figures in the Conservative Party. In addition, there are a small number of non-partisan coalition cabinet ministers, such as Chancellor of the Exchequer Anderson. In the Liberal Party, qualified candidates include Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Brown (leader of the National Liberal Party) and Lieutenant General George (Catholic Liberal). The changes to the cabinet have resulted in the resignation of wartime cabinet members such as Minister of Labour Bevin, Deputy Prime Minister Attlee, and Secretary of State Morrison. Prime Minister Churchill must form the provisional cabinet within two days, while Attlee is preparing his planned government, as the Labour Party has high hopes of winning the upcoming general election.

Chongqing is currently constructing long-distance railways and highways according to a five-year plan. Chongqing greatly welcomes cooperation with foreign countries on these projects. The powerful Japanese navy is the protector of Greater East Asia!

After receiving the notification, all business households must comply and go to the nearest land tax collection office to clear the full amount without delay to avoid punishment.

Financial Bureau Holds Land Tax Conference

In order to increase the revenue for municipal finance, the Shanghai Special Municipality Finance Bureau has decided to actively organize the land tax in various counties and districts under its jurisdiction. It has scheduled a meeting for the 28th of this month to gather county magistrates, district commissioners, and important financial personnel to discuss strategies for organizing land tax.

### Intensified Preliminary Investigation Work for Spring Business Tax

The city's Finance Bureau is collecting this year's spring business tax. Due to the efforts of tax officials in the suburbs and the eighth district, the procedures for merchants in the suburbs to declare and pay taxes are also very quick. The preliminary investigation work has generally been completed. The preliminary investigation work in the old one to eight districts began in separate districts as early as the 11th of this month. It is reported that the bureau, feeling that the first and eighth districts are centers of industry and commerce and that the preliminary investigation is quite difficult due to insufficient manpower, has ordered the transfer of 40 people from the suburbs who are engaged in tax work to assist in the investigation in the first and eighth districts. Fearing that Director Luo, who also serves as the bureau chief, would advance tax administration to enrich the municipal treasury, he convened a meeting of the heads of various districts under the Business Tax Section at 5:30 PM on the 24th to instruct them, and also offered condolences and encouragement.

In addition to the Minister of Judicial Administration serving as the chairman and the presidents of the Shanghai High Court and the High Procuratorate serving as ex officio members, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, Chen Ribing, and Yuan Rongchang, the director of the Municipal Health Bureau, were also elected as standing committee members. Three groups were established within the committee: General Affairs, Finance, and Health, which will actively carry out their work. It is hoped that all donations that have been enthusiastically pledged by people from all walks of life will be sent to the Siming, Dalu, or Jin Cheng Banks, or the Shen Xin newspaper offices, before the end of this month to obtain receipts. Once the funds are collected, the sanitation improvement plan for prisons and detention centers can be implemented as soon as possible.

### Director of Police Bureau's Fire Department Gives an Overview of Firefighting Work; Reports at the Regular Press Conference

The 18th regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Department was held at 10 AM yesterday (25th) in the City Hall's conference room, where the Director of the Fire Department of the Police Bureau gave a report on the city's firefighting facilities.

General Work

Firefighting plans are divided into wartime and peacetime aspects. In peacetime, the firefighting work generally involves each branch investigating the water supply and terrain within its jurisdiction. Each branch must investigate hazardous materials or easily explosive objects stored in each household or warehouse within its jurisdiction. Once a fire occurs, each branch dispatches fire trucks within 30 seconds of the alarm ringing and arrives at the fire scene within five minutes. If a fire occurs on a ship in the Huangpu River, this department immediately assists the waterborne fire brigade in rescue efforts. In the event that the water pressure at the scene is insufficient, the water and electricity company can be called to increase the water supply. The power company also sends personnel to each branch on duty every day.

Air Defense Firefighting

Regarding air defense firefighting, the Fire Department has specially reorganized all personnel into air defense firefighting units in order to meet the needs. However, fire branches in each district respond immediately to fire alarms during peacetime. During air raids, they must listen to the orders of the director before dispatching trucks, as the current manpower and equipment are still insufficient to deal with fires during air raids. In order to make full use of resources, a focus-based approach must be adopted, responding opportunistically in order to cope with emergency situations with limited capacity. At the same time, in order to prevent water sources from being obstructed, planning for the construction of water storage pools and investigation of the use of river water is underway. Currently, there are a total of ten completed reservoirs, and a total of 74 will be built in the city in the future. In addition, if transportation is cut off, bicycles will be used as a contingency. Measures to prevent damage from coal gas are currently being trained on employees, guiding them with appropriate methods to be prepared.

Crackdown on Extortion

Illegal activities by firefighters will be severely cracked down on. In the past, a small number of unscrupulous personnel have been discovered, arrested, and severely punished, and judgments will be made soon. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will thoroughly understand: All firefighting costs in the event of a fire are covered by the government, and citizens do not need to pay. There will be no fines regardless of the nature of the fire alarm. Officials who go to the fire scene for investigation all have identification cards, and citizens can ask to see them at any time. If imposters are discovered or if there are extortionate acts, please report them immediately. The Fire Department never sends people to solicit the sale of firefighting equipment. If such people are discovered, they are imposters. Citizens must not offer bribes in the event of a fire.

### Standard Forms Should Be Completed When Applying to Adjust Sales Prices

The Municipal Economic Affairs Bureau states that the cost forms submitted by various trade associations or manufacturers when applying for price adjustments are inconsistent in style and the calculations are not comprehensive. Not only is the review time-consuming, but it is also difficult to accurately revise the sales prices. In order to facilitate review and standardize the formats, the bureau has submitted to the municipal government for approval and printed three types of standard cost calculation forms, which are applicable to manufacturing, import, and supply categories, respectively. Yesterday, the bureau ordered all manufacturers that from now on, all applications to adjust sales prices must uniformly obtain the forms from the Fifth Section of the bureau, fill them out according to the format, and submit them along with the relevant supporting documents for review.

### Air Defense Headquarters Coordinates with Charity Organizations to Participate in Relief Work; Reducing Air Raid Damage and Maintaining Safety

In order to reduce air raid damage, the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters will hold "Air Defense Facility Enhancement Week" starting June 1st. It is learned that the Social Affairs Section of the headquarters, in order to maintain the safety of citizens during air raids, has specially convened the responsible persons of various public welfare and charitable organizations in the city, together with the Social Welfare Bureau, for a discussion at the bureau's auditorium the day before yesterday. More than 80 people, including Li Tianzhen and others, representing more than 60 organizations, including the World Red Swastika Society, attended the meeting. Zhou, the director of the Social Affairs Section of the Air Defense Headquarters, and Deputy Director Noguchi personally presided over the meeting, explaining the importance of air defense facilities and hoping that various charitable organizations would provide wartime services with the spirit of peacetime service. The representatives of various charitable organizations, feeling the kindness of the officials in charge in protecting citizens, were willing to contribute their full strength to air defense work and separately announced the implementation plans for temporary emergency care and accommodation. Subsequently, Director Zhou and Deputy Director Noguchi answered various difficult points raised by the representatives, and it was decided that the General Affairs and Social Affairs Sections of the Air Defense Headquarters and the Social Welfare Bureau would do their best to assist. The result was very satisfactory. It is now learned that all charitable organizations are rapidly preparing all aspects of their work. It is expected that the city's air defense work will be perfected by the participation of all public welfare and charitable organizations in the city.

### Shipping Industry Plans to Restore Qingdao Route

According to sources in the city's shipping industry yesterday, the industry is planning to use sailing ships to sail to Qingdao in order to facilitate the flow of goods between North and Central China. This route has been suspended for more than a year, which not only affects transportation between North and Central China, but also has a close relationship with the development of industry and commerce. It is learned that the relevant authorities strongly support the restoration of this route and will provide full assistance.

### Comprehensive Allocation Certificates for Periods 61 to 90 to Be Issued on Schedule

The Municipal Goods Allocation Office has stipulated that the comprehensive allocation certificates for periods 61 to 90 will be issued from June 1st to June 30th. According to the certificate issuance procedures, three days before the issuance, the announcement of the scheduled issuance date should be read in front of the certificate issuing office. The landlord or their representative should represent their family or employees, and bring all household registration documents to the issuing office for verification and collection of the certificates. If the deadline is missed, an application for reissuance must be made at the issuing office during the supplementary certificate issuance period from July 1st to July 15th, but a late payment fine of 20 national currency units must be paid for each certificate. If the deadline is missed again, it will be considered a waiver and no reissuance will be made.

(Another report) The procedures for issuing comprehensive allocation certificates to residents of shantytowns in various districts of this city have been handled by the Pao-Chia Section of the Municipal Police Bureau. Later, the Goods Allocation Office had a proposal to handle the process itself. Because the allocation certificates for periods 31 to 60 had already been issued, it was too late to rush the process. Therefore, the process was changed to be handled by the Goods Allocation Office itself starting from period 61. The comprehensive allocation certificates for periods 61 to 90 will be issued soon. The Goods Allocation Office drafted regulations for investigating household registration and registering for certificate issuance for shantytowns in various districts, and sent them to the Pao-Chia Section for assistance. The section has now issued a notice to its subordinate general security liaisons and district offices to assist in the process.

### Measures for Temporary Requisition of Vehicles to Assist in the Evacuation of the City's Population

In order to meet actual needs, the Municipal Construction Bureau has specially drafted temporary measures for the temporary requisition of vehicles, which have been submitted to the municipal government for promulgation and implementation. An excerpt of the measures is as follows: The bureau is ordered to assist in the evacuation of the population and requisition vehicles, so these measures are specially formulated. The type of vehicles to be requisitioned shall be limited to trucks suitable for long-distance transport. The number of trucks to be requisitioned is tentatively set at 20 per day, which shall be selected by the person in charge of the city's Truck Transport Industry Association and sent to the Land Transportation Committee of the City's Population Evacuation Committee for application and be subject to the management of the committee. The drivers, fuel, and repairs of the trucks shall be handled by the Land Transportation Committee of the City's Population Evacuation Committee itself. The depreciation and wear and tear of the requisitioned vehicles shall be compensated by the Land Transportation Committee of the Population Evacuation Committee. The start and end dates of the requisition of vehicles shall be determined by the Land Transportation Committee of the City's Population Evacuation Committee. These measures may be amended at any time if they are incomplete. These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the municipal government.

### Increased Grain Production in Jiangsu Province

— Tang Yi

Governor Ren Discusses Agricultural Loans

"Jiangsu's land is fertile and has always been a rice-producing area. In recent years, it has made significant contributions to both wartime efforts and civilian food supplies. Therefore, the tasks borne by Jiangsu's farmers are extraordinarily important and particularly heavy. How to help the increasingly desolate rural areas catch their breath is not only the duty of Jiangsu's officials and people, but also a matter of great concern to neighboring provinces and cities due to the close relationship between them and the supply of food." When the reporter interviewed Governor Ren Yuandao on the 21st, Governor Ren expressed the above opinions, emphasizing the recent sharp rise in rice prices and its impact on people's livelihoods.

"Because of the poor harvests in some fields last year, and other various reasons, farmers are clearly lacking funds for re-production. If we hope for a sufficient food supply in the future, and to prevent rice prices from rising again, we must solve the current difficulties for farmers, allowing this year's rice crops to be cultivated smoothly and achieving a real increase in production.

"Some people in Shanghai, in light of this situation, have spontaneously launched a Jiangsu agricultural loan campaign, and I, on behalf of the farmers of Jiangsu, express my deep gratitude. The total amount of funds raised for this agricultural loan is 500,000 yuan, which is considerable in terms of numbers. However, given the vast area of Jiangsu and the many needs of the farmers, it cannot be said to be sufficient. Nevertheless, even if it is just a drop in the bucket, they will still receive the benefit of that drop, which is very beneficial for nurturing and restoring vitality to the rural areas. It is not only a current need, but also has a significant impact on the long-term plans of the country.

"Without even discussing the role of agricultural loans themselves, just the transfer of surplus funds from Shanghai to the rural areas is quite relevant to the stability of prices in Shanghai, and this is the first point. Secondly, that Shanghai leaders and people with assets can sacrifice their personal interests for the greater good, and not neglect long-term plans for temporary gains, this vision and spirit are worthy of admiration, and this shift in fashion can be said to be the dawn of national revival."

Provincial Government's Production Increase Efforts

The Jiangsu Provincial Government not only hopes that agricultural loans can be implemented in the shortest possible time, but has also actually begun to increase food production from all sides. According to the reporter's observations, the main points are as follows:

Since the Sujia Railway was destroyed, the provincial government has leased all the abandoned roadbeds from the railway company and distributed them to farmers along the line for cultivation. A total of 4,800 mu of farmland has been added. The provincial government provides seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural implements, while the farmers provide labor, and the harvest is distributed in a 4:6 ratio. The purpose of the provincial government is to increase production, not to make a profit, so it does not consider profits and losses. It is said that the farmers in the allocated areas are very enthusiastic, and the autumn harvest this year will surely be substantial.

The Provincial Construction Department has established an Agricultural Production Promotion Committee and an Agricultural, Forestry, and Fishery Production Supervision Office. The main tasks are three: training technical personnel, introducing improved seeds, and rewarding land reclamation. An experimental rice field is set up in Wuxian County, and a branch field is set up in Songjiang; a fishery experimental field is being established in Kunshan. In addition, efforts are being made to promote winter stem borer removal, protect farmland, improve sericulture, and encourage rural sideline occupations.

The Provincial Construction Department has, together with the New Life Movement, the Youth League, and the Baojia neighborhood organizations, investigated vacant land in the provincial capital and various counties to prepare for the establishment of demonstration farms. For example, if a private individual owns two gardens, it is stipulated that one of them should be used for increasing grain production; the areas around school playgrounds should also be used for planting. Regardless of the size of the area, the aim is to accumulate small amounts to make a large amount, and to integrate scattered pieces into a whole.

After Ren Yuandao took office as Governor of Jiangsu Province on November 10 last year, he first proclaimed "construction and production" as the focus of his administration. Under the leadership of Governor Ren, Construction Department Director Sun Yucai visited widely and made many innovations. The slogan put forward by Director Sun: "Construction projects and economic measures must be based on the needs of wartime; strengthen production increases and develop resources, in order to achieve prosperity for the people's livelihood." This is truly a good motto for a construction director!

### Introducing the Exhibition of Modern Japanese Culture

— Zu

The Exhibition of Modern Japanese Culture is sponsored by the International Cultural Promotion Association and supported by this newspaper. It opened yesterday at the "Shanghai Art Gallery" on the upper floor of Dacolou at 212 Nanjing Road.

"Culture is neither something for enjoyment, nor does it only refer to the arts such as literature and music. The spirit of a nation's people striving for practical action is the highest expression of culture."

According to this broad concept, the photos displayed in the exhibition can be said to be various scenarios of Japan protecting and cultivating Eastern culture.

The nature and scope of the exhibition photos are very broad and can be divided into six parts:

The elite of the navy, army, and air force.

Military industry: including aircraft, iron and steel industry, power plants, automobile factories, shipbuilding industry, tank industry, worker life, etc.

Education: including national schools, science education, film education, and secondary schools. The educational conditions of girls' schools, higher vocational schools, and higher merchant marine schools.

Sports: including swimming, gliders, judo, kendo, archery, ball games, equestrianism, cycling groups, military training, student aviation, etc.

Social facilities: including battle reports of electric news, subways, etc.

Fine arts and crafts

There are a total of sixty-eight pieces. The exhibition will run from the 25th to the 30th. The hours are from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily. Admission is free and all are welcome.

Brief Commentary: Emergency Measures

Recently, prices have been soaring, especially the skyrocketing price of rice, which is staggering. The frenzy of price increases is unprecedented. Just imagine that the lives of ordinary people were already struggling to breathe, and now they are suffering the oil on the fire, which is tantamount to declaring the death penalty for the common people. How can this not make people resentful!

In wartime, rising prices are originally an unavoidable phenomenon from an economic point of view. However, although the increase is inevitable, it should also be within a reasonable degree. An increase that exceeds a reasonable degree must not be due to economic reasons. In other words, the crazy and violent increase is entirely due to speculation and manipulation. Therefore, according to the principle of catching the thief, you must first catch the king, and to cut grass, you must first remove the roots, thorough and severe means must be used to eliminate the root causes of speculation and manipulation in order to be effective. Only strong political means are the real strength to capture the king and eliminate the roots. At a minimum, when using economic means to suppress prices, political means must be coordinated at the same time, and they must be implemented thoroughly and severely.

Complaining is useless. We very painfully hope that the authorities will pay attention to, in order to maintain the faith of the majority of citizens, they should quickly devise emergency measures to deal with the wild and violent rise in prices. We firmly believe that the wise authorities will not ignore this.

### Two Youth Associations Host Student Work-Study Loan

Due to the rising prices and increasing difficulty of life in recent years, there are many students who are unable to afford tuition and have dropped out of school. Although they rely on enthusiastic assistance from all walks of life to rescue those who have dropped out, the serious problem of seeking education can be solved in a timely manner. However, some poor students still find it difficult to maintain their daily lives. Therefore, although they have been rescued from dropping out, their difficulties in life have not been alleviated. Therefore, a student work-study loan is specially organized, with the intention of encouraging students to engage in extracurricular production work to supplement the inadequacy of living expenses, and to cultivate self-help and diligence. Since its promotion, a considerable fund has been raised for use, and well-known people from all walks of life have been invited to form a work-study loan committee to preside over the matter. Formal applications will be accepted from the 28th of this month. Any student of secondary or higher school who wants to engage in extracurricular production work, has a considerable plan, and lacks a portion of funds, can apply for a loan at the Youth Association of Baxianqiao and the Women's Youth Association at 638 Xianhaiwei Road (Office hours: every Monday and Thursday from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM).
