### Utilizing the Natural Defenses of Luzon Island, Japanese Garrison Bravely Annihilates Enemy; One Enemy Vessel Sunk in Lingayen Gulf

Central News Agency, Philippine Frontline Base, 14th: The enemy forces that invaded Lingayen Gulf have been actively unloading tanks and vehicles on the 12th and 13th on the Lingayen front and in the San Fabian area. Although the landed enemy forces attempted to move south towards Kiangan, the battle situation on Luzon Island did not show any signs of becoming lively. The Japanese special attack unit took advantage of the enemy's hesitation and continued to launch attacks. On the 12th, the special attack unit moved into the Lingayen Gulf and bombed a large enemy vessel, either an aircraft carrier or a transport ship, sinking it.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Enemy forces on Luzon Island, with a strength of approximately two infantry divisions and one tank division, landed around San Fabian and Lingayen at the head of Lingayen Gulf and are currently desperately trying to secure a bridgehead. The enemy's landing aims to cut off the highway to Manila and control the Luzon Plain. The strategic importance of their landing point in Lingayen on Luzon Island for advancing into the Luzon Plain is immediately apparent. The northern part of Luzon Island is a rugged mountainous area, making it difficult to deploy large forces. The eastern coast of Luzon Island is a narrow plain, unsuitable for decisive battles. The southern part of Luzon is a plain area where large forces can be deployed, and large-scale mobile operations must focus on the central Luzon Plain. The western coast of Luzon Island experiences heavy rain from May to October, and it is currently the dry season, which the enemy is taking advantage of. This area has numerous rivers, including the Agno River, running through it, so even though it is called a plain, it is not a flat, expansive plain. The Luzon Plain campaign cannot ignore the rivers. The enemy army must use amphibious tanks as its primary force for attacking the Luzon Plain. When the Japanese army quelled Luzon, they defeated the American-Philippine forces composed of Philippine soldiers, which were a mixed force, so they were annihilated in one fell swoop, and the Luzon Plain was completely controlled and Manila entered within just one week. The operational capabilities of the Japanese army today are enough to frighten the enemy. This operation by the American enemy is the first large-scale land battle since the start of the Greater East Asia War, and their supply lines are extremely long. In the Luzon Plain campaign, recognizing the true strength of the Japanese army, based on General Yamashita's strong defensive posture, and paying attention to the mountains surrounding the plain, it will become clear that the American forces' operations will suffer heavy losses.

### Wan-ting, a Key Point in China and Burma, Captured by Japanese Troops; Enemy Transport Vehicles Bombed at Hsenwi

Central News Agency, Burmese Base, 14th: The Yunnan Expeditionary Force of the Chongqing government attempted to capture Wan-ting, a key point on the border between China and Burma. Since the end of last year, they have deployed the 5th Division of the 11th Army in the northeastern area and the entire 53rd Army in the northwestern area, launching attacks from both directions. However, the Japanese garrison forces in that area discovered that the main forces of the Chongqing's 53rd Army, the 130th Division and the 116th Division, attempted to cut off the Japanese army's rear starting from the 4th, crossing the Longchuan River. At that time, the Japanese army received reinforcements of new troops. Under the cover of tank units and field artillery units, they launched a preemptive and fierce counterattack from the Katianya River at dawn on the 6th, repelling the Chongqing army. A unit of the Japanese army even crossed the Longchuan River and is currently pursuing the fleeing Chongqing army in the north. The 11th Army of the Chongqing government, which launched an offensive from the northeast of Wan-ting, was also repelled by the Japanese army.

Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Burmese Front, 12th: Japanese elite fighter planes discovered a group of enemy vehicles west of Hsenwi in northern Burma on the 11th and immediately bombed them, setting three enemy trucks on fire and destroying four. Another team of Japanese planes continued to bomb the enemy airfield in that area, setting two enemy planes parked on the ground on fire. All Japanese planes returned safely to their base.

### British General Killed in Action in Luzon Landing Operation

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th: According to a London dispatch, the British War Office announced a few days ago that General Lumsden was killed in action on the 6th of this month while commanding operations on an American ship in the Pacific.

### Japanese Forces in Southern China Closing in on Shao-guan

Chongqing Guangdong Provincial Government Relocates

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th: The Japanese army's encirclement strategy on the mainland has gradually closed in on Shao-guan, an important city in the 7th War Area of the Chongqing government. According to local sources, Li Han-hun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government of the Chongqing government, recently moved various provincial government agencies from Shao-guan to Longchuan on the upper reaches of the Dong River. Yu Han-mou, Commander-in-Chief of the 7th War Area, remains stationed in Shao-guan.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th: According to a Chongqing dispatch, General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater, declared on the 12th that although the Japanese army in China is being obstructed by the American forces entering Luzon Island, it is still possible that they will advance westward. If the Japanese army has sufficient time, they will even attack Kunming and Chongqing, as the Japanese army still possesses strong offensive capabilities.

### Battle Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia in One Week

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The main battle situations in various parts of Greater East Asia this week are as follows:

Philippine Front

From the 9th to the 13th, the enemy's Second and Third Fleets, following the First Fleet, forcibly landed in Lingayen Gulf, with a force of three to four divisions, including one tank division. However, currently, only the San Fabian area has tanks as the main force. In addition, the enemy is occupying a bridgehead in the narrow area from the coast to the Agno River to prepare their positions, and their large-scale offensive posture does not seem to be complete. In response, the Japanese land forces launched a fierce counterattack, and the two sides engaged in fierce fighting. At the same time, the Japanese special attack units and air force were also mobilized. On the 11th, more than twenty small landing boats in the 20-kilometer coastal area between San Fabian and Lingayen were fiercely attacked by the Japanese special attack units. Furthermore, the enemy landing forces are extremely panicked by the Japanese army's unique "night hand-to-hand combat assault" tactics and have deployed a strict security network outside their positions and added a large number of military dogs to the security, but the Japanese army still bravely broke through their security network and launched an assault, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Also, the enemy's mobile units have been moving near the eastern sea since the 3rd and 4th, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's southern supply routes. On the 9th, 450 carrier-based aircraft and large aircraft flying from mainland China simultaneously attacked Taiwan.

Mariana Islands

According to foreign news reports, the enemy's air force headquarters has moved to Guam. The enemy army attaches great importance to the island because it was a base for Pacific operations before the war, so they will further strengthen the island in the future.

Morotai Island

The Japanese army is still continuing to carry out daring guerrilla warfare, disrupting the enemy's positions. At the same time, the Japanese air force is also coordinating with this, continuing to launch fierce attacks. From November 4th of last year to January 10th of this year, the Japanese air force achieved the following results in that area: burning more than 140 military facilities, affecting 44, destroying 153 aircraft, and damaging 128, for a total of 281 aircraft. In addition, many material warehouses were destroyed. The Japanese army on Tarikie Island is still fighting bravely, firing flares and continuing artillery fire near the airfield and the central highlands. The Japanese garrisons on Morotai and Tarikie Islands continue to fight bravely against the enemy forces in each area, preventing the enemy base from fully functioning. However, the enemy's land aircraft on Leyte and Mindoro Islands are repeatedly intensifying their advance. There are a total of 400 enemy aircraft on Leyte Island and approximately 100 enemy aircraft on San Jose.

Burma Front

(1) The 7th Division of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force of the Chongqing government attacked the rear of Burma from the east and north of the Salween River area. There are three more divisions waiting in reserve. Two divisions of the Chongqing's newly formed 1st Army, numbering 500, are at the Bhamo airfield near Namhkam, but continue to suffer losses. The Japanese army began to counterattack starting on January 6th and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. (2) On the eastern bank of the Irrawaddy River, two divisions of the mixed Chongqing-American forces advanced to approximately 40 kilometers north of Molo, Laban, and Mengshao Liao and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. (3) On the Myitkyina railway line, the Japanese army is intercepting a total of seven divisions of the 4th Army and the 33rd Army of the Chongqing government, 60 kilometers northwest of Shwebo, 600 kilometers west of Monywa, and west of Kane. The Japanese army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with them. (4) Since the end of last year, the enemy forces have been gradually landing in the Akyab area from the Mayu Peninsula using mobile boats and ships. The Japanese air force and land forces launched a fierce attack on them, inflicting heavy damage. In particular, the Japanese army attacked an enemy convoy full of soldiers on the 9th, immediately setting two large enemy cruisers on fire and certainly sinking one of them, and sinking other boats of about 300 tons. In addition, the Japanese army attacked the Akyab area again on the 10th, setting seven places on fire and blowing up one place.

Shonan Front

Fifteen enemy B-29 aircraft attacked on the morning of the 11th.

### Enemy Planes Attack Nagoya, Several Shot Down; Central and Southern Taiwan Also Attacked

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: Sixty B-29 aircraft from enemy bases in the Mariana Islands invaded the central region from near the line from twelve o'clock on the fourteenth for one and a half hours, dropping incendiary bombs and bombs on the Nagoya area, and then fled south. The Japanese air defense forces were very active at the time, shooting down several enemy aircraft, which was witnessed by many. Detailed results are currently under investigation. Due to the fierce attack by the Japanese interception units, the enemy's bombing was not accurate, and the Japanese side suffered very little damage to important facilities.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Japanese Taiwan Army announced at 2:50 p.m. on the 14th: At approximately 10:40 a.m. on the 14th of this month, approximately 50 large aircraft flying from China invaded the central and southern parts of the island, dropped some bombs, and then gradually retreated towards the western sea at approximately 1:00 p.m. Our side suffered minor damage.

A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the current situation in Northern Jiangsu and the principles of Sun's administration, visited him and received the following remarks: Since I was appointed as the Director of Pacification for Northern Jiangsu, I have followed the intentions of the Central Government and strived to integrate military and political affairs into an inseparable force to promote all government affairs. In the past, the Northern Jiangsu area suffered greatly from the devastation of the communist bandits, and the majority of the people lived a miserable life in deep water and scorching fire every day. I personally witnessed the devastation during the troop transfer and felt tears welling up in my eyes. Therefore, I am determined to make the greatest effort to eliminate the communist bandits, revitalize government affairs, and relieve the people from their suffering.

### The Railway Protection Corps Returns to Nanjing After Inspection

Each time they arrived in a location, they convened relevant agencies and held symposiums, lasting two weeks. There were approximately 500 or more officers and members of the Protective Corps. The corps and its entourage have now returned to Nanjing to report on their mission, and it is said that the members' performance was quite good.

### Fluid Warfare Evolves in the Ardennes Sector of the Western Front; German Forces Use Rocket Artillery

Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th: The Havas News Agency reports: The situation in the Ardennes on the Western Front remains fluid. Both sides are unwilling to engage in prolonged trench warfare. Changes in positions are very slow and the sectors are small. On Friday, the German salient had moved south of Vielsalm and east of La Roche. The U.S. First Army's attack in the Salm area has made very little progress. The attacks by British and Canadian forces from the north and east are progressing at the same speed as the German retreat. The U.S. Third Army's offensive from Bastogne and Wiltz in the south has achieved a breakthrough, and the German army has launched a counterattack. The Allied counteroffensive in Alsace has gradually regained the initiative and is preventing the German army's attack south of Bischwiller.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th: According to frontline reports, the German army on the Western Front has begun to use long-range rocket artillery, constantly bombarding the U.S. Third Army's garrison. The rocket artillery is the same as that fired at the U.S. Third and Ninth Armies in mid-December.

### Turkey Opens the Dardanelles Strait

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th: According to Reuters, Washington: It is reported that the Turkish government has decided to open the Dardanelles Strait to the UK and the US for transporting military supplies to the anti-Axis forces.

### Germany Will Retaliate Against the Torgau Party

Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th: The German News Agency reports that the German Foreign Ministry announced on the 13th that France is still persecuting so-called pro-German elements. Therefore, the German government, in accordance with the announcement in its note to the International Red Cross last December, will sentence five Torgau Party members in German hands to death after a formal trial.

### Eastern Front Soviet Army Launches Winter Offensive

Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Soviet winter offensive was launched by the 1st Ukrainian Front on January 12th in southern Poland. The German military authorities are taking this Soviet offensive very seriously, even saying that January 12th, the day the battle began, will be a day remembered in history. According to German military authorities, the forces under Konev participating in the offensive consist of 24 to 28 divisions from three army corps of infantry, along with tank units.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German news agency reports: The major Soviet offensive anticipated by the German army has now reached its climax. The major offensive from the Vistula River bridgehead, which the Soviets began on January 12th, expanded again towards East Prussia on the morning of the 13th. Large-scale battles of decisive significance are now underway along a front of over 100 kilometers. It is believed that everything of the Soviet army will be decided by this offensive operation. The objective of the Soviet forces at the Baranow bridgehead is undoubtedly Silesia, while in the East Prussian sector, the operation seems to be aimed at Königsberg, and the area may be further expanded. The Soviet forces encountered German resistance at Baranow. Gaps have already opened up among the Soviet assault units in East Prussia.

German Troops Recalled from the Balkans to Participate in the War

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German news agency reports: A German military spokesman stated on Saturday in response to questions that some of the German troops recalled from the Balkans have joined the line between Lake Balaton and the Drava River. The German troops, on their way, were attacked by Tito's forces, but were not hindered as a result.

Editorial

### Song Ziwen in a Love Triangle

Since the Sino-Japanese War evolved into the Greater East Asia War, the love affair between the US, Chongqing, and the Chinese Communists has become overt, from being ambiguous. Enemy America's counteroffensive in the Pacific attempts to approach the Japanese mainland. However, being further away from their own country and facing the danger of destruction, the only way to save themselves, and in order to realize their ambition of dominating East Asia by fighting a decisive battle with Japan on the Chinese mainland, is to take advantage of the lovers they already had and those still in pursuit of—Chongqing and the Chinese Communists. If they can make both lovers willingly fall into their arms and indulge in wanton play, then the best way is to kill two birds with one stone. Two lovers in love with one man, each harboring a purpose, will naturally be jealous of each other, vying for beauty and favor, displaying every seductive charm, and offering their all to win the man's favor and raise their own value. However, in order to show their own nobility, even when seeking favors from a patron, they cannot speak directly, so there must be a madam trusted by both sides to mediate. At the same time, the patron, in order to flaunt in front of the lovers or monitor them for other affairs, also needs a madam to help. Song Ziwen's rise to power as the President of the Executive Yuan is exactly this kind of role.

This analogy may be a bit too vulgar, but it may be clearer than Mr. Yoshida To’s explanation of "Song Ziwen's entry into the cabinet and Chongqing's distress," and more suitable for Chinese people's understanding, right? Mr. Yoshida's insights are very accurate, and we fully agree with his opinion. However, from our Chinese perspective, we will add a few words to this issue, without intending to add a dog's tail.

The center of this love triangle is, of course, Chongqing. Therefore, Chongqing is the axis between the US, Chongqing, and the Chinese Communists. Song Ziwen's rise to power first reflects Chongqing's attitude, and Chongqing's attitude is linked to the relationship between the US and Chongqing, and the Chinese Communists and the US.

Before explaining these three relationships, we must first describe Song Ziwen and Chiang Kai-shek's foreign policy. As Mr. Yoshida said, Song Ziwen is the most suitable person to be the President of the Executive Yuan for the Chiang family. He had long wanted to ascend to this real position, but was always suspected by that brother-in-law. The reason for his lack of success was that he had the ability and qualifications, and had gathered around him a group of outstanding talents of the time. Therefore, Chiang knew that Kong Xiangxi was greedy, mediocre, and incompetent, but not dangerous and easy to control, more so than Song. Originally, Chiang Kai-shek's foreign policy had always been sitting in the car pulled by two horses, the "pro-Japanese faction" and the "European and American faction." In some situations, he put the former in front, and in others, he put the latter in front (to borrow Mr. Yoshida's words). However, Chiang never dared to properly harness this "European and American faction" horse—Song Ziwen—and let him pull his carriage. Now, the Americans dislike these obstinate horses and insist on replacing them with the beautified Song Ziwen. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to rely on the United States and gain its trust, naturally complied and let him drag the carriage into a dangerous situation.

At the same time, in order for Chongqing to be more in line with the US's wishes, the US must place in Chongqing's political center someone who can obey the US and ease the opposition between the government and the people, so that China's manpower and resources can be fully exploited and consumed. On the other hand, it must cultivate a puppet who can represent American interests during the war, in an attempt to turn China into an American war trophy—a colony—after the war. Song Ziwen is the most suitable role. The nurturing over the past few years has been for this purpose.

Secondly, there is the relationship between Chongqing and the Chinese Communists. As Mr. Yoshida said, Song Ziwen is someone who has had a considerable understanding of the Chinese Communists since the Anti-Japanese War, which is a fact. However, whether he is "the most trusted politician by the Chinese Communists" remains to be proven by facts. If he is as loyal to Chiang and the US as Kong Xiangxi, and neglects the demands of the Chinese Communists, or hinders the development of the Chinese Communists, I don't think the Chinese Communists will be more generous to Song than to Kong, right? Moreover, all the goals of the Chinese Communists are in "coalition government" and "joint command." If Song Ziwen participates in this group as one of the parties and factions, and takes the same political steps as the Chinese Communists, then the Chinese Communists will not oppose it and will treat him as a comrade in the united front. Therefore, Song Ziwen's appointment as president can only be seen as a shield for Kong Xiangxi for now, and cannot be regarded as a peacemaker between Chongqing and the Chinese Communists.

Thirdly, there is the relationship between the US and the Chinese Communists. Mr. Yoshida said in his article "The Reorganization of the Kuomintang and the Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists": "...The Chongqing army is more concerned about how to eliminate the Chinese Communist army in the future than how to prevent the Japanese army. And the Chinese Communist army is certainly concerned about how to disrupt the Japanese army, but it is even more concerned about expanding its sphere of influence as much as possible within the areas occupied by the Japanese army." This paragraph is enough to explain the key to the collusion between the US and the Chinese Communists. The US does not trust Chongqing and Chiang and wants the Chinese Communists to restrain Chongqing and Chiang from resisting Japan. If the US wants to win the war, it must find a second force in China, and this force can cooperate with the delusion of landing on the Chinese coast. Then, the Chinese Communist army is the most ideal. Therefore, the US cannot but recognize the political power of the Chinese Communist Party and collude with it.

The Chinese Communist Party is committed to using the contradiction and unity in dialectics. They use the contradiction between the US and Chongqing to unify the contradiction between the Chinese Communists and Chongqing and develop their sphere of influence. Then, they unify the contradictions between the US, Chongqing, and the Chinese Communists in "Resisting Japan." Song Ziwen stood up at this point.

Mayor Zhou Issues a Proclamation to the Citizens

The newly appointed Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality and Commander of the Security Force Zhou Fohai took office today (the 15th) and issued a "Proclamation to the Citizens of Shanghai" as follows:

"Citizens of Shanghai, at a time when the situation is serious and tense, I have been ordered to preside over Shanghai's municipal affairs. I deeply feel the great responsibility, the arduous task, and the difficult environment. Therefore, at the beginning of my term, I would like to briefly state some of my feelings and beliefs to my fellow citizens, fathers, elders, brothers.

A Heavy Burden Has Been Picked Up

On the day that Chairman Wang's coffin returned to Beijing, the Supreme National Defense Council held a meeting and elected Mr. Chen as the acting chairman. On the same day, Mr. Chen said to me: "I cannot take care of Shanghai's affairs. I have to ask you to take on the responsibility." At that time, because my own talent and energy were not enough to cope with Shanghai's complex and difficult situation, I declined politely. My best friends and the friends of friendly nations all advised me not to do it. They were all based on the enthusiasm to protect me and did not want me to come to Shanghai to sacrifice myself. They believed that Shanghai's situation would only become more difficult and worse in the future. No one would be able to do anything. Why should I bear the brunt and take on the difficulties and make sacrifices in vain? I am very grateful for their kindness. However, the reason why I did not dare to take on the responsibility was not because I was afraid of sacrifice. In such an extraordinary period, how can I still plan for myself? I did not dare to take on the responsibility entirely because there was no way to do it. Therefore, the issue of Shanghai's mayor was delayed for more than 40 days before it could be decided. Later, after Mr. Chen's order and the urging of comrades, I had to pick up this heavy burden.

Responsible for Guaranteeing Two Points

Now that I have picked up this heavy burden, how can I complete the task I have been given? Although I have been thinking hard day and night, consulting widely, I have not been able to get a satisfactory answer. I heard that many people have great expectations for my coming, which makes me even more worried and anxious. I hope that everyone will not have any expectations of me. Without expectations, you will not be disappointed in the future. The greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment in the future. I do not want everyone to be disappointed in the future, so I ask everyone not to expect it now. This is not me shirking responsibility, nor is it me belittling myself, nor is it me reserving excuses for when I do not do well in the future. In such a situation and environment, even a god with three heads and six arms would not be able to open up the deadlock and improve the current situation. With my weak ability, what can I do to fulfill everyone's expectations? However, I can guarantee two points to the citizens: First, I and my cadres have come with great determination this time. Our determination is to "want to do well," not only "want" but also "do" in the spirit of hard work, practical work, and tough work. As for whether it can be "good," although there is no full confidence due to the timing, environment, and other objective conditions, we will definitely do our best to use the timing, environment, and other conditions to do everything we can. We will not perfunctorily, not follow the old ways, not be complacent, not avoid labor and complaints, not use bureaucratic language. We will bury our heads in hard work in a down-to-earth manner, hoping to do as much good for the citizens as possible. This is the first point that I can guarantee to you.

Second, I and my cadres are all young and promising. We all have ideals, we all have a sense of enterprise, and our spirit is that public interest is more important than private interest, and society is before the individual. We will absolutely not use our power and position to seek personal gain. We know that it is not easy to establish a clean and honest atmosphere when life is pressing, people's desires are rampant, and the whole society is corrupt and degenerate. However, based on the spirit of Acting Chairman Chen's establishing a clean government, we are determined to lead by example, not to embezzle, not to pervert the law, not to engage in corruption for personal gain, and not to seize by force. Although we cannot achieve a clean sweep of corruption in one fell swoop, we must thoroughly investigate and rectify in a down-to-earth manner, hoping to do as much as possible to reduce the suffering of the citizens. This is the second point that I can guarantee to you.

Evildoers Will Never Be Tolerated

In addition, the ancients said: "To govern a chaotic world, use heavy penalties." Without eliminating violence, it is not enough to secure the good. To be lenient to corrupt officials who exploit the people, unscrupulous merchants who manipulate the market, and bandits who disrupt the neighborhoods is to be cruel to the good people. To be tolerant to evildoers who do evil is to be tyrannical to law-abiding people. If we find solid evidence of their wrongdoing, we will definitely punish them severely without tolerance, because I do not want to be cruel to the good people, so I will never tolerate or be lenient to evildoers. I hope that fair-minded people in society will assist me in investigating and reporting with a fair attitude. As for other things that need to be done, simply put, it is to follow the rules. Shanghai has been planned and managed by former Mayor Chen for more than four years, and the cause has a foundation and the administration has been on the right track. What I have to do in the future is what former Mayor Chen has already done but not yet completed, as well as what he wants to do and is about to start. I have no new policies, no new plans. My policies and plans are to continue the ideals and cause of former Mayor Chen in a consistent manner, and gradually realize them and gradually complete them.

Clean Up Undue Benefits

Because we want to do things, we cannot take into account feelings. Because we do not care about private interests, we must clean up or make public the undue benefits that have enriched individual pockets in the past. Therefore, I believe that those who do not have respect for personal feelings and who do not continue to have personal interests will definitely have repercussions. In the future, it will be inevitable to create rumors and even fabricate facts and distribute leaflets. In order to seek the welfare of the majority of people and to remove the suffering of the majority of people, we not only do not care about these actions of a few people who confuse right and wrong for personal interests, but also severely punish those who take the initiative to do so. However, when encountering these situations, I hope that you will investigate the facts and make a fair judgment, and do not easily believe the tricks of villains.

The ancients said: "There is no lofty theory in humility," and also said: "The key to governing is not in many words, but in how effective the actions are." At the beginning of my term, I am unwilling to make excessive promises or issue checks that cannot be cashed in the future, nor am I willing to make many arguments and make unnecessary propaganda. I will do as much as I can, and I will explain it to you in the future with actions and facts.

Finally, in order for government orders to be smoothly implemented, citizens must be able to understand and obey them. If there is no close link between the government and the people, government orders are not easy to implement. In the future, we will try our best to consult and adopt opinions from all parties. At the same time, I sincerely hope that the citizens will give full support and cooperation to the implementation of government orders. Zhou Fohai, Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality and Commander of the Shanghai Security Force."

### Price Review Council Decides to Unify Price Management; Six Implementation Measures Agreed Upon

The Shanghai Price Review Council, in view of the fact that although the council has recently reviewed and issued price limits, ordering merchants to sell accordingly, there are still some merchants who arbitrarily raise prices. In order to completely eliminate this malpractice, the council has passed a resolution to implement unified management of generally fixed prices. The content of the measures is as follows: (1) The supply of raw materials for items such as pancakes, fried dough sticks, noodles, glutinous rice balls, boiled water, and cotton has been suspended, resulting in reliance on the black market, and prices have skyrocketed, making it impossible to enforce the official price limits. Therefore, it is necessary to allocate the required raw materials on a regular basis. (2) Most of the white paper, chemical industrial raw materials, and Western medicine raw materials come from overseas. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the source of supply was cut off. The items currently traded on the market are all previous stocks, which have been hoarded by speculators, causing prices to soar. Therefore, it is planned to order the relevant industry associations to report and register all such materials in accordance with central regulations, and to implement unified management of the trading market. Except for legitimate supplies to manufacturers as raw materials, all other buying and selling are prohibited. (3) In the past, price limit investigations were conducted on the sales prices of various commercial establishments, and those who were punished were all retailers. However, in reality, wholesalers increased prices first, causing retailers to follow suit. Retailers who were investigated and punished by the authorities were not spared, but wholesalers who actually raised prices were able to escape punishment, which is the main reason why prices have not been suppressed. Therefore, in the future, in order to suppress prices, investigating and enforcing price limits must start with wholesalers to achieve the effect of getting to the root of the problem. (4) Most vegetable vendors are scattered along roads and streets, and few set up vegetable markets, making it impossible to unify the management of vegetable price limits. Therefore, it is necessary to submit a request to the municipal government to order the health and police authorities to concentrate all vendors in the city in vegetable markets for trading, and to strictly order vegetable vendors to mark the official price limits of all items sold in the vegetable market, so that citizens can buy at the fixed price, and to order supervisors to earnestly implement this. (5) The prices fixed by the central market are mostly lower than the market prices. Each association should be ordered to sell goods in accordance with the assessed price limits and to implement full collectivization so that retail prices can be suppressed. (6) In the past, general items were often raised in price by industry associations when they applied for price evaluation, or it was found that most of the industry had exceeded the price limit, but the industry association did not report it. Therefore, in the future, the responsibility for supervising the buying and selling of the industry will be given to each industry association, and the responsible persons of each industry association will be punished for illegal activities. The above measures will be implemented in the near future to suppress prices at a time when the price problem is becoming increasingly serious.

### Rice Mills and Rice Warehouses Must Register by a Deadline

The Rice Grain Control Committee, in accordance with the provisions of the 1944 Rice Grain Procurement Implementation Outline for the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, is implementing control and management of rice mills and rice grain warehouses in various regions, and is handling registration procedures. The committee has already notified rice mills (including those using electricity and fire) and rice grain warehouses within the Shanghai Special Municipality and its seven subordinate counties to obtain and fill out registration forms from the Storage Section of the committee by the 22nd of this month.

### Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Were Calm Last Week

The financial and industrial and commercial market conditions in the city were stable last week. There was little activity by speculators, and people were unusually calm. Price fluctuations were minimal. In the financial sector, the black market for fine gold has remained stable at around 780,000 to 790,000 yuan, and silver has stayed at 900 yuan. Interest rates for short-term loans remain at six corners, with no changes. Chinese stocks rose first and then fell, with little distinction between prosperity and disgrace. In the industrial and commercial sectors, although factories are still unable to produce due to the lack of electricity, the authorities are actively working on ways to supply electricity to major commodity factories. Therefore, factories are preparing to resume operations after the electricity supply solution is resolved, so people are at ease, and the commercial situation is not as panicky as in the past. Moreover, the new mayor is about to take office, and he will strictly enforce the suppression of prices and the stability of people's livelihoods. Therefore, general hoarders and speculators dare not easily raise prices, and the prices of daily necessities such as rice, miscellaneous grains, oil, sugar, firewood, and charcoal have been suppressed.

### Zhabei Baojia Association Officially Established

Since the baojia (household registration) administration in the Zhabei District of this city was merged into the jurisdiction of the Police Bureau's Baojia Department, the Zhabei District Office of the Baojia Department was established a month ago, with the intention of reorganizing, dividing Lianbao (joint security) and Baojia districts, and establishing the Zhabei District Branch of the Municipal Baojia Committee, and appointing Lianbao chiefs. The organization has been strengthened, which is a prelude to the cooperation between the police and the baojia in Zhabei and the revitalization of the local area. The Zhabei District Branch of the Baojia Committee officially held its inaugural meeting and the inauguration ceremony of the baojia personnel at 3:00 PM on the 13th in the district branch. Those present included Gu Jiwu, Director of the Baojia Department, Vice Director Da Chuan, Jiang Yuewu, Director of the Zhabei Police Bureau, Vice Director Kawate and Kyuro, and guests including Kurita, a trustee of the Allied Shanghai Liaison Department, as well as baojia committee members and Lianbao chiefs in the district, totaling more than 100 people. First, Chairman Wang Binyan reported the purpose of the meeting, and then held the swearing-in ceremony of the baojia personnel above the level of Bao chief in the district. After the swearing-in ceremony of all the newly appointed personnel was led by the Chief Lianbao Chief Wang Binyan, Director Gu of the Baojia Department was invited to give a speech, followed by Chen Jiufeng, Deputy Director of the North District Office, Jiang Yuewu, Director of the Zhabei Police Bureau, and guest Trustee Kurita, who gave speeches in succession, followed by a speech by the representative of the Baojia chief, and finally the meeting was adjourned after a group photo.

### A Stroll Through the Snowy Capital

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Dan Ming

On the 7th of this month, Nanjing experienced a day and night of snowfall. Upon waking the next day, one found a world already transformed into a landscape of powdered white and jade. It is said that this heavy snowfall is not only the most significant since the Nationalist Government returned to the capital, but also a rare occurrence in the past decade or more. Consequently, the snow on the streets reached depths of up to two feet, and the weather turned sharply colder. Due to the reflection of the snow, despite the overcast sky, one felt a sense of brightness. Walking through it, one truly felt as though one was ascending to immortality. Therefore, despite the heavy snowfall, this reporter braved the freezing cold to stroll through the streets these past few days.

Commemoration of the War Participation

This day marked the second anniversary of our nation's participation in the war. It was said that because important figures from the national government were to attend the ceremony, the police had mobilized officers early in the morning to clear the snow from the main roads. The reporter walked from Gulou towards Baotai Street, along the way, soldiers and police were densely stationed, continuously raising their rifles in salute to the dignitaries who were traveling by car to the national government. Approaching Jiming Temple, a team of Allied soldiers ran towards us, each one exceptionally heroic, so we stood by the side of the road to observe their running姿态. This is truly a symbol of the victory of the Greater East Asia War, isn't it? Entering the National Government Auditorium, there were already people inside. Looking closer, it turned out that Chen Zhishuo, the Vice Minister, had arrived before me. The newly appointed Chief Secretary Zhou Longxiang, the Vice President of the Control Yuan Xu Suzhou, and others were also seated. There were many other high-ranking officials, roughly forty to fifty people. Unexpectedly, the newly appointed Mayor of Shanghai, Zhou Fohai, had also made a special trip from Shanghai to attend the commemoration. He attended today in his capacity as the Vice President of the Executive Yuan. Before the return to the capital, this reporter had met Zhou accompanied by Mr. Zhao Housheng, but after four or five years, he had become even more robust. Shortly after, Acting Chairman Chen arrived, accompanied by the new National Government Secretary Lin Ji and Fan Guanghua. The ceremony began, and from Vice President Zhou downwards, the national government officials listened silently to Chen's speech, which had been prepared beforehand. Midway through, the doors opened, and Foreign Minister Chu Minyi walked in. He stood silently in the crowd without saying a word. After Chen finished reading the speech, everyone left to the sound of music. As the reporter departed, I felt a surge of melancholy as I faced the auditorium where the late Chairman Wang's coffin had rested just over a month ago.

A Conversation with Ye Peng

I went to Luojia Road to visit Army Minister Ye and spoke with him for two hours. Ye left Chongqing due to his dissatisfaction with the political faction of the Chongqing government and responded to the peace movement in Hong Kong. In recent years, he has always been in control of the national government's military affairs, but he always said that he has not been able to achieve his desired goals. He believed that the national government's military build-up should at least achieve the four steps of: point (selection), train (training), compile (organization), and transfer (deployment), otherwise it would fail. With the possibility of the mainland becoming a battlefield today, the strength of our army is very important. Regarding this issue, his answer was humorous and frank. I think that in modern warfare, the sophistication of weaponry should be particularly valued.

The day after the War Participation Commemoration, the reporter went to Fu Zuo Road to visit an old Allied friend, Mr. Monwu. Mr. Monwu has been serving as a consultant for the National Economic Commission for the past few years. He is a close friend of Minister Ding Mocun. He recently returned to Japan to get married. When I entered, the couple was studying Chinese. When the reporter first met him seven or eight years ago, he could not speak Chinese, but now he speaks it as well as a Chinese person. In addition, he was wearing Chinese clothes, so it would be difficult to distinguish him as Japanese at first glance. According to his opinion, China's future requires a new system to be produced from a new ideology, so that new people can lead new politics, and then promote new economic policies. Otherwise, in the cycle of the government increasing taxes, officials increasing salaries, and merchants increasing prices, it is feared that there will be no good solution!

Visiting Chuan Shishuo

In the afternoon, the reporter visited Construction Minister Chuan Shishuo at Dongjian Road. Along the way, I saw that the snow had been cleared from many places. There is an old Chinese saying: "Each person sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and does not care about the frost on other people's roofs!" This is truly the best depiction of today. Speaking of Chuan, he participated in the peace movement quite early. In the conversation, I deeply felt that he was indeed a rare resolute person in the peace camp. When discussing the issue of ensuring security in the rear of the war, his experience as the head of Zhejiang was very effective. He said: "When I was in charge of Zhejiang, the local security team fought with the Chongqing Communists several times, and each time they won."

I asked, "Then, is there a way to manufacture weapons?"

"It only depends on whether there is a leader," he said with a smile, "In my own view, it is not impossible."

"Where is China's way out in the future?" I asked again.

"First," he said, "According to the evolution of the war, the problem today is how Chongqing can get rid of the Anglo-American aggression.

"Second, China in the future should start from anti-communism."
