### British General Election: Labour Party Wins, Churchill Cabinet Resigns, Attlee Commissioned to Form New Cabinet

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): According to a dispatch from London, the Labour Party has won the British general election with a two-thirds majority, gaining the support of most members of the British House of Commons.

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): According to information received here, Churchill visited the King last night to resign as Prime Minister, and Labour Party leader Attlee has been formally commissioned to form a new cabinet. Churchill, due to the failure in the general election, resigned as Prime Minister last night and issued a farewell message, stating: "I wish to express to the people of the whole country my infinite gratitude. I am grateful to the British people for giving me firm support and great confidence when I was entrusted with a heavy responsibility during the most dangerous and difficult stage in the past."

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): The official view here on the results of the British general election, in which the Labour Party holds an absolute advantage, is as follows: The victory of the Labour Party is proof that the British people are inclined towards post-war management. The policies of the new Labour Party cabinet may focus on domestic issues, but it is predicted that the new British cabinet's war policy will be the same as that of the Conservative government, or even more forceful than the Conservative cabinet. If the Labour Party continues to be enthusiastic about the war against Japan while promoting domestic post-war management, its policy may be flawed. This aspect of the new cabinet's foreign policy will inevitably have a considerable impact on the past US-British relations.

### British Labour Party Executive Meeting: Attlee Elucidates Policies

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): London telegram: Attlee and other Labour Party leaders held an emergency executive meeting on the night of the 26th to discuss the formation of a new cabinet. The meeting also seemed to have reviewed countermeasures for the Potsdam Conference. The Labour Party cabinet's Foreign Minister post is highly likely to be filled by former Minister of Labour Bevin, former Minister of Commerce Dalton, and former Minister of State Morrison.

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): Attlee, who is organizing the succeeding cabinet in Britain, gave a speech to party members at the Labour Party executive meeting outlining the new cabinet's policies as follows: "We must face the fact that Britain must undertake the most difficult tasks and overcome the various current difficulties. The Labour Party's policy is 'great internationalism.' We must have a complete guarantee of permanently eradicating war and contribute to world prosperity. This international undertaking is extremely difficult. We must restore the damage caused by the war, rebuild the abandoned houses, and further strive to improve the living standards of the British people. This is the cause of democracy, and it is also the cause of a just society."

### Churchill's Defeat: Causes and Consequences Show the People's Anti-War Sentiment

Central News Agency dispatch: According to international commentators here, the crown of the British general election ultimately went to the Labour Party, and Churchill's cabinet was forced to submit its resignation en masse. Churchill took office as Prime Minister in May 1940 and has been manipulating Britain's political and military affairs during the war for six years. He fully believed that he could win the election, but unexpectedly received a cold and ruthless "election" judgment from the British people, and had to announce his resignation. According to the natural steps of constitutional politics, Attlee, the leader of the absolute majority party, will take over as the head of the succeeding cabinet. It is expected that Attlee will form a single-party cabinet based on the Labour Party's position on Japan. Why did Churchill fail? Why did he suffer a crushing defeat with a large margin of 379 to 181 votes? Why was a meritorious person who won the war against Germany forced to withdraw from politics before the British people's own "vote"? The reason is very simple: the British people now no longer want the appearance of war. If Churchill were still the Prime Minister, the British people would suffer great pain. Churchill was the initiator of World War II. If Britain and the United States had been defeated, the major war criminal would undoubtedly be Churchill, not Hitler or PÃ©tain. He used clever strategies to drag the United States into the war and carry out the war against Germany, so if he remained in office, Britain's burden of the war would not be eased. Churchill's hard-line political and war strategies were effective when London was bombed during the war with Germany, but now that Europe has seen peace, the British people naturally hope for a good life. Domestically, doubts and criticisms have arisen about Churchill's imperialist war of aggression, forming a kind of public opinion. The whole of Britain hopes for a stable life after the war, and thus supports the Labour Party's domestic policy. The people hope to abandon Churchill's hard-line policies and prevent sacrifices in the war against Japan, and intend to support Attlee as Prime Minister, strengthen British-Soviet rapprochement, and protect Europe's superior vested rights. In short, all of this shows the British people's distrust of Churchill and is also a full expression of anti-war sentiment.

### Labour Party Policy Program

When the Labour Party held its party congress on May 22 of this year, it passed the "Five-Year Plan Party Program," which included: 1. Control of banks and finance. 2. Reforming domestic transportation, iron and steel industries into public ownership. 3. Strengthening the supervision of monopoly businesses and cartels. 4. Appropriately maintaining economic and price controls. As for the policy towards the Soviet Union, it was clearly stated that in order to prevent the occurrence of a third world war and remove current misunderstandings between each other, it is necessary to strengthen British-Soviet relations. At the same time, it was informally declared that, in order to open up the current situation, a coalition cabinet is no longer appropriate. Only by realizing a single-party cabinet with a unified will and absolute harmony can the heavy responsibility of dealing with the current situation be shouldered. From this, it can be seen that the future Labour Party cabinet and the Conservative Party cabinet will have distinctly different points. Regarding the Indian question, when the Labour Party held its party congress, the then Labour Minister Bevin stated on the Indian governance issue, "The current cabinet's policies have many errors, and the position of Minister of Indian Affairs should be abolished immediately." Therefore, Churchill declared on May 22 that compromise with the Labour Party was impossible and sent a public letter with a challenging nature to Attlee, which stated, "Whether you oppose maintaining the coalition cabinet and postponing the election before the war against Japan is right or wrong will be judged by the people of the whole country. Your repeated defamatory remarks against the Conservative Party are beyond my expectations and are truly regrettable in British political history. The general election will be held in a few months, and your remarks are very likely to lead to the adverse consequences of obstructing administrative efficiency. This responsibility should be fully borne by the Labour Party." Churchill's cabinet submitted its resignation en masse on May 23, and he was ordered by the King to form a cabinet again, thus formally parting ways with the Labour Party. Vice-Prime Minister Attlee, the dictator of 20 million British wartime personnel, Labour Minister Bevin, and Home Secretary Morrison resigned at the same time. Churchill then formed a conservative temporary cabinet to await the opening of the general election.

### British People's Cold-Blooded Nature

In order to counter the Labour Party's program, the Conservative Party also issued twelve articles to ensure a peaceful strategy, mainly: "Supporting Churchill's victory in the war against Japan, and then jointly deciding on a plan for permanent peace with the United States and the Soviet Union to ensure world peace. 2. Seeking the welfare of all British people. 3. Increasing British foreign trade. 4. Raising the living standards of the people," etc., but the content was empty and there were no concrete suggestions, making it difficult to be effective for the people. Churchill said during the Three-Headed Conference, "The British general election has no influence on the conference. If the Conservative Party fails, Attlee will take over from me." Therefore, Attlee accompanied him to the Potsdam Conference, knowing that this time was the crossroads of his own political life. During the talks, he suddenly returned to London for the election on the 25th and heard the news of his own defeat. The British people's judgment of the 71-year-old Churchill was too cruel.

We remotely imagine Churchill's lonely figure of defeat and cannot help but be shocked by the cold-blooded nature of the British people. Churchill exerted his hard-line political skills, from the Atlantic Conference in August 1941 to the Alexandria Conference in February of this year, holding talks with the late Roosevelt as many as eleven times, three times in his mansion, twice in Quebec, Tehran (first time), Cairo, Casablanca, Yalta, and Tehran (second time). Churchill, in his waning years, traveled all over the world, exerting his wisdom to prevent Britain from going astray and suppress the wavering of the people, with the defeat of Germany as the primary goal. His contribution truly deserves the honor of being called the "Savior of Britain."

Churchill smokes thirty cigars and drinks three bottles of whiskey a day, his vitality is extremely strong, and he can be called a British "national treasure." However, once the British people no longer need him, they discard him like worn-out shoes. The ruthlessness of the national character can be seen in this. At the same time, it can also be seen how surging and high the "anti-war" sentiment of the British people is, forcing them to abandon the great leader Churchill.

### Traditional Policies Remain Unchanged

With Churchill's strength and prestige, he could not overcome the people's anti-war sentiment, so the Labour Party took advantage of this sentiment and advocated a domestic stability policy, gaining the support of the people and winning the victory. Although Churchill's retirement has nothing to do with the war against Japan, as Japan does not consider Churchill an enemy but is at war with Britain. Moreover, any British cabinet's foreign policy remains consistently unchanged, which is its tradition. It remains to be seen how Attlee, who is replacing Churchill in the future, will guide the country.

### Churchill to Withdraw From Political Stage

Engaging in Writing War History

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): As a result of this British general election, in which the Conservative Party failed, Churchill seems to be resigning from his position as a member of the House of Commons after the establishment of the new parliament on August 1 and withdrawing from the political arena to devote himself to writing "The History of the Great War."

Editorial

### A Multi-Faceted View of Churchill's Ouster

The British general election was revealed on the 26th, with the Labour Party winning with 379 votes against the Conservative Party's 181 votes. What is particularly noteworthy is that, apart from Churchill, all the important Conservative Party figures in Churchill's government failed in this election. This is the first complete failure in the history of the Conservative Party.

The Conservative Party led by Churchill suffered a comprehensive defeat in this general election. The government led by Churchill also resigned immediately because of this! This is another historical tragedy being staged in the British Empire! This historical tragedy is a public declaration by the British people to the world:

Rejecting the Conservative Party's continued imperialist war policies and resisting the continued implementation of imperialist policies after the end of the war. The British people have a new attitude towards war; they no longer want war; they seek peace.

Demanding the protection of the people's peaceful and free life after the war, guaranteeing the economic life of the largest number of people, and solving problems such as food, finance, prices, and reconstruction and construction.

Hoping to escape the dangerous tendency towards a third world war under Churchill's Conservative Party policies in international policy, and further hoping to promote cooperation with the United States and the Soviet Union.

Demanding a reasonable resolution to colonial problems and Far Eastern power issues.

Therefore, we can say that this general election is the most powerful expression of British public opinion and the expression of British politics seeking a new dawn in a dead end. It is the first step towards a new life for Britain and its affiliated colonies.

However, this time it is the expression of the British people's will, and the expression of the will does not equal the fact! The current question is, where will the new Labour Party regime headed by Attlee lead Britain?

The Labour Party government has now appeared for the third time in modern British history. In the past, under the leadership of MacDonald and others, although there were no major errors, there were no special achievements to speak of. Can Attlee make any major achievements now? We dare not predict today. However, judging from Attlee's and others' defense of imperialist policies during the Churchill coalition cabinet era, they may not necessarily be much better than Churchill's Conservative Party government. However, one point must be noted, that is, it may be more realistic in reconstruction and construction, and it can be closer to the Soviet Union in diplomacy, and the contradiction between Britain and the United States will at least not reverse to the era of "Roosevelt-Churchill cooperation."

Churchill's resignation and the emergence of the Labour Party regime will of course have a considerable impact on the ongoing Three-Headed Conference. Therefore, with regard to the section on Truman-Churchill's conspiracy to force Stalin to participate in the East Asian war, it is obvious that a conclusion different from the planned one is about to occur.

### Sixty B-29s Bomb Omuta, Matsuyama and Tokuyama Cities Also Bombed

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): About sixty enemy B-29 aircraft infiltrated the vicinity of Omuta City via the Satsuma Peninsula at about 00:30 on the 27th, and for about an hour, they indiscriminately dropped incendiary bombs and bombs on the city and its surrounding areas, causing fires in various parts of Omuta City, but they were completely extinguished by about 4:00 AM. In addition, about forty B-29 aircraft, divided into two teams, carried out incendiary bomb attacks on Matsuyama and Tokuyama cities for two hours starting at 10:30 AM on the 26th. In addition, seven or eight other B-29 aircraft reconnoitered Yamaguchi Prefecture at the same time.

### Kawasaki Air Raid Hits Prisoner of War Camp

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): When US aircraft bombed the Kawasaki area on the 25th of this month, they dropped bombs that hit a prisoner-of-war camp, resulting in nine enemy prisoners of war being killed, two being missing, and the seriously injured being treated, one of whom eventually died, and three with minor injuries.

### Japanese Army Breaks Into Dongxing and Pingxiang

Southern Front Base, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): The Chongqing army under He Yingqin, which has been clamoring to attack Vietnam and continuing to stir up trouble, Japanese troops stationed in northern Vietnam have launched an attack since the 19th of this month, braving the rain. They first attacked the enemy's positions near Xiadong, becoming the vanguard of the main force of the 151st Division of the enemy's Second Front Army in Jingxi. Another unit attacked the Dongxing area, occupied it, and then broke through the Chongqing army's positions in the steep mountainous cave positions. Since the 23rd, they have destroyed and burned several military facilities and military supply accumulation points, and on the evening of the 24th, they infiltrated Nengzhou and Pingxiang with a unit, giving them a destructive blow, shattering the enemy's attempt to counterattack, and are currently expanding their war results.

### Hong Kong Stanley Detention Center Bombed

Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): At noon on the 25th, 31 enemy P-51 aircraft invading Hong Kong dropped nine bombs on the enemy nationals' detention center in the Stanley area. As a result, several British people in the detention center suffered minor injuries. According to reports, the weather was clear that day, and the detention center was marked with signs. The enemy carried out bombing at a low altitude of 400-500 meters, which was obviously intentional. In addition, the detention center was also bombed by carrier-based aircraft on the 1st of this month, resulting in several deaths and injuries. The American aircraft's illegal actions have truly made the detained British people gnash their teeth in hatred.

### Britain and the United States Urge Soviet Union to Participate in Combat

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): The British and American news reporting circles are keen to publicize that the main topic of the Three-Headed Conference is the East Asian issue, with the focus on the issue of Japan. According to a Reuters telegram from Potsdam on the 24th, the issue of the British, American, and Soviet war against Japan has been decided. Another Reuters telegram said that the American side believes that the Three-Headed Conference will have some important announcements regarding the war against Japan and emphasizes the Soviet Union's mission. This is a kind of propaganda strategy, intended to urge the Soviet Union to participate in the war against Japan, which is in sharp contrast to the current neutral countries' conservative silence on the issue.

### A Glimpse of Yangzhou

â Yifei

Northern Jiangsu is a grain-producing area. The people of Shanghai are often panicked about food. In the midst of advocating the consumption of mixed grains, the reporter went to Northern Jiangsu to investigate. On the first day of the month, I took the night train from Shanghai and arrived in Zhenjiang at 5:00 the next morning. What was surprising was that the inspection station, which had been ordered to be abolished by the central government, was still carrying out its work of harassing the people and extorting money. Afterwards, I talked to the villagers in the tea house next to the station about this matter. According to them, these people are currently using the excuse that they are in the process of winding down, so they continue to operate as before, and because they know that the good times will not last, they are taking the opportunity to get what they can, and they are even more greedy and ruthless than before, which makes the villagers sigh!

At 6:30, I arrived at the riverbank. By then, the place was already crowded with people. Someone was selling black market tickets for the ferry. Soon, the inspection began at the dock. The situation was comparable to that of a military station. Passengers here had to pay "road tax" as usual. At 8:00, the ship set sail. When it reached the middle of the river, the person in charge of the ship came to check the tickets, claiming that each passenger had to pay 500 yuan for "expenses," which was no different from a poll tax.

Twenty minutes later, after arriving at the opposite bank, I switched to a long-distance bus of the Central China Transportation Corps and drove directly to Yangzhou. Half an hour later, I arrived at the bus station outside the South Gate, crossed the floating bridge (consisting of several small wooden boats), passed through Fuyunmen and entered the city.

### A Glimpse of Yangzhou

"With 100,000 yuan around one's waist, one rides a crane to Yangzhou," but history is cruel, and present-day Yangzhou is outdated and old. All it can give people is a taste of history.

Yangzhou did not make a good impression on the reporter at first, but after lingering for a few days, I felt that this ancient city also has its lovely side. For example, the streets here, apart from the unique Xinma Road and a few so-called prosperous streets, such as Duozi Street, Yuanmen Bridge, Zuowei Street, and Jiaochang Street, the other nineteen are long and narrow deep alleys, quietly scattered in every corner, still maintaining the original appearance of the 18th century. As for the residents here, they are so leisurely, listening to operas and going to teahouses, or with three or five friends or relatives, playing mahjong at home when they are free. No wonder the Yangzhou Grand Theatre and the famous Fuchun Flower Bureau are always packed every day!

### County Government Overview

During my stay, I visited the Jiangdu County Government. The following is an overview of Jiangdu County, which is divided into nine districts: the urban area, Guazhou, Lidian, Xiannvmiao, Daqiao, Yiling, Shaobo, Dayi, and Huangjueqiao. The urban area is further divided into twenty-nine townships.

Population of the above nine districts: 1. The urban area has 131,151 people. 2. The Guazhou district has 158,778 people. 3. The Lidian district has 3,057 people. 4. The Xiannvmiao district has 66,867 people. 5. The Daqiao district (a bandit area, no statistics). 6. The Yiling district has 26,775 people. 7. The Shaobo district has 23,987 people. 8. The Dayi district has 29,656 people. 9. The Huangjueqiao district has 28,895 people. The total population of the above nine districts (note: these statistics are for residents in the peaceful areas where government orders can be enforced) is 469,166.

### Difficult to Implement Government Orders

Currently, the county government of Jiangdu County is experiencing difficulties in its promotion due to environmental reasons, which is the same as in other parts of Northern Jiangsu. At present, except for the fifth district, which is completely unable to be promoted, the same is true for the other districts. For example, in the third district of Lidian, only the two townships of Yongmao and Xinggang are subject to government orders. In the sixth district of Xuanling, there are only Muchen and one or two attached towns. In the seventh district of Shaobo, there are about four or five townships and towns. In the eighth district of Dayi, there are only Ganquan and Yangzhuang townships. In the ninth district of Huangjueqiao, in addition to the five townships attached to the city (Huangjin, Huaizi, Wamisisi, and Huai Si), the rest are bandit areas. Therefore, only the fourth district of Xiannvmiao and the second district of Guazhou, except for the two townships of Yuelai and Xinjie under their jurisdiction that cannot be promoted, are slightly stronger. Looking at the above, we can get a glimpse of the difficulty of the administration and the instability of public security in Jiangdu County.

### Land Tax Situation

The total number of cultivated acres in Jiangdu County is approximately 2,310,293 acres. The land tax rate is divided into three grades and nine categories, that is, the first-grade top-grade fields are taxed at 1.1 deciliters of rice per mu, the first-grade middle-grade fields at 8.65 deciliters, and the first-grade low-grade fields at 6.45 deciliters.

The second-grade top-grade fields are taxed at 5.44 deciliters of rice per mu, the second-grade middle-grade fields at 3.77 deciliters, and the second-grade low-grade fields at 3.21 deciliters.

The third-grade top-grade fields are taxed at 2.69 deciliters of rice per mu, the middle-grade fields at 2.03 deciliters, and the low-grade fields at 1.44 deciliters.

In 1943, the number of mu that could be levied was 510,000 mu. Recently, due to the inability to promote the eighth and ninth districts under its jurisdiction, there are now only 400,000 mu remaining. However, even with this number, only about 60% can actually be collected. According to reports, the county collected a total of more than 9 million yuan in land tax revenue in 1943. The revenue for 1944, which began on November 1 of that year, has not yet ended and has collected more than 8,600 dan of white rice.

As for the distribution method between the county government and the provincial government for land tax revenue, before 1941, 38.62% was handed over to the province and 61.38% was retained by the county. Later, from 1942 until the establishment of the Pacification Office, it was changed to 50% each for the province and the county.

Recently, the Suzhou Northern Pacification Headquarters has stipulated the "Interim Measures for the Storage and Monetization of Land Tax Commodities" for the disposal of land tax proceeds. The county government must first obtain a "valuation form" (that is, a valuation form) and a sample from the local rice industry association and submit them to the Pacification Headquarters for approval before they can be sold and converted into cash, which is then deposited into the county treasury for various expenses.

### Agrarian Customs and Land System

Agricultural Customs in Jiangdu County: "Stupid Package" and "Listening to Shares." The relationship between farmers and landlords can be roughly divided into two types: "Stupid Package" and "Listening to Shares." The former refers to farmers (tenants) who lease land from owners and must determine a "lease" in advance (that is, a tenancy contract). The contract predetermines how the crops will be distributed in the future, agreed upon by both parties.

As for the latter, "Listening to Shares," there is no written contract between the tenant farmer and the landlord like in the "Stupid Package." The division is determined based on the abundance or scarcity of the harvest that year. Conventionally, the owner receives one-third of the total crop yield, and the remaining two-thirds go to the tenant.

Upper and Lower Feet: The term "Upper and Lower Feet" refers to the relationship between a tenant who has obtained perpetual tenancy rights ("Upper Foot") and the landlord. "Lower Foot" refers to the relationship that arises between the cultivator who has obtained the right to cultivate the land from the tenant and a fourth party.

Military Lands: In the past, during the Qing Dynasty, there were so-called military lands in Jiangdu and other places, also known as "Garrison Lands." These were fields bestowed by the imperial court to meritorious military personnel. The taxes on these lands were not collected by the county government but by specially appointed garrison officers. After the Republic of China, these lands were converted into civilian lands.

### Balikpapan Front: Stalemate, Both Sides Continuously Attacking with Air Force

Central News Agency dispatch from Southern Frontline Base, 27th: The Balikpapan front has returned to a stalemate since the 25th. Currently, only scouting is taking place. The enemy is facing strong resistance from the Japanese garrison forces. However, eager to seize the oilfields, they are actively attacking the Samarinda oil refinery and the three oilfield areas. Only three roads pass through the eastern district of Balikpapan, and their directions are obscured by dense forests. The Japanese army is defending the entrances and exits of the roads in this area, preventing the enemy from entering. Moreover, the enemy began using an airfield several weeks ago, and giant, high-altitude aircraft have started operating. Fierce seesaw battles have broken out between the two sides in eastern Balikpapan. In this situation, the Japanese army is fighting bravely. A team led by Captain Yano is undertaking the difficult task of building roads under enemy fire. A Japanese commando team raided the enemy's headquarters, destroying it. On their return, they engaged in battle with 30 enemy soldiers. Sergeant Matsunaga and Corporal Suge were killed in action, while Corporal Nishiyama was seriously wounded. They cut dozens of enemy telephone lines before returning. On the 24th, the Japanese Air Force commander in the area, Aida, launched a strong attack on the enemy's position, bombing it. The activity of the air force is visible to the Japanese ground forces, further boosting their morale.

Central Japan News Agency dispatch from Southwest Pacific Base, 27th: On the 23rd and 24th, the enemy besieging Balikpapan launched a new offensive, causing renewed fierce fighting between Japanese and American forces. However, the Japanese army launched a fierce counterattack, causing the American offensive to stall temporarily. On the night of the 24th, Japanese air force bombing of enemy positions could be seen several times from the mountains, greatly boosting the morale of the Japanese army. However, the American forces continue to attack Japanese positions with aircraft.

### American Submarine Shells Kinkasan

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 27th: On the afternoon of the 26th, at around 6:00 PM, an American submarine appeared off the coast of Kinkasan and shelled the coastline for five minutes. Only one enemy shell hit the official residence of the lighthouse keeper.

### Sumatra Senate Reissues Statement

Central News Agency dispatch from Sumatra, 27th: The Central Senate of Sumatra, based on the recommendations of the first Central Senate meeting, has issued a statement to clarify the purpose of the Greater East Asia War and the Senate's position during the preparation for independence.

### Suzhou Raises Funds to Help Shanghai Disaster Victims

Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou, 27th: In recent days, enemy aircraft blindly bombed the northeastern districts of Shanghai, causing immense suffering to innocent civilians and resulting in severe damage. Leaders from Suzhou Province's industrial and commercial sectors have launched a fundraising campaign. The first batch of 50,000 yuan raised will be remitted to Shanghai within days, and fundraising will continue to aid the disaster victims.

### Strict Prohibition of Illegal Discounting in Suzhou

Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou, 27th: The Suzhou Central Reserve Inspection Office and the Provincial Police Bureau previously strictly prohibited illegal discounting and trading by various firms and the unwarranted refusal to pay cash for checks to steer provincial finances back on track. However, a few firms, driven by profit, have been outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, disrupting the financial market and stimulating price increases. Therefore, the Inspection Office and the Provincial Police Bureau will thoroughly investigate the cash revenue and expenditure accounts of various firms, strictly prohibit privately operated illegal discounting companies, and encourage the public to report violations to stabilize provincial finances.

### Ministry of Industries and Commerce Sends Personnel to Supervise Agricultural and Forestry Production Increase in Various Regions

Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 27th: The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industries and Commerce feels that the lack of technical personnel often hinders the effective promotion of local production increase efforts. Therefore, it has hired a large number of technical personnel and issued official letters to various provinces and cities, allowing them to directly request personnel from the Ministry. It is now known that the Huaihai Province, Anhui Province, and northern Jiangsu Province have responded to the Ministry, designating technical personnel to be dispatched to Xuzhou, Bengbu, Yangzhou, and other places to guide production increase efforts. The Ministry has dispatched specialists to reside and work in these locations.

### Former Xinjiang Province Chairman Sheng Shicai Impeached

Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping, 27th: Before adjourning on the 21st, the National Political Council in Chongqing listed Sheng Shicai's acts of killing civilians and accepting bribes during his tenure as Chairman of Xinjiang Province and requested severe punishment in the name of the people. The motion passed unanimously, causing ripples in the delicate international political situation surrounding the Xinjiang issue. A United Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 21st stated that the measures taken by the National Political Council against Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Sheng Shicai were significant. Sheng had ruled Xinjiang Province autocratically for twelve years, during which he killed hundreds of civilians and accepted countless bribes. He was only transferred to the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry last August. At the same time as the impeachment by the National Political Council, a Mr. Lin, the director of construction in the province who had been arrested a year ago, also accused Sheng of his crimes. The Chongqing judicial authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation. Sheng, who was backed by the Soviet Union and ruled Xinjiang autocratically, was transferred to the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry about a year after leaving Xinjiang, and now he has been impeached. This plan is nothing more than a predetermined strategy by the Chongqing Kuomintang. At a time when external forces are vying politically for influence in Xinjiang, the sudden impeachment of Sheng, who still has considerable latent power in the Xinjiang border region, is...

### Zhejiang Province Develops Transportation, Establishes Highway Bureau, Initial Construction Cost 50 Million Yuan

Central News Agency dispatch from Hangzhou, 27th: Since the start of this year, highways in Zhejiang Province have been damaged by bandits and puppet troops, making them either completely impassable or difficult to travel. This obstruction of transportation has caused exceptional hardship for travelers. Since Governor Ding took office, he recognized the critical relationship between highways and security, economy, and transportation and planned to repair them. Recently, bids have been let or construction is underway for the Hangzhou-Fuyang Highway, the Hangzhou-Yuhang Highway, the Hangzhou-Jiashan Highway, and the Hangzhou-Wuxing Highway. The initial cost of constructing these highways is as high as 50 million yuan. Because the project concerns the prosperity of Zhejiang Province and local security, no expense will be spared in their construction. Other highways are being planned for construction by the relevant authorities. Furthermore, the original Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration has been reorganized into the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau. Governor Ding will serve concurrently as the director of the bureau, and Mao Yuyuan and Wu Renhao have been appointed as deputy directors. Management offices have been established for each major highway, with Xing Shaomei appointed as the director of the Hangzhou-Fuyang Highway Management Office, Shen Banmei as the director of the Hangzhou-Yuhang Highway Management Office, and Xi Jianping as the director of the Hangzhou-Jiashan Highway Management Office.

### Various Factions in Chongqing Hope for Freedom of Speech

Central News Agency report citing a Xinhua News Agency broadcast: The magazine "Rebirth," originally the organ of the Chinese National Socialist Party, has been reorganized and become a common platform for various parties and factions in Chongqing. Recently, in its 100th commemorative issue, it published an article titled "All Democrats Unite," which stated: Currently, many people hope for genuine democracy. However, many groups, using democracy as a mask, attempt to enjoy privileges. We propose the following: National unity; Reduce the privileges of a small number of privileged groups; Give the people freedom of speech, association, assembly, and physical integrity; Realize genuine democracy.

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 27th: The Chongqing government's strict control of news and communication has aroused dissatisfaction both domestically and abroad. According to a New York dispatch on the 25th, The New York Times, in an editorial on the 24th, discussed the Chongqing government's recent ban on two American journalists, Randall, from entering the country. The editorial argued that while an American journalist's exposure of the weaknesses and corruption of the Chongqing regime was harsh, Chiang Kai-shek should accept the criticism and reflect on himself for improvement if he sincerely intends to build a democratic China. American journalists criticizing Chiang Kai-shek is not that different than British journalists criticizing Churchill and American journalists criticizing Roosevelt. However, only free speech can promote truth. If Chiang Kai-shek attempts to suppress speech out of practical needs, it will only worsen the situation.

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 27th: According to a London dispatch, The Sunday Times reported on the 22nd that a German scientist had invented a mustard gas fuel that could produce ultra-high temperatures when the European war was about to end. This gas could have a decisive impact on every tactic. It is called "Igol," and it is used to propel Y-type Meteor missiles. According to the inventor, it is predicted that using this fuel to launch naval torpedoes could control them from afar if they miss the target on their first pass, allowing them to move back and forth through the escort path of their target multiple times. The fuel can increase the speed of submarines by twenty nautical miles per hour, and if used in aircraft, the speed can be 650 miles per hour for one hour or 450 miles per hour for three hours. The inventor is now in the United Kingdom and has informed British scientists of the details.

### Yugoslavia Passes New Laws

Central News Agency report citing a TASS dispatch from Belgrade: At its final meeting, the Anti-Fascist Assembly of the National Liberation Committee of Yugoslavia passed several new laws.

Another law transferred all domestic ships, docks, harbors, and shipyards to the direct control of the Ministry of Transportation.

### Bumper Harvest in the Soviet Union, Harvesting Begins

Central News Agency report citing a TASS dispatch from Moscow: Harvesting began two months ago in the southern fields of the Soviet Union. Now, harvesting has also begun in the northern fields. Rice harvesting has already been completed in the Central Asian and Transcaucasian republics, but harvesting is about to begin in Belarus and the Volga region. Farmers are bringing millions of tons of grain to the granaries of Uzbekistan, Cuba, Ukraine, and the Caucasus. This harvest is being hailed as a victory harvest, an exceptionally abundant one. Compared to last year, the area under cultivation has increased by millions of hectares. Most of the machinery and tractor stations, which were severely damaged by the German army, have been repaired. Three thousand machinery and tractor stations have been restored in all liberated areas to assist with harvesting. This year, 60% of the national grain harvest will be cut by combine harvesters.

### Police Bureau Actively Carries Out Air Raid Rescue Work, Deputy Director Du Reports Recent Policies

At 10:30 AM yesterday (the 27th), Du Zhengjian, Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, attended the regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office to report on the Bureau's recent policies and answer questions from various newspaper reporters in detail. The following is a summary:

Eliminating Redundant Personnel and Improving Treatment

After the unification of municipal administration, efforts were made to promote fixed guidelines, such as eliminating redundant personnel. In the past, the police bureau had 15,000 police officers. After careful screening, redundant personnel were eliminated, which was completed at the end of last month. Improving treatment. Police salaries were meager, and some police officers took advantage of their positions to extort money. Therefore, the salaries of police officers were raised to a high point. At the same time, subordinates were educated and strictly prohibited from engaging in improper behavior. Those who deliberately violated the rules would be severely punished. Distribution of supplies. Since Director Zhou took office concurrently, in addition to improving the treatment of police officers and increasing their salaries, they have also been given supplies. Establishing a police welfare society to handle welfare matters for police officers. Currently, the main supplies distributed include rice, as well as daily necessities such as flour, matches, cigarettes, and cooking oil. The amount of rice distributed is six dou per month for married people with children and two and a half dou per month for unmarried people. Recently, with the assistance of relevant authorities, 2,000 tons of rice will be distributed to police officers. It is also reported that the society will soon go to other cities to purchase firewood for police officers.

Rigorous Training of Rescue Teams

During air raids, the police bureau, in addition to close cooperation between the police and baojia, actively carries out firefighting and air defense work. The work ability of the fourth (White Russian) team of the Municipal Police Corps is highly regarded by all sectors of society. The team has a total of 200 White Russian members, divided into six classes. They have received rigorous training in the past. Therefore, in the event of air raids, such as the collapse of houses, they will be dispatched to rescue people. The police bureau has spent a lot of money on the team's equipment. The organization is purely military. The team's activities during the frequent enemy air raids on Shanghai have been satisfactory. In addition, the police corps has a reserve team staffed by Chinese police officers. Plans are underway to give them the same training, so that they can be dispatched together in emergencies.

Air Defense in Counties Will Be Strengthened

Recently, enemy aircraft have frequently attacked the city. The rescue equipment in the counties is simple, causing injured citizens to suffer greatly. It is hoped that the police authorities will pay attention to this and find ways to strengthen it. (Answer) Regarding the air defense and rescue equipment in the counties, it is said that the municipal government is actively considering it, and the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters has also paid attention to it and plans to strengthen the equipment. I returned to the country on official business in mid-May. In Tokyo, I witnessed the well-organized and swift air defense and rescue work. In the event of an air raid, the injured were given first aid and treatment. The displaced citizens were immediately given food and relief, all handled by the police. Therefore, Shanghai should urgently emulate this. The Municipal Advisory Committee intends to use a portion of the funds for air raid victims. It is said that a meeting will be held tomorrow (the 28th) at 4:00 PM to discuss the distribution plan. As for hospitals refusing to treat civilians injured in air raids, the police bureau is determined to eradicate this. The baojia are also organizing rescue teams to be responsible for treating injured civilians. At the same time, this will be extended to the suburbs.

### Police Bureau Revises Penalties for Major Land Traffic Violations, Orders Subordinate Branches to Implement

In order to thoroughly rectify traffic order and maintain the city's appearance, the Municipal Police Bureau, starting on the 25th of this month, cooperated with the military police and members of the Baojia Office Police Corps to implement "Strengthening Traffic Week." The bureau directed traffic, cracked down on vehicles and pedestrians violating regulations, and since its implementation, traffic order has been improving day by day. At the same time, the bureau has also revised the "Penalty Regulations for Major Land Traffic Violations," which has been implemented by all subordinate branches since the previous day. The reporter has learned the following details:

Fines Divided into Two Categories

According to the articles of the Land Traffic Management Regulations, fines are divided into first and second categories. Violations of Articles 5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 27, 28, 30 to 37, 39, 41, 45 to 47, 49 to 52, 54, 56, 59, 61 to 64, 66, 67, 70 to 75, 79 to 83, 86, 89 to 96 of the regulations are classified as the first category of fines. All other articles are classified as the second category of fines.

Penalties for Various Vehicle Violations

Automobiles or trucks or other motorized vehicles that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 20,000 to 50,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Motorcycles that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 15,000 to 40,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 40,000 to 80,000 yuan. Carts and horse-drawn wagons that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 20,000 to 50,000 yuan. Tricycles that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 5,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 10,000 yuan. Rickshaws that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 2,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 5,000 yuan. Bicycles, handcarts, and other similar vehicles are the same as rickshaws. The penalties for vendors are also the same as for rickshaws. Other violations of the first category of fines shall be fined 2,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 5,000 to 20,000 yuan.

(Notes) Those without a license or without a passing inspection certificate shall be punished in the same way as those without a license. Article 86 of the Land Traffic Regulations, all those involved in "piling up goods" shall be punished according to the second category of fines, and the rest shall be punished according to the first category of fines. For fines levied on violations not listed in this table, the fine shall not be lower than the minimum amount listed in the table or exceed the maximum amount. For cases where there are special provisions for violations, the amount of the fine shall be punished in accordance with the special provisions.

Commendations and Awards for Directors of Four Branches

Director Zhou, who is also the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to encourage his subordinates to work hard, has successively promoted general police officers who have performed well on weekdays. Recently, due to the commendable work of Shi Sijian, director of the Taishan branch, Yao Benyuan, director of the Changning Central branch, Li Guohua, director of the New City branch, and Yao Ruifeng, director of the Jing'an Temple branch, Shi Sijian and Yao Benyuan were each awarded one major merit, and Li Guohua and Yao Ruifeng were each promoted to first-class police officers as an incentive.

### Chen Shilong Comes to Shanghai

Mr. Chen Jun, Minister of Industry and Commerce and Secretary-General of the Materials Control Review Committee, came to Shanghai from Nanjing the other day.

It is understood that Chen's visit is to discuss and instruct relevant parties in Shanghai on promoting wartime economic policies, strongly suppressing market prices, reorganizing various control agencies, strengthening materials review work, and improving the organization of industrial and commercial associations.

Strengthening the Institutional Issues of the Five Control Committees

The National Commercial Control Federation and the five control committees for rice, flour, oil, cotton, and daily necessities have been established for more than a year since their reorganization in July last year. A plan has long been discussed on strengthening the institutional issues of the various committees and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. According to reporters, this entire major case of control administration has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan and is still being studied and considered by the Materials Control Review Committee, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and other relevant authorities. It is heard that Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's visit to Shanghai this time may have a mission to liaise and negotiate on the issue of materials control administration.

### Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Injections Begins

The Municipal Government of this city, due to the arrival of summer and the rampant outbreak of cholera, organized a cholera inoculation team and provided free injections and issued certificates to protect the health of citizens. Now that the second injection has begun, a notice has been issued to all police officers and citizens to voluntarily receive the injection. Those who violate the regulations will be investigated.

### Construction Bureau Merges Affiliated Institutions

Since its establishment, the Municipal Construction Bureau has established offices in northern Shanghai, southwestern Shanghai, Pudong, and the city center to carry out construction work and has selected appropriate locations to set up vehicle and ship registration offices for citizens to apply. For pier management, it is divided into six areas for management to facilitate supervision and command. It is learned that in order to adapt to the current actual situation and save treasury expenditures, starting in August, the existing institutions will be tightened and readjusted. The results of the investigation are as follows: The South City Office will be abolished, and the public works in the area will be directly handled by the bureau. Vehicle affairs will be handled by the Changxing Road Vehicle Registration Office, and ship affairs will be handled by the South City Pier Management Office. The City Center Office will be abolished. The Wusong Pier Management Office and the Vehicle and Ship Registration Office will be transferred to the Baoshan County Government. The Gongping Road Vehicle Registration Office will be abolished, and its affairs will be handled by the Jiangning Central Vehicle Registration Office. The Affairs Group of the North Shanghai Office and the Road Maintenance Team of the Pudong Office will be abolished, and engineering matters will be handled directly by the bureau. The West Shanghai Office will be changed to the West Shanghai Vehicle Registration Office. The Central Section Pier Management Office of Suzhou Creek will be abolished, and its affairs will be taken over by the East and West Sections Pier Management Offices of Suzhou Creek. The asphalt crushing plant and the workers' technical night school will be closed. It is learned that the employees of various factories and parks will be streamlined as much as possible within a possible scope, and it is heard that the municipal government will give severance pay to all laid-off employees in the future.

### Bank and Money Exchange House Customer Deposits: Stipulated Withdrawal Periods, Earlier Check Clearing Time

The Shanghai Silver and Money Exchange Association, based on a decision made at a joint meeting, has decided that, starting July 30th, the check clearing time for silver and money businesses will be uniformly moved earlier to 9:00 AM daily. Furthermore, revisions have been made to the times and methods for receiving checks, returning checks, clearing, and entrusting exchanges, which have been circulated to all members for compliance. In addition, three regulations have been stipulated for customers of various money exchange houses and banks, which will also be implemented simultaneously on the aforementioned date.

The time for all members to receive customer deposits of checks will be the same as their business hours (9:00 AM to 1:00 PM).

Checks deposited by customers into banks and money exchange houses can only be credited to the account on the following day. With the exception of returned checks due to insufficient funds, all check amounts can only be withdrawn on the third day. (For example, if a check amount is deposited on Monday, it can only be withdrawn on Wednesday; if a check amount is deposited on Saturday, it can only be withdrawn on the following Tuesday.)

Customers of all businesses can also pre-deposit unmatured checks with banks and money exchange houses for collection before the maturity date, and the account will still be credited on the check's maturity date.

According to a financial insider who spoke to the reporter, the implementation of the next-day check clearing system by silver and money businesses is purely because the number of checks has increased daily, making it impossible to clear and reconcile excess funds daily. This system is implemented as a remedy. The reason for advancing the clearing time is that each bank and money exchange house prepares the checks from the previous day in advance, and with ample time, 9:00 AM is considered an appropriate clearing time. However, customers must note that funds can only be withdrawn starting on the third day from the date of deposit. It is hoped that customers of all banks and money exchange houses will pay special attention to this. If funds are deposited on Monday and withdrawn on Tuesday, they will undoubtedly be rejected. As for customers who can pre-deposit unmatured checks into banks and money exchange houses, the crediting date must wait until the maturity date of the check.

Brief Commentary

### Expectations for Wealthy Merchants and Traders

Yesterday, the social service department of this newspaper received a donation of over 63 million yuan on behalf of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Suzhou private industrial and commercial sectors for air raid relief. We are deeply impressed by their concern from afar.

After receiving donations from all sectors of Jiangsu Province, we immediately felt that the benevolence of wealthy individuals residing in Shanghai is not as great as that of friends from afar. We have been collecting donations for eight days, and statistics show that the most common donations are below 100,000 yuan, indicating that the concern for public welfare is leaning towards the working class. Apart from a very few wealthy individuals who generously donate large sums, most wealthy merchants and traders are notoriously stingy and unwilling to show any compassion.

Everyone knows that there are countless extremely wealthy individuals in Shanghai today, with properties worth millions or more. If they could show a moment of benevolence and donate one-thousandth of their wealth to relieve people's suffering, a huge amount of funds could be raised immediately. It is estimated that the cost of air raid relief will require at least 200 million yuan, which may be difficult to raise without relying on larger donations. We sincerely hope that wealthy merchants and traders will open the door to convenience and donate some funds.

Reader Scholarship News

### "Family Doctor" Scholarship Movement to Be Expanded; Students Encouraged to Promote Sales During Summer Vacation

Since the launch of the "Family Doctor" scholarship movement, it has become widely popular in just three or four days, reminiscent of "Luoyang paper becomes expensive." In recent days, people from all walks of life have come to the office to purchase "Family Doctor," and some have even called to order books, indicating that this book is valued by the general public. We feel that the number of students participating in the fundraising campaign is only 300, which is too few, and therefore the effect has not been significant. According to our budget, we need 2,000 students to carry out the campaign separately in order to conclude it in a short period. We will send letters to various universities, colleges, and high schools within days, requesting the principals to select a large number of students to come to the office to discuss and jointly promote the campaign, taking advantage of the summer vacation to dedicate some time to fundraising for "Family Doctor." This is a meaningful and valuable endeavor for both public and private interests. For example, if one person sells 50 books and raises a total of 250,000 yuan in donations, each student can receive a subsidy of 125,000 yuan, and our newspaper's scholarship and youth work-study loan can also receive 125,000 yuan. This is truly a win-win situation. Students, being aware of the greater good, should remember this and come forward!

Donations for Scholarships Yesterday Reach Highest Record

Yesterday, donations for scholarships reached over 10 million yuan, the highest record since the start of the fundraising campaign this year. Among them, Mr. Zhu Mingyu's donation of over 9 million yuan, which he transferred from gifts intended for his birthday celebration, was the largest amount. Mr. Zhu's dedication to scholarships and his extraordinary generosity are deeply admired by colleagues. His relatives and friends who generously contributed to the celebration and dedicated everything to charitable causes are also deeply appreciated, not just by Mr. Zhu alone. In addition, Daxin Hè¨ donated 500,000 yuan, which was the sum of a customer's misplaced money and their own donation. Sun éç¥¥ was deeply moved after repeatedly reading our fundraising appeal and pledged to support a team, showing a sincere heart. Wan Tai Money Exchange and Huafeng Bank (jointly pledged by Mr. Li Chuanding and Mr. Zhou Jun) each pledged a team, responding to the call for all banks and money exchange houses to jointly support scholarships, living up to the expectations of our newspaper colleagues, which is truly commendable. There are many other team pledges, which will not be listed individually, and sincere thanks are given.
