### Truman Hopes Marshall Will Facilitate Unity and Cooperation in China

[United Press International, Washington, 7th] President Truman stated today that he hopes General Marshall's mission to China will facilitate unity and cooperation among Chinese political parties. The President stated at a press conference that there would be no opportunity to consult with Secretary of State Byrnes regarding instructions for the newly appointed special envoy. Asked about Brigadier General Hurley's accusation that Undersecretary of State Acheson had undermined American foreign policy in Iran, Truman said he did not believe the case to be so. The President also instructed that he would soon send a message to Congress requesting approval of a loan of $4.4 billion to Britain. Truman also stated that he had not yet received a request from the Soviet Union for a loan of $6.2 billion from the United States. The President also announced that he would appoint a committee in the near future to investigate the situation in Palestine.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th Dispatch] Marshal Marshall is still testifying before the Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee and his departure date from the United States is not yet known.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] MacArthur's headquarters stated: MacArthur met yesterday with General Wedemeyer, General Baber, and Fifth Fleet Commander Towers to formulate recommendations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

### Byrnes Publicly Declares US Policy Goal: To Develop a Strong, Unified, and Democratic China

[United Press International, Washington, 8th] The full text of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee is as follows:

During the war, the primary goal of the United States in China was to promote military unity among all political groups, thereby adding their combined strength to our common enemy, Japan. Our more distant goal was to develop a strong, unified, and democratic China. This goal was, and remains, at least equally important.

To achieve this more distant goal, the Chinese central government and all parties must be open and honest and use compromise to resolve all disputes. We believe, as we have always believed and insisted, that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's government provides the most satisfactory foundation for the development of democracy. However, we also believe that this government must be expanded to include representatives of all groups that are broadly organized and that do not yet have a voice in the Chinese government.

The solution to the problem depends mainly on the sincerity and goodwill of the Chinese leaders themselves. If our influence is a factor, then success or failure depends on how we use that influence to encourage the central government, the so-called Communist Party, and other parties to compromise with each other.

We officially recognize only the National Government, and our ambassador is the ambassador to the National Government. Our military supplies and economic assistance have always been given only to the National Government. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek represented China at the Cairo Conference. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government signed the United Nations Charter at the San Francisco Conference. The National Government ratified the Charter. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government attended the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

In recent weeks, the need for our troops to remain in China has become a cause of concern for the American public, which is understandable. Therefore, this issue has often been raised in my meetings with the press. I have made it very clear that the sole purpose of our troops in China is, according to the orders of the Supreme Allied Commander, to facilitate the surrender of large numbers of Japanese troops to the National Government forces.

These are just a few of the many public evidences that we recognize the government of Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate government of China.

General Hurley's statement to this committee that the President and I refused to grant his request to issue such a public statement compels me to add a few words. We can tell you that in all the documents preserved in the State Department, I have never known the Ambassador to have made such a request. Furthermore, he had several conversations with the President after returning home in September, and I was also present, and I did not hear him make this request.

I do not know Acheson or Service personally, but because Ambassador Hurley made specific criticisms of them, I was able to read Acheson's telegram of February 28 of this year and Service's memorandum of October 10 of last year. These two documents, in Hurley's view, seemed to be strong evidence that they were obstructing the accomplishment of American goals in China.

Whether Acheson's telegram was appropriate must be judged in the context of the situation in China before the telegram was sent. Like his predecessor, Ambassador Gauss, Ambassador Hurley had worked to promote unity, not only between the National Government and the so-called Communist Party, but also between the National Government and other opposition parties. On February 19 of this year, when Ambassador Hurley left for the United States, he told me that negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communists were almost on the verge of breaking down.

After Ambassador Hurley left Chongqing, the post of Ambassador was automatically assumed by Acheson's advisor. On February 28—nine days after Hurley left Chongqing and three days before arriving in Washington—according to State Department records, Acheson sent a telegram on that day. In this telegram, he made a broad and profound analysis of the rapidly changing situation in China. The telegram concluded: "In order to adapt to the drastic changes in the environment, we must adjust America's current strategy." The telegram also explicitly stated: "The most appropriate time for discussing this issue is when General Wedemeyer and Hurley are in Washington to propose a solution."

Since September, we have always relied on the reports of personnel stationed at the Chinese Embassy. Acheson's telegram of February 28 was a complete and free report on the current situation in China. His suggestion was indeed an honest effort to help the State Department formulate future policy toward China, and there was absolutely nothing to indicate that he was trying to deceive his superiors. On the contrary, this telegram strongly suggested that Hurley's opinion should be sought on this matter. Service's action was a preparation for the memorandum of October 10, 1944, which Hurley mentioned in his conversation with me, and which I also carefully reviewed. When Service drafted this memorandum, he was not working at the Chongqing Embassy, although he still held diplomatic status. He was merely a political observer stationed in Yan'an by General Stilwell. At that time, he belonged to Stilwell and not to the Embassy. At that time, Hurley was serving as the President's personal representative to China in the capacity of ambassador, but he was not the American Ambassador to China, nor was he in charge of the American Embassy in Chongqing. Under these circumstances, we can say that what Service wrote did not constitute disobedience to Hurley. The memorandum itself proposed a fundamental change in the United States' policy toward the central government of China. The content was strong in tone, and the conclusion was quite radical.

This recommendation was written for Stilwell and also sent to the Chongqing Embassy. The Embassy sent the recommendation to the State Department without endorsing its conclusions, but added a note stating that this recommendation only represented the opinion of a political observer.

When this annotated memorandum arrived at the State Department, it was immediately forwarded to the China Affairs Group. Before further circulation, the China Affairs Group attached another memorandum, firmly stating that many of the conclusions were incorrect. There is no evidence here that Acheson and Service were in any way disloyal to their superiors. In fact, they were merely expressing opinions to their superiors, in a proper manner, that differed from the current government policy.

Another accusation by Ambassador Hurley is that some officials or employees not only expressed opinions to their superiors, but also told certain people who had contact with the Communist Party that the Ambassador did not accurately represent the American position. This behavior is, of course, unforgivable, and I will be the first to punish and dismiss officials who commit this crime. But Ambassador Hurley has not presented any evidence to me or to this committee to indicate that any employee has committed this crime. Anyone who loyally serves the government must not be dismissed because of someone's private suspicion, thereby suffering a significant loss of reputation. I do not want to hear of any State Department official who, fearing to offend another person in this department, avoids presenting honest reports and suggestions in a proper manner. If that day comes, then I will lose all the assistance and guidance that is sufficient for me to successfully perform my important duties.

### Material Storage and Transportation Bureaus to be Established in Six Cities including Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Qingdao

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration of the Executive Yuan plans to establish post-war relief material storage and transportation bureaus in six locations: Shanghai, Kowloon, Qingdao, Tianjin, Dalian, and Hankou. Active preparations are underway, and the heads of each bureau have now been determined. Sun Jiayu will head the Shanghai Bureau, with Huang Hongdao as deputy head; Zeng Guangzhi will head the Kowloon Bureau; Niu Zequan will head the Tianjin Bureau, with Sun Qingbo as deputy head; Wu Yinglun will head the Qingdao Bureau; Chen Defen will head the Dalian Bureau; and Cai Kequan will head the Hankou Bureau.

### Finance Minister Yu's Statement: US Consulted Me on the Lifting of Capital Controls

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Regarding the US Treasury Department's announcement of the lifting of the current control regulations on financial and commercial dealings with the United Nations, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun recently issued the following statement: When the US Treasury Department decided to lift capital controls on the funds of the United Nations in the United States, it consulted the opinion of our government. We immediately formally replied to the US Treasury Department, stating that all assets of Chinese citizens already frozen in the United States and their interest should continue to be frozen and not be used without the consent of the Chinese government. However, regular transactions by Chinese citizens with foreign countries in the future should not be restricted. Furthermore, assets and interest obtained by Chinese citizens after the promulgation of the new US Treasury Department decree will also not be frozen. The US Treasury Department has fully agreed with our position, and the new decree will take effect on December 7 of this year.

### Chongqing to Hold City-Wide General Election at the End of This Month

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The schedule for the Chongqing popular election has been announced. The election of district people's representatives will be held from the 14th to the 15th. The list of eligible voters and candidates for the municipal councilors will be announced from the 13th to the 15th, as well as the confirmed number of councilors.

### 36,000 Personnel Returning to the Capital; 6,000 Workers to Be Transported First to Expedite Railway Repairs

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 8th] The National Ship Allocation Committee has approved the eastward transport of approximately 36,000 personnel from various agencies and organizations in Chongqing. The most urgent of these are approximately 6,000 unemployed workers from the city. The highest authorities have personally ordered their expedited transport to various recovered areas to undertake railway repair work. Over ten thousand soldiers and over one thousand initial personnel returning to the capital from various agencies have been listed as secondary priorities. The committee currently controls five ships on the Chongqing-Yichang section, capable of transporting 16,000 people per day. There are only a dozen or so ships on the Yichang-Hankou section, transporting approximately 13,000 people per month. Currently, the river water is depleted, making work extremely difficult.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The first batch of 158 personnel returning to the capital to work arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 8th, aboard four China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Over one hundred staff members of the Ministry of Communications are scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 9th. It is reported that the main focus of the ministry's work will shift to Nanjing from the 16th, with the remaining personnel in Chongqing gradually moving eastward in batches. Vice Minister Ling Hongxun, Chief Secretary Wang Yihe, and Department Chief Sa Fuhui, among others, will fly to Nanjing on the 15th.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Roads in various regions are being actively repaired. It is learned that the 2,994-kilometer road from Chongqing to Nanjing has recently been repaired and opened to traffic.

### Weng Wenhao Reports on the Situation of Recovery and Handling in the Recovered Areas at the Standing Committee of the Political Participation Council

Comparing the actual situations, the scale and success of Japanese management in Central China are far inferior to those in North China. The total capital of the North China Development Company was 500 million Japanese yen, with over 1.5 billion yen in bonds issued, and approval for the issuance of over 3 billion yen in debentures. The principal and interest of the bonds were guaranteed by the Japanese government. The company's headquarters were in Tokyo, Japan, with branches in Beiping and Zhangjiakou, and offices in Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Taiyuan, and other places. The organization in Beiping was the most complete. The important projects invested in by the North China Development Company, briefly stated, include the North China Transportation Company (capital: 400 million pseudo-Federal Reserve Bank notes), the North China Telecommunications Company (capital: 100 million yen), the North China Electric Power Company (capital: 300 million yen), the Datong Coal Industry Company (capital: 120 million yen), and the North China Iron Manufacturing Company (capital: 100 million yen). It also invested in the establishment of the Shandong Mining Company, and various coal companies or associations in Jingxing, Cixian, Jiaozuo, Zhongxing, Dawenkou, Xintai, Liuquan, Shanxi, and Daqingshan, as well as the North China Coal Sales Company, the North China Alumina Company, the Light Metal Company, the Salt Industry Company, the Electrolysis Company, the Chemical Industry Association, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Company, the Fiber Control Association, the Shanxi Industry Association, the Mongolia-Tibet Electric Power Association, the Mineral Products Sales Association, and other business organizations. Among the established businesses, those worthy of attention include, for example, in the area of electric power, the Japanese newly established a 60,000 kW power plant in Beiping, a 50,000 kW power plant in Tianjin, and a 50,000 kW power plant near the Tangshan coal industry, and they have also established long-distance transmission lines, connecting these three extremely important power sources into a network. Although some of the equipment has yet to be completed, this power interconnection method increases strength, reduces costs, and is truly in line with the principles of modern power, serving as a model for our country's new-style power. The Japanese side deeply believes that North China has abundant resources and the need to develop large-scale electric power, so during the war, power experts planned the Yellow River hydroelectric power plant, setting up eight stations from Hequ to Mengjin, with a total power generation capacity of 5.17 million kW. The Hutuo River and Yongding River can also generate hydroelectric power, and it is believed that only by building dams upstream to regulate the rivers can the downstream rivers follow a normal course and avoid flooding and siltation. It can be seen that this plan is of great importance to the livelihoods of the people of the north. In terms of textiles, the Japanese have conducted many tests on various qualities and have learned that coking coal and bituminous coal, in addition to Kailuan, Jingxing, Cixian, and Boshan, are also extremely valuable in Wulai and Xintai. Datong bituminous coal, although it needs to be blended to produce coke, is of high quality and abundant in quantity, which is extremely important. The Japanese have centered the iron and steel plants in Beiping, Qingdao, and Tangshan, but the production of steel rails has not yet been implemented. In terms of the construction of Shandong alumina, the Japanese planned to use it to make aluminum oxide and built a factory in Nanding, most of which has been completed, transporting the aluminum oxide to Japan for aluminum production. From these examples, it can be seen that the Japanese policy focuses on production in our country, only to the level of raw materials or semi-finished products, while the final refining process, to become practically useful products, is left to the Japanese mainland. This colonial policy of control was originally valued by the Japanese. Regarding transportation, Tianjin is an important port in North China, but the siltation of Dagukou has increased, with a depth of only four feet this summer, which is worrying for the future of Tianjin. For improvement, the Japanese have dug another canal leading to Tanggu, deepening the channel and strengthening the port, which is an essential strategy for creating a large port in the north and is worthy of continued completion. Overall, the methods used by the Japanese in North China and Central China emphasize centralized organization and large-scale operation. Centralization increases strength and efficiency, while large-scale operation increases output and reduces costs. This is the direction that modern business operations should take and can serve as a reference for our country's future development. (To be continued)

### Failed Attempts to Attack Guihua and Baotou; He Long Requests Reinforcements from Yan'an; Overseas Chinese Groups in the Provisional Capital Telegraph to Request Curbing Communist Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] According to reliable sources, He Long, having failed to attack Guihua and Baotou, telegraphed Yan'an requesting an increase of 300,000 troops. Mao Zedong convened a meeting to discuss the request and decided to send 150,000 reinforcements. However, due to insufficient troop allocation, a large number of elite troops will be transferred from various places in eastern Gansu and northern Shaanxi, while also attempting to open up Yulin to transport troops.

[Central News Agency, Guihua, 6th] Since gathering in the northern mountains of Baotou, the Communist army has been extensively intercepting grain and coal transported by people from Shigou and the back mountains. In addition, He Long personally led two regiments of guards, moving eastward from the northern mountains of Baotou, with unclear intentions. Gunfire has been incessant in the suburbs of Guihua in recent days, especially intense at night.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Overseas Chinese groups in the provisional capital jointly commemorated the fourth anniversary of the Pacific War on the 8th and resolved to telegraph the government requesting a clear order to curb the Communist rebellion, which is undermining unity.

### Last Supper at Wang Shijing's Residence; Situation of Arresting Traitors in Beiping; Zhou Zuoren Denies Being a Traitor

After the dinner, all the traitors present were arrested. Those who did not attend were arrested by the military police overnight in separate actions. Wang Yintai was arrested at his home. After Japan surrendered, he rushed to print a collection of speeches by Mr. Meng Qun, listing all his statements that could be construed as complicit. When Wang Kemin was arrested, he collapsed and had to be helped onto a reclining chair and into a car by four people. Wang Yitang has been ill since the 6th and is staying in Room 127, a first-class ward, at the Central Hospital, where guards have been assigned. Zhou Zuoren firmly denies being a traitor. The authorities' standard for arresting traitors this time is to only consider their actions. As of now, more than 70 people have been arrested in Beiping and Tianjin. The traitors in Beiping are being held in three locations, including the former residence of Shi Huan and the Yuan Family Garden. It is reported that their living conditions are comfortable, except for the suffering of some addicts. The authorities stated that once the investigation of their rebellious and egregious acts is clear, they will be handed over to the court for trial.

### Sunday Forum: Atomic Energy and China's Future

— Zhao Zengjue

1.  The Importance of the Atomic Bomb

The atomic bomb mobilized the most outstanding scientists from the United States, Britain, and Canada. Two atomic bombs destroyed the two large cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, prompting Japan's collapse. The atomic bomb made the Soviet Union suspicious and uneasy, and made British and American leaders travel extensively to discuss it. The atomic bomb caused the U.S. Congress to organize a special committee to study how to deal with it, and the United Nations to organize a special committee to handle its custody. The atomic bomb changed future tactics, shook every corner of the world, and opened a new era of science. The position of oil and coal, which have controlled the world's power source for a hundred years, is likely to be replaced by atomic energy, causing a shake-up. In short, since the first atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima, the 20th century has stepped into the new atomic age. The political, military, industrial, and lifestyle of the entire world may soon undergo significant changes. The atomic bomb not only opened a new era for the world but also represents the comprehensive crystallization of the world's scientific progress!

2.  A Brief History of the Atomic Bomb

To talk about the history of the atomic bomb, one must trace back to the discovery and research of radioactive atoms. Radioactive atoms that have been discovered on Earth include Uranium, Thorium, Polonium, Radium, Radon, and many other types, all of which automatically have continuous radioactivity. In fact, other elements that were not originally radioactive can also become radioactive after being bombarded by radioactive elements. Among them, uranium and radium are the most important. The uranium used in atomic bombs today was discovered earliest, by the French scientist Becquerle in 1896. Later, because everyone's attention was focused on radium research, uranium remained anonymous for many years.

Various radioactive elements are not very stable. Their atomic nuclei are originally composed of a certain number of positive protons, negative electrons, and neutral neutrons. (It is generally believed that a neutron is a close combination of a proton and an electron.) However, because radioactive X-rays (rays composed of four protons and two electrons) and B-rays (electron rays) are emitted, the atomic nucleus gradually becomes lighter, forming various isotopes, such as radium with R-226, R-224, R-206, etc., and uranium with U-238, U-235, U-234, etc. According to the opinion of general scientists, radium is actually formed from the continuous transmutation of uranium, and uranium can also be transmuted into aluminum. All heavier elements can be transmuted into lighter elements.

When radium radiates, the surrounding temperature is four to five degrees higher than room temperature, which is a kind of radiation ability. Roughly, one gram of radium can generate 300,000 calories of heat when completely radiated. Various radioactive substances continue to lose energy, dispersing into radiation, heat, and light. Each gram of substance contains about 9 followed by 20 zeros ergs of energy. However, the radiation time is very long, such as 3,200 years for radium and 920 million years for uranium. The energy radiated in each unit of time is not much. But the reason why radium can treat cancer is because its radiation can destroy cell tissue. Therefore, it must be used very cautiously to avoid harming the human body, its power is already considerable. If the energy accumulated for a long time is completely released at once, its power would be astounding, and its destructiveness can be imagined.

Because scientists wanted to utilize this huge energy and also wanted to accelerate the transmutation of elements, they tried to break the atom, so that the potential energy accumulated in the atomic nucleus would immediately become kinetic energy. The reason for using uranium is that uranium-235 (U-235) is very unstable and relatively easy to break, and the production of potassium is also relatively abundant, about one million times that of radium. Various countries have been conducting research in this area for more than ten years. The original motivation was of course to use this inexhaustible source of power to replace the gradually depleting coal and oil. Unfortunately, the war broke out, and thus the atomic bomb was born, appearing before industrial applications. It is estimated that one pound of uranium-235 is equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT explosives. The problem is to extract uranium-235 in large quantities.

When Britain was in turmoil in 1940, British scientists were quite confident in the research of the atomic bomb. Therefore, they consulted with the United States and moved this group of scientists to the safer United States, using American scientific equipment and the rich uranium of Great Bear Lake in Canada to continue research. As a result, they caught up with the Axis powers and invented the atomic bomb first.

It is said that the research and manufacture of the atomic bomb cost a total of 200 million US dollars and mobilized 65,000 workers. Among them, our country has a female scientist, Dr. Wu Jianxiong, who was researched by Nobel Prize winner Lawrence and made indirect contributions. During the first test, the organizers were deeply afraid that the radiation would cause nitrogen and gas in the air to combine in large quantities, resulting in a shortage of gas in the world. The test results were not like this, and this fear disappeared. The effect of the atomic bomb is not only to generate huge explosive power, one atomic bomb is equivalent to 20,000 tons of explosives, making the ground architecture, but also rupturing the internal structure of all living things.

3.  The of Atomic

The appearance of the atomic bomb overwhelmed all other weapons, and the entire tactics will be greatly changed. A country only needs to have a small number of air forces, carrying atomic bombs, to launch a night attack on another country. The attacked country can immediately fall into a miserable and desperate situation. All factories and flora and fauna are destroyed, transportation and production are completely stopped, tanks become fragments, cannons turn into dust, and steel-armored fleets are as useless as paper boats. The powerful army is immediately isolated and helpless, everything is over. In short, striking first is the key. One atomic bomb can put the enemy country in a state of eternal destruction.

Since the destructiveness of the atomic bomb is so great, there is currently no appropriate defense method in the world. If this atomic bomb falls into the hands of aggressors, the world will never have peace. Therefore, the world is in panic, either demanding to announce this secret or seeking appropriate custody. Our country's position is that if this secret can be kept by the United States forever, it may not be impossible, because she is not used to invade but to protect peace. But whether the secret can be kept permanently is a problem. Scientific progress is endless, and for countries aspiring to science, the discovery of this secret is only a matter of time. So-called management can only temporarily maintain the secret of the advanced countries' atomic bomb manufacturing methods, but it cannot prevent scientific efforts from countries' research and success!

The use of atomic energy in industry will soon be realized. It is said that if a small piece of uranium-235 is placed in a water-filled container, a large amount of water vapor will be continuously generated, which is more durable and cheaper than using other fuels. The only unresolved issues are how to handle uranium-235 safely, how to obtain uranium-235 as cheap as gasoline or coal, and whether other abundant and cheap atomic energy can be utilized. We know that the reason why Britain is so rich and powerful now is because she was the first to industrialize; the reason why the United States is so rich and powerful now is because she was the first to mass-produce. Therefore, any country that can first apply atomic energy to industry will also take the lead on the road to wealth and strength. This is also one of the reasons why other countries demand the disclosure of atomic secrets. [Continued on Page 2]

### U.S., British, and Soviet Foreign Ministers' Meeting to Be Held in Moscow on the 15th of This Month to Discuss Controlling the Secrets of Atomic Energy

[United Press, Washington, 8th] The State Department officially announced today that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to hold a meeting in Moscow on the 15th of this month to exchange views on the management of atomic energy. Secretary of State Byrnes is expected to leave early next week to meet with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the agreed date. The meeting will also discuss other issues, including: (1) the Iranian issue, (2) the United Nations' control of Japan, (3) the Chinese unity issue, and (4) getting the European peace plan on track.

[Reuters, London, 8th] It was confirmed last night that the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to meet in Moscow on December 15th. The meeting is expected to discuss the situation in China and the control of Japan, but their main task is to discuss the disclosure and control of atomic secrets and to eliminate Soviet concerns about this. According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, other issues that are expected to be discussed are: (1) the international repercussions of the situation in China, (2) Far East issues (management of Japan and peaceful settlement), (3) Iran, and (4) general discussions on European peace agreements. The underlying intention of the Moscow meeting is clearly to create the best possible atmosphere between the major powers and to enable the major powers to agree on a common policy on major issues and to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations. London pointed out that the meeting of the three foreign ministers does not contradict or deviate from the principle of mutual consultation among the five foreign ministers. Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the meeting should by no means be regarded as a three-nation "collusion" aimed at imposing pre-agreed resolution methods on the rest of the United Nations.

### The Supreme Authority of the British Army Decides to Increase Troops in Java to Help the Netherlands Restore Sovereignty in the Dutch East Indies

[United Press, Batavia, 8th] The supreme authority here announced today that Britain has decided to continue transferring troops to Java to maintain law and order and restore Dutch sovereignty over the Dutch East Indies. This decision will end Britain's policy of compromise with the leaders of the East Indies independence movement. It is heard that it was decided at a meeting in Singapore this week between Mountbatten and the British, French, and Dutch commanders. Well-informed sources said that the planned plan requires the use of a large number of Dutch troops and British reinforcements.

[Reuters, Batavia, 8th] A hand grenade exploded near the hangar of the airport here yesterday, only 15 yards away from several British officers. The Allied authorities are very concerned about this. Indonesian troops from Semarang are advancing towards the airport there. When an air force personnel flew there yesterday morning, he saw Indonesian artillery shelling an area only one and a half miles from the airport.

### The Indian Political Situation is About to Have a New Development

Gandhi to Meet with Wavell on Monday

[Central News Agency, Calcutta, 7th] British and Indian political figures are currently using Calcutta as a meeting center to seek new developments in the Indian political situation.

An Allied spokesman said that this demonstration was held around the city government (where military supplies are also stored), so its target was the mayor, not the Allied forces.

### Konoe, the Culprit of the Invasion of China, Has Committed Unforgivable Crimes

Used the Pacific Society to Promote an International Propaganda Plan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] It was reported last night that MacArthur ordered the arrest of Konoe Fumimaro, who is to be tried as a war criminal, had used the Japanese branch of the well-known Pacific Society organization to engage in a large-scale international propaganda plan during an important period between the September 18th Incident and the Pacific War. Konoe placed figures from his trusted "think tank" in key positions to gain control of the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society. The so-called think tank included Tsurumi Yusuke and Ushiba, etc. During Konoe's three terms as prime minister, Japan made three of the most important national policy decisions that led to the outbreak of the Pacific War. At that time, Ushiba served as the prime minister's private secretary and the chief secretary of the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society. Therefore, during the historically significant period of Konoe's tenure as prime minister, there was a very close connection between the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society and the Japanese Cabinet. The funds for the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society came from donations from the business community through Saionji Kinmochi (the deceased elder statesman), who had a close relationship with Konoe. Konoe also appointed Saionji Kimikazu, the grandson of Saionji Kinmochi, as the secretary of the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society. Mitsubishi and Mitsui and other companies also made donations. Konoe was able to contact many prestigious visitors to Japan through the Pacific Society's connections. After Japan's invasion of Northeast China began, Konoe, as president of Tokyo University of Commerce, had Sadajiro Ueda write a very lengthy report explaining the theory of "Japan feeling population pressure." At the end of 1936, when the World Pacific Society met in California, the Japanese branch of the Pacific Society presented Ueda's report to the conference, which made many world economists believe that Japan's foreign expansion was a natural and reasonable trend. When the "China Incident" began and evolved into war, Konoe again sent Saionji Kimikazu as his special envoy to China, ostensibly to explore whether peace was possible, but in reality to scout out the Chinese leaders' preparations for resistance and how prepared they were. He consulted with Song Ziwen and reported to the government after returning to Japan that China was prepared for a long-term resistance war, and warned the Japanese government that it should send a large number of troops in order to end the China Incident as soon as possible. Konoe apparently immediately decided to send a large number of troops, and thus the war broke out.

### Trials of Japanese War Criminal Groups to Begin Next January

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th, United Press] The chief prosecutor announced that the group trials of suspected Japanese war criminals are scheduled to begin next January.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] Three hundred Japanese war criminals accused of abusing prisoners of war are scheduled to be tried in Yokohama on the 17th.

### Japanese House of Peers Members: 29 War Criminals

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Twenty-nine members of the Japanese House of Peers have been ordered by MacArthur's headquarters to be considered war criminals and should be imprisoned. Count Sakai Tadamasa, the vice-chairman of the House, has submitted his resignation to Marquis Tokugawa Iesato, the chairman of the House.

### Rumor: A Soviet Division Will Open in Japan Next Spring

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a Tokyo broadcast on the 8th, a spokesman for the Allied Headquarters in Japan said today that the rumor that a Soviet division will arrive in Japan early next year is very well-founded. However, MacArthur's design and operations team said that they have not received any information on this matter.

The accomplices of the enemy were the Rice Control Association and the general traitorous military rice merchants. Therefore, the farmers rose up to report them. Ye Jiugao, the director of the Rice Control Association, has been arrested by the county and is being strictly guarded, awaiting investigation. As for Gu Yangchu, the military rice merchant in Huayangqiao, he has already fled elsewhere, and the rice shop he set up in the area has been sealed off by personnel.

### Sunday Forum: Atomic Energy and China's Future

— Zhao Huijue

(Continued from Page 1)

4.  Our Country Should Study Atomic Energy

Our country is a scientifically backward country. The Father of the Nation once loudly called on the people to catch up. But to date, how much have we caught up? Are we catching up head-on? To talk about catching up, we must make more efforts in science from now on, everyone must make efforts! To talk about catching up head-on, we must call on outstanding scientists across the country to study the secrets of atomic energy from now on! The physicist specializing in radioactivity, such as the aforementioned Ms. Wu, should also be recalled, and a special college should be established for planned research. The importance of this research can also be divided into two aspects: military and industrial.

Our country's military equipment manufacturing is originally backward. Even if we make a sudden effort to catch up, we will not be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with other countries in a short period of time. However, the atomic bomb occupies the most important part of military equipment. If we can research and manufacture it ourselves, the seriousness of the backwardness of military equipment can also be reduced. If we cannot manufacture atomic bombs ourselves in the future, it can be said that we have no national defense. In today's world where universal harmony has not been realized, it is really very dangerous, and the danger is increasing day by day. This does not mean that we do not need to study the rest besides the atomic bomb. For example, airplanes are also necessities for dropping atomic bombs, and other military equipment is also indispensable for maintaining law and order and for protracted warfare. But to be listed as one of the four powers, to maintain world peace, and to be decisive, we must have the ability to manufacture atomic bombs ourselves to be successful.

As for the industrial aspect, although our country is known as having a vast territory and abundant resources, it is actually a barren land with poor people. Coal, the source of power, is said to be spread throughout the provinces, but the wide distribution does not necessarily mean abundant reserves. According to investigations, the reserves account for only 6% of the world's total. As for oil reserves, they are even more negligible, and whether there will be new discoveries in the future is a question. It is difficult to develop large-scale industries with such a scarce source of power. But with cheap and inexhaustible atomic energy, the development of industry is very promising. Moreover, our country's production of various other industrial raw materials is not complete. If we can use atomic energy to transmute substances, the problem of lack of raw materials can also be easily solved.

Recently, the United States has also invented the extraction of atomic energy from hydrogen. (Or it is heavy hydrogen containing two protons.) It is also heard that they are studying the use of cosmic rays to break atomic nuclei. In short, atomic science is only just beginning now, and there is no end in sight to the path of progress. It is not too late to catch up as soon as possible. It is hoped that the country will cultivate more scientists on this most important issue, and that scientists will also study diligently and make continuous efforts, without being complacent. Make further progress and enable our country to occupy a position in world atomic science. After eight years of hard fighting, our country has sacrificed countless lives and properties and sacrificed the happiness of countless people. It was easy to raise our international status. With the current status, if scientists cannot catch up head-on in atomic energy research, the status of a strong country will not be maintained. Therefore, our country must catch up head-on and study atomic energy to seek self-improvement and maintain world peace. I would like to encourage all Chinese people to do so.

### Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua Reports: Enemy Revised Textbooks to Implement Enslavement Education

Middle and Primary School Students to be Treated with Leniency; Emphasis on Thought Examination and Investigation

[Chongqing Airmail Report from Our Newspaper] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, at a press conference held in the ministry's conference room a few days ago, reported his impressions of inspecting education in the recovered areas, stating:

Inclined Toward the Motherland

Most of the teachers and students in the recovered areas, under the eight-year control of the enemy, although physically deprived of freedom, still ardently leaned toward the motherland. Although the enemy spared no effort to revise textbooks at all levels to implement enslavement education, the results were nil. In the occupied areas, schools were required to raise the puppet flag every morning as usual, but except for those who were monitored and forced to comply, most used the school flag instead. He deeply felt that during the eight years of the war of resistance, although the land was occupied, the spirit was not. Moreover, most intellectuals in the occupied areas continued to carry out psychological resistance.

Turned Back Midway

Unfortunately, there were also many practical difficulties. Schools in various places could not relocate inland. A small number of colleges and universities were obstructed by funding during the inland relocation, and had to turn back midway, which is truly admirable. Based on the above situation, in addition to the resolutions of the National Education Post-War Rehabilitation Conference, the rationalization of education in the recovered areas still requires detailed research. Those professors or students who willingly betrayed the country and surrendered to the enemy, if there is solid evidence, will still be severely punished. He conducted a detailed investigation during this inspection, with particular emphasis on faculty and professors and students above the college level.

Classes as Usual

As for middle and primary school students, it is necessary to "treat them with leniency," because the current middle school students were still primary school students during the war, and the current primary school students were still in their infancy and had no individual freedom at all. It is hoped that this point will also arouse the attention of all sectors. Middle and primary schools in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Beijing and other places are still ordered to hold classes as usual. Colleges and universities have successively established temporary university preparatory classes, all of which are presided over by special commissioners of the Ministry of Education. On the faculty side, the special commissioner temporarily employs faculty, mostly those who originally taught in schools in the occupied areas, but this is only temporary.

Examination Method

The examination method for students in the future will place special emphasis on the examination of thought. Second, those who score above 75 in the remedial courses (including Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, Party doctrine, President Chiang Kai-shek's thought, basic courses, and required courses) will be assigned to various public and private universities. Those who score above 60 will be free to apply to various private universities, but the academic program will be reduced by one year to achieve a balance with the level of students in the inland areas.

### Child Rehabilitation: Reducing Casualties and Damage

[Report from Our Chongqing Correspondent] The current urgent task of the China Joint Committee for Emergency Relief of War Zone Children is to focus on child rehabilitation work. The main points of its work plan are as follows: (1) Concentrate efforts to provide relief to children in the recovered areas; (2) Coordinate with post-war relief to handle child rehabilitation; (3) Mobilize social forces to expand the scope of work; (4) Improve emergency methods to reduce casualties and damage; (5) Mobilize local manpower to ensure the smooth progress of work; (6) Liaise with relevant agencies to achieve unified work; (7) Promote family subsidies to protect poor children; (8) Encourage adoption and foster care to promote a child-rearing atmosphere; (9) Implement technical training; (10) Replenish medical equipment to protect children's health.

### Brief News

### Friendly Football Match: The Final Act; Donghua vs. Xuhui; Today at 3:00 PM at Xuhui

The Sino-British Four-Team Friendly Football Tournament, hosted by Xuhui Middle School, with the participation of Donghua, Xuhui, Beifusi, Pan Maoda and other four teams, adopts a single round-robin system. Only the Donghua vs. Xuhui match remains at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Donghua has already defeated the two British military teams one after the other, while Xuhui has lost twice. Donghua's victory is almost certain. However, Donghua will not have the services of two star players, Jia Youliang and Sun Jinshun, today, and will be replaced by Lin Wenhu and Shen Jinda, which will inevitably weaken its strength. On the Xuhui side, although Mailson is absent from Shanghai, Meng Yiliang is resolutely helping, and the strength has increased rather than decreased. Donghua must also be careful. The performance of both sides is expected to be exciting. Tickets are 100 yuan, which is intended as a restriction.

Volleyball: Starting at 3:30 PM, Aurora University won two consecutive games with two scores of 15 to 1.

### Education Funding

— Hu Xian

Any good education plan cannot be realized without funding. During these eight years of the war of resistance, the government knew the importance of education, but was constrained by the lack of funding, so it followed the wisdom of a clever housewife and cooked without rice. Due to inflation, the funding for various schools today is less than 1% of the original funding before the war. With the aim of producing shoddy goods in large quantities, it began to increase the number of new schools in large numbers, without ever considering the harm that this kind of shoddy education would cause. It is called giving young people educational opportunities, but in fact, it is delaying young people to an unknown degree. This is the harm of running education without raising sufficient funds.

However, it is still understandable during the war of resistance. After the end of the war, since it is advocated to build the country, we must raise as much education funding as possible so that education can gradually return to the right track and not repeat the mistakes of producing shoddy goods in large quantities. It must be known that today, in order to achieve industrial plans, cultivate cadres at all levels, and universalize national education, and to cultivate teachers and local self-government personnel at all levels that are necessary for the above, the increase in schools must be a hundred times that of today, and the funding must be ten million times that of today.

The government authorities must clearly recognize that in the process of building the country in the future, the importance of expanding education is definitely not less than that of completing industrial plans. To expand education, it is necessary to increase education funding as much as possible. There is a common saying in our country: "Don't leave even half a mu of land for teaching your children." This shows that the people of the country know the importance of education, and the government must also know that in order to achieve various national policies, it must have a similar determination to expand education and raise education funding as much as possible.

### Wu Shaoshu Talks about Recruiting New Party Members

[Central News Agency] Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, flew to Chongqing some time ago to report on his work, which lasted more than a month. He returned to Shanghai on the 7th after completing his official duties. Yesterday, the reporter visited Wu at the Shanghai City Party Headquarters and first inquired about the working policy of the Shanghai party affairs. He said that in the past party affairs in this city were unable to openly recruit party members under the violent oppression of the enemy and puppets, so the number of party members was relatively small compared to the city's population. In the future, the recruitment of party members will emphasize both quality and quantity. All outstanding individuals will be sought to be recruited into the party. Recently, in addition to registering old party members, it is also planned to recruit a large number of new party members so that the party's organization can penetrate into all levels of the city. At present, the focus of the party's work is to prepare for the implementation of constitutional government and to complete local self-government, and strengthening the grassroots organization is a prerequisite. Shanghai is the largest city in the country with a dense population. The Municipal Party Headquarters will definitely assist the government and engage in this work actively so as to lay the foundation for democratic politics as soon as possible. Then, he asked about the reasons for suddenly developing the intention to resign from the positions of Deputy Mayor and concurrently Director of the Social Affairs Bureau and requesting a resignation from the central government. He replied: "In the past, in Shanghai, in addition to serving as the Chief Posture of the Party Headquarters and the Director of the Corps, I also served as the Jiangsu Inspector, so I felt that I was heavily burdened and often crossed the line. However, it was a time of hardship, so I had to brave the difficulties and take risks without hesitation. Last winter, I received a secret order from the central government to concurrently serve as the Political Commissioner and Military Commissioner of this city, so I came to Shanghai at the beginning of the end of the war to discuss rehabilitation work. Taking care of all parties, the responsibilities were heavy, and I felt exhausted physically and mentally. I originally intended to get rid of all my concurrent positions and take a short break when the underground work was over. Unexpectedly, the central government entrusted me with the two positions of Deputy Mayor and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau. At that time, I thought that it was the beginning of the rehabilitation period, and the military and political leaders had not yet come to Shanghai, so it was difficult to resign. I have been working hard for the past three months and felt very tired. Now that all the work is on the right track, I took advantage of this trip to Chongqing to report on my work and repeatedly asked the central government to allow me to retire, and finally it agreed to let me resign from my administrative duties and continue to be responsible for the Corps work."

### Lu Jingshi Talks About: Relief for Unemployed Workers; A Comprehensive Plan Has Been Drafted

[Exclusive Report from Our Newspaper] Lu Jingshi, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs for Nanjing and Shanghai, returned to Shanghai from Chongqing a few days ago. According to a reporter's interview, a comprehensive plan for the relief of unemployed workers has been drafted and will be gradually implemented in the short term. This plan includes (1) distributing a large amount of flour, (2) implementing a large-scale work-for-relief program. Lu also said that according to statistics from the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee, there are more than 100,000 unemployed workers in this city. Lu continued: "I have already agreed with the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration that the association will allocate 9,000 tons of flour, which will be distributed to the workers by the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee. It is now set at 100,000 workers in principle, and each unemployed worker can receive an average of 66 pounds of flour per month. All the flour will be distributed in three months." Lu continued, "Relief for unemployed workers should be promoted simultaneously in both symptomatic and radical ways, so I have consulted with the competent authorities and business leaders in this city on the method of resuming work in various factories so that workers can have suitable jobs as soon as possible. The Ministry of Social Affairs has discussed suitable work-for-relief plans with the Municipal Government, the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and relevant groups in this city. I hope to be able to mobilize unemployed workers in this city in the short term to assist in various construction works in this city." Lu also said, "Regarding the issue of labor disputes, the Ministry of Social Affairs hopes that workers and industrialists can all appreciate President Chiang Kai-shek's principle of economic nation-building and work together in labor and management to increase production and strive for construction so that this city's industry can restore pre-war productivity in a stable state."

The responsible representatives of the two organizers temporarily announced that the venue would be used to host the National Army, and the three plays "Si Fan," "Shi Lian Deng," and "Broken Bridge" would be performed tonight specifically to host the Allied Forces. The representative expressed his apology to the Allied soldiers who were turned away for not stating in advance that tickets were required for numbered seating. As for the unused tickets last night, the representative said that they have all been invalidated and new tickets will be reissued today, and numbered seating will still be in effect.

### Enemy and Puppet Materials in Private Warehouses Must Be Inspected and Reported Truthfully; Failure to Report More Than Half Will Result in Confiscation Upon Discovery

### China's New Invention: Shallow-Draft Gas Steamship; Yamei Ship to Arrive in Shanghai

In order to adapt to the needs of inland river navigation in our country, Huaxi Xingye Company invented a type of water-gas steamship. It has been actively researching since 1943 and finally succeeded. It has been tested on-site by the Wartime Transportation Bureau, the Navigation Department of the Ministry of Communications, the Production Bureau, the US Army Headquarters, the US Foreign Economic Administration, the Taikoo Shipping Company, etc. There are no difficulties in going up and down the rapids within a hundred miles around Chongqing. It is unanimously believed that it meets the needs of inland river navigation in our country. The advantages of this type of gas steamship are that it uses domestically produced white coal as fuel, which is extremely economical, only one-fourth of the cost of using charcoal, one-sixth of the cost of using steam engines, one-tenth of the cost of using diesel engines, and one-twelfth of the cost of using gasoline or alcohol, but the efficiency is high, the speed is high, the draft is shallow, and the operation is simple. Its benefits to China's social economy are by no means insignificant. It is reported that the gas steamship "Yamei" is undergoing a trial voyage between Chongqing and Shanghai. It has now sailed to Yichang and will arrive in Shanghai soon.

### Du Gang Children's Education Fund: Solicitations Initiated from All Circles

The late Martyr Du Gang, former committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, also known as Shao Wen, dedicated himself to Party and government work and education, demonstrating diligence. In the autumn of the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], he was ordered to come to Shanghai to engage in underground work. Before two months had passed, the matter was exposed, and he was arrested and ultimately killed. His body was pierced with thirty-two wounds. The tragic nature of his death and the grandeur of his sacrifice are sufficient to leave a legacy of righteousness for the nation.

### UNRRA Relief Supplies: Flour to be Sold at Discounted Prices Next Week

The flour transported to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will soon be sold publicly at discounted prices.

### Traitor Zhou Yiwei: Accused of Luring Workers to the Philippines

Zhou Yiwei, a native of Guangdong, worked as a translator and instructor at the Shanghai branch of a Japanese-owned oil company, where he lured 83 poor people, falsely claiming that they were going to Taiwan to work, only for them to never return. The workers' families turned Zhou Yiwei over to the police, and the Procuratorate prosecuted him on charges of treason. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, he was tried in the High Court. Judge Liu Yugui first asked the defendant what kind of position he held, to which he replied that he was a translator and had nothing to do with the recruitment of workers, nor did he ever force workers to go to the Philippines. He claimed that he only knew they were going to Taiwan to work and did not know they were going to mine in Manila. The judge then summoned Qiao Changfa and four other family members of the workers for questioning, all of whom unanimously stated that Zhou Yiwei was the foreman. Seven of the workers have now returned to the country and claim that the suffering they endured in the Philippines was unbearable. The judge ordered that the hearing be adjourned until next Monday and that the returned workers be brought to court to testify. The defendant was remanded to the detention center.

Entertainment World

### The First Indian Film is Released

— Xiao Xun

(Chengdu Aviation News): The first Indian film, "Dassi," has recently arrived in Chengdu by air and will be screened at the "National Grand Theater" starting in mid-month.

"Dassi" (titled "Remotely Sent Yearning Geese Return" when released in Chengdu) is a completely Indian film, with all technical work being carried out entirely by Indians. This film is the debut work of "Taifu Film Company," the first Indian film company recently established. It is adapted from the original novel by modern Indian writer Pan Qiaoli and directed by the Indian person Xilun Pusi. The three leading Indian stars are the golden-voiced female singer Lan Qini, the young actor Najiemu, and the male actor Qiyani. The film is interspersed with a lot of music and songs, which are also purely Indian in flavor. However, the dialogue is in English, but copies with Indian dialogue have been produced in India.

Another feature is the strangeness and mystery of the story, which is full of Eastern philosophical atmosphere, coupled with the fantastic concept of the elusive "destiny." This may be a bit "incomprehensible" to us who are used to the simple and clear American film stories. It depicts a young couple who become husband and wife from lovers and suffer the manipulation of fate for more than ten years. It begins with a sudden encounter and leads to twists and turns, and then from twists and turns to combination, from combination to new misfortune, until the husband and wife separate and have been apart for ten years. Finally, they reunite again due to another sudden opportunity. The whole film is permeated with an inexplicable sense of mystery from beginning to end.

Hefu Film Company was only established in June this year.

### The "Fu Chou" in Storytelling

— Jian Fan

The clown in drama is most likely to make people laugh with his witty remarks and interesting movements. Storytelling evolved from Kunqu Opera. In addition to singing, it depicts the expressions and movements of the characters in the book, as well as their dialogues, just like performing in a play. The difference is that one person plays several roles without makeup or decorations, and the storyteller participates in the narration to explain the story. As for depicting characters appearing on stage, the term is called "Qi Jiao Se"; more attention is paid to "Fu Chou" who create laughter. The so-called "Fu Jiao," also known as "Er Mian," is the equivalent to the "Fang Jin Chou" in Peking Opera. They are mostly treacherous villains with ulterior motives, sycophants who follow trends and flatter, and world-weary characters with other intentions. "Xiao Chou" is also known as "Xiao Hua Mian," mostly depicting lower-class society's coolies and runners, and thieves. Although they are ancient stories, comparing them to the various aspects of modern society still feels very familiar, making it a strong form of satire. Storytellers call inserting jokes "Fang Xue Tou." A storyteller must be proficient in speaking, joking, playing instruments, and singing to be considered perfect. The emphasis on "joking" shows its importance. Almost all jokes are created by the two roles of "Fu Chou," so the popular storytellers on the stage are all good at "Fu Chou." To have elegant speech and humorous tone, one must deeply study Kunqu Opera and be good at making changes. In addition, the storyteller's narration must also have a strong clown-like character to be funny and intriguing. In a major era of change, there are many wonderful and strange things among all kinds of people that storytellers can use in "comparing the past to the present" to deeply render the joke. Although old dramas and storytelling are too far removed from the era, they have a social impact. The greatest power is the satire of the world. Unfortunately, storytellers who can truly satirize the world are indeed rare.

Well-known Hollywood director and playwright Frank Craven recently passed away due to a heart attack at the age of 69. In addition to directing and writing scripts, Craven also acted.

### Raising the Standard of Entertainment

— Zhang Yizhi

At the welcoming party for Mr. Zhang Daofan, I said, "The reason why we in the entertainment industry do not receive the attention of society is because our art is immature, our knowledge is shallow, and our standards cannot be balanced with those of the general cultural and artistic circles! This is something we cannot deny!" Therefore, on behalf of the entertainment industry, I loudly appeal to all circles to come and guide and support us at any time!

However, it is unreliable to rely on others to help with everything. We still have to rely on ourselves. The entertainment industry should first unite from within, uphold the principle of "learning without end," and mutually study the progress of art. With the evolution of the times, life needs self-discipline, and we must eliminate all bad habits. We must know that entertainment, although a kind of entertainment, is not only for people to pass the time! I remember that before the Anti-Japanese War, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, once encouraged us and said, "Drama is a kind of popular education, and performers are social mentors who go deep into the people." We are really ashamed that we often do not live up to this name, and we cannot bear this heavy responsibility! But we have to strive to bear this heavy mission! Therefore, comrades, although we dare not respect ourselves; at the very least, we must not abandon ourselves! We must fight for the entertainment industry, strive to move upwards, cultivate our own personality, and raise the standard of entertainment!

Short Story

### The Enemy (15)

— Pearl S. Buck, Translated by Zhu Qi

Then he left the general and went back, thinking about the plan all the way. This way, everything could be unrelated to him. He didn't want to tell Hana at all, afraid that she would be afraid of the assassination at home, and in an autocratic country like Japan, this assassin was necessary. Besides this means, what else can the ruler use to deal with those who oppose him? They are necessary.

When he walked into the room where the American was sleeping, he did not allow his mind to exist other than reason. But when he opened the door, he was surprised to see that the young man had gotten up and was preparing to go into the garden.

He exclaimed, "What! Who allowed you to leave this room?"

Tom happily said, "I am not used to waiting for permission. My God, I feel very healthy again! But I don't know if the muscles on this side will always feel stiff?"

Sadao asked in surprise, "Really?" He forgot everything. "I think I seem to have prevented this phenomenon," he murmured. He pulled up the man's clothes and looked at the healing scar. He said, "If exercise can't cure it, maybe massage can be used."

The young man said, "This doesn't hinder me much." His young face with a thick, tough yellow beard was haggard. "Oh, doctor, I have a few words to say to you. If I hadn't met a Japanese like you—then I wouldn't be alive today, I know that."

Sadao bowed and said nothing.

"Really, I know," Tom continued warmly. The knuckles of his big, skinny hand holding a chair turned white. "I guess if all Japanese were like you, this war wouldn't have happened."

Sadao said with difficulty, "Maybe so. I think you can go to sleep now."

After he helped the child to sleep, he bowed and said, "Good night."

Sadao did not sleep well that night. He woke up repeatedly, thinking he heard footsteps, the sound of a branch breaking, or the movement of a stone in the garden—sounds that could be made by someone carrying something.

### Gold Market Hedging More Common, Bonds Generally Stable

Rice Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday's market saw a slight rebound in gold prices due to the situation in the wartime capital, Chongqing, appearing quite stable. Midway through trading, due to the weakening of U.S. dollars, prices once retreated to a low of 666,000. Near noon, a surge in short covering pushed prices back up, finally fluctuating around 685,000. This resulted in a slight increase of 3,000 compared to the previous close. The overall trend was very stable. General sentiment was influenced by the gold and U.S. dollar prices in Chongqing, leading to more hedging (Chongqing gold at 845,000, U.S. dollars at 1,235 yuan, roughly 685 yuan, compared to today's hedging price in this city of 620 yuan per ten taels). Therefore, the local gold market's vitality was further enhanced. However, the upward trend was not extremely intense. Ornament gold was listed at 75,000, silver bullion at 650, and silver dollars still hovered around 450. The unofficial discount rate was even looser. Many bulls in the securities industry closed out their positions, leading to an overabundance of credit. Interest rates were around 10 to 12%, with some even below 10%.

Affected by the market in Chongqing, U.S. dollars saw a constant stream of short selling, resulting in extreme weakness. The lowest price reached 1,083 yuan. Finally, due to the rise in gold prices, there was a slight stabilization, struggling around 1,090 yuan. The result was a further drop of more than 30 yuan compared to the previous close. The difference between it and the price of gold was thus increasingly widened. Hong Kong dollars, old notes, were stable, while new notes fell by two yuan.

Public bonds initially showed strength. Bulls took profits and exited the market, leading to an immediate decline. Type C bonds retreated from 610 yuan to 530 yuan. Retail investors supported them at lower prices, and they finally stabilized somewhat. The result was a drop of 10 to 35 yuan, with a fluctuating trend. Chinese stocks did not fluctuate much, generally following the gold market's movements. Foreign stocks also showed little special change.

Grains: Rice prices in the interior are reported to be high, and local prices have risen accordingly, increasing by about 500-600 yuan to 700-800 yuan. The oil market was tight in the morning but weak in the afternoon, with high prices followed by stagnation. Flour was also high and popular initially, then weakened due to the large amount of mid- and lower-grade flour and the scarcity of high-grade flour. Soybean production and sales were mismatched, but retail sales became active, and prices rose by 200-300 yuan. Corn was sluggish in both arrival and sales, with no significant activity in the market. Sesame was scarce in both supply and demand, with no significant fluctuations. Cowpeas were stable. Soybean cakes were balanced in supply and demand, and there were no significant changes for the time being. Liquor arrivals gradually increased, and the price was slightly less than 500 yuan, with normal digestion. Various goods are temporarily showing a fluctuating trend.

Asphalt: For the past two days, there were no increases or decreases. Yesterday morning, a telegram from Lanxi stated that oil prices there had fallen to 13,000 yuan, with continued weakness expected. In Jiaxing, due to abundant cypress tree sales, credit was tight, and oil prices weakened accordingly. Local merchants brought dozens of carloads of oil from Jiaxing, with prices at 16,000 yuan per picul for immediate delivery, that is, a foreign price. Deliveries were made before the Winter Solstice, with Jiaxing oil being sold at 20,000 to 19,000 yuan, and Lanxi oil at 15,000 to 16,000 yuan.

### Chongqing Gold Prices Ease

U.S. Dollars Also Weaken

[Report from this newspaper in Chongqing, 7th] (Delayed Arrival) On the morning of the 7th, factory-made gold bars were at 846,000 yuan, and cast bars were at 840,000 yuan. In the afternoon, factory-made bars opened at 845,000 yuan and closed at 842,000 yuan. Cast bars opened at 842,000 yuan and closed at 838,000 yuan. U.S. dollars opened in the morning at 1,260 yuan, with the tail end at 1,340 yuan. In the afternoon, the tail end was at 1,320 yuan, and the closing price was 1,285 yuan.
