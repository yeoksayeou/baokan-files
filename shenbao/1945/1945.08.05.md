### Yu (Chongqing) Appoints Wang Shijie as Foreign Minister

Guangzhou, July 3rd, Central News Agency Dispatch—

Following the reorganization of the Executive Yuan in Yu (Chongqing), Wang Shijie has been appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The position of Minister of Information, vacated by Wang, will be concurrently held by the Minister of Social Affairs, Gu Zhenggang, who will also concurrently hold the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, previously held by Sheng Shicai and Luo Guangjun. Other ministers will retain their positions. The core of this reorganization of the Executive Yuan in Yu (Chongqing) is the replacement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Yu-Chongqing United News Agency observed as follows: Wang Shijie is the most outstanding theorist within the Yu (Chongqing) faction and a steadfast politician with the demeanor of a scholar. He also holds considerable influence within the Kuomintang. In these turbulent times, his appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs is highly anticipated. When Wang assumed the position of Minister of Information last December, he declared his intention to improve relations with the Soviet Union. He also undertook the task of Yu-Yan (Chongqing-Yan'an) negotiations last June, personally traveling to Yan'an for this purpose. As for Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of Information, he is a steadfast member of Wang's faction. According to the United News Agency's conjecture, after the Wang faction gains power this time, they will ostensibly adopt a conciliatory attitude towards Yan'an, but will still seek to intensify the pressure on Yan'an.

Weekly Review

### Freedom of Speech and the Censorship System

— Han Sheng

Freedom of speech can increase knowledge, express the feelings of the people, and enhance the people's political interests. All modern constitutional countries protect it. Most of our country's officials have served as journalists and naturally value the freedom of speech.

During a country's process of revolution and construction, the people must be guided well. Revolution is the struggle between old and new forces. To prevent old knowledge from hindering new knowledge, the will of the people must be unified to build a new country and achieve the goals of the revolution. Therefore, news reports must be coordinated with this. In other words, a democratic country cannot tolerate counter-revolutionary speech, and a socialist country cannot tolerate anti-socialist speech. This principle is extremely clear.

Jesus said, "You must know the truth, and the truth will set you free." This means that the scope of freedom cannot be sought outside of truth. Lowell, a political scientist who advocated for the kingly way of freedom, argued in his book "Public Opinion and Popular Government" that a nation must have a common opinion on its major current problems to cultivate good public opinion. Therefore, modern constitutions of various countries also do not guarantee freedom of speech without limits. The censorship system is an indirect legal safeguard to adapt to the current needs of the nation and the people.

During wartime, if the news censorship system is incomplete, and newspapers contain a lot of important military secrets, it can cause great disadvantages in the war. Therefore, strict censorship must be implemented so that such counter-propaganda materials can be eliminated. Newspapers themselves will gradually realize the harm of such materials to the country and automatically stop recording and publishing them. Secondly, taking Shanghai newspapers as an example, in the past, social news contained many reports of theft, robbery, rape, and adultery, filling the pages. This not only harmed good customs but also disrupted social order. This phenomenon was naturally caused by the poor news censorship system.

The first example pertains to military matters, and the second pertains to social matters. The former can prove the active effect of the censorship system, while the latter can prove the passive effect of the system.

Speech and records during wartime must be especially cautious. We already have measures for wartime news censorship and review of books and magazines to give people a scope of freedom of speech. Other countries that claim to be democratic and central have censorship systems. Although the methods and scope may be different, the intention to protect the interests of the nation and the people and prevent the suppression of war efforts is the same. It is difficult for any system to be perfect. It must constantly seek improvement. The publication censorship system is no exception.

Currently, the trend of new publications is extremely strong, and their direction seems to be towards demanding freedom of speech. Generally speaking, this is a good phenomenon. However, the necessities of the country during wartime cannot be ignored. Therefore, is there a need to discuss the management of speech and publication in terms of methods? Is there a need to adjust the scope to better protect the people's speech? We believe that the Propaganda Department must be conducting meticulous research on improvement plans. We believe that the first step is to solicit opinions from the cultural and publishing communities and then develop the most reasonable method. We suggest that the government, through legislative procedures, separately determine essential and concise censorship laws to ensure that the whole country follows them consistently. In the spirit of law and discipline, actively support and promote the healthy development of speech and lay the foundation for China's revitalization and construction.

### New Rice from Wuhu Enters the Market

Wuhu, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch—

Since the beginning of summer, this county has had moderate and well-distributed rainfall, and the rice has been growing rapidly. The early rice crop has now entered the market. Because there are very few farmers planting rice, the amount of goods arriving is not large. However, this year's rice crop has been growing well, and a bountiful harvest is expected in the autumn. In the future, a large amount of new rice from the four villages will flood the market, and rice prices are bound to fall.

### British Foreign Office Statement on East Asian Organization Issues, British and American Chiefs of Staff Reach Agreement

Stockholm, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch— London reports: The British Foreign Office issued a statement at 10:30 PM on the 3rd as follows: "During the Potsdam Conference, the representatives of the British and American Chiefs of Staff held daily meetings and worked hard to discuss all the details regarding the destruction of the Japanese Army and Navy and the early unconditional surrender of Japan. Also, in order to liberate the areas occupied by the Japanese military, the deployment of British and American troops was adjusted. All British Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel who can be freely deployed will be used for attacks on Japan. There was considerable discussion on issues such as determining the commander of the Southwest Pacific and Southeast Asia regions, and utilizing the forces of other allied countries that are at war with Japan. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have issued this statement, which is of great significance in light of the current international situation. "According to Reuters, after the British Foreign Office issued the above statement, it added that "the war against Japan is currently being borne only by the United Kingdom and the United States", so this statement was not issued at the same time as the communiqué of the Three-Power Conference, but was only announced tonight. However, this point cannot be inferred that the Soviet Union will not participate in the East Asian war.

### Soviet Newspaper Praises the Achievements of the Conference

Moscow, Central News Agency Dispatch— A commentary in 真理报 [Pravda] stated that after the end of the European war, the international situation is extremely complex, so the agreement of the Potsdam Conference is of great significance, confirming that the three countries of this historic conference have reached mutual understanding to ensure and consolidate true peace. The Soviet people welcome the success of the Three-Power Conference, as the conference is sufficient to enhance the ties between the three countries. The Soviet people are confident that the decisions made based on this conference will contribute greatly to peace and security among nations.

### Delicate Relations Between Japan and the Soviet Union

Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch— Observers here note that the Potsdam Declaration makes no mention of East Asian issues, especially Japan and the Pacific, which is particularly noteworthy. There is still a neutrality treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, and there is more special reason to attract worldwide attention, and Japan is naturally working harder in the spirit of the neutrality treaty to build friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, and this policy will never be swayed by the Potsdam Declaration, etc.

### No Secret Agreements at the Potsdam Conference

Lisbon, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch— According to information received here, U.S. President Truman met with reporters on the cruiser "Augusta" while returning to his country by sea from Plymouth, England yesterday and said that no secret agreements were made in the Potin [Potsdam].

Lisbon, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch— According to Reuters from Washington, U.S. President Truman has returned home by sea. After arriving at the White House, he will use the radio to broadcast to the country, reporting on the details of the Potsdam Conference, and will pre-respond to possible questions from all walks of life, such as "Why did you yield to Stalin?"

### Pétain Continues to Be Tried, Laval Testifies, Claims to Be a Loyal Republican

Lisbon, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch— According to Paris reports, former Vichy government leader Laval testified as a witness yesterday during the trial of Marshal Pétain. Laval repeatedly defended his leader's efforts. He testified, "I have strived to fight 'war' so that it does not break out. As for when I began to have political relations with Marshal Pétain, I think it was around 1934, when I realized that French foreign policy would inevitably lead France into war. I do not want to see disturbances in other countries. At that time, my France was also extremely peaceful and prosperous, and there was no reason to go to war with other neighboring countries." At the same time, he also clarified his pre-war foreign policy, saying, "I only ceded to Mussolini a land of 140,000 meters of sandy soil. As for the secret French-Italian military agreement, it was signed because I wanted to confront Germany. Furthermore, regarding the Hoare-Laval Pact signed during Italy's invasion of Abyssinia, it was my plan, but the plan was ultimately rejected by the politicians in London and Paris." At that time, Pétain raised his voice to Laval and said, "Laval, you once said, 'Where will the French Republic be in the future?'" The court was once moved, and Laval showed some signs of panic and hurriedly replied, "I cannot remember this. Maybe I was joking. I am a Republican and would never want to overthrow the Republic. I am neither a Fascist nor a Nazi acolyte. I am really a Republican." At this time, the court temporarily adjourned and continued the trial after forty minutes. Prosecutor Montebou questioned Laval how the power to enact the French constitution was granted to Pétain and how he jointly held the 立　权 [legislative power] with the government. Pétain alone could not promulgate a constitutional bill. There were many differences between my opinion and Pétain's." Later, when asked by the jury about the Vichy government parliament in 1940, he replied, "When the parliament secretly convened in Vichy at that time, 700 members attended, and none of them directly or indirectly expressed opposition to the 'armistice agreement'. You should not attribute all the mistakes made by other inexperienced cabinet members to Pétain alone."

### Zhejiang in the Past Two Months (1)

— Bo Ying

Zhejiang was originally a prosperous area in the southeast and also an important coastal province, occupying an important position in the government, economy, culture, and other departments. However, since the Incident, due to war damage, its prosperity is far from what it used to be. Although Mr. Ding Chu-cun has been in charge of military and political affairs in Zhejiang for only two months (June and July), he is determined to rectify the situation and works tirelessly day and night, especially to alleviate the suffering of the people. Therefore, in a short period of two months, there has been significant progress in administration, politics, economy, culture, education, and security. Recently, the reporter visited the provincial government and various aspects of Zhejiang Province and reports on the actual situation of Zhejiang Province's administrative measures in June and July as follows:

### Communicating Public Opinion

The way to govern lies in grasping the will of the people. In particular, it is necessary for directives from above to reach the lower levels and for information from below to reach the upper levels. Only in this way can the government and the people be integrated and achieve the effect of promoting administration. Since the Incident [likely refers to the Second Sino-Japanese War], Zhejiang Province has lacked a truly representative public opinion mechanism, and there is inevitably a disconnect between the upper and lower levels. As soon as Governor Ding took office, he recruited local impartial gentry and leaders from various circles in Zhejiang Province to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Advisory Committee. He also ordered each county to organize a County Advisory Committee. Public opinion mechanisms were promoted, and public opinion boxes were set up to widely solicit opinions. The provincial government has adopted and implemented the suggestions of the Provincial Advisory Committee, such as establishing a grain purchasing agency to prevent rice prices from rising again when the new harvest is not yet available, dredging existing waterways to facilitate transportation, purchasing firewood to solve the firewood shortage in Hangzhou, encouraging private individuals to establish simple primary schools to help out-of-school children, establishing epidemic hospitals to protect the safety of the people's lives, and renovating famous historical sites to preserve the national essence. All of these are full expressions of diligently seeking out the people's concerns and adopting suggestions. As for the County Advisory Committees, they are currently being established, and more than ten counties, including Hangzhou County, have already reported their establishment. It will soon be possible to establish them universally, so that everything in Zhejiang Province can be promoted with the cooperation of officials and the people.

### Regulating the People's Food Supply

In recent years, food panic has become a common phenomenon everywhere, and Zhejiang Province is no exception. In reality, Zhejiang Province's grain production has been barely sufficient. Before the Incident, the province's output was less than 20% of what was needed, and the only way to make up for the deficiency was to rely on neighboring provinces. After the Incident, coupled with the decline in rural production and transportation and security issues, the severity of the situation has become even worse than before. In May of this year, the price of rice in Hangzhou was actually one-third higher than in Shanghai. Since Mr. Ding took office, he has paid close attention to the food panic, and has sent personnel to Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiangsu, and eastern Zhejiang to continuously purchase grain, and to purchase flour from Shanghai and other places for regulation, and strictly implemented the national government's emergency measures for grain. In a short time, rice prices fell sharply. At present, rice prices in Hangzhou have fallen lower than those in Shanghai and Jiangsu. Recently, a purchasing agency has been organized to carry out purchasing work to prevent food prices from rising again, and at the same time, plans are actively being made to increase production so that the people's food problem can be fundamentally solved. In the past two months, the rising rice prices in Hangzhou have not recurred, and they have often been lower than those in Shanghai and other places, which is not easy to achieve independently.

### Adjusting Officialdom

The county is the foundation of administration. Only with sound county administration can provincial administration be implemented. Mr. Ding has formulated provisional organizations for the counties in accordance with the central government's regulations and with reference to the situation in Zhejiang Province. The main purpose is to increase the power of the county magistrate so that he can shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the entire county. It is also planned to raise the status of certain counties and formally request the central government to appoint them as key counties. Mr. Ding adheres to the spirit of impartiality in the selection of county magistrates, focusing purely on talent and making every effort to employ Zhejiang natives to serve their hometowns. Incumbent magistrates will not be easily transferred unless they have committed misconduct, and resignations are often met with retention. In addition, county magistrates, police chiefs, and security team leaders are responsible for defending the local area, and are strictly prohibited from leaving their posts without approval. In the two months since Mr. Ding took office, the officialdom has gradually become clearer.

In the past, the salaries of civil servants in Zhejiang Province were lower than those of the central government and other provinces. Mr. Ding slightly increased them in June. Starting in July, they have been fully increased in accordance with the central government's regulations (recommended appointments and above receive a basic salary plus 1,000 times), so as to ensure their livelihood. The funding for county governments and district administrative inspector's offices will also be universally increased. The administrative expenses of first-class counties in the first half of the year were originally set at 200,000 yuan per month, and starting in July, they will be increased to more than 5 million yuan.

### Rectifying Tax Revenue

Finance is the mother of enterprise, and the promotion of government orders depends on the abundance or scarcity of finances. Zhejiang Province's estimated expenditures for the first half of the 34th year [likely refers to 1945] were 100 million yuan, averaging about 16.6 million yuan per month. However, from January to March, expenditures exceeded income. Mr. Ding began to rectify the situation in June, with the principle of not increasing the burden on the people. The main method was to eliminate corruption so that every penny of tax revenue would go to the public. The original land tax, business tax, special tax, and consumption tax were reorganized separately without opening up new tax sources. The accounting system was strictly enforced, and a special accounting office was set up to strictly audit the accounts. A special consumption tax office was also set up to actively reorganize the consumption tax, and the consumption tax rates of various bureaus were increased in accordance with current prices. It is estimated that since implementation in July, the increase in revenue has been considerable. As for the collection of land tax, following the example of Jiangsu, counties with relatively convenient transportation and solid security, such as Hangzhou County and Jiaxing County, were selected to first collect the land tax in kind for the upper quarter of the 34th year. For the lower quarter of the 34th year, the financial bureaus of each county will be abolished, and land tax collection offices will be established in each county, with the county magistrate serving concurrently as the director, and a deputy director will be sent by the provincial government to supervise the collection work. If the collection of land tax in kind is effective, the problem of food rice for the military, police, and civil servants can be easily solved. All previous commission systems for various taxes have also been abolished, and public quotas have been strictly set. Standards have been established with reference to the local conditions and security of various cities and counties, as well as the strength of purchasing power, and reports are submitted quarterly. The grades of each bureau are re-determined, appropriate funding is provided, and regulations for rewards, penalties, and performance evaluations are revised. The tax revenue of each tax will inevitably increase further.

### Improving Cultural and Educational Undertakings

Zhejiang Province's cultural and educational undertakings have always been well-developed, but they have been greatly damaged since the Incident. Upon taking office, Mr. Ding first ordered that all cultural and educational personnel should be employed with the principle of employing people from this province, followed by increasing the salaries of educational personnel and raising educational funding. The salaries of teachers in Zhejiang Province are even more important than those of civil servants in terms of the teaching staff, and efforts are being made to improve them. Recently, the second general registration of primary school teachers in the province was held, and teacher training classes were planned to train current primary school teachers in rotation to develop educational talents. Furthermore, local educational administrative personnel are carefully selected, and the assessment of the education system is strict. Academic standards are also emphasized to curb students' bad habits. In order to strengthen and promote production education, vocational schools have added agricultural courses, and schools are required to use vacant land to grow miscellaneous grains to increase production, and small factories are planned to manufacture industrial products. Secondly, the level of Japanese teachers in Zhejiang Province varies, so a Japanese language cram school will be held during the summer vacation to provide further education. In terms of culture, in view of the fact that the books of the provincial library are scattered and have not been sorted out, a large sum of money has been allocated to order their reorganization in order to preserve the national essence. As for the museum, the alcohol used for the animal and plant specimens has not been replaced for a long time, and the specimens are about to rot. Appreciating the difficulty of the predecessors' collection, for the sake of preserving culture, they have been replaced separately. The library and museum have been renovated after reorganization. Furthermore, many famous historical sites have been damaged since the Incident, and a committee for the renovation of famous historical sites has been established, inviting local people to participate in the renovation and reorganization.

### Municipal Government Re-formulates Salary Rice Rationing Method: Maximum of Six Dou and Minimum of Two and a Half Dou Per Month

The municipal government yesterday formulated the Shanghai Special Municipal Government's Provisional Measures for Salary Rice Rationing, which was announced and implemented. At the same time, the previous Shanghai Special Municipal Administration for Allocation of Supplies's Measures for the Municipal Government and Affiliated Bureaus and Offices' Salary Rice Rationing, which was formulated by the former Administration for Allocation of Supplies, was abolished. The main points of the new measures are as follows:

The employees of the municipal government and its affiliated agencies, as well as the faculty and staff of municipal and county schools, will be temporarily allocated three dou of salary rice per person per month free of charge, which will be issued by the Bureau of Economy.

The amount of rice allocated to the police bureau, in addition to following the procedures stipulated in each article, is as follows: 1. All married police officers with children will be allocated six dou of salary rice per month. 2. Married police officers without children will be allocated four dou of salary rice per month. 3. Unmarried police officers will be allocated two and a half dou of salary rice per month.

Police officers in the suburbs will be allocated three dou of salary rice per month. The aforementioned salary rice will be temporarily issued by the Bureau of Economy, and the rationing for county police officers will be stipulated separately.

The salary rice allocation for the security team is uniformly three dou for officers and soldiers. Those stationed in the urban area will collect it from the Bureau of Economy according to the prescribed procedures. Those stationed in the counties will be allocated by each county from the collected treasures according to regulations. If the treasures collected in each county are insufficient, a special report should be submitted to the municipal government for unified coordination.

### The First Phase of Land Tax Collection in Kind is Quite Good: Rice and Wheat to be Shipped to Shanghai This Week

The Municipal Bureau of Finance has already started the first phase of the work of collecting land tax in kind from its affiliated counties. Around the beginning of this month, the first batch of rice, grain, and wheat is expected to be transported to Shanghai. According to sources familiar with the matter, the Municipal Bureau of Finance's collection of land tax in kind this time has been quite successful. Even in this lean season, the actual amount received can roughly reach the budgeted figures. In the future, the salary rice and food rations for the municipal government and various bureaus and offices can be processed as usual. When the first batch of goods arrives in Shanghai, the Bureaus of Finance, Police, and Economy will jointly inspect and accept them, and the Bureau of Economy will be responsible for their storage. Subsequent batches will be shipped to Shanghai, and the procedures will remain the same. As for the first phase of the collection of land tax in kind, according to regulations, the deadline is the end of this month. If the land tax is not paid by the deadline, a late payment fine will be imposed in accordance with the regulations.
