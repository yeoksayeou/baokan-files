Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Yokosuka Naval District Headquarters announced on the 19th that during the enemy carrier-based aircraft's two attacks on Yokosuka Naval Port on the 18th, the Japanese side's achieved victories, as of 6:00 AM on the 19th, included 40 aircraft shot down and 38 destroyed.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The total number of enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking various areas in the Kanto region and Yokosuka Naval Port since the 18th has reached 900. The Japanese Army and Navy's total battle results include 75 shot down and 46 destroyed, totaling 121 aircraft. The Japanese side suffered almost no damage on the ground.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - For unknown reasons, the enemy's mobile force did not attack the Japanese mainland with carrier-based aircraft today, perhaps retreating beyond the range of the Japanese Air Force. On the 18th, the Japanese aviation units launched daring interception battles against the attacking enemy carrier-based aircraft everywhere, achieving significant results. It is now confirmed that 80 aircraft were shot down and 53 destroyed. Furthermore, approximately 30 attacking enemy aircraft were shot down in one location. At approximately 12:00 AM on the same day, a few small enemy naval vessels shelled fishing villages near Shirahama at the southern tip of the Boso Peninsula for about ten minutes. After firing on civilian homes, they fled. The Japanese side suffered minimal damage.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Approximately 60 enemy P-51 aircraft intruded into the Kinki region around 5:00 AM on the 19th for about an hour, mainly attacking airfields and transportation facilities, etc. The Japanese side suffered little damage.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - 60 enemy P-51 aircraft attacked various airfields in western Gifu, Aichi, and the Shizuoka region at 9:00 AM on the 19th for one hour. Damage to the Japanese side was minimal, and interception results are currently under investigation.

Furthermore, 9 B-29 aircraft from the Marianas base dropped sea mines in the Kanmon Strait and its surrounding areas at 12:30 AM on the 18th.

Sapporo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese military's interception of enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking Hokkaido on the 14th and 15th resulted in major victories. Subsequent investigations have revealed that the results were even greater, with a total of 32 aircraft shot down and 21 destroyed.

### Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force, General Okamura, Issues Statement: Troop Withdrawal Should Be Based on Armistice; Maximum Assistance Will Be Provided for Food Problem

Central News Agency Report - According to the Continental New Daily, General Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force stationed in China, hosted the capital's propaganda and reporting authorities at the Nanjing Keiko Company at 3:00 PM on the 9th of this month, providing detailed accounts of the current general war situation and revealing the Expeditionary Force's determination to fight. The key points of the General's statement on that day are supplemented below:

Recently, some people in China's opinion circles have been advocating for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. However, there are two points to consider regarding the so-called troop withdrawal. First, the withdrawal should be based on an armistice; otherwise, it will not achieve its goal but will instead lead to chaos. The current war is not between Japan and China, but a war with Chongqing backed by the United States. Given this situation, withdrawal is naturally not permissible. Second, even if Japan were to leave the above issues aside and begin withdrawing troops, it would not be completed in a short period. The armed withdrawal of Japanese soldiers will take approximately two years, and the duration will have to be extended due to the disruption of transportation by the U.S. Air Force. Therefore, hastily withdrawing troops without considering the above tactics is unacceptable to us.

Regarding the enemy's amphibious operations, I hold two contradictory emotions. On the one hand, as a neighbor of China, I cannot help but feel saddened for the Chinese people by the devastation of Chinese territory. On the other hand, to rapidly defeat America's Pacific strategy, I hope for an American landing and welcome the early arrival of American troops. I have the determination and confidence to achieve final victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Yan'an's current practices certainly need to change. However, I believe that Yan'an is not an absolutely incompatible regime with China. The relationship is a domestic issue, and I do not wish to comment on it at length. However, Chongqing's reliance on other countries to resolve domestic problems is not appropriate.

The food problem lies in the incompleteness of the purchasing methods and the lack of smoothness in transportation. Improving this situation is naturally the responsibility of the Chinese government, but the Japanese side also has a responsibility. The Expeditionary Force will continue to provide as much assistance as possible, and the future of China's food supply should be reassuring.

### Next Operational Intentions of the U.S. Military

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy U.S. military, which has seized control of the Okinawa battle situation, is actively preparing naval and air bases on the island, coordinating with the Mariana Islands base and the Iwo Jima base. For the past ten days, they have been using B-29, B-24, and P-51 fighters as the core of a combined battle-bomber air force to conduct tactical and strategic bombing of military production facilities and small to medium-sized cities across the Japanese mainland. Meanwhile, they are attempting to re-equip their mobile force, which has lost half its strength in the Okinawa campaign. Since the 10th, they have been encroaching on the waters near the mainland, attacking the Kanto region on the 14th and the northeastern and southern Hokkaido regions on the 14th and 15th, and parts of the Kanto and northeastern regions again on the 17th. At the same time, some of their warships have conducted the first-ever shelling of Kamaishi and Muroran on the mainland. However, it would be naive to assume that these actions mean the U.S. military intends to launch a landing operation on the mainland. The enemy's mobile force is cruising near the mainland and strafing Japanese airfields and other military facilities, as well as ports and ships with machine gun fire. This is clearly the preliminary aerial battle before a landing on the mainland. One of the enemy's objectives is to scout out the mainland's air strength and to disperse and deplete Japan's air power. The enemy's mobile force is also supplementing the strategic and tactical bombing from the Iwo Jima base, which has not been entirely successful, by attacking specific areas and destroying important Japanese production facilities in order to reduce production and sow fear to achieve a psychological effect. The Japanese side has long been preparing and reinforcing its defenses to obstruct the enemy's advance, and the damage caused by carrier-based aircraft has been extremely minimal. The enemy's attacks have been a complete failure, causing them anxiety. Based on the recent movements of the enemy's mobile force, there is a hint of a new landing operation. However, the intention of this intrusion by the enemy's mobile force is still difficult to determine the next strategy and intention. If the enemy's next strategy aims to land on the mainland, the existing enemy air bases in the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa are too far away. To expand and strengthen these air bases, they would need to secure an air base closer to the mainland before launching a landing. Furthermore, while preparing the Okinawa base, the enemy has been conducting air raids on the mainland from that area and bases in the Philippines, which have become increasingly active recently. It is easy to fully deduce that the enemy has strategic and political landing intentions in that direction. However, the Japanese army on the mainland has already completed thorough preparations, concentrating its forces to launch a head-on attack on the enemy, and the enemy's landing attempt will certainly fail.

### Japanese Navy Ministry Announces Special Attack Force Achievements: 236 Honored Warriors

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to an announcement by the Japanese Navy Ministry on the 18th, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet recently issued a notice to the entire army regarding the great achievements of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force members in destroying enemy mobile forces and ship convoys around Okinawa Island. A total of 236 warriors have been honored, including members of the Shinryu unit, who are launched from mother ships in rocket-powered small aircraft, vowing to sink enemy ships at all costs. This is the second time the spirit of the Shinryu unit's special attacks has been proclaimed to the entire army to show the world. In total, they have sunk or destroyed over 600 enemy ships, achieving unprecedented victories in history, bringing brilliant results to the Okinawa operation. The heavy damage suffered by the enemy is all due to the merits of these special attack warriors.

### Three-Power Conference: Hidden Reefs Ahead; Military Commentator Discusses World Political Situation

A military commentator in this city recently provided a detailed commentary on the current world political situation as follows:

### Three-Power Conference: Peace as Prerequisite

Regarding the Anglo-American-Soviet three-power conference, there seems to be a hidden reef due to Stalin's tardiness. According to reports from the British and American sides, this three-power conference is like an East Asian version of the Yalta Conference, or rather, a prerequisite for future peace. It is understood that a peace conference will be held early next year, and this three-power conference is a preparatory meeting. The progress of this conference has not been disclosed so far. The schedule originally called for a meeting on the 16th, but it was postponed by one day due to Stalin's late arrival. On the morning of the 16th, U.S. President Truman consulted with Secretary of State Byrnes and his staff after getting up, and then visited British Prime Minister Churchill. Although Stalin's movements were secret, it is believed that he arrived in Potsdam on the afternoon of the 16th. According to another report, Truman and Churchill held an informal meeting in Potsdam on that day, and the staff of the British and American sides also exchanged opinions. It is also said that Stalin and Truman conducted their first meeting on the 17th, where they discussed important world issues, and that they had also arranged to meet Churchill. According to an incoming telegram on the 18th, Truman first had lunch with Churchill, and in the afternoon Truman visited Stalin for a second meeting. Reporters are not allowed to participate in this conference, and the release of news is prohibited. Lieutenant Colonel John, a military outreach officer with the U.S. Department of the Army, said in a report that the conference proceeded according to past procedures. Before the conference, Song Ziwen visited Stalin in Moscow, acting as a mediator. The fact that Stalin arrived a day late on the scheduled date further confirms that there are hidden reefs in the future of the three-power conference.

### Enemy U.S. Movements in the Pacific

Regarding the future movements of the U.S. military in the Pacific, according to the New York Times on the 17th, the decision of where the British and American forces will land will be made according to the overall situation, but it pointed out that a landing on the Chinese mainland is more likely in the next operation, while actively bombing the Japanese mainland. As for Japan's war power and air power, according to what the enemy has released, Japan's underground factory production is progressing considerably, and stockpiles are very abundant. Moreover, based on Japan's glorious past achievements and the rising spirit of special attacks, with the ability to kill a hundred with one blow, the world is astonished. With such strong strength, it is not willing to act rashly. Therefore, some people say that once the enemy begins to invade and land on the Japanese mainland, Japan will mobilize all manpower and aircraft to launch a head-on attack on the enemy. At that time, the damage suffered by the enemy will be several times greater than the tragic Okinawa Island campaign. This is not difficult to imagine. Japan is striving to liberate the nations of East Asia and build a new world of universal brotherhood in East Asia. In order to eliminate the influence of Britain and the United States in Japan and China, and permanently expel them from East Asia, both China and Japan, as well as all the nations of East Asia, must permanently maintain their faith and advance towards the construction of a new East Asia under the same goal.

### Indo-British Conference Negotiations Break Down

Regarding the breakdown of the Simla Conference in India, the process has been explained to the House of Commons by Amery, the British Secretary of State for India. The conference began on June 25th and discussed the following: The positions of Army Minister and other important posts in the Governor-General's Executive Council should be filled by Indians, and the Commander-in-Chief must also be borne by an Indian. Implementing the Indian proposal for a large-scale reform in the Executive Council. Appointing new Indian diplomats to be sent overseas. Cripps had previously called on India to discuss the possibility of independence after the war, but so far there has been no progress. The purpose of this new proposal is to facilitate India's self-governance and grant it independence. The formal meeting began on that day of the week and adjourned on July 14th. When Indian Governor Wavell initially advocated for the election of members of the Executive Council, he requested that the Conference nominate Muslim League members as candidates and request a list of names. However, until the day of the adjournment, Wavell only explained the progress of the conference. In addition, Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim League, did not guarantee the selection of Muslim League members, leading to suspicion and stagnation. The final conclusion was that Wavell perfunctorily considered and decided to maintain civil order, so a new plan was not easily produced. In short, Britain has been consistently implementing a colonial policy toward India, sacrificing the Indians to extract their benefits. In the past, during the First World War, it had promised India independence, but has still not fulfilled that promise. Judging by past precedents, Britain will never grant India true independence.

### Battle of Tana Island: Japanese Forces Inflict Losses

Tana Island Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese forces sweeping up remaining enemy troops on Tana Island have reduced their forces by 200, and have generally completed the island's mopping-up operation.

Southwest Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese troops sweeping up enemy troops who landed on Tana Island have gradually suppressed the enemy towards the west coast since receiving reinforcements on the 11th. Since the 12th, they have killed or wounded approximately 200 enemy soldiers, and 500 enemy soldiers since the enemy landed.

### Jurisdiction of Japanese Ministry of Munitions Transferred to Local Authorities

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Ministry of Munitions has decided to transfer legal jurisdiction to local authorities, which will be announced on the 20th and implemented immediately. The target of the transfer is laws applicable to various military common uses, such as the Air Defense Law, the Enterprise Consolidation Order, the Metal Recovery Law, the Military Supply Company Law, the Factory and Workplace Management Material Control Order, the National Emergency Mobilization Order, the Important Workplace Labor Management Order, the Wage Control Order, and the Factory Law Wartime Special Order. The Ministry will transfer most of its authority to local officials. Local military supply management officials, local mining bureau chiefs, local fuel bureau chiefs, and metropolitan and prefectural governors will implement military supply production administration on the spot to increase efficiency in handling affairs.

### Suzhou-Shanghai Highway Actively Repaired

Suzhou, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the Provincial Construction General Engineering Office began repairing the Suzhou-Shanghai Highway, progress has been extremely tense. Although the weather is very hot, the general situation of the construction work has been quite good in recent days. The Construction Office has repeatedly dispatched supervisors to inspect the work in the heat to ensure that the repair of the road surface and bridge markers is in accordance with the original plan. There are still several weeks until the completion date.

Editorial

### The Berlin Three-Power Conference

The three-power conference of Truman, Churchill, and Stalin began at 5:00 PM on July 17th in the Sanssouci Palace in the ancient city of Potsdam, 32 kilometers southwest of Berlin. This conference is being held in a new environment where the European war has ended and the most important European issues, such as the Polish issue, have been resolved. Therefore, the content of the conference is clearly very different from the previous two three-power conferences, and it deserves the attention of those of us in the East.

The Tehran Three-Power Conference in the winter of 1943 was an international high-level strategic meeting that emphasized military matters first. The result was the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944, opening the Second Front. The Second Three-Power Conference in Yalta in February 1945 was an international high-level meeting that combined military and political considerations. As a result, in military terms, there was the tragedy of Germany's unconditional surrender on May 8th of this year, and in political terms, there was the San Francisco Conference from April 25th to June 26th of this year, which adopted the United Nations Charter. The first conference focused on European issues, while the second conference gradually expanded to issues outside of Europe.

However, the nature of the current third conference is very different from the previous two. The main differences are: first, the military significance of this conference has been reduced to a secondary position; second, the issue of international politics has been elevated to the top priority; third, East Asian issues have begun to become a very prominent topic in this conference.

Summarizing the information obtained from various sources so far, it can be seen that the main topics of this Berlin Three-Power Conference are: The German settlement plan, because the plan for Germany decided at the Crimea Yalta Conference is no longer suitable for the current situation. The specific methods of governing Germany, the period of stationing troops and joint management, and the issue of Germany's freedom and independence after the expiration will all be decided on a common fundamental policy at this conference. The problem of building a new order in Europe, including settlement plans for Germany, Italy, Hungary, Austria, Norway, Finland, and other countries. The problems of the Mediterranean and Balkan countries, especially the conflict between Britain, America, and Southern Italy centered on the Port of Trieste, the conflict between Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Britain and the Soviet Union centered on the Greek-Macedonian border issue, and the conflict between Britain, France, and even the United States and the Soviet Union centered on the Tangier autonomous region. The problems of the Near East and the Middle East, such as the Anglo-French conflict centered on the Syrian issue, the Anglo-American-French-Soviet conflict centered on the Palestinian issue and the Jewish-Arab issue, the Anglo-American-Soviet conflict centered on oil issues in Iran and Iraq, and even the problems of all the Arab countries. The Far East problem, that is, the confrontation between Britain, the United States, Chongqing, and the Soviet Union centered on the Sino-Japanese problem.

Among these many issues, what we are most concerned about is naturally the last one, the issue of East Asia. The British, American, and Chongqing sides have dreamed of a sudden change in the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union for many years, and they all hope to achieve this at this three-power conference. Song Ziwen's activities in San Francisco and Washington before the conference, as well as his return to Chongqing and then his trip to Moscow for the conference, show not only Chongqing's attitude, but also the anxiety of Britain and the United States about the East Asian problem. Because the persistence of the East Asian war is the most ruthless mockery of their so-called world peace and security mechanism!

So, does this problem, superficially speaking, just depend on a few words from Stalin? In fact, it is not entirely so! Stalin is a realist. In this matter, Stalin can calmly choose the conditions most favorable to the Soviet Union and the world. And the fact is also very obvious, that the conditions that meet his requirements are definitely not to drive the Red Army, which has been fighting for a long time and is exhausted, to fight again, but rather to sit back and lose all kinds of favorable opportunities. Therefore, without saying anything else, just guessing from the East Asian issue, Truman and Churchill's tricks to incite a new war will definitely fail in this three-power conference.

### Fierce Battle Unfolds on Both Sides of the Balikpapan-Samarinda Highway; Japanese Garrison Executes Daring Night Raid

Southwest Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese and U.S. forces are currently engaged in a fierce battle on both sides of the Balikpapan-Samarinda Highway. The battle situation in that area is extremely intense. On the 15th, the enemy used heavy artillery fire and air force bombing as cover to burn down dense forest areas and attack. The Japanese garrison launched a daring night raid that day, killing or wounding 150 enemy soldiers and repelling the enemy aircraft.

Southern Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Although it has been two weeks since the U.S. and Australian forces landed in Balikpapan, they have still been unable to capture the Japanese army positions guarding the hills behind the city. The enemy has attacked several times, but all have been met with strong counterattacks by the Japanese army, only increasing their casualties. The enemy on the Samarinda Highway has only advanced eight kilometers, but has also suffered significant blows due to Japanese counterattacks. The hilly area has been reduced to plains due to the enemy's intense bombing by naval guns and other artillery. However, the morale of all officers and soldiers below the Japanese commander is very high, and they have completely stopped the enemy's advance. On the contrary, the enemy's fighting spirit has been quite frustrated due to the high number of casualties, and they have stopped attacking and are exclusively engaged in collecting the dead and wounded.

Southern Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The battle situation in Balikpapan is still extremely fierce. On July 1st, the enemy dropped airborne troops from the air under the cover of intense artillery fire and bombing. At this time, a certain Indian Volunteer Corps leader led his troops to break into the enemy's ranks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, and he himself died heroically in the bombing.

### Church Schools All Bombed

South Front Base, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The enemy's propaganda warfare, alongside their military operations, is actively deployed. Their propaganda targeting the Southern cities of the East Indies is becoming increasingly apparent. For instance, on the 11th of this month, the enemy's frontline broadcast, drawing a parallel from the Balikpapan front, used naval bombardments and bombings during enemy landings as its subject matter. They played their usual low trick of fabricating broadcasts, hoping to incite anti-Japanese sentiment among the East Indians. Moreover, recent instances of enemy atrocities in the East Indies are too numerous to list. For example, on June 29th, when enemy aircraft bombed the city streets of Balikpapan, they targeted churches and schools, harming innocent children. On June 16th, the strafing of Pagelaran destroyed the central mosque. On July 12th, the indiscriminate bombing of an East Indian hospital in Surabaya occurred, and on the 11th, public schools in the same area were strafed. Furthermore, they also shot and killed farmers engaged in increasing food production. In Celebes, Borneo, and along the coast of Java, they indiscriminately bombed and strafed sailing ships. All these atrocities have pained the East Indians, who deeply resent their contempt for East Asians and do not believe the enemy's clever words.

### Oshima Island Air Raid

Central Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Approximately 150 enemy fighter aircraft attacked Oshima Island from the morning of the 18th until 3 PM. The Japanese forces intercepted them, shooting down one plane. Japanese damage was slight.

### Ministry of Industry Urges Localities to Form Rice Industry Associations

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Considering that the new rice crop is about to come to market, the Ministry of Industry believes that the work of local rice industry trade associations needs to be actively developed. However, many counties and cities have not yet completed the reorganization of local rice industry trade associations since they were changed from a district-based system to a county/city-based system in April of this year. The Ministry has instructed the provincial governments to direct their subordinates to quickly establish rice industry trade associations at the county and city level before July 21st.

### Japanese Forces in Burma Shift to Offensive, Crossing the Kisapanadi River in Pursuit

Burma Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese forces, having crossed the Kisapanadi River and shifted to the offensive, broke through the enemy's strongholds during the advance. Without pausing for rest, they forced the enemy to retreat, inflicting great damage. They are now actively expanding their gains. The Japanese forces completely captured the enemy positions at Zongjiaxiu and Meiqiu on the 19th of the lunar calendar. After securing strongholds in these two locations, they launched fierce bayonet attacks and rapidly pursued the defeated enemy with numerous bayonet squads, continuously expanding their gains. Since the start of the Kisapanadi River crossing operation until today, the confirmed results are as follows: over 1,000 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, two aircraft shot down, and a large number of military supplies captured (not including the results from the Meiqiu battle).

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Actively Mobilizes Labor

Suzhou, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – In order to establish a wartime system and mobilize the people of various counties, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has established a Labor Section. Under the leadership of the acting Provincial Governor, they have actively mobilized labor for construction projects for several months, achieving excellent results. Labor Sections have also been uniformly established in the county governments. The provincial government is now actively planning to strengthen labor organization and manage labor groups, enabling them to engage in the construction of roads and air defense facilities. This will absorb some of the surplus labor in society and reduce unemployment, truly a policy that achieves two goals with one action.

### Ministry of People's Training Convenes Work Conference

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Civil Corps Training Department of the Central Party Headquarters, in order to discuss promoting civil training work, has scheduled a Civil Training Work Conference for 10:00 AM on the 20th in the department's auditorium. Standing committee members and heads of civil training departments dispatched by the party headquarters of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Huai provinces, as well as Nanjing and Shanghai, will bring their proposals and work reports to Nanjing on the 19th to register. Minister Mei, along with Vice Ministers Wang and Liu, will personally preside over the meeting, and senior officials from the department will also attend and participate in the discussion.

### Potsdam Conference Discusses Various Key Points

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters special correspondent, the Three-Headed Conference in Potsdam officially began discussing various key topics yesterday evening. The increased frequency of consultations among the chiefs of staff and foreign ministers of the three countries suggests that important issues are being actively discussed by all parties. President Truman visited Prime Minister Churchill near noon yesterday, accompanied by his personal secretary Ross, army advisor Vaughn, and naval advisor Farda. After a brief meeting, they had lunch together and then continued to meet for a long time, although the conversation was limited to the two of them. At the same time, US Secretary of State Byrnes also had lunch with British Foreign Secretary Eden at his villa. Afterwards, Truman and Churchill had a brief meeting with their secretaries of state and foreign ministers. In the afternoon, President Truman, accompanied by Secretary of State Byrnes, visited Marshal Stalin for a meeting. According to previous regulations established during the last Three-Headed Conference, no information regarding the issues discussed or any statements made during the current conference is allowed to be disclosed to the outside world. Therefore, even information about the meetings among the military leaders of the three countries is being kept strictly confidential. However, the residents of Berlin, who are suffering from severe famine, are now forced to anxiously hope for some indication regarding their future prospects, as their homeland has lost its autonomy.

### Policies of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A Zurich dispatch from the Asahi Shimbun of this area described the Three-Headed Conference and the world policies of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, with the main points as follows: The Soviet Union's focus in its policy towards Germany is to completely grasp the German people and establish a positive policy for the reconstruction of Germany. However, to date, the US and British policies towards Germany have no clear plan, only causing resentment among the Germans and exposing their indecisiveness towards Germany. Chairman Stalin has held six meetings with President Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan of Chongqing to negotiate with the Chongqing side. This has forced the United States into a new position, proving that the United States' preparations for the Three-Headed Conference have fallen behind. The Soviet Union's realistic policy is to believe that cooperation with Chongqing is more promising than cooperation with the United States, so that it can consolidate its political and military position in China in the future to counter the United States and Britain, and to ensure friendship between the Soviet Union and Chongqing. In order to attempt a landing operation on the Japanese mainland, the United States must control the Japanese army in Manchuria. Therefore, in East Asia, it also needs the Soviet Union's assistance, but only to a certain extent, and it will not allow the Soviet Union to exceed its limits. This is the foundation of the United States' current diplomacy towards the Soviet Union and also its weakness. Although the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have different political views, they may propose to issue a joint statement on East Asia at this Potsdam Conference. From Japan's standpoint, this is the beginning of a new international situation, which is noteworthy.

### Hu Shize Continues Negotiations in the Soviet Union

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Due to the widespread discussion in British and American newspapers that the Moscow talks between Stalin and Song Ziwen were "China's Yalta Conference" or "a Yalta-style for the Far East," the negotiations did not yield results after two weeks, and the announcement of the cessation of talks was merely to ease the tense atmosphere. According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th, after the Stalin-Song Ziwen talks ceased, Vice Minister Hu Shize remained in Moscow to continue negotiations on specific issues agreed upon in principle. Furthermore, after Song Ziwen returns to Chongqing, he is scheduled to carry new instructions for further negotiations and return to Moscow to resume talks.

### Britain Declares Protection of Greek Territorial Integrity

Zurich, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The dispute over the Greek border is gradually intensifying. Greece, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria have all gathered heavy troops in their border regions, causing an unusually tense situation. Due to this, British forces, previously scheduled to withdraw this winter, may remain in the area. According to a French news agency dispatch from Athens, Churchill recently declared to Greece that he would guarantee that Greek territorial sovereignty would not be invaded by foreigners, advising them not to worry. Well-equipped British forces have already been deployed along the northern border of Greece, preparing everything to protect the integrity of Greek territory.

### Reconstruction Work in the Soviet Union Actively Underway

Central News Agency Report – According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow, the "Pravda" newspaper here stated that large-scale reconstruction work in the rural areas liberated from German occupation is now underway. In the previously occupied territories of the Russian Republic alone, the Germans destroyed one million collective farmers' houses, 850,000 rural buildings, and 7,250 hospitals. In the Smolensk region, approximately 2,000 villages were burned, and in the Moscow region, 600 villages were burned. In Belarus and Ukraine, all villages were destroyed by fire, hence the large-scale building reconstruction plan. Despite the difficult situation during wartime, it is still being implemented according to plan. In the Russian Republic alone, 563,000 houses have been built or restored, and approximately 2,250,000 people have moved from earth and ruins into these new houses. It is estimated that the government has spent over 155 million rubles on the construction costs of houses destroyed by the Germans during the occupation. In the year since the Germans were driven out of Belarus, 137,000 collective farmers' houses have been successively completed in the countryside, and other large-scale reconstruction work is also actively underway in Ukraine and the Baltic republics.

### Wilson Succeeds as US Treasury Secretary

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A dispatch from Washington states that President Truman announced on the 17th that he appointed Wilson, the Director of the Office of War Mobilization, to succeed Morgenthau as Secretary of the Treasury. Wilson's vacancy will be filled by his friend, former banker Nasda.

### King of Belgium Resumes Power

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A broadcast from Brussels stated that the Belgian Senate yesterday passed a resolution to restore King Leopold's power. The resolution also passed in both houses, with the Senate passing it by a vote of 77 to 50.

Travel Notes

### Songjiang Today

— Zhi Cheng

Songjiang, formerly known as Yunjian, has the county seat also called Rongcheng, and is also known as Lou Village. To the west of the seat is Wu Wang , with the Huangpu River encircling it to the south, and the Nine Peaks arranged to the north. The people are accustomed to ease and comfort, and dislike traveling far. Therefore, officials who go thousands of miles, if only to be warm and fed, immediately plan to return home.

The county's transportation has always been convenient. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway obliquely crosses the county, and there are stations in the county seat, as well as Xingzhuang, Xinqiao, Mingxingqiao, Shihuo, and Fengjing. There are seven highways, including Song-Hu, Song-Si, Song-Feng, Hu-Hang, Si-Shi, Pu-Nan, and Yu, connecting all places. Waterways to Shanghai, Pinghu, Jinshan, and other counties have regular small boats coming and going. Since the opening of rice and grain, the amount of food coming to Shanghai via Songjiang from various places has been considerable.

The city is over nine li in circumference, and there are few residents. Within the city, broken walls and ruins are everywhere, and there is no commercial market to speak of, only numerous government offices. The commercial market is most lively in the area outside the West Gate, with stores standing in rows. The streets have been widened after the war, changing the past obstruction. The Dongyue Temple is full of stalls selling groceries and vegetables, somewhat like the City God Temple in Shanghai and the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, but without their neatness. The attached postal city and the underworld are full of decaying statues, and the air is gloomy, said to have been built during the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty. To the southwest of the city is Zui Bai Chi, which was Gu Dashen's villa. It now belongs to the Infant Hall, with small ponds of lotus fragrance and sparse windows and bamboo shadows. The location is secluded, and the scenery is especially clear and quiet.

Cracking Down on Illegal Activities

The county borders the East China Sea to the south, and the Huangpu River crosses through it, resulting in a worse environment in the Pu-Nan districts. The northern region has many mountains, which are areas where various troops move in and out. The first, second, fourth, and fifth districts are relatively peaceful. The county's security team × squadron, together with the police station, maintains local order, and public security is improving day by day.

Not long ago, some lawless individuals often went to various shops, restaurants, and hotels, relying on their power to squander and spend without paying a cent. Sometimes they would even use Shen Zhuang's overdue large checks, asking for cash back. Otherwise, they would use their fists and feet, or face each other with weapons. Therefore, the legitimate customers of various shops and hotels would avoid them. Daily business losses were over a million at most, and at least over ten thousand. The shop owners could not bear it, and closed their businesses, turning the only lively market outside the city into a bleak and cold scene. The county authorities, aware of the seriousness of the situation, specially worked with the Allied military police and the police station to strictly crack down and decisively deal with the lawless individuals. They ordered the shops to reopen, and only recently has everything completely cleared up.

Rice and Agricultural Products

The total land area of the county is 967,202 mu, of which 654,671 mu are farmland, mostly paddy fields. The main products are rice and cotton. The annual rice production is about 100,000 shi, wheat and barley about 20,000 shi, cotton about 45,000 dan, rapeseed over 10,000 dan, soybeans over 10,000 dan, and other agricultural products, the amount of which is not easy to estimate.

The county is known as the hometown of rice. Recently, due to the rising cost of living and the heavy burden of various donations and taxes, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the ability to purchase fertilizer is quite weak. Furthermore, due to poor public security in various districts, the output is also decreasing. Comparing the above figures with before the war, it has decreased by five-tenths. Since the lifting of the rice ban, although there has been a constant stream of vendors on the road, the export situation has become ordinary.

Other products, such as the purple perilla of San Mu Tian outside the East Gate and the lotus root of Heyangbang, are better than those elsewhere. The four-gill perch has always been famous, with those produced under Xiuye Bridge being the best. In September of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), Dr. Goto, a first-class Japanese writer, came to Songjiang to specially visit this product. After returning home, he wrote an article "Visit to Songjiang Perch," published in the newspaper. Animal husbandry is mainly chicken and pig farming, which are sold to Shanghai in winter.

Regarding agricultural loans, a branch office was established on July 3rd, and a committee was organized, with the county magistrate and financial giants as members. A sub-office was established under the committee to handle loan matters. It is said that the total amount of loans in Songjiang is 250 million yuan, which will be allocated by the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Products Office. The loans are credit-guaranteed, jointly guaranteed by the township and village chiefs, and each household can borrow up to 250,000 yuan for the purchase of agricultural tools and fertilizers. When asked, local farmers hope that the procedures will be simple and quick to meet their urgent needs; they should be direct and avoid middlemen, in order to increase the use of the funds.

Education and Charity

Jiangsu education was quite developed before the war, with about 220 schools. Afterwards, after many vicissitudes, it declined greatly. Among all school-age children in the county, the proportion of those who have dropped out of school is over seven-tenths. Recently, due to the improper management of education leaders, all facilities are not only following old ways and seeking personal gain, but even embezzling school rents and deducting rice rations, which is outrageous. The current authorities are determined to rectify this, replacing the director of the Education Bureau, using the over 9,000 mu of school land to improve school funding, raising over 10 million yuan from all sectors to subsidize teachers, and planning to provide scholarships to benefit poor students.

Various charitable undertakings are currently managed by the Charity Temporary Relief Association. The Infant Hall, Relief for the Elderly, and the Three Halls currently house 120 elderly people and women, 100 widowed women (an average of three per household), and over 50 infants with disabilities and nursing infants, totaling 4-500 people. Also, the Christian Church used to have a Songjiang Orphanage, housing 80 poor orphans. Recently, it has taken in 35 more orphans (evacuated from Shanghai to Songjiang), totaling 115. The monthly food cost is over 10 million yuan. At this time of high prices, the interruption of food is worrisome. We hope that all benefactors and enthusiastic gentlemen and merchants from Songjiang living in Shanghai will generously donate so that poor and orphaned children will have a place to avoid freezing and starvation.

### Municipal Government Discusses Relief for Air Raid Victims Yesterday, Hoping Citizens Will Intensify Air Raid Precautions and Speed Up Evacuation

On the 17th and 18th of this month, enemy aircraft carried out indiscriminate bombings, resulting in many innocent civilian deaths and injuries, and the destruction of many houses. Municipal Government Secretary-General Luo had personally visited the disaster areas the day before to express condolences on behalf of Mayor Zhou. Yesterday morning (the 19th), he convened a temporary meeting in the Municipal Government conference room, attended by directors of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government, as well as personnel from the Air Defense Headquarters, to conduct meticulous and practical discussions on issues such as rescuing and providing relief to the affected victims after the enemy air raids. First, Chief of General Affairs Noguchi of the Air Defense Headquarters, Deputy Director Du Zhengjian of the Municipal Police Bureau, and Directors Yuan of the Health Bureau, Liu of the Economic Bureau, of the Education Bureau, and Zhou of the Social Welfare Bureau gave detailed reports. Secretary-General Luo and Deputy Secretary-General Hu gave detailed instructions, urging all colleagues in the bureaus and departments to strive for simplification of administration during this extraordinary period, to do their best to rescue the affected victims, and to quickly adjust any unreasonable phenomena. For example, some hospitals charged huge consultation fees for treating victims injured in air raids, which should be severely punished. He also instructed the health authorities to immediately formulate a comprehensive management plan for the city's hospitals, medical staff, medical supplies, and other resources. Regarding the compensation and reward measures for those injured or killed while rescuing disaster-stricken people, the Air Defense Headquarters was instructed to formulate them as soon as possible so that they could be quickly distributed by the Municipal Government. Other measures, such as the relief for the families of the victims, the provision of food, the announcement of disaster victim or shelter locations, and the announcement of temporary rescue hospitals in various districts, have all been decided and can be implemented immediately. It is especially hoped that citizens will intensify air defense facilities and speed up evacuation to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.

Citizens Welfare Association to Hold Emergency Meeting Today

The Citizens Welfare Association, considering that the refugees in this city who have suffered from the air raids are displaced and suffering unbearably and urgently need relief, has decided to hold an emergency meeting at 5 PM today (the 20th) in the Shen Bao Social Conference Room to discuss all matters such as promoting relief work. The list of all directors of the meeting is as follows: Wen Ting, Li Sihao, Zhao Qing, Yuan Ludeng, Ye Fuzhen, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Chen Shao, Chen Riping, Wang Boyuan, Zhu Boquan, Sun Ruihuang, Jiang Shangda, Jin Xiongbo, Chen Bin, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Nanqun, Director General Hu Qi.

Hospitals Receiving the Injured Must Inquire About Names and Addresses

Recently, enemy aircraft have carried out indiscriminate bombings in Shanghai, resulting in many deaths and injuries to innocent civilians. Fortunately, the authorities have perfect air defense facilities and are making special efforts in rescue work. The injured are quickly rescued and sent to various hospitals for treatment. However, in the rush to rescue the injured under air raids, it is difficult to inquire in detail about the names, addresses, and families of the injured, making it difficult to visit and retrieve the injured. In view of this, the Municipal Health Bureau immediately notified all public and private hospitals in the city that they should inquire in detail about the names, addresses, and families of patients received during air raids and record them. If they cannot speak, they can examine their residence permits and record them. Their names and addresses should be disclosed in various newspapers or their families should be notified directly at the address.

### Police Department Orders All Branches to Strengthen Air Defense Facilities and Urges Citizens to Dig Artesian Wells

In light of the repeated attacks by enemy aircraft on Shanghai, the Municipal Police Department, in order to prepare for any eventuality, has ordered all branches to strengthen air defense facilities. In addition to opening appropriate air raid shelters, they are also digging water storage ponds and wells for air defense, in order to prevent the interruption of tap water supply in case of emergency. At the same time, the public is urged to strengthen air defense facilities. Ideally, each neighborhood should dig an artesian well in order to cope with emergencies.

Air Defense Training Should be Given More Importance

On the 17th and 18th of this month, Shanghai was indiscriminately bombed by enemy American aircraft, resulting in injuries to about 1,500 innocent residents of Chinese, Japanese, and foreign nationalities. However, after this large-scale bombing by enemy aircraft, it is inevitable that they will repeatedly attack again. In view of the tragic damage, citizens must pay more attention to air defense training. The points previously warned by the authorities should be given more attention. Most of the deaths and injuries in the disaster-stricken areas occurred because people did not enter air raid shelters after the police issued warnings, or they looked up at the sky from windows, or they boldly walked on the roads. On the other hand, at a certain Japanese national school in the eastern district, upon hearing the air raid siren, everyone immediately entered the air raid shelter to wait for shelter. Therefore, although they were hit by many direct hits, no one was slightly injured, which shows how important it is to take shelter. In addition, in order to prepare for air raids, clothes and food should be dispersed in advance, and when taking shelter during air raids, or during difficult times, some clothes, enough food for two days, and emergency first aid items such as gauze and disinfectants should be carried. Although the Air Defense Headquarters has made full preparations for the rescue of victims, when the bombed area is large, it is inevitable that there will be areas that cannot be comprehensively taken care of in terms of time. Citizens are urged to pay special attention to this point.

### County Administration Director's Duties to be Acted Upon by Deputy Director

Cai, the director of the Municipal and County Government Administration Office, was previously transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, and officially took office at the bureau on the first of this month. As the newly appointed Director Shen Xin has not yet taken over, the duties of the vacated Director position are still being handled by him. Now that Cai's affairs at the Finance Bureau are busy, and he is unable to take care of the administrative office affairs, he has applied for and been approved by the Mayor, and before the new director takes over, all duties of the Director of the County Government Administration Office will be temporarily exercised by the Deputy Director Hu Zongwang in accordance with the law.

### Real Estate Transactions Subject to Income Tax

The Shanghai District Income Tax Collection Bureau recently received a provisional measure for the collection of Category 1, Item C income tax issued by the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that the bureau has now followed the provisions of Article 3 of this measure, and all those who engage in real estate transactions using speculative profit-making methods will be taxed according to the rules for temporary profit-making businesses. However, real estate companies registered with the government, who pay Category 1, Item A income tax every year, will still be taxed according to the usual practice after the annual accounts are closed, and will be exempt from temporary profit-making income tax. The bureau has separately notified the Municipal Finance and Land Administration Bureaus and relevant agencies to assist. Hereafter, companies and firms that are not registered, or engage in real estate transactions under other names for the purpose of profit, must declare to the bureau before the transaction is concluded. If they are discovered or reported, they will be severely punished according to law and will not be leniently treated.

### Housing Subletting Licenses to Issue Application Forms on a Regular Basis

The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau has stipulated that application forms for subletting licenses for landlords in the old 18 districts for the second half of this year will be issued starting on the 25th of this month, in order to fill out and exchange for new licenses.

### Brokerage Firms to Declare Business Tax

The Association of Brokers of the Chinese Securities Exchange recently notified its members that the method for reporting and paying business tax for the industry has been agreed upon with the authorities. All spring business tax will be reported based on 15 per mille of the business commission income for the three months of October, November, and December of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, plus a 20% late payment penalty. Those with business commission income of one million yuan should pay 18,000 yuan in business tax. In addition, summer business tax will be reported based on 15 per mille of the business commission income for three months of this year's January, but there is no late payment penalty. The application process has already begun.

Reader's Education Aid News

### Hoping Wealthy Families' Children Rise Up to Rescue Those Out of School

Ms. Chen Xiuqin Takes the Lead in Responding

The most important thing about the educational aid movement is practical action. If I can donate independently, that is the best thing. Even if I don't have the economic ability, I should gather relatives and friends to donate together, introduce them around, and promote each other. Then the goal of 30 million yuan can be achieved in no time. Yesterday, the Zhide Hall recognized a donation to the honorary team, with the Hall's name. They did not want to publicize their real name, which shows the sincerity of their kindness. Peng Xijun and an anonymous person each donated 500,000 yuan, and Zhengda Factory and Xu Jingui each recognized a team. They all came in person in the pouring rain, which is very touching! Rongyi Records adopted the "collective sub-recognition method," donating 100,000 yuan alone, and Hua Ji and Fan Zhi Ji each 50,000 yuan, integrating 200,000 yuan into one team. The people of the same company are very happy to help with education with enthusiasm. We hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will respond and make this year's aid funds achieve their goals as soon as possible, and the merits will be immeasurable! Ms. Chen Xiuqin, a student at Mingde Girls' High School, automatically asked her father to donate a team, and attached a letter advising the children of wealthy families to promote this and rescue out-of-school children together. This young girl has the good heart to cultivate talents, and her father actually promised a lot of money. The perfection of family education can be imagined.

Birthday Gifts All Used for Charity

Peng Xijun wrote in a letter: Yesterday was my humble birthday, and I am deeply grateful for the gifts from relatives and friends. In addition to donating 500,000 yuan to the Xinwen Bao Education Fund, 100,000 yuan each to the Small Business Loan Fund, the Library Fund, and the Medical Loan Fund, and donating 1 million yuan to repair the Hunan Guild Hall, and 50,000 yuan each to the Shanghai Zhongshan Voluntary School, Guangyi School, Shanghai Minyi School, and the Humorous Cartoon Society, I specially send another check for 500,000 yuan, donating it to your newspaper's education fund, as a blessing for relatives and friends.

Feeling Uneasy About Seeing Others Out of School

Chen Xiuqin, a first-year student at Mingde Girls' High School, wrote in a letter: I am a graduate of elementary school and am now entering junior high school. In this situation of soaring prices and rising cost of living, I can still study with peace of mind, which can be said to be fortunate. On the contrary, many children are out of school because their families are poor and their parents cannot afford their tuition fees. How unfortunate and pitiful! Among these unfortunate children, many are very smart and hardworking. How can we watch them drop out of school halfway because they can't afford tuition? Although I can study with peace of mind, I can't bear to watch many children suffer from being out of school. Therefore, I told my parents what I meant and asked them to give me 150,000 yuan to donate to the Shen Bao Education Fund. My father listened and greatly agreed, and immediately gave me a check for 150,000 yuan, but what is the use of 150,000 yuan? This small amount is useless. Although my parents strongly agree with my idea, my family is not wealthy, so I cannot donate a large amount, which is very regrettable. I hope that many children from wealthy families will respond, and accumulating a small amount can help some children who are out of school.

### Donations and Taxes Over 10,000 Yuan Can Be Paid with Sight Drafts

In order to facilitate citizens' payment of various donations and taxes, the Municipal Finance Bureau has stipulated that from now on, donations and taxes of less than 10,000 yuan should be paid in cash, and amounts of 10,000 yuan or more can be paid with general sight drafts. The collecting agencies must not force the payment of cash. It has been ordered to inform all subordinates.

### Exchange of Negotiable Instruments Every Other Day Mostly Decided

Due to the recent frequent increase in the number of negotiable instruments among banks and money changers in this city, the exchange procedures have become increasingly difficult, resulting in an increase in the daily exchange differences and the number of returned negotiable instruments. Disputes between customers and customers, and between paying and receiving banks, also arise from this. In order to solve the difficulties and meet the needs, the joint meeting of banks and money changers discussed the exchange of negotiable instruments every other day. As a result, the principle was fully approved, and the detailed rules were decided to be drafted separately by the bankers' and money changers' associations, and then submitted to the joint meeting of banks and money changers for discussion and adoption, and implemented uniformly on a regular basis. According to information from the financial sector, the two associations have both approved the principle of exchanging negotiable instruments every other day, which is inevitable. The two associations have separately submitted the matter to the small group and the practical affairs committee for careful discussion of the articles of implementation rules. The detailed rules of the banking industry have been passed, and the small group meeting of the money changing industry will discuss them again within the day. The official implementation date will be around the end of this month at the latest. However, the original provision in the Negotiable Instruments Law requires that negotiable instruments be exchanged on the same day. Now, due to the factual difficulties of the two industries, in order to prepare for the exchange of negotiable instruments every other day, a document is being prepared to be submitted to the financial authorities of the Ministry of Finance for record, in order to seek a legal basis.

### The Fifth Phase of Gold Securities will Continue to be Issued Within Days, Prices to be Determined According to Reasonable Standards

Since the issuance of the Central Reserve Bank's gold securities, the gold market has gradually stabilized. After the postponement of the fifth phase of gold securities, due to the stirrings of the speculative market and the incitement of unfounded rumors, the absorption of gold has become increasingly strong, and market prices have skyrocketed, which has greatly affected social people's livelihood and public order. It is reported that the bank is now planning to issue the fifth phase of gold securities within a few days in order to suppress the skyrocketing gold prices and give the speculative merchants a head-on blow. It is reported that the listing price will be determined according to reasonable standards.

Gold Securities Market Conditions

Yesterday, the gold securities market rose sharply, all breaking through the 7 million mark and closing at the limit, but with demand exceeding supply, trading was not active. The closing prices are as follows:

Due Securities: highest 7,080,000 yuan, lowest 6,150,000 yuan, limit 7,080,000 yuan, up 930,000 yuan.

Phase Four Securities: highest 7,130,000 yuan, lowest 6,200,000 yuan, limit 7,130,000 yuan, up 930,000 yuan.

### Bad Check Case Continues to Develop

The Lao Zha Police Station recently uncovered a case in which a criminal indiscriminately issued bad checks, defrauding major restaurants and companies of more than 20 million yuan. Further investigation has revealed further developments. It was found that the criminal, Li Afu, also used his friend's "China Industrial Bank" and "Fishery Bank" checkbooks, each, to indiscriminately issue bad checks outside, defrauding people of property. The account names and records have been blurred, but there is a signature of "Li Afu" on the back of each check. Therefore, the police station hopes that if any major stores, companies, or entertainment venues have been victimized by this type of bad check, they should report it to the third section of the police station within two days in order to close the case and transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.

### Convert Dance Halls into Hospitals for Disaster Victims

— Zhang Mengzhao

On the 17th and 18th of this month, Shanghai was bombed, and I don't know how much damage the citizens' lives and property suffered. The tragic situation of severed heads and broken feet is truly unbearable to look at. In such a serious environment, no one can guarantee what will happen tomorrow, and there is a possibility of being cruelly sacrificed at any time. According to the human duty of helping each other in the same boat, no one can avoid it. Everyone should do their best to rescue and help those in disaster. In view of the lack of hospitals to treat severely injured citizens, I suggest borrowing many dance halls in the city as temporary hospitals. I remember that during the early days of the August 13th Incident, many dance halls in the concessions were converted into temporary refugee shelters and hospitals for wounded soldiers, turning places of extravagant enjoyment into places that express the spirit of human mutual assistance. Today's situation is no less serious than in the past. I sincerely hope that the authorities and enthusiastic people from all walks of life will give this matter more consideration, and the disaster victims will be fortunate.

### Please Set Up a Refugee Relief Committee Immediately by the Municipal Government

— Huan

Enemy aircraft have launched large-scale attacks on Shanghai for days, indiscriminately bombing the city. The northeastern district of the city has suffered heavy damage, many civilian houses have collapsed, and about a thousand civilians have been killed or injured. Regarding emergency relief measures for disaster victims, it is reported that enthusiastic people from all walks of life have initiated the organization of a temporary refugee relief association to handle relief work.

However, enemy aircraft may come to attack more frequently in the future! Any corner of this city is vulnerable to bombing. We should now prepare for air defense equipment and rescue work, and at the same time, we cannot ignore the issue of relief after the disaster. I believe that the Municipal Standing Committee should immediately organize a city-wide refugee relief committee, unite with enthusiastic people from all walks of life in this city to work together, and pre-plan specific relief measures for the entire city. In addition to allocating regular expenses from the government, it can also actively raise donations from all walks of life to prepare for temporary relief. The current work of the committee can be divided into the following points:

(1) Raise funds and foundation: The committee's regular office expenses can be designated by the municipal government for a certain amount as a subsidy. As for the relief expenses, they are quite large, and there should be full preparation as early as possible to avoid digging a well only when thirsty. If a huge amount of funds can be raised, it should be managed by a management committee organized by the municipal government together with impartial people from society.

(2) Regarding the post-disaster issues in the disaster area: In the bombed disaster area, walls are broken, corpses are lying horizontally, and the aftermath should be dealt with, especially in this summer, which is even more harmful to public health. Therefore, the work of concentrating, storing, and burying corpses, clearing rubble and roads, and repairing collapsed houses is urgent.

(3) Regarding refugee relief issues: Most of the disaster-stricken refugees have lost their families and their properties have been destroyed. The situation of orphans and widows who have lost their homes and are displaced is especially tragic. In order to seek temporary relief, it is necessary to pre-arrange several refugee shelters so that in the event of an accident, the disaster victims can be concentrated and taken care of, solving the problem of their residence. At the same time, the problem of their food should also be solved, such as providing porridge or bread to avoid the suffering of hunger, and then overall arrange for their post-disaster measures, classify the situation, order them to evacuate to their original residence or other designated locations, or transfer them to charitable organizations for adoption, so as to ensure that innocent disaster victims can obtain appropriate homes and not be in a dead end and have no way to complain.

The above points are only a few of the major points of the relief work. As for the organization of the Refugee Relief Committee and the entire method, it remains to be adopted by the Municipal Government and carefully discussed. I hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will cooperate and promote this as soon as possible.

### Relief for Air Raid Victims: Donations from All Walks of Life

On the 17th and 18th of this month, this city suffered air raids, and the civilians in the Hudong district suffered the most, with many displaced and homeless people. Yesterday, this newspaper published that various social organizations will promote relief work, and enthusiastic people from all walks of life have sent donations to this newspaper. This newspaper believes that relief is a matter of great importance and should not be shirked, and has already begun to collect donations on behalf of others. In one day, a total of more than 15 million yuan was received, which shows that all walks of life care about the disaster situation and cooperate in donating to help the disaster victims, which is truly immeasurable merit.

This newspaper will announce the names of the donors and show appreciation. It will also transfer the donations collected on behalf of others to formal relief organizations for distribution and use. I also ask that influential people from all walks of life, with a human heart, continue to make generous donations to achieve great results. The details of donations received are as follows:

(1) Yizhong Coal Industry Company wrote in a letter: "This city has suffered sudden air raids these days, and residents have been killed and injured. The company has donated 15 million yuan to be evenly distributed to your newspaper and the Xinwen Bao and Dalu Xinwen Bao on behalf of the victims. Enclosed is a check for 5 million yuan. Please accept it."

(2) Qi Wenzhi, Wang Zizhi, and 19 others wrote in a letter: "This time, the northeastern region of this city suffered a tragic bombing, with more than a thousand casualties, which is unbearable to hear. We witnessed this and could not sit idly by. We have collected donations of 5 million yuan and sent a letter. Please accept it and forward it to the relief agencies to fulfill our obligations as citizens. We are grateful."

(3) Bu Liang, accountant of Pingliang Law and Accounting Firm, wrote in a letter: "This city has been bombed, and countless innocent civilians have been killed and injured. They are in dire need of help. Zhengtai Firm has collected 1.5 million yuan and instructed us to transfer it to the relief agencies. Enclosed is a check. We are grateful."

(4) Mr. Xie Jikai wrote in a letter: "I have been living in Shanghai for more than ten years and have been ill for many years, relying on the care of relatives and friends. I am grateful for their kindness. Recently, this city has been bombed, and the civilians in the Hudong district have suffered even more, and are in need of relief. I have prepared a check for 1 million yuan and sent it to you for collection and transfer to the relief agencies, hoping to inspire others to donate."

(5) Rencheng Firm wrote in a letter: "The colleagues of the firm, in view of the heavy casualties, we have collected 1 million yuan in relief funds, which we would like to send to you for transfer, and to express our humble devotion."

Jiming Hospital Offers Free Treatment

Jiming Hospital has launched free medical treatment for civilians injured in air raids. Anyone injured in air raids can be sent to the hospital for treatment (free of charge) from July 21. It has also set up a hundred sickbeds to provide free hospitalization and treatment for those seriously injured. It is reported that the funds needed, in addition to being raised by the hospital's colleagues, are feared to be a drop in the bucket and will not help much. A special appeal is made to all walks of life to donate. Those who wish to donate money and medicine can send them to the following collection points for official receipts: (1) Donation Collection Points: Changcheng Bank (123 Dashalu), Huatai Bank (37 Tianjin Road), Zhenfeng Qianzhuang (229 Shandong Road), Guo Yu Qianzhuang (290 Beijing Road), (2) Collection of Medicines: Shanghai Jiming Hospital (end of North Xizang Road).

Daguan Yaji to Broadcast and Raise Donations
