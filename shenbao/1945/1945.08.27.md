Chongqing, 26th – The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and related agreements, notes, and records were signed in Moscow on August 13th. The Soviet government approved them on August 25th. Our side submitted them to the Central Standing Committee, the Supreme National Defense Council, and the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and approval on August 24th. Our government has now approved them on August 25th and authorized the public announcement of the full text. The main points are as follows:

Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance

The purpose of this treaty is to ensure that China and the Soviet Union jointly fight against Japan until complete victory and to prevent Japan from invading again. The treaty stipulates that if either party is attacked by Japan in the future, the other party will provide military assistance. The rights and obligations of the contracting parties under the Charter of the United Nations are not affected by this treaty. This treaty is valid for thirty years.

Three Statements by the Soviet Union to China

First, the Soviet Union declares that it will provide China with moral, military, and other material assistance, which will be fully provided to the central government of China, namely the National Government.

Second, the Soviet Union reiterates its respect for China's full sovereignty and territorial and administrative integrity in the Three Eastern Provinces.

Third, the Soviet Union declares that it has no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs.

Outer Mongolia, China Changchun Railway Issues

The Chinese government declares that after Japan's surrender, if Outer Mongolia, according to a referendum, realizes its desire for independence, China will recognize Outer Mongolia's independence. The Soviet Union declares that the Soviet side will respect the political independence and territorial integrity of Outer Mongolia.

The main lines of the China Eastern and South Manchuria Railways are called the China Changchun Railway, jointly owned and operated by China and the Soviet Union for a term of thirty years, after which they will be returned to China free of charge. The above-mentioned railway is purely a commercial transportation enterprise. The railway police are organized by the Chinese government and are not run by the railway itself. Except during the period when China and the Soviet Union are jointly fighting against Japan, the railway will not transport Soviet troops. Joint ownership and joint operation are limited to the railway auxiliary lines built by the China Eastern Railway during the period of Russian and Sino-Soviet co-management and the South Manchuria Railway during the period of Russian management, which are directly needed by the two railways, and the affiliated enterprises built during the above-mentioned period that directly supply the railway. All other railway branch lines and affiliated enterprises shall be wholly owned by China.

Agreements on Dalian and Lüshun

Dalian: The Chinese government declares Dalian a free port, open to all countries for trade and shipping. All administrative power in Dalian belongs to China, but the port director is appointed by Soviet personnel, and the opening is set for thirty years. Lüshun: Within the thirty-year period of validity of the Sino-Soviet Lüshun Agreement, the port of Lüshun will be a naval base jointly used by China and the Soviet Union. Civil administration in the area is under Chinese jurisdiction, and a Sino-Soviet Military Commission will be established in the area to deal with issues related to joint use.

Establishment of Administrative Institutions in the Three Eastern Provinces

The Chinese National Government will send representatives and assistants to establish and command administrative institutions in the recovered areas. The National Government will also send a military delegation to the Soviet General Headquarters for liaison.

Withdrawal of Soviet Troops

Marshal Stalin declared that in the period after Japan's surrender, the withdrawal of troops will begin, and all Soviet troops will be withdrawn from the Three Eastern Provinces within a maximum of three months.

The Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China and the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, desiring to strengthen the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and China through good-neighborly cooperation after the war, have resolved to assist each other in the struggle against the enemy aggressors by the United Nations in this World War and to cooperate with each other in the joint war against Japan until Japan's unconditional surrender. Also, in the interests of the people of the two countries and all peace-loving countries, they express their unwavering desire for cooperation for the purpose of maintaining peace and security. Knowing that, based on the Declaration by United Nations of January 1, 1942, the Four-Nation Declaration signed in Moscow on August 30, 1942, the Four-Nation Declaration signed in Moscow on August 30, 1942, and the principles declared in the Charter of the United Nations International Organization, they decided to sign this treaty.

If either Contracting Party is attacked by Japan and is forced to engage in hostilities, the other Contracting Party shall immediately, to the best of its ability, provide the Contracting Party engaged in hostilities with all military and other assistance and support. This treaty shall remain in effect until the Organization of the United Nations, at the request of both Contracting Parties, assumes responsibility for preventing future aggression by Japan.

Article 4 Each Contracting Party undertakes not to conclude any alliance against the other party, nor to participate in any agreement against the other party.

Article 5 In the interests of their mutual security and economic development, the Contracting Parties agree to engage in friendly cooperation after peace is restored, in accordance with the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs.

Article 6 In order to accelerate the restoration of the two countries after the war and contribute to world prosperity, the Contracting Parties agree to provide each other with all possible economic assistance after the war.

### Reap What You Sow

— Cheng

There is an advertisement in the newspaper that says: "Massive sacrifice, milk powder, originally 500,000 per pound on the market, now only selling for 160,000, limited stock, while supplies last." This is clearly hoarding being released and sold off at a reduced price.

Originally 500,000 on the market, now only selling for 160,000, is indeed a sacrifice, but people will not sympathize with this sacrifice, they will only laugh. Even those willing to pay 160,000 will certainly not be grateful for his cheap sale and thick kindness.

The fruit of today's sacrifice is the cause of yesterday's speculation. Sow the cause, reap the fruit. The way of heaven is fair. Those who speculate and hoard, who were arrogant in the past, may now suffer some setbacks, which can give these people a lesson: those who only know their own private interests and do not care about the public good will eventually reap what they sow.

### Also Talking About Hanging the National Flag

— Lu Liang

After reading Mr. Cheng's "Hanging the National Flag" in the Free Talk on the 21st, I feel that this instruction and correction are very valuable and necessary. I would like to pay my deep respects to Mr. Cheng! However, in addition to what Mr. Cheng wrote, I have a few points to add as follows:

The national flag that does not meet the standards should not be hung. (At least the accuracy of the twelve angles of the national emblem must be maintained).

Faded national flags should not be hung. (Red faded to pink is very undignified.)

The national flag should not be held upside down. (I have seen a few people buy small national flags and hold them in their hands, not raising them, but letting their hands droop while walking, resulting in the national flag being held upside down, which should be corrected.)

The national flag should be hung in the center of the front of the house, on the roof, or on the upper hand side (that is, facing the right), and should not be hung on the lower hand side.

If you are hanging a single national flag against a wall or a shop window, hanging it vertically, the Blue Sky with a White Sun portion should be hung in the upper right corner. If hanging it horizontally, the Blue Sky with a White Sun portion should be hung in the upper left corner. (This has become a habit, and it feels strange if it is hung incorrectly.)

When raising or lowering the national flag, no part of the flag should touch the ground. (This is also one of the respects for the national flag.)

The national flag should not be given to ignorant children as a toy. (To avoid being discarded or soiled in a play.)

The above points are what I have seen at any time, and of course, they are not complete. In short, as Mr. Cheng said: "The method and attitude of hanging the national flag should be based on respect as the principle." I hope that every knowledgeable citizen will stand up and give sincere advice and correction to the various errors in hanging the national flag, so as to create the concept that the national flag is sacred and inviolable, and supreme!

### Double Good News

— Meng Zhao

Old Mrs. Zhu is a very spirited old lady. Since her son, Qingsheng, arrived at the anti-Japanese war camp in Chongqing, almost four years have passed in the blink of an eye! Her love for her son is so strong that not a single second goes by without her leaning against the door or the window, remotely wishing that Qingsheng—her only child—would return with the glory of victory as soon as possible!

One day, she received a bamboo newspaper from the green-clothed messenger, the first safe letter from Qingsheng in three years. She divined with coins and prayed with lamp flowers, finally fulfilling her joy! Because her son's letter was filled with the glorious light of the Chinese nation's victory! The gist was: "Mother! My physique in the anti-Japanese war camp has become even stronger! I also wish you increasing health! We have heard the good news here that the bandits have yielded to justice! The Potsdam Declaration by China, the UK, and the US will soon be realized! I will return with the glory of victory! And return to your loving embrace. I wish you long life like the Chinese nation! Changchun

Before the old lady could finish reading the bamboo report, she suddenly heard the sound of firecrackers from the east and west neighbors and the cheers of the crowd celebrating outside the door, making a clamorous noise. She hurriedly went out to see that the victorious national flags were already flying in the streets and alleys!

### The Awakening of Youth

— Xiu Ru

Eight years of hard struggle have come to a glorious end. While the whole country is rejoicing and celebrating enthusiastically, we should be especially mindful of the importance of the task of future rejuvenation. This work of rejuvenation can be said to be extremely complex, with a heavy burden and a long road ahead!

In the past eight years, thousands upon thousands of young people contributed their blood and sacrificed their lives for the revival of the motherland and the freedom of the nation. We can say that the victory of the War of Resistance is a manifestation of the power of youth!

Youth is the backbone during the war and an even more powerful driving force in the future construction phase. President Chiang has repeatedly announced to us: youth is the new life of the country, the original driving force of society, and the vanguard of the revolution. The responsibility of youth is so important, and the leader's expectations of youth are so earnest, so young people must strive to inspire themselves and serve the country, which requires deep reflection.

Unfortunately, the youth of Shanghai have been forced by the environment for eight years. Although they have patriotic enthusiasm, they have no way to vent it. In this process, on the one hand, they are anesthetized by distorted propaganda, and on the other hand, they are swayed by the intense material temptations of the nouveau riche's extravagance and extreme desires, thus going from forward to passive, and from passive to decadent. For example, the students' speculation and the collective "parties" of university students in the previous period are clear proof. The emergence of this phenomenon directly indicates the corruption of the youth themselves and indirectly illustrates the depression of the youth. Of course, these are temporary phenomena. Now that the bright road has been unfolded before us, I believe that everything in the past will disappear with the darkness.

In the future, the work that young people need to do has been clearly indicated by the leader in the book "China's Destiny." As long as we strengthen our own strength, we can prepare to shoulder the heavy responsibility of rejuvenating and building the country. There are three simple points to pay attention to now: first, eliminate all the wrong thoughts, behaviors, and lifestyles of the past, and cultivate a vigorous and energetic spirit. Second, the things we do in the future must be beneficial to the country and the masses, or at least not harm the interests of the masses. Third, we must be pragmatic and realistic in our work, not being lazy, not exaggerating. At the same time, young people who are generally in school should pay particular attention to whether the subjects they are learning are beneficial to the country. We know that what the country urgently needs to do in the future is large-scale construction work, and what it needs is a large number of technical talents. In the future, China will lay a strong foundation in this great revival and construction. Therefore, everything we learn today must start from this point.

Finally, I hope that every young person can study the words and deeds of the leader more, which provide extremely precise instructions on the principles of being a person and doing things, which will be of great help to their own future.
