### War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia This Past Week

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - The war situation for the past week is as follows:

China Front

In aerial warfare, continuous attacks were launched on Suichuan, Laohekou, Ankang, and other places, achieving significant results.

Japanese Mainland

When enemy aircraft from Mariana bases raided the vicinity of the capital on the 27th of last month, Japanese forces shot down 41 planes, or 80% of the attacking force, inflicting heavy damage. However, small numbers of enemy planes continued to conduct reconnaissance and raids almost daily, aiming for psychological warfare. On the afternoon of the 3rd, approximately 90 enemy aircraft, primarily targeting Nagoya, and another part attacked the vicinity of Osaka and Hamamatsu. During this raid, enemy aircraft began indiscriminately bombing urban areas. In response, Japanese air units launched strong attacks on Saipan Island on January 2nd and 3rd, inflicting heavy damage. On the other hand, to weaken the Ogasawara Islands, the forward base of the Japanese mainland, a small enemy naval force shelled Chichijima and Hahajima on the morning of January 5th, while enemy aircraft repeatedly raided the southwestern islands with small numbers of aircraft more than a dozen times at night. On the Taiwan front, the enemy attempted to cut off Japanese supply lines to the Philippines, with a powerful mobile force appearing in the waters near Taiwan, launching attacks on various parts of Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands with 1,500 carrier-based aircraft on the morning of the 3rd and 400 aircraft on the 4th. Although no enemy aircraft appeared after the 5th, the enemy mobile force continued to patrol the waters east of Taiwan.

Burma Front

In the Nujiang area, the enemy Yunnan Expeditionary Force added two divisions to the 9th Division of the 11th and 20th Army Groups and advanced to the Nujiang area. The first line is currently northwest of Jiashong and near Manmeng, attempting to attack Wanting. Although a portion of the enemy is advancing on the front, it is not of great significance. In northern Burma, a portion of the American-equipped Yu Army advanced to the vicinity of Bhamo, and several British-Indian divisions advanced to the railway line along Myitkyina and the vicinity of Katha and Indaw, coordinating with the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, and their activity is extremely active. Furthermore, the first line of the enemy forces on the Kaladan River front has advanced to the Seing Bu Taung-Buthidaung line and is currently attempting to continue advancing. On the Arakan front, the enemy is advancing along the Kaladan River valley, and the 25th and 26th Divisions are gradually advancing on both sides of the area. Japanese garrison units are bravely fighting on all fronts, ambushing the enemy everywhere.

Southwest Pacific

Enemy aircraft continue to launch large-scale attacks on Halmahera Island. From December 29th to January 2nd, in just five days, the total number of enemy small and medium-sized aircraft reached as many as 381. In Ambon, small formations flying from Halmahera raided daily, with a total of about 80 aircraft over the three days of January 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. On Morotai Island, Japanese ground troops continue to engage in courageous ambush operations, occupying positions on December 25th. The enemy, supported by strong reinforcements from the Barbaro area, attempted to hold the positions, but the Japanese launched surprise attacks, killing over 225 enemy soldiers, destroying four bunkers and two anti-aircraft positions, and one ammunition depot. Japanese garrison troops are still engaged in courageous ambush operations with a small number of troops on Peleliu Island and Angaur Island.

### Enemy Planes Attacking Kyushu Shot Down Three, Damaged Over Ten

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - Seventy or eighty B-29 type aircraft raided western Kyushu on the morning of the 6th. Japanese air defense forces bravely intercepted them under extremely difficult conditions of dense, layered clouds. It was later confirmed that three enemy aircraft were shot down, and more than ten others were damaged, with a considerable number of them appearing to have been shot down.

Philippine Islands

On Leyte Island, the enemy forces who landed in Barenben landed in the area between Baren City and San Isidro with boat mobile units. The Japanese troops in the area intercepted them and completely repelled them. There was no major change in the land operations on Leyte Island and Mindoro Island. The Japanese air force and special flying units, and Kamikaze Special Attack Force, have been attacking the waters near the Philippines and enemy airfields daily, achieving glorious feats. On January 5th, a strong enemy transport convoy, under the cover of a mobile force, appeared west of Luzon Island, attempting to land on Luzon Island.

Indian Ocean

In response to the urgent situation of the Philippine battle, the British fleet and others attacked the northern district of Sumatra with approximately 80 carrier-based aircraft on the morning of the 4th but were bravely intercepted by the Japanese forces, suffering damage and fleeing. There has been no major activity since. In short, the battle surrounding the Philippines is becoming increasingly important.

### A Proposal for Stabilizing Prices

— by Higashisuke Yoshida

Over the past month, prices in Shanghai have been soaring at an accelerated rate. The fixed income of ordinary salaried workers and laborers is naturally a drop in the bucket and of no use. Even entrepreneurs cannot realistically guarantee that the living expenses of their employees and workers will increase in proportion to prices. Since this is a fact known to all, it has already reached a dead end where salaried workers and laborers will either cease to be human, or entrepreneurs will cease to operate their businesses. In a wartime economy, it is inevitable that civilian production will be reduced and the amount of currency issued will be expanded. Therefore, everyone on the street is commenting that if consumption is not thoroughly curtailed, if public bonds are not promoted, and if people's savings are not popularized and expanded to withdraw currency, then seeking price solutions is akin to climbing a tree to catch fish. If this argument is indeed a penetrating and honest opinion, then the Shanghai price problem under today's abnormal political situation cannot but make people pessimistic and discouraged. First, over the past year, civilian production in Shanghai has plummeted, while the amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued has increased significantly since the Xiang-Gui campaign. The so-called countermeasure of "consumption reduction" is merely empty rhetoric and a show of force. As for the currency withdrawal caused by the promotion of public bonds and people's savings, it is really like "a drop in the ocean" compared to the current amount of currency in circulation. Given the current situation, is not the soaring price in Shanghai an inevitable phenomenon from any point of view? Therefore, most people are greatly disappointed, believing that the price countermeasures in Shanghai are at best empty designs like drawing cakes to satisfy hunger or quenching thirst with plums, and that there are absolutely no effective and realistic designs. Then, can the ordinary principle of the relationship between currency and goods explain the Shanghai price phenomenon? I believe that this ordinary principle obscures the true face of the Shanghai price phenomenon. Naturally, no one can deny that the basic price increase caused by the increase in the amount of currency issued and the decrease in civilian production is the basis of the recent surge in prices. However, the actual prices far exceed this basic price increase, so I believe that it is unrelated to ordinary principles and that there are other factors at play. I originally wanted to use actual figures to illustrate this fact, but because the publication of price figures is prohibited, I can only cite the commonly known rice price for a general description. Recently, within 〇 days, the price of rice jumped from the 〇 ten thousand yuan mark to the 〇 ten thousand yuan mark, an increase of nearly 〇 times in 〇 days. However, no one believes that the "currency" and "goods" have changed that much during this period. Even from this point alone, it can be understood that it is absolutely unreliable to use the relationship between currency and goods to explain the Shanghai price phenomenon. So what is currently determining the Shanghai price phenomenon? I believe that the biggest factor is the Chinese people's distrust of Central Reserve Bank notes. In the past two or three months, the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes has indeed fallen alarmingly. Its rate of decline is like ice in the palm of your hand in summer, melting away in the blink of an eye. People are racking their brains to figure out how to exchange the Central Reserve Bank notes in their hands for other goods as soon as possible before they melt, in order to preserve their original value. People are looking for a "refrigerator" for Central Reserve Bank notes every day, just like preserving ice in a refrigerator to prevent it from melting in vain. This is what the Chinese call hoarding. For a certain period or for certain people, hoarding is an inappropriate act of pursuing improper profits, and it should be thoroughly investigated and punished. However, such hoarding is still relatively rare. In reality, there are many more people who use hoarding as a means of maintaining a minimum standard of living. Recently, I was shown statistics on the income and living expenses of Shanghai workers by a certain authority. Among them, the wages of a certain special type of laborer in Shanghai have been greatly increased recently. However, compared to the soaring cost of living, they are still far behind. With the exception of one or two special laborers, almost all of them are living on borrowed money. What do they use to make up for the borrowed money? Most workers themselves also engage in the business of hoarding goods, and their families help with the unloading of goods, thereby eking out a living. Salaried workers with slightly more income buy and sell stocks and gold bars, as well as hoard all the goods they can buy. As for capitalists, there are no production enterprises to invest in, and even if there are, they cannot afford the ever-increasing living expenses of workers, so most of them have to use their capital for large-scale hoarding. As I said at the beginning of this article, it has now reached the dead end where salaried workers and laborers will either stop working, or entrepreneurs will stop operating their businesses. As it stands, neither capitalists nor workers are doing their proper jobs. That is, both of them transform themselves into "merchants" in the wealth flow process, trying to resist the harm of the soaring prices. Therefore, the capital and labor of Shanghai are separated from the wealth production process and turn to the circulation process. As a result, production becomes increasingly depressed, and competition in the circulation process becomes increasingly fierce. As a result, the number of buyers in the commodity market is constantly increasing, and the number of suppliers is constantly decreasing, which only promotes the continuous rise in prices. From this point of view, the price increase is not determined by the absolute relationship between production and currency, but mainly by the special phenomenon caused by the special attitude towards currency. If expressed simply in a graph, it is as follows. The AB line in the graph is the price increase line related to the relationship between currency and goods, and the a, b lines are the actual price increase lines. The difference between the A, a interval and the B, b interval is the part of the price increase caused by the distrust of Central Reserve Bank notes. This is the reality of prices. Given the reality of prices, restoring people's faith in Central Reserve Bank notes can at least prevent prices from rising along the ab line, but will rise along the AB line, in other words, the actual prices can be reduced to the normal price increase line related to the relationship between currency and goods. So, in my opinion, the main reason for the current price surge is the suspicion of the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes. If this can be adjusted, then prices can be significantly reduced. Otherwise, if it is believed that actual prices have never deviated from rising along the AB line, then the countermeasures can only be to implement "encouraging savings," "suppressing hoarding," and "increasing production." However, these three tasks cannot be effective until the people's panic about Central Reserve Bank notes is resolved. So, if the panic is not corrected first, then adjusting prices will be hopeless. To prove this point, let's start with a brief explanation of the "savings" that are currently on the agenda.

Saving means storing unnecessary wealth today for use in the future. However, even if you want to deposit Central Reserve Bank notes in a bank today for use a year later, the value of the money will have disappeared several times by this time next year. Who would be such a fool to deposit money in a bank for the sake of "saving"? Therefore, in Shanghai today, there are probably no people left who are saving from a private economic standpoint. (In this regard, the remarks of Consul Okazaki of the Japanese Embassy, published in the Continental New Report on December 17, 1944, are extremely noteworthy.) From the banker's standpoint, if a bank receives one million yuan in savings from a depositor today, and pays the depositor 10,000 yuan in principal and interest after one month, the bank obviously gets an unfair profit. Because the depositor deposits one million yuan, which has the value of one million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes (i.e., the purchasing power of one million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes). If the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes is reduced by half when the depositor withdraws it a month later, then the depositor actually only receives 500,000 yuan. Such a complete "fool" who deposits money in the bank is rare among the Chinese people in Shanghai. Therefore, it is said that Shanghai's Chinese banks receive almost no savings deposits at all. In short, since the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes is falling so dramatically today, then "encouraging savings" will become an empty slogan, just like the usual "suppressing hoarding" and "increasing production" slogans.

Therefore, I believe that the urgent task ahead is how to dispel the public's panic about Central Reserve Bank notes. On this point, I have a proposal. The reason why prices are high today is not directly related to the absolute quantity of goods, but because the amount of goods appearing on the black market is too small compared to the amount of goods demanded by buyers. In other words, hoarding has narrowed the market. Naturally, the main reason for the rush to hoard today is to preserve the value of money (i.e., to preserve the purchasing power of money). If the purchasing power of money can be preserved, then hoarding will naturally decrease without suppression. It is the government's responsibility to guarantee the stability of the purchasing power of money. Therefore, the National Central Bank must guarantee the stability of the purchasing power of money. That is, when the Central Reserve Bank collects savings from depositors, it is saving the purchasing power of their savings. Then, when repaying, it should naturally repay the purchasing power in full. If a gold bar costs 500,000 yuan, and 500,000 yuan is deposited, and a gold bar costs 600,000 yuan a month later, then 600,000 yuan should be repaid. If a gold bar costs 700,000 yuan, then 700,000 yuan should be repaid. If such a method is established, then no one will want to buy inconvenient gold bars anymore, and everyone will feel at ease depositing money in the bank. If it is said that relying solely on gold bars as the benchmark for purchasing power is risky, then the average value of three or four important goods can be used as the benchmark for the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes.

Some may say that this will result in too much loss to the country, which will lead to a larger amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued and even more inflation. But after the method I mentioned is established, the Central Reserve Bank notes circulating in the market can return, so there is no need to worry. If the price of the purchasing power benchmark goods soars, then the government should implement appropriate market adjustment measures. To implement market adjustment measures for goods, the government must naturally first have a certain degree of goods reserves. However, using this method is not for the actual need for goods, but for maintaining the value of Central Reserve Bank notes. Such hoarding of goods has the possibility of being released into the market, so the price of benchmark goods may naturally fall considerably. Naturally, this method can only suppress the current price increase caused by panic, and cannot fundamentally suppress prices. However, if we do not first suppress the current price surge, then any fundamental price suppression policy will fail. Regardless of the policy, but the people themselves are designing ways to preserve the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes, hoarding as much as possible, and unknowingly causing the shrinking of the commodity market and the soaring of prices. This situation is difficult to ignore. The method I advocate is that the government should guarantee the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes on behalf of the people, eliminating the need for the people to hoard themselves, and unknowingly expanding the narrow commodity market. The price will fall, and this can be expected to happen quickly. I believe that after this method is established, prices can at least fall to the wartime normal inflation increase line according to the relationship between currency and goods.

Originally, the turmoil and unease of the people's lives in the rear are the main factors determining a long-term war. Then, the current price problem is actually not a problem of the wartime economy. To be honest, it is a battlefield of the war itself. In this sense, I cannot help but hope that the authorities will determine and implement such a price stabilization policy as soon as possible. (Translated by Jing)

Editorial

### Forgetting Self for the Country

From the perspective of the Greater East Asia War, this year is the year of decisive battle. From the perspective of domestic politics, this year is a year in which reform is a must. From the perspective of all aspects of expectation, everyone is focusing on the stability of the people's livelihood, and the stability of the people's livelihood must first ensure that politics is on the right track. The first thing to demand that politics be on the right track is to eradicate corruption. It can be said that eradicating corruption is the first major event this year. Political competition should also take this as the overall goal.

The prevalence of corruption has become the number one enemy in current politics. The corruption of a portion of officials has already created a moral problem in society. For example, Chinese merchants inherently lack the concept of the country and the nation. They have always been profit-oriented and have been historically called "treacherous merchants." In peacetime, they are good at seeking private gain and accepting bribes. If there is no opportunity, they will create one. Therefore, once the door to corruption is opened, they can become even more powerful and do not hesitate to use bribes for everything, further increasing the corruption in the officialdom. On the other hand, they add all the bribery costs to the prices, which are borne by the ordinary people, raising prices and making exorbitant profits. At the same time, they collude with bureaucrats, and the bureaucrats are happy to combine with them. The merchants become even more unscrupulous, disregarding the law, becoming stateless Jews, knowing only exorbitant profits, and not knowing the country and the nation. When prices reach the point where ordinary people can no longer live, they are still laughing and "looking high," like man-eating beasts. Such merchants with profiteering ideology are extremely hateful and unforgivable. However, let us think about it. If there is no way to bribe officials, then even if these "treacherous merchants" have supernatural money, they will not be able to use their tricks, and they will not dare to think of harming the people and benefiting themselves in violation of the law. The moral degeneration of merchants to this point cannot be attributed to the governance of officials.

Secondly, the foundation of the corruption mentality, generally speaking, is due to economic hardship. Some minor corruption starts with the idea that salaries cannot maintain life, and they have no choice but to do this. Those in authority do not prohibit it. As Chairman Chen said in his inaugural speech: "... Those responsible in all aspects, either because the officials' lives are difficult, or because their subordinates have performed meritorious services in the past, reduce their crimes with consideration for their circumstances..." Over time, it has become a bad atmosphere in politics, and it has long been out of the scope of reducing the difficulty of living, taking this as a means of getting rich. Those who had a hard life in the past are now round-faced wealthy men. This has further motivated those who are still in a hard life to embark on the road of corruption and catch up. Naturally, the wind of corruption cannot be stopped once it starts.

As the saying goes: "People must insult themselves before others insult them." At a time when we are seeking national independence and national freedom, it is a great pity that a portion of our officials, who are responsible for saving the country and the people, have engaged in misconduct. However, we cannot but have hope for the officials who are responsible for politics, hoping that they can truly reflect on the past. From now on, they must never again consider reducing crimes and condoning subordinates. From the mistake of "private interests being established and public interests being destroyed" to "public interests being established and private interests being destroyed," and then to establishing the spirit of "forgetting self for the country" and "having the country but not me," it is not too late.

The bad atmosphere in politics is certainly caused by a small number of people. At the same time, a good atmosphere can also be formed by a small number of people. If senior officials strictly practice self-discipline and lead by example, then those below will follow suit, and it will not be difficult to create a good atmosphere. For example, recently, some central organs and the Zhejiang and Anhui provincial governments are gradually moving towards the path of improvement. We hope to make progress every day and expand the scope. The most important thing is the arbitrary county and district politics, because county politics is the most directly related to the people, in order to gradually create a good atmosphere in the entire politics.

Chairman Chen mentioned Mr. Wang's spirit of "forgetting self for the country" and "having the country but not me" at the welcome meeting of the five Shanghai groups the other day, and his eyes were filled with tears. We believe that he was not sad because he was asked to practice this spirit, but sad that too few people can understand and practice this spirit. We should deeply understand Chairman Chen's distress and break through the current corruption in politics with the spirit of "forgetting self for the country."

### Enemy Troops on Leyte Surrounded Everywhere

San Jose Airfield Bombed

A certain Japanese military base on the Philippine front, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese troops on Leyte Island, with fierce fighting spirit, surrounded the enemy troops everywhere and launched a counterattack, frightening the enemy troops. On December 31st of last year, the enemy troops in Barenben attempted to land near six kilometers south of Biriaba with ten tanks from a maritime mobile unit. The Japanese troops intercepted them, causing one amphibious tank to catch fire, and all the enemy troops retreated. Another Japanese team attacked the enemy around Biriaba more fiercely on the 2nd, occupying the north and south highlands, and is currently sweeping away the enemy troops in the vicinity of Biriaba.

Philippine Front. A certain Japanese military base, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese air force attacked the San Jose enemy southern airfield in the middle of the night on the 5th, dropping bombs that hit the taxiway of the airfield, and then the entire team returned to the base safely.

### Japanese Submarine Sinks Enemy Ship

A certain Japanese military base on the Philippine front, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - A Japanese submarine attacked an enemy escort convoy in the Mindanao Sea, sinking one of its destroyers.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese submarines sank one enemy submarine each in the Central Pacific and Southwestern Pacific.

### Two Years Since the National Government's Entry into the War: Congratulatory Message from the Deputy Prime Minister of Burma

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Burmese Deputy Prime Minister, U Saw, issued the following congratulatory statement as the National Government was about to reach the second anniversary of its entry into the war: "More than a year after Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, the National Government resolutely announced its historical decision to join the Greater East Asia War. This war was initiated to end the Sino-Japanese Incident. Therefore, the National Government's decision to share destiny with various countries of Greater East Asia has profound significance. Looking at the process of the National Government declaring war on Britain and the United States, it can be seen as natural for China and Japan to cooperate with each other in the Greater East Asia region, and it is also necessary to permanently break the interference and exploitation of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the National Government's resolute rise on January 9, 1943, was a decision to establish the foundation for East Asian peace and common prosperity. The ancient Chinese sages long advocated peace, and Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, advocated Pan-Asianism, pointing out that China would find it difficult to revitalize itself without mutual understanding and cooperation with Japan. This is unusually clear in the memory of the entire East Asian region. The late Chairman Wang inherited Sun Yat-sen's teachings and immediately made unremitting efforts to realize overall peace. In the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, the National Government clarified the common interests of China and Japan, clearly indicating that China's participation in the war was for the revitalization of the nation and the liberation of East Asia, which is truly admirable. Now, on the occasion of the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, Sino-Japanese cooperation is becoming increasingly close, and the military and political achievements will also become increasingly solid in spirit and material. We hereby encourage mutual encouragement between China and Japan, from top to bottom, to achieve the early victory of the war."

### Preparations for Celebrations in Various Locations

Zhenjiang, 7th (Central News Agency) - This month's 9th marks the second anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war. In order to uplift wartime consciousness, implement total war participation, and jointly defeat Britain and the United States, the county government plans to hold a grand celebration and organize mobile propaganda teams to give lectures in various places.

Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - To commemorate the second anniversary of the war, the Guangdong Provincial Government plans to hold a cartoon competition and exhibition, which is currently under active preparation. It is reported that a preview will be held at the Youth Center on the 8th, and officials will be invited to judge the rankings.

### German Forces Cross the Rhine River, Launching a Major Counteroffensive; Battle in Southern Belgium Reaches Climax

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports that a German military spokesperson reviewed the Western Front situation yesterday, stating: "The anti-Axis forces have been forced to withdraw their troops from various war hotspots to counterattack the northern and southern flanks of the German forces entering the region. The current battle has become a war of attrition for the anti-Axis forces, and the enemy has lost several armored divisions and many infantry. The American counterattacks have generally been repelled. The British forces on the northern flank have joined the battle and advanced four or five kilometers. The anti-Axis forces have been forced to withdraw a large number of troops from other areas to attempt a counterattack. The German authorities have seized the opportunity to launch a major counteroffensive in Lorraine and Upper Alsace. In the battles of the past three weeks, the German forces have been in a proactive and free-moving position, making breakthroughs in various areas."

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports that after British forces in the Netherlands reinforced the US First Army to suppress the northern flank of the German invasion zone, two-thirds of the anti-Axis forces on the Western Front are fighting between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers. The US Ninth Army also reinforced the US First Army before the New Year to restore its combat power. The battle in southern Belgium and Luxembourg is reaching its climax. On Friday, enemy forces penetrated at two locations southwest of Marche and Stavelot, while the rest were repelled. On the southern flank, German forces continue to pressure the US Third Army, pushing them back towards Bastogne. General Patton's attempt to relieve the left flank of Bastogne was also unsuccessful. In the major battle between the Saar and the Rhine, German forces are in a proactive position. South of Bich, German forces continue to advance south. The rearguard of the US forces in the Vosges Mountains is being tightly pressed by the German forces and has retreated to Haguenau. After the German forces crossed the Rhine River, the situation there is extremely critical.

Rumor of General Patton's Capture

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports that the London "Daily Mail" stated: "Following the recent rumors of the deaths of Churchill and Eisenhower, there is now a rumor of General Patton's capture. The newspaper warns the public not to be

### President Roosevelt Addresses Congress

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports that according to the US Capital Radio, President Roosevelt addressed Congress on Saturday, stating that he would fight to the end and that the anti-Axis forces would not dispute the issue of final victory. He has complete faith in Eisenhower. The shallow view that the United States should devote all its efforts to Japan, regardless of Britain and the Soviet Union's war with Germany, is not true.

### Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Stable Last Week

The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai have been relatively stable in the past week, with few changes. Because the year 34 has begun, there was no market for the New Year holidays on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, the prices all tended to rise and become firmer, rising again after a fatigue in the middle. The rise in silver was still rare. Stock transactions were more active than in the past due to the experimental trading of the stock exchange, and the market also saw a gradual increase. However, because short selling was heavy after the start of easy delivery, its speculative danger was greater than that of spot trading. Most ordinary brokers were unwilling to do it, so the exchange authorities attached great importance to it. Whether the transition of the trading prospect can promote the prosperity of the legitimate investment business is unpredictable. Money was slightly looser during the three-day market opening period, with only the interest rate on money shops increasing slightly by six cents. On the industrial and commercial front, there was still a shortage of production, and it was quite difficult for prices to relax. There was no certainty about the resumption of work in factories and companies. Although the market prices of various companies and shops have not seen a further increase, it has been reported that some large manufacturers have repeatedly requested an increase in selling prices, but have not yet been allowed by the authorities. This situation is very worrying. The general public hopes that the relevant economic authorities will carefully consider this with the livelihood of the people as the premise.

### News Workers Included in Priority Allocation, Decided by the Municipal Goods Allocation Office

With the cooperation of all parties concerned, the Municipal Goods Allocation Office, in order to promote the increase in wartime industrial production in this city under the wartime system, will implement priority allocation for major foods in order to stabilize the daily lives of the relevant workers. All standards and scope of priority allocation have been carefully stipulated. It was found that news workers in this city were not originally included in the priority list. However, Director Feng You of the Allocation Office and Councilor Hirano, believing that news reporters are fighters on the fourth front of the nation and bear the heavy responsibility of reporting, and that their responsibility is even more important during the decisive period of the Greater East Asia War, and that the circumstances of news workers are mostly poor, they should be given priority allocation to stabilize the daily lives of all news reporters in the city. After repeated consultations with all parties concerned, it has been decided to include them in the scope of priority allocation. Once the priority allocation starts in this city, all news reporters in the city will receive the same treatment.

### Stabilizing Prices and Stabilizing People's Livelihood

— Yu

In today's environment of rampant, ceaseless price increases and widespread misery among the people, making it difficult to survive, the issue that the government authorities should be focusing all their efforts on to resolve is probably no other. In particular, the Shanghai municipal authorities, experiencing this firsthand, should be the first to bear the brunt, witnessing the five million citizens under their jurisdiction, with the exception of a few who profit from the national crisis and the wealthy, mostly groaning and lamenting, living on the edge, and filled with anxiety day in and day out. How could they suddenly forget their responsibilities, remain unmoved, lift them out of the abyss of suffering and bring them to a life of ease? This is not only the ambition that a great statesman should have, but also the responsibility that a great statesman should shoulder. The saying "Do not decline what is righteous" and "Duty-bound with no turning back" can truly be said of the Shanghai municipal authorities.

Since the outbreak of the incident, prices in Shanghai have been rising, but the rate of increase has only accelerated recently. Normally, a "dan" (a unit of weight) of rice cost around ten yuan, but in January and February of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], the black market price of rice was still just over two thousand yuan per "dan". However, by December of the same year, it had risen to a peak of sixty-five thousand yuan per "shi" (another unit of weight), and even when relatively stable, it was around forty-six or forty-seven thousand yuan. In other words, the price of rice in Shanghai had soared four thousand six or seven hundred times compared to normal, and even within one year, it had skyrocketed more than twenty times. Take coal balls as another example. Normally, a "dan" of 100 "jin" (another unit of weight) would cost only about eight jiao (a unit of currency), but recently a "dan" costs three thousand five hundred yuan. In January and February of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], the black market price of coal balls was still less than two hundred yuan. Although the raw materials and heating power are far from comparable to before, the rate of increase is still more than four thousand four hundred times, and the increase in one year is also more than twenty times. Nothing is more closely related to people's livelihood than "eating," and rice and coal balls are the most important aspects of "the problem of eating." One can wear fewer clothes and live in simpler housing, but one's stomach cannot remain empty. However, with such a sharp rise in prices, the average middle-class family, usually relying on salary income to support a family of eight, is truly suffering from the inability to cope with "the problem of eating." Let's now estimate the monthly expenses for a family, based on recent living conditions, and list them as follows:

The above table lists the minimum cost of living required to maintain a family, according to the recent situation, at more than one hundred thousand yuan. But there are probably very few salary earners whose income can meet this standard, not to mention that even greater difficulties lie ahead, with the situation only worsening. If no measures are taken to curb this trend, not only will the salaried class collapse, but it will also disrupt the social and economic structure, leading to an unmanageable crisis.

Because the rampant rise in prices cannot be contained, people's livelihoods are withering and collapsing in countless ways. Our country has always held the saying "The people are the most important," and also "The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is solid, the state will be secure." And for the Shanghai municipal authorities, stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood is a matter of duty, and it is difficult to stand idly by. Therefore, the author does not hesitate to express his humble opinions, offering them as a modest contribution.

(1) Enhancing Rationing: The daily necessities rationed in Shanghai include rice, flour, grains, coal balls, oil, salt, soap, matches, and so on. It can be said that there is not much lacking in terms of what is needed for people's basic needs of food and clothing. The prices of rationed goods are also very reasonable. The only problem is that the quantity is too small, and often delayed. The authorities' difficulties are certainly not ignored by the citizens, but the citizens' difficulties can only be hoped to be resolved by the authorities, and every effort should be made to overcome all difficulties to achieve results. If all supplies can be rationed on time and in sufficient quantity, then how can the black market prices be rampant, and the lives of citizens can be stabilized.

(2) Unblocking Sources: In order to achieve a smooth and satisfactory rationing system, and to enable people to maintain their minimum standard of living, it is essential to have a flexible transportation mechanism and to unblock the sources of domestic materials. In recent years, there have been many reasons for the soaring prices in Shanghai, but "the inability to smoothly transport goods" is one of the main causes. In order to implement control, the government can coordinate the work, but the results of the previous work done by the authorities have not been satisfactory to the people. At the same time, the prevalence of small traders only promotes the rise in prices. Therefore, from the standpoint of the citizens, it would be best if the government could have a well-planned plan for the transportation of goods and be responsible for it, or else it should allow wealthy merchants and experienced merchants to handle it, and implement supervision and limit profits. If the source of materials can be unblocked, then production can be increased, prices can be stabilized, and the people's lives will be secure.

(3) Suppressing Profiteering: Merchants are inherently profit-seeking. However, during the war, due to the severance of international channels and the interruption of supplies, there were many who took the opportunity to manipulate the national accumulation and make a fortune from the national crisis. On the one hand, most people are oppressed by high prices, struggling and crying out, not knowing where they will die. Such abnormal phenomena not only violate the principle of control, but also destroy the dignity of the law. It can truly be said that "a merchant's success is built on the bones of thousands of people." "Dr. Haber of Germany once gave a lecture in Japan on the reasons for Germany's failure in World War I, and spoke in tears about the situation of merchants becoming rich during the war." It should be known that suppressing profiteering is the government's responsibility, and it should be thoroughly eliminated, especially during wartime. If this point cannot be achieved, not only will prices soar even higher, but most people,困擾by livelihood problems, will not have the heart, the strength, or the ability to unite against aggression and cooperate in the war.

(4) Eliminating Corruption: It is the nature of merchants to seek profit, and if the government is impartial and intervenes, it may be possible to achieve a deterrent effect. What is regrettable is that officials and merchants collude with each other, acting like jackals, which only adds fuel to the fire, making the situation unmanageable. The people's suffering will only deepen, and there is no possibility of reducing it. In recent years, discipline has been lost, orders are not being followed, and the practice of corruption has become a habit. The rice fraud case and the business special tax case, to name a few, are well-known examples. Other smaller cases are too numerous to mention. Due to the collusion between officials and merchants and the prevalence of corruption, the rampant rise in prices is like a raging fire and a flood of water, and the so-called control is actually helping it to rise. Therefore, if you want to stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihood, eliminating corruption is also one of the key points.

Shanghai is the financial center and a major industrial and commercial city of our country. Its economic status is extremely important. In recent years, because it is also the base camp of the wartime system and the source of control policies, its political importance has also become increasingly prominent. Therefore, every move in Shanghai is enough to affect the whole country and spread to various places. It is very appropriate to say that it concerns the views of the whole country. How to make this giant city in East Asia develop its production and restore people's livelihood is not only the responsibility of the municipal authorities, but also the desire of all citizens. At this time, as a new year begins and everything is renewed, the 34th year of the Republic [1945] is coming soon, and the Shanghai municipal authorities are also undergoing a change. I still remember that after Hong Yang was pacified, Zeng Wenzhenggong of Xiangxiang [Zeng Guofan], as the commander-in-chief and governor-general of Liangjiang, was diligent in government and loved the people, and his love was eternally remembered. Now Mr. Zhou and Mr. Luo are also from Hunan. At this time of rampant price increases and people's misery, they have come forward to preside over the Shanghai municipal government and will surely follow the old tradition of Hunan people's perseverance, diligence, and hard work, personally supervise and lead by example, seek happiness for the people, and seek prosperity for Shanghai. I can't help but offer my best wishes and wait with bated breath.
