### Fierce Fighting in Iwo Jima; Entering the Decisive Battle Phase; Japanese Forces Inflict Over 20,000 Enemy Casualties

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The enemy forces on Iwo Jima, under the cover of naval bombardment since the morning of the 26th, have launched an all-out offensive. At approximately 9:00 AM on the same day, about 20 enemy cruisers and destroyers, approximately 100 transport ships, and an estimated 120-130 other vessels fiercely bombarded Japanese positions from the sea approximately five kilometers southeast of the island. Simultaneously, approximately 40 enemy aircraft, including "Jake" (Type 2 Seaplane) new-type seaplane reconnaissance planes and "Helldiver" aircraft, also mobilized to assist in the operation.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The battle situation on Iwo Jima, since the enemy launched a major offensive on the morning of the 26th, appears to have entered a decisive phase. The Japanese garrison on the southern front was still engaged in fierce fighting with enemy forces that had infiltrated the Motoyama Airfield and naval artillery battery area as of the night of the 26th. As a result, Japanese forces still maintain the battle lines of the afternoon of the 25th. The Japanese garrison on the western front launched a fierce counterattack against enemy forces advancing on the vicinity of Tawarazaka (northeast of Chidori Airfield) from Tenguiwa, resulting in their repulsion. Japanese positions are currently still in the area of Mount Asō. Throughout the night of the 26th, enemy forces fired large numbers of incendiary and white phosphorus bombs, while also firing from naval vessels to prevent Japanese forces from repairing their positions and launching counterattacks. At approximately 6:00 AM on the 27th, the enemy once again launched artillery fire from heavy artillery positions at the southern end of Chidori Airfield. Japanese forces heroically counterattacked and defended their positions. Although the enemy began a major offensive on the morning of the 26th, their losses have also increased accordingly. By noon on the 26th, enemy losses had reached 18,500 men. By the evening of the 27th, 38 enemy tanks had been disabled and over 2,000 enemy soldiers had been killed or wounded. In total, since the landing until the evening of the 27th, enemy casualties have reached over 20,900 men.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese forces on Iwo Jima are fighting with all their might, and enemy casualties are increasing accordingly. On the night of the 23rd, a Japanese unit commanded by Colonel Atsuji broke through the encirclement from Mount Suribachi and joined forces with the main Japanese force on the eastern front. This unit alone inflicted approximately 1,000 enemy casualties in the Mount Suribachi area.

### Japanese Forces in Manila Gradually Shortening Battle Lines

Luzon Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese army and navy in Manila are gradually shortening their battle lines. Japanese forces within the four borders of the old city broke through the enemy encirclement and joined forces with a small number of friendly troops within the city. On the 24th and 25th, they repelled enemy offensives several times. The enemy finally adopted a scorched-earth tactic, using flamethrowers and dropping incendiary bombs within the breaches of the city walls, causing the city to be engulfed in flames. On the night of the 25th, enemy tanks broke into a corner of the city walls, and a fierce and bloody battle ensued with Japanese forces. By the morning of the 26th, communication lines to most of the city and a portion of the city walls had been severed, and the Japanese battle situation was unclear. Fierce fighting on Corregidor Island continues, with the entire island shrouded in a cloud of artillery fire. In the Clark area, Japanese army and naval forces have been subjected to intense enemy attacks, and half of their positions have been lost. They are currently defending the remaining positions, conducting defensive warfare, and launching night raids, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. On the 25th, they intercepted enemy tanks that had broken into their positions, disabling one and repelling the rest. The enemy has already used Clark Airfield and appears to be deploying bombers from the Leyte area to that location.

Philippines Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The battle within Manila continues to rage, with the Manila Hotel, near the old city, being the site of particularly fierce fighting. The enemy used loudspeakers to urge the Japanese forces within the city to surrender, but the Japanese forces silenced the loudspeakers with gunfire, demonstrating their high morale. The enemy forces currently surrounding the Japanese forces consist of elements of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 3rd Infantry Division, and the 11th Airborne Division, along with approximately 200 tanks and armored vehicles and approximately 150 artillery pieces of various types. Also, on the south bank of Laguna de Bay, in the Los Baños area, the enemy landed on the night of the 23rd using approximately 100 boats, and Japanese forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting with them.

### Deepening Conflict Between British and Chongqing Forces in Northern Burma

Burma Front, 28th (Dispatch) – The Indian 5th Division, having crossed the Irrawaddy River southwest of Pakokku, attempted to attack the Myingyan area, but was met with a severe counterattack by Japanese forces, resulting in its near-collapse. There have been no other changes on the Burmese front.

Burma Front Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The antagonism between British forces and the Chongqing (Nationalist Chinese) forces on the northern Burmese front has long been present, and recently, due to disparities in treatment and a sense of being looked down upon, the conflict has become even more pronounced. According to Chongqing soldiers who defected to the Japanese army near Molo, south of the Kaukkwe River, approximately 200 soldiers, or about one and a half battalions, of the Chongqing 50th Division ambushed approximately 100 British troops near Tongka, south of Kamaing, on January 15th. The fighting lasted for three days, resulting in 85 British deaths. The Chongqing forces also suffered 50 deaths. This ambush was an expression of the extreme resentment of the Chongqing officers towards the British army. Because the treatment of Chongqing officers was even less than that of a British soldier, and at the same time, they were despised by the British army, this action was taken. As a result, the conflicts on the northern Burmese front are intensifying daily.

Editorial

### Agility and Sluggishness

The opposite of "agility" is "sluggishness." Whether in thought, speech, or action, one can exhibit the phenomena of "agility" or "sluggishness."

Taking action as an example: What is agility? Agility is alertness and speed. In the same amount of time, doing more, doing better, and doing faster is agility. At the same time, doing less, doing worse, and doing slower is sluggishness. Therefore, those who work agilely have higher efficiency, while those who work sluggishly have lower efficiency. This is a very obvious distinction.

The opposite of "sloppiness" is "meticulousness," which is also relative and can be expressed in comparison. However, "agility" is definitely not "sloppiness," and "sluggishness" is even more different from "meticulousness." If doing something "sloppily" is called "agility," and doing something "sluggishly" is beautified as "meticulousness," then one can only deceive oneself and never deceive others. On the contrary, true "agility" certainly includes "meticulousness," while the content of "sluggish" work is inevitably sloppy. Therefore, observing the overall efficiency of work, agility is definitely not sloppiness, and sluggishness cannot be considered meticulousness.

We Chinese have a habit that best exemplifies sluggishness. For example, when holding gatherings, whether social or meetings, most people do not respect time and are always late. Some people even think that being late is a sign of high status. Also, in terms of office hours, most people are not accustomed to observing them, arriving late and leaving early as a common practice. Because gatherings do not respect time, they delay the valuable time of those who attend on time. Because offices do not respect time, they delay many important official duties and reduce the efficiency of the overall work. Another example is when making contracts, people are always inattentive to fulfilling the stipulated conditions, doing things carelessly. They are always slow in delaying the agreed time or money, which easily causes disputes, and is nothing but the result of sluggishness.

Within Japan, it can be said that universal attention has been paid to respecting time, and the habit of acting agilely has been established from the spirit of respecting time. Therefore, both government agencies and private organizations follow suit. As a result, work has an agile spirit, resulting in the highest efficiency. This is the opposite of us, from which we can also observe the difference between agility and sluggishness, and the difference in work efficiency. Therefore, from the phenomena of agility and sluggishness, one can express the spirit of a nation. Acting agilely is sufficient to represent the progress of a nation, while acting sluggishly is sufficient to represent the nation's old age.

Currently, it is the decisive phase of the Greater East Asia War, a time to compete in overall strength to determine victory or defeat. We are a participating country, a member of the overall strength competition. Whether in thought or action, we need to act agilely, seize time, seize efficiency, strengthen overall strength, and contribute to the war. At the same time, we should transform all sluggish old habits with a conscious spirit. Government senior officials and social leaders should especially lead by example, advocating from above and creating a prevailing atmosphere.

### Japanese Cabinet Meeting Passes Plan to Strengthen Military Production

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – In order to cope with this critical war situation, and to strengthen military production, the Japanese government has previously reviewed the "Plan Regarding the System and Operation of Military Production." At the same time, there are also those in the private sector who advocate the theory of nationalizing or militarily managing important military enterprises. In addition, there is also the claim of establishing a "Production Army." In response, the government believes that it is necessary to make this decision and announce it, and the plan was submitted to the Cabinet meeting on the 27th for deliberation and passed. The Information Bureau has released the following outline: (1) The state trusts the people's sincerity of serving the country, and in military production, the goal is also to handle affairs with the spirit of each person's duty to serve the country. (2) Regarding private enterprises, a thorough implementation will be carried out in accordance with the spirit of the Military Supply Company Law. (3) Enterprise groups will be formed according to industry type and region. (4) Depending on the content of the enterprise and the progress of the war situation, if it is deemed necessary for nationalization, the management will be transferred to the state.

### Churchill Delivers Speech in the House of Commons

Stockholm, 28th - Central News Agency telegram: Reuter reports from London: Churchill announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the San Francisco Conference will gather representatives of the anti-Axis powers who declared war on Germany and Japan before March 1, 1945, to sign the declaration of the anti-Axis powers conference. When Churchill mentioned "several countries are now declaring war," there was uproarious laughter.

The Boundaries of New Poland

In his speech, Churchill revealed the boundaries of the new Poland as agreed upon at the Yalta Conference. It is said that Poland can obtain land concessions in the north and west. In the north, it can obtain Danzig, land west and south of Königsberg, and a wide coastline along the Baltic Sea, to replace the pre-war corridor. In the west, it can obtain the important industrial area of Upper Silesia and some areas east of the Oder River, the extent of which will be decided at the peace conference. Churchill also stated that the British government will continue to recognize the Polish government in London until the new provisional Polish government established according to the Yalta Conference is announced.

Respecting the Independence of Lebanon and Syria

Churchill also stated: The British government's position on Syria and Lebanon is based on the decision made in 1941, in which both Britain and France affirmed the independence of these two Eastern countries. Britain is now determined to respect the independence of these two countries. However, given the cultural and historical ties established between France and Syria, we want to do our utmost to preserve its special status. We believe that these two countries can be firmly established with the support of world organizations, while France's privileges will also be recognized.

### German Troops East of the Ruhr River Firmly Defend New Defense Line

Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency telegram: Reuter reports: The pressure from American troops east of the Ruhr River is increasing. After the German troops retreated to the second line of defense, the enemy's advance at several points is faster than before.

The American Ninth Army tanks on the left flank have been blocked northeast of Erkelenz. The tanks in the center are advancing slowly along the Linnich-Jülich road. The vanguard on the southern flank has reached Jülich. Near Elsdorf on the Cologne road, they reached the Erft River. Further south, the American First Army tanks are advancing on both sides of the Düren-Cologne road. In short, the American troops penetrated deeper on Monday, but have not yet been able to break through. It is expected that the battle situation will be even more intense in the next few days.

Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency telegram: Reuter reports: After the American Ninth Army invaded the city of Erkelenz, fierce street fighting is now taking place.

### Chief of the Information Department, Ide, Discusses Chongqing-Yan'an Disputes - The United States and Yan'an Jointly Pressure Chongqing

The Propaganda Department of the Allied Japanese Army met with Chinese news reporters from this city at the Hamilton Building at 3:00 PM yesterday (1st). Those present included Ide, Chief of the Army Propaganda Department, Lieutenant Maehara, Jiangcheng Trustee, and reporters from various newspapers. Chief Ide delivered a speech on the recent disputes between Chongqing and Yan'an, which is recorded below:

Chongqing-Yan'an Negotiations Facilitated by the United States

Zhou Enlai, the representative of Yan'an, arrived in Chongqing in December of last year to negotiate the Chongqing-Yan'an issue. After two months, due to the vast differences between the two sides' opinions, no resolution could be reached. The reasons for the breakdown of the negotiations can be seen in the reasons for the negotiations published by Wang Shijie of Chongqing on February 14 and Zhou Enlai's statement in Chongqing on February 15 (before leaving Chongqing).

This negotiation is the same as the long-term consultation and negotiation between the two sides for five months last year. However, this negotiation was instigated by the United States, which is the unique point of this negotiation. However, even though the US representative has great influence, they ultimately failed to resolve the issue, which proves the fundamental opposition between the two parties.

The focus of this negotiation is the Chongqing and Yan'an's struggle for leadership. Chongqing argues that Yan'an's party and military power should pledge allegiance to Chongqing as the main body, only then will Yan'an's regime be allowed to exist. Yan'an opposes Chongqing's dictatorship and advocates the establishment of a democratic joint government.

The Struggle for Power Between the Two Parties Cannot Be Resolved

Yan'an's goal, on the surface, is to use the slogan of overthrowing Japan and unifying the anti-Japanese war work front. In form, it is to establish a so-called democratic government. As for the two-stage revolution, that is, to realize the democratic revolution, it is purely a struggle for the revolutionary leadership of the two parties. In essence, it is no different from last year's negotiations. The guiding theories held by both parties cannot be fundamentally resolved, so there is absolutely no possibility of cooperation between the two parties.

If the two sides do not change their guiding theories and want to reconcile, Chongqing must make concessions. The United States knows that the prospect of mediation is difficult, but it still continues, even ordering Ambassador Hurley to Chongqing to mediate.

The US interference in the internal affairs of the two parties has long been known to the general public. However, with the urgent progress of the war situation, the United States has intensified its pressure on Chongqing, causing China to become a decisive battlefield. Therefore, the United States' concern for China is also increasing day by day. Whether Chongqing and the Communist Party can thoroughly cooperate and jointly deal with Japan is a crucial point for the United States. For this reason, it has to force Chongqing to compromise with the Communist Party. The United States' approach to Yan'an is because the United States intends to establish an air base in the Northwest, so that Yan'an can directly obtain US material assistance. Therefore, the compromise between Chongqing and the Communist Party must rely on the United States' strong influence. Whether the two sides can cooperate also depends on the United States' opinion. Observing the Chongqing-Yan'an issue in this way may not be wrong. Although Chongqing insists on its position and wants to obtain US assistance, it has to follow the United States. From this, we can see a glimpse of the United States' joint pressure on Yan'an to oppress Chongqing.

The Communist Party's Attacks on Chongqing are Becoming More Intense

The Communist Party's political offensive against Chongqing has also become increasingly urgent recently. According to the "Liberation Daily" on February 17, with the theme of the Crimea Three-Power Conference, criticizing Chongqing, it is requested that Yan'an advocate the abolition of Chongqing's dictatorship. The joint declaration of the three countries advocates the establishment of a coalition government, which has become increasingly strengthened, and Chongqing's dictatorship has suffered a blow. Recently, the US news has openly exposed the inside story of China and began to attack Chongqing. According to a February 22 report by the United Press, the Chongqing News Inspection Office has caused frequent complaints from foreign newspaper special correspondents due to the inspection of their writing.

In short, the United States and Yan'an jointly pressuring Chongqing will raise the following two questions about the Chongqing-Yan'an issue: First, how will the United States realize its aggressive ambitions alone? Second, to what extent will Chongqing's dictatorship be pressured by the United States? However, because Chongqing is deeply oppressed, there will inevitably be major problems in China's future, that is, Chongqing will become Yan'anized, and the Chinese people will become slaves of the United States.

### Industry and Commerce Association Holds General Membership Meeting Yesterday - Chinese and Japanese Members Attended

The City Industry and Commerce Association held its sixth general membership meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Dozens of members from both sides attended, including Wu Qi, Gu Nanqun, Wang Boyuan, Luo Nezhai, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Huailian, Chen Shao Ma, Kurimoto Toraji, Tomonaga Tosaburo, Murakawa Yoshimi, and Tatekawa Danzo. Japanese guests included Consultant Niimoto, Vice Consul Fukuma from the Embassy, and Bureau Chiefs Xu, Yuan, and Zhou from the City Government. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Wen Lanting, with the usual formalities. First, the chairman gave an opening speech and a report on association affairs, followed by speeches by Funatsu Tatsuiichiro and Lin Kanghou Chen Binhe, who elaborated on how the Chinese and Japanese business communities should seek further cooperation, increase production, and jointly strive for the war effort, and redouble their efforts. Afterwards, refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned.

Wen Lanting's Speech

Today, our association is holding its sixth general membership meeting. We are very pleased to have Chinese and Japanese officials present to give us guidance, and I would like to express our gratitude on behalf of all the members. Our association was established in response to the needs of the Chinese and Japanese business communities. Since its establishment, it has received support from all parties and relied on the enthusiasm and cooperation of members from both sides, and it has achieved its current scale, which is very gratifying. In the future, we will adhere to our established policies, move forward, and fulfill the original intention of the association, connect the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese business communities, and further strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in business, which is the main task of the association. The association will also strive to promote or participate in other social welfare undertakings. However, the members are all constrained by their own duties, and they often feel that their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient. We still sincerely ask Chinese and Japanese officials and wise men from all walks of life to give us guidance from time to time so that we can follow. Shanghai has always been the economic center. If China and Japan can achieve close economic relations, it will not only contribute to the war effort but also benefit the people's livelihood. If the Chinese and Japanese people can first establish a close economic relationship, they can strengthen the cooperation of the rich. Therefore, from this point of view, the mission of our association is particularly arduous, and the efforts of our members are also particularly urgent. Recently, our association has recruited two new members, Mr. Yin Zuogan and Mr. Oka Takeo. Also, Mr. Ueba Tetsuzo, the director of the third session of our association, has resigned due to personal reasons, and Mr. Tomono Kiyoshi has been publicly elected to succeed him by the seventh board of directors. The above two new members and new director Mr. Tomono are all respected figures in the city's business community. In the future, they will work together with us on association affairs, and the association's affairs will definitely accelerate, which is a gratifying thing.

Funatsu's Speech

This association is composed of powerful people in the Shanghai business community. Since its establishment, it has not only conducted research and discussions on economic aspects, but also made important contributions, especially to the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese business communities, which is deeply gratifying. However, from a subjective and objective point of view, it seems that it is not enough for only Chinese and Japanese business people to participate in this association. In the future, we should redouble our efforts to expand its organization. Because the Great East Asia War is at a critical juncture for survival, we must strive to survive together in this war and achieve victory. To achieve victory in the war, we still need the cooperation and redoubled efforts of China and Japan.

### Basketball Championship Remains Undecided: Chinese Athletic Association Defeats Chung Bei, Each Wins Once, Rematch Scheduled

The final of the second round of the Class A and A1 group public basketball competition between the two powerhouses, the Chinese Athletic Association and Chung Bei, took place last night amidst an extremely tense atmosphere. The Chinese Athletic Association defeated Chung Bei by a score of 39 to 34, avenging their previous loss and creating an equal standing. At halftime, the score was tied at 17 points each. The championship remains undecided and will be re-contested at a later date. The audience was even larger than the first final. Both sides fielded their most ideal lineups. Chung Bei consisted of Li Chen-chung, Chen Hsueh-tsung, Chao Ya-lin, Cho Kuo-jung, and Bao Song. The Chinese Athletic Association fielded Wu Cheng-chang, Burt, Chang Liang-hsiung, Fan Ching-kung, and Chu Hsi-lin. The first half saw a back-and-forth battle, resulting in a tie of 17 points each. In the second half, the Chinese Athletic Association gradually gained the upper hand and maintained the lead, ultimately winning with a score of 39 to 34. Unfortunately, both sides committed numerous fouls, resulting in seven players being ejected from the two teams, a blemish on the match. For the Chinese Athletic Association, Wu, Chang, Fan, and Chuan Chang-chun were ejected. Substitutes included Kong Kuang-yi, Chen Tso-liang, and Chang Hsien-lun. For Chung Bei, Chao, Bao, and Li Chen-chung were ejected, leaving Chung Bei to finish the game with only four players. Wang Chung-tao and Li Pao-chung were substituted in. Shen Yu-kung was injured after slipping and was helped off the court. It seems that the Chinese Athletic Association has returned to normal last night, while Chung Bei had slightly worse luck.
