On the 7th, the Air Force continued to bomb enemy forces in the Kadena area of Okinawa Island in response to the land battle. Also, on the afternoon of the same day, Japanese Kamikaze special attack forces attacked an enemy mobile force east of Okinawa, inflicting heavy damage.

Enemy Mobile Force Heavily Damaged and Fleeing Eastward

Somewhere in the Pacific, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force is continuing its fierce attacks on the enemy Anglo-American joint mobile force entrenched in the Ryukyu Islands. According to a report released by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the [date obscured], from April 5th to dawn on the 7th, the results were fifteen ships sunk and nine destroyed. According to reconnaissance obtained on the afternoon of the 7th, an enemy mobile force, based on two standard aircraft carriers and one auxiliary aircraft carrier, was dragging an oil slick two kilometers long and fleeing southeast 200 miles southeast of southern Kyushu. At least several ships in this unit had been heavily damaged. In addition, an enemy mobile force based on four auxiliary aircraft carriers was also fleeing eastward 120 to 130 miles east of Amami Oshima. An enemy mobile force consisting mainly of three aircraft carriers and two battleships was located 100 miles east of Okinawa Island. Slightly to the south, there was another enemy mobile force based on one aircraft carrier and one battleship. Furthermore, there were enemy mobile forces based on two to four aircraft carriers cruising 140 to 150 miles south of the island. On the evening of the 7th, Japanese special attack forces attacked the enemy mobile force east of Okinawa Island. The entire force courageously collided with enemy ships. According to reports from reconnaissance aircraft, at least four or five enemy ships had been heavily damaged. As a result, the enemy fleet was thrown into great confusion, with ships scattered, listing heavily, or with greatly reduced speed, and fleeing eastward. All results since the 4th, in addition to those released by the Imperial Headquarters on the 8th, indicate considerable additional losses.

### Situation in Burma

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces in Burma, which have suffered repeated heavy losses, have advanced to the vicinity of Myinmu west of Mandalay, and about 30 kilometers northeast of Meiktila. There have been no major changes in the situation near the coast of the area.

### Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki Meets with Reporters, Elucidating "Belief in Victory," Concentrating Total National Strength to Protect the Deities and Ensure Tranquility

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki received a group of reporters for the first time at the Prime Minister's official residence at approximately 11:00 AM on the 8th, and gave a speech, stating in brief: The current fierce development of the war situation is something we anticipated and is not surprising. We are currently fighting against the United States, just as we did during the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, Japanese elder statesmen also believed that Japan was not capable of defeating Russia, but as a result of the circumstances forcing Japan to fight, it ultimately achieved victory. This war is also being forced upon us, so we will inevitably achieve final victory. At this point, the reporters asked the Prime Minister about his views on the war situation. Prime Minister Suzuki responded to this by saying that we will certainly win this war. The so-called victory does not refer to wins or losses on individual battlefields, but to morale as a crucial factor in the decisive battle. For example, Tokugawa Ieyasu was defeated by Takeda Shingen at the Battle of Mikatagahara and returned to Hamamatsu, but Tokugawa's tactics and morale in that battle became the key to his eventual victory. I do not consider the battles on Iwo Jima and other places to be failures because the battles on Iwo Jima and other places fully demonstrate the faith and spirit of the Japanese people, which is an unwavering belief.

### Summary of Broadcast

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki broadcast the following at 7:00 PM on the 8th, under the title "Receiving the Great Command": The trend of the war situation is by no means optimistic. Although we rely on the brave fighting of the soldiers on the front lines and the hard work of production in the rear, the distance between the stubborn enemy and our homeland is getting closer day by day, and the only way to save the crisis is to arouse the enemy-hating spirit of the people and concentrate total national strength, all with one heart. In terms of the world war situation, a large country will not necessarily win, and a small country will not necessarily lose. If a small country wants to defeat a large country, it must unite all its strength and go all out. Japan is fighting against the stubborn enemies Britain and the United States. Today's situation is a natural trend and is not surprising. We will fight to the last man with the determination to sacrifice ourselves for righteousness and will surely give the enemy a thorough blow. I hope that the people of the country will unite as one to overcome national difficulties and quickly follow the government's various policies to usher in a new situation and protect the tranquility of the nation.

### Japanese Army Results in the Barlett Area: Over 10,000 Enemy Soldiers Killed or Wounded

### Enemy Forces on Cebu Island Suffer Fierce Counterattacks

Philippine Base, 9th (Central News Agency) - Enemy forces invaded the vicinity of Cebu with approximately one hundred transport ships, urgently attempting to increase land forces and supplies. The Japanese Naval Landing Forces and Army units cooperated to launch fierce counterattacks against the enemy troops that landed. In these four days since the beginning of April, the damage inflicted on the enemy forces in this area includes one transport ship destroyed, approximately 700 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 15 pieces of ordnance destroyed, and more than 10 residential buildings and military supplies burned. A strong Japanese force from a stronghold east of Manila entered a location three kilometers west of Mendar on the 3rd, inflicting significant damage on enemy forces. On the night of the 3rd, three major explosions occurred near the Ma Chou barracks east of Manila. At the same time, Japanese forces in the Laguna de Bay area launched a strong attack on the enemy attempting to advance towards Baguio on the 1st. The Japanese artillery unit near the battle line in that area shelled and repelled the enemy that attacked positions approximately five kilometers east of Barks on the 4th. On the afternoon of the 5th, they destroyed two enemy rapid-firing guns and three armored vehicles and ammunition trucks each.

### Characteristics of the New Japanese Cabinet

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - In light of the increasingly pressing situation, the Allied Prime Minister Koiso decided to give way to a more powerful cabinet to cope with all eventualities, and Suzuki, an admiral of the navy, was quickly appointed. He has completed the task of forming a cabinet and has emerged in a new form amidst the tense autumn weather of the world. All countries in the world attach great importance to the Suzuki Cabinet, especially the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, who have higher expectations. The general feeling about this cabinet reorganization is that it is aimed at uniting the domestic forces, exerting the total strength for the decisive battle, and concentrating all efforts on increasing aircraft production to strengthen the defense of the homeland. In terms of foreign affairs, it will follow the past policies and strengthen the unity of the countries of East Asia to jointly seek the liberation of the entire East Asia.

The characteristics of this cabinet are twofold: It is centered on important ministers to form a more powerful cabinet, and more of the new cabinet officials are related to the navy, which is highly anticipated for the future development of the Japanese navy. Regarding the Soviet Union, it is hoped that the new cabinet will continue to advance the previous cabinet's policies. Moreover, the formation of this cabinet comes after the establishment of a new Japanese political party, and two of the new cabinet members are from the new party, so the connection between the military and the people will become closer.

### The New Japanese Cabinet Implements Decisive Politics

Central News Agency Report - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 8th that in the naval and air operations around Okinawa Island late on April 5th, a total of 24 auxiliary aircraft carriers, battleships, and other ships were sunk or destroyed. However, the enemy's broadcasts continue their consistent style, striving to conceal the damage suffered, only acknowledging that three destroyers were sunk. Although the US has publicized that its losses are minimal, only claiming the loss of three destroyers and seven aircraft, it has also stated that the British 35,000-ton battleship George V, which participated in the battle, suffered heavy damage from a Japanese air attack and was forced to retreat from the battle line, which shows how contradictory the enemy's propaganda is.

According to a Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese air force and surface fleet in the naval and air battle around Okinawa Island have become special attack units, determined to destroy the enemy with firm fighting spirit. At this time, the Suzuki Cabinet was born after the Koiso Cabinet. The new Prime Minister Suzuki Kantaro stated in his speech: "I am determined to stand in the front line with my old body for the people of the country and handle state affairs. I hope that you will step over my corpse, embrace a brave heart, and develop new combat power to pacify the sacred heart."

During the last great war, French Prime Minister Clemenceau, at the age of seventy-seven, finally reversed France's decline. The 79-year-old Prime Minister Suzuki Kantaro is also determined to lead the people of the country to fight to the end. The Suzuki Cabinet, with Anami and Yonai, ministers of the army and navy, respectively, concentrates the consistency of politics and strategy to powerfully promote decisive policies. The new cabinet is strongly supported by the ministers and the faith of the people. Under this harsh war situation, General Suzuki assigned the people of the country to the decisive battle machine, issuing orders. Japan is now achieving great results around Okinawa externally, and internally, the Suzuki Cabinet is strongly promoting decisive politics. Government officials, military personnel, and civilians are all advancing toward the path of destroying the enemy with the spirit of special attacks, and we all have high expectations.

### Agricultural Production Inspection Group Returns to Nanjing

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The 30 members of the joint organization of the Agricultural Production Planning Committee and the Ministry of Industry, who went to the various regions of Su, Hang, Jing, and Beng on the 25th of last month, returned to Nanjing yesterday. They are currently preparing reports on the progress of agricultural production in various places, which will be used by the conference as a reference for future improvements.

### Divergence of Opinion Between Chongqing and the United States on the Stilwell Road Transportation Issue

Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) - The opinions of Chongqing and the United States are not consistent regarding the allocation of military supplies transported via the Stilwell Road and the defense of the road. The United States seems to have a monopoly on the road, which has caused great dissatisfaction in Chongqing. According to recent enemy intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel Pan Sen of the US Army Rear Services in Kunming stated that the prerequisite for the road is the increase in personnel and that the US military should have priority in the transport of military supplies via the road. The main points of his statement are as follows: Currently, the US military on the mainland needs one-third of a ton of supplies per day, and the 14th Air Force has a great need for fuel recently. The US military's supplies are inferior to those in other theaters, and sometimes only two boxes of cigarettes are allocated per month, and other recreational items are even made in China.

### The Closure and Management Offices of Dangtu and Wuhu Counties in Anhui Province Are Abolished

Wuhu, 9th (Central News Agency) - The First District Clearing and Suppression Supervisory Office of Anhui Province stated that the clearing and suppression work in the district had been completed by the end of January. All closure and management offices and all checkpoints, large and small, in Dangtu and Wuhu counties have been abolished as scheduled. The duty of inspecting at all key passes has been assigned to the police bureaus of Dangtu and Wuhu counties.

Editorial

### Re-discussing the Way Out for the Shanghai Industrial Community

Speaking of the future of overall industrial construction, we will address the unreasonable phenomenon of China's economic bias towards several large cities. We consistently advocate for a balanced development that is suitable for the material, the location, and the people. Otherwise, there is no way to eliminate the colonial characteristics of China's economy, and there is no way to transform the socio-economy.

This theory and direction are equally suitable for the future industrial construction of Shanghai. Moreover, since Shanghai has always been the center of China's economy, finance, and especially industry, this fundamental reform should be initiated by the Shanghai industrial community. Secondly, considering the actual environment in Shanghai, with the progress of the war, it may be subject to air raid damage at any time. It is also difficult to improve the situation for a while due to the lack of coal, power restrictions, insufficient raw materials, and transportation obstruction. Rather than being trapped in a predicament of sitting idle and consuming resources, it is better to make active plans and seek a way out. Therefore, we have repeatedly argued that Shanghai's industry should be evacuated to the inland as soon as possible.

There are currently two arguments regarding the evacuation of Shanghai's industry. First, large factories should be transferred to Huaihai Province to build the future light industry foundation in the region. Second, smaller factories, especially those producing daily necessities, should be evacuated to the counties of Jiangsu Province, utilizing the local specialties of each county and adapting to the needs of the rural areas, building small factories for daily necessities. We believe that both of these arguments, whether for the construction of China's new industry after the war or for opening up a way out for Shanghai's industry and commerce today, require further research and practice. The former will not be discussed for the time being. Regarding the establishment of small factories for daily necessities in the counties of Jiangsu, we will further supplement and discuss as follows:

First, the evacuation of Shanghai's industrial community to the counties of Jiangsu to establish small factories for daily necessities is the industry itself seeking a way out to adapt to the environment. Therefore, the industry should automatically and quickly develop appropriate countermeasures. However, for rational development, it should be carried out in an organized, planned, and stepwise manner, trying to avoid deformed development, such as small yarn factories being established in competition due to profit. The types and number of factories to be built should be determined based on the special raw materials of each county in Jiangsu, the special needs of the rural areas, and the conditions of transportation.

Second, the Shanghai industrial and commercial community, especially factories with ample funds, should immediately conduct investigations and research, invest in setting up factories in various counties, or use existing local handicrafts to provide financial and technical assistance to promote development.

Third, the government authorities and the financial community should provide various assistance and conveniences to those in the industrial community who set up small factories for daily necessities in various counties in terms of funding, material handling, and security protection. If necessary, they should also provide rewards and subsidies. Tax exemptions and reductions should be given to the products of small factories.

In order to realize the evacuation of Shanghai's industry, and at the same time, to carry out planning, we suggest that the city's economic authorities, the Jiangsu Province authorities, and the leaders of various relevant trade associations of daily necessities factories, as well as economic experts, should form a committee to start investigation, design, and implementation. In addition to government loans, self-investment or loans from the financial community should be guaranteed interest by the National Bank to show the intention of advocating and assisting.

### Togo Appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs; Inauguration Ceremony Held Yesterday Afternoon

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki intended to appoint former Foreign Minister Togo Shigenori as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs at the beginning of his cabinet formation. However, Togo was residing in Karuizawa and was unable to arrive in Tokyo before the inauguration ceremony on the 7th. Therefore, Prime Minister Suzuki temporarily served concurrently as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs until now. Togo responded to the telegram and met with the Prime Minister after the inauguration ceremony on the 7th to negotiate his entry into the cabinet and requested a period of hesitation to carefully consider it. At 5:00 PM on the 9th, he visited the Prime Minister's official residence again for important talks. Since their opinions on the policy outline were completely consistent, he agreed to join the cabinet. The inauguration ceremony was held in the palace in the afternoon, and was announced by the Information Bureau at the same time. Togo is from Hiroshima Prefecture, 64 years old. After graduating from the University of Tokyo in Meiji 41 (1908), he entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In Showa 8 (1933), he served as Director of the European and American Bureau and Director of the Eurasian Bureau. He then concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. In the autumn of Showa 12 (1937), he was appointed Ambassador to Germany, and made great efforts in the cooperation between Japan and Germany. In the autumn of Showa 14 (1939), he was transferred to Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In Showa 16 (1941), he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Tojo Cabinet. He resigned and retired in September of Showa 17 (1942) and was appointed as a member of the House of Peers until today.

### Current Situation in Taicang

— (Zhu Ming)

There are two transportation routes between Shanghai and Taicang: one is the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, where long-distance buses can directly reach Taicang. If the car parts do not encounter any obstacles, it takes about four hours to reach the west gate of Taicang city. The long-distance bus operated by the China Central Railway, with a station on Qiujiang Road, was originally scheduled for two trips per day (9:00 AM, 2:00 PM), but in reality, there is often only one trip at 9:00 AM. If it rains, it will be suspended. Each car was originally stipulated to carry 40 passengers, but now it carries more than 50 passengers. There are many commercial car lines currently, which are more convenient than before, and the journey is safe, but the road surface is uneven and bumpy, and because the bridges are damaged, passengers need to get off and walk in the middle of the journey. If you take a car from Shanghai to Nanxiang or Jiading, you can take an inland river boat to Taicang City. This route takes longer, but it is economical.

If there are five or six people, and there is a little more luggage, it is more convenient to charter a car from Shanghai directly to Taicang City. The car price is about 80,000 yuan.

The cost of living in Taicang is similar to that in Shanghai. The prices of major daily necessities are listed below:

Rice (stone) 70,000 yuan

Firewood (load) 3,000 yuan

Oil (catty) 1,000 yuan

Meat (catty) 800 yuan

Spinach (catty) 330 yuan

Electricity Per Kilowatt 500 yuan

The local rice and grain can be self-sufficient. Now, due to the influence of rice dealers, the stored rice can only last until mid-April. Now, to buy three or four dou at a time, you must go to the west gate or several miles outside the north gate. It is said that the farther away from the north gate, the lower the price.

There are currently 25,000 residents in Taicang City. The market is better in the west gate. The rent in the city is calculated in rice. An ordinary room 16 feet wide and 16 feet long costs 1.5 dou of rice per month, or about 10,000 yuan. This system has been banned by the county government, but many still follow it secretly.

Those who maintain law and order include the Military Police, the Garrison Team, the Security Team, and the Public Security Bureau. In general, the situation is good. There are two senior high schools, four junior high schools, and three elementary schools in the city. Not many school-age children are enrolled, and education is not very developed.

### The Special Court for the Anhui Civil Servant Extortion Case Has Delivered Its Verdict; Yu Shi'an Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Yu Shi'an, the former Chief Secretary of the Third District Administrative Inspectorate of Anhui, along with Wang Shuzhi, the inspector, Liu Junyang, the councilor, and Liu Daoya, the head of the Mingguangzhen District of Jiashan County, conspired with Zhou Leshan, the former Administrative Inspector of the Third District, at the end of November last year to extort donations from various industries in Mingguang in the name of dedication. The total amount of money obtained reached 14.16 million yuan. Zhou, Yu, and Liu decided to submit 5.2 million yuan, and intended to embezzle the remaining 8.96 million yuan. This was discovered by the Anhui Provincial Government, which ordered Councilor Ge Wanglong to investigate. The suspect Liu Junyang and others then requested that various industries conceal the matter on their behalf. After Councilor Ge met with the chairmen of various industries, he learned that the above-mentioned facts were true, and believed that Yu Shi'an and others had illegally extorted a huge sum of money and concealed the report, which was inappropriate. He immediately escorted the one thousand suspects to Bengbu to be interrogated by the Provincial Government. Inspector Zhou Leshan had committed suicide by taking poison for fear of punishment. The remaining defendants were sent to the Special Court. After several trials, a verdict was issued on the 3rd of this month, sentencing Yu Shi'an to life imprisonment for forcibly extorting property from the people, and fining him 50,000 yuan. Wang Shuzhi was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment and fined 30,000 yuan. Liu Daoya was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and fined 20,000 yuan. Liu Junyang was acquitted.

### Tense Situation on the Northern and Southern Wings of the Western Front; German Troops Defend Bremen

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency reports: The past week has been one of the most tense weeks of the Western Front. Famous cities such as Bremen, Hanover, Ofrat, Nuremberg, and Stuttgart are all close to the battle line, and the resistance of the German troops at each point is gradually showing results. At present, the battle line from the far north to the far south stretches from Anтинg eastward, then turns northwest, passing through Almelo, Minden, Nothausen, and reaching the heart of Germany, then turning westward to the southwest, passing through Eisenach, Schweinfurt, Wurzburg, Heilbronn, and reaching Karlsruhe in a semi-circle. At present, the frontline in the east, from Berlin to Frankfurt, Kustrin, etc., is only 60 kilometers away, but in the past week, it has not been able to affect the resistance of the western front at all. The situation on the northernmost wing of the Western Front is extremely noteworthy. The Weser district is tense, and Bremen, one of Germany's most important seaports, is under threat, but strong German forces have withdrawn from the Netherlands and are stationed in the area west of Bremen.

### Stilwell Acknowledges Difficulties in the War Against Japan

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuter reports: U.S. Army Commander General Stilwell stated at an Army Memorial Day dinner the night before that as American forces advance closer to the Japanese mainland, the supply lines for the Allied forces increase in length, while the Japanese supply lines shorten. This point cannot be ignored. Supplying the troops fighting in Europe requires a 3,000-mile voyage across the Atlantic, while supplying the troops fighting in East Asia requires a 7,000-mile voyage across the Pacific. The eastern United States has many good ports, while the western United States has fewer. This point also cannot be ignored. From the good ports of the Philippines to the Asian mainland is still a 600-mile voyage, while the English Channel is only twenty-six miles wide. The difference in difficulty is obvious. Furthermore, the military strength of the Japanese in this theater is even stronger than the military strength the American forces have encountered elsewhere.

### Song Ziwen and Others Depart for the United States

Macau, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuter reports: Acting Premier and Foreign Minister of Chongqing, Song Ziwen, as the head of the delegation to the San Francisco Conference, has already departed for the United States with the American economic advisor to Chongqing, Henderson. Li Huang has also departed. The only delegate who has not yet left Chongqing is the Communist Party member, Biwu, who is said to be planning to depart within a few days.

### 2,000 American Planes Bomb Northern German Cities

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - London reports: The Eighth Air Force Headquarters announced on the 8th that 1,300 American heavy bombers and 850 fighter planes bombed northern Germany on the 7th. Over Hamburg, they encountered jet-propelled fighter planes and lost twenty-two heavy bombers and three fighter planes. This is the greatest loss since the Allies crossed the Rhine.

### Relations Between the Soviet Union and Turkey

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuter reports, United Press, Ankara: Well-informed sources believe that the Soviet-Turkish crisis will affect the domestic political situation in Turkey. The position of the Turkish Prime Minister may be shaken as a result. Stalin has clearly informed his Allied nations of the Soviet Union's intentions towards Turkey. Turkey has become the most important nation in the world's political arena.

### Nanking Establishes Blood Type Testing Association

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The preparations for the Nanking Blood Type Testing Committee are complete. A founding meeting will be held at 3:00 PM this afternoon in the city government auditorium.

### British Labor Minister to Resign from Cabinet

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports, according to London: It appears that the resignation of British Labor Minister Bevin from the British cabinet will soon become a reality.

### Fierce Fighting Around Vienna - Soviet Forces Advance from the Northwest and West

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuter reports: The battle for Vienna is gradually becoming a large-scale battle. The fighting on the German-Hungarian border, as well as the clashes between the Morava River and the Rabnitz River, are not included in the scope of this major battle. The most important development in the battle for Vienna is the Soviet forces' penetration into the Vienna Woods, putting pressure on the German Danube bridgehead near Tulln, northwest of Vienna. Although the Soviet forces were blocked in front of the German defense line, they simultaneously pushed around Vienna from the west. The fierce fighting continued all day. Although the Suedbahnhof (South Station) and Margaretenring in Vienna have been recaptured by German forces, the Westbahnhof district (West Station) is in danger of being penetrated by Soviet forces.

### All Sectors Should Restrain Themselves, Cooperate in Suppressing Prices - Top Economic Advisor Ogura Delivers Remarks

Government's top economic advisor, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, made a special trip from Nanking for official business. Yesterday (9th) at 4:00 PM, he met with local Chinese and foreign reporters at the East Asia Building along with the new economic advisor, Mr. Araki. Top Advisor Ogura delivered remarks on issues such as the mobilization of Chinese resources for war efforts and the suppression of prices. He also answered many questions raised by reporters. The following is a summary:

Ogura Advisor Remarks

### The Front Lines and the Rear Are Equally Important

The original remarks from Top Advisor Ogura: (Long time no see, everyone. The situation has progressed rapidly recently; things that happened only two or three months ago feel like a long time ago. Now that the enemy has climbed onto the Philippines, seized Iwo Jima, and landed on part of Okinawa, and as the bombing of important cities, both inside and outside, intensifies, the front lines and the rear must be regarded as equally important. Whether in the homeland or on-site, the posture directly connected to the war effort is quickly being established, which is only natural. At this time, we must sincerely face the situation and implement decisive measures, regardless of formalities or past malpractices, in order to prepare for any situation that may arise in the future, which goes without saying. Economic matters must never lag behind the war effort. Therefore, the military and civilians of both Japan and China must work even more closely together, and with a new resolve, continue to advance to complete the holy war.)

### Chinese Resources Should Be Mobilized for War Efforts

I believe that China is now the largest supply base among the regions of Greater East Asia for Japan. However, in view of the development of the war situation, all sectors must redouble their efforts to strategically mobilize Chinese resources. Regarding the problems in Central China, the problem of [text unclear - looks like "wheat" related characters] is actually the central issue. Because the achievements in [same unclear text] are not only directly related to war efforts, but also have a great impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, I urge local officials and civilians to work even harder. Although the [same unclear text] problem is also important, problems such as transportation or the revitalization of light industry are easy to talk about, but actually doing them well is very difficult. All parties are working hard on this issue, but it seems that some aspects of the situation are gradually deteriorating. However, the enemy is also experiencing this phenomenon, so we must continue to work hard to the end and never change our course. At present, we should be satisfied with any improvement, no matter how small, that we can make in the worsening war situation. But if we continue to work hard, we will definitely be able to improve, and our efforts will be worthwhile.

### The Development of the War Situation is in Our Favor

The enemy firmly believes that victory in this war will belong to them. The closer the enemy gets to the Japanese mainland, the longer their supply lines become, and the more the war situation seems to slowly unfold in our favor, revealing the enemy's anxiety. Of course, the war situation will become increasingly tragic and harsh in the future. The enemy thinks that if we keep fighting persistently, the enemy will naturally retreat. Today, enduring hardship is the path that all East Asian nations should take. It is not possible to win the crown of victory without effort. In other words, no one can stand idly by. I believe that the people of China and Japan should take advantage of the present opportunity to make further progress, and make a greater contribution to the great cause of Asia, so as not to be ashamed. If this spirit can be thoroughly implemented, then prices can also be favorably affected. I believe that the reasons for the recent high prices in Central China are very complex, as described below:

### Reasons for High Prices in Central China

China is very different from other warring nations. Even though it still possesses abundant resources, it cannot circulate them smoothly, making it a target for speculation and hoarding, which is an important reason for high prices. In view of this, I believe that if the atmosphere of self-restraint and the elimination of speculation and hoarding can permeate the economic sphere and gradually extend to other aspects, good results will definitely be shown. As you all know, observing the current price trends in Central China is regrettable, whether from the perspective of squeezing resources for war economics or from the perspective of people's livelihood. At present, the authorities in China and Japan are promoting policies to suppress prices with great enthusiasm. However, I also believe that promoting self-restraint in all sectors is an important part of suppressing prices and safeguarding currency measures.

### Answering Questions

Advisor Ogura stated: At this critical moment in the Greater East Asia War, all nations of Greater East Asia should cooperate closely in this difficult time, actively uniting as one. Whether it is economic policy or any policy, it will definitely have a bright future of advancement if it is tightly connected and coordinated. Now the national government is actively strengthening production, and all sectors should have a thorough understanding of this in order to achieve final victory. He then answered the various questions raised:

1. Regarding the problem of rationing for civilian needs. (Answer) Due to production and resource constraints, it is still not possible to achieve universal rationing. In the future, we should increase production, and rely on the cooperation of all farmers and sincerely trust the implementation of control measures.

2. What methods are there to bring back the flow of cash to outside ports? (Answer) At present, after receiving goods, cash tends to flow into rural areas. I hope that farmers will acquire the virtue of accumulating savings and depositing them in local banks, in order to emulate the inherent spirit of the Japanese people. This will allow currency to flow smoothly back.

3. What are your opinions on replenishing material supply and increasing production? (Answer) In addition to replenishing the source of coal and increasing the ability to transport it, we should also actively develop local coal resources. Regarding coal, we have already received the joint cooperation of the Japanese Army and Navy authorities. There should be no shortage of coal mining. There should be no problems with increasing production in the future.

4. What is the economic policy of the new Japanese cabinet towards China? (Answer) After the recent cabinet reshuffle in Japan, the policy towards China will continue to follow the established direction of the past and will continue to be implemented without any change.

5. What are your opinions on strengthening wartime economic control measures? (Answer) During wartime economics and control, the focus should be on mobilizing war efforts, increasing military production and civilian supplies.

6. What are the new economic policies of China? (Answer) The national government already has a basic concept for these policies and is actively engaged in increasing production. At the same time, all provinces and cities have followed orders to expand village production work. Anhui and Huai provinces have recently been training basic rural talent to strengthen rural production.
