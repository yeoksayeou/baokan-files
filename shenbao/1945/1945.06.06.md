### Enemy Aircraft Formation Fiercely Attacks Enemy Warships: Intense Aerial Battles Unfold; Fierce Battles Underway in Southern Okinawa Region

Ryukyu Islands Base, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - On the night of the 3rd, Japanese Air Force units attacked enemy warships in the sea area near Okinawa, inflicting considerable damage. Japanese fighter squadrons also flew over the skies of Okinawa Island, engaging in fierce aerial battles with enemy fighter groups. Furthermore, a small group of enemy naval vessels, including one large warship, approached the southern region of Okinawa Island on the 4th, bombarding Japanese positions. Japanese defending forces valiantly returned fire.

Certain Air Base, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Since the 28th of last month, Okinawa has been significantly impacted by the activities of the Japanese Special Attack Shinbu Corps. As the weather gradually improves, a large-scale attack was launched on the 3rd against enemy warship formations cruising in that area, carrying out self-destructive attacks to inflict heavy damage. The Wakazakura and Yuishin squadrons, flying aircraft, and with close cooperation from the land and sea air forces, broke through the intense defense network on the morning of the 3rd, reaching enemy airspace and successively diving towards enemy warships. Furthermore, to continue this attack in the afternoon, the Takamo squadron, flying aircraft, also bravely took off, attacking the chaotic enemy ships. Prior to the attack, enemy warships around Okinawa were estimated to include three battleships, three cruisers, fifteen destroyers, and one hundred and thirty transport ships off the coast of Kadena, and one battleship and one cruiser off the coast of Itoman, due to poor weather in that area, a thorough verification has yet to be conducted. At that time, a considerable number of warships were in operation, attempting to cooperate with land forces to decisively determine the outcome of the battle. The activities of the enemy fleet are of great importance, and the rapid change in the war situation is not optimistic.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Fierce battles continue to unfold in the southern region of Okinawa Island. On both the east and west coasts, the enemy forces have not made significant advances due to Japanese counterattacks. However, the enemy forces in the central area have gradually moved south, crossing the Kokuba River from a point three to four kilometers south of Shuri, advancing towards the Japanese defense lines on the southern coast. Japanese troops bravely engaged, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy to impede their advance. Additionally, Japanese special attack forces continued to attack enemy warship formations around the island from the 1st to the 3rd, expanding their battlefield victories amidst adverse weather conditions.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Hanshin Area; 200 Aircraft Shot Down; Fire in Eastern Kobe Quickly Extinguished

Editorial

### Regulating People's Food and Suppressing Prices

Recently, due to the soaring price of rice, general prices have also risen. Now, to limit the soaring general prices, we must start with regulating people's food and suppressing the price of rice.

This newspaper has discussed the food problem in recent days. However, if the food problem is not solved and the price of rice does not fall, the entire price problem will not be solved, and may even worsen. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to continue to elaborate on this issue.

We have twice proposed emergency measures to address the food problem, the main points of which are: Today, the food problem is no longer simply a matter of rice. The problem of maintaining grain supplies should also be discussed at the same time. The responsibility for the food problem should be jointly shouldered by both Chinese and Japanese authorities and civilian leaders.

Today, we urgently call for the responsibility for the food and price problems should not be avoided by anyone, no matter how serious the war situation is or how scarce resources are. However, have the competent authorities done their best, have the Allied authorities in China provided as much assistance as possible, have the leaders in the private sector done their best to plan, and have the merchants thoroughly awakened and exercised self-restraint? This is a question of degree. We believe there is still ample room for joint efforts. Those who have already started should continue to persevere and continue to work hard.

Now we propose two major principles for emergency measures to address the food problem. Although they may seem humble, we firmly believe that both principles are practical and unwavering.

Smooth transportation: Shanghai is experiencing a food panic, while miscellaneous grains are overstocked in Jiangsu Province, making it impossible to regulate the situation. The biggest reason for this is the failure to ensure smooth transportation. It is said that the authorities have plans to overcome transportation difficulties. We hope to see them implemented immediately. All available transportation tools, including railways, sea transport, and inland waterways, should be utilized to the fullest extent. Saving the starving is like putting out a fire, and there should be no delay.

Increase production: The significance of agricultural loans lies in increasing production, as this newspaper has repeatedly explained. Now that the loan disbursement period is approaching, people in the financial and economic sectors should pay attention to the seasonal need for loans by farmers. Further delays will not benefit farmers and will not achieve the goal of increasing production.

Under these two principles, the opportunity for effort must not be lost. We hope that officials, merchants, the public, and Allied authorities will pay attention to them together. However, this belongs to the aspect of promoting benefits. In terms of eliminating evils, we also propose a practical and unwavering principle.

The reason for the soaring price of rice and the skyrocketing price of goods is that we believe this is the result of the failure of past economic policies to be free of flaws. Economic policies must be reasonable and then beneficial, and they must suit national conditions and popular sentiment, and then proceed smoothly. Otherwise, a policy of "carving a boat to find a sword" will hardly be effective. At the same time, a method of "cutting one's feet to fit the shoes" is not enough to speak of success or failure. Today, we hope that both China and Japan should come to a full realization and eliminate as much as possible the unreasonable points of past economic policies and reorganize as much as possible the impractical points of institutions. The most ideal way is for the Chinese and Japanese authorities and private sector leaders to organize an institution in the nature of an "Economic Staff Headquarters", whose task is to review the pros and cons at any time, study the gains and losses, and reduce the unnecessary pain of the people on the negative side. On the positive side, based on the pros and cons, experience the gains and losses, suit the national conditions and public sentiment, and create a concrete improvement plan to provide to the authorities for execution, and have the right to supervise and correct the progress of execution. In this way, the shortcomings of all economic policies can be reduced and gradually improved.

Finally, we present two more facts to those who care about people's food. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the military have repeatedly negotiated and have now agreed on a method of borrowing rice, and the focus of food distribution to military police and civil servants is no longer a problem. However, the general public's food situation still requires the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Allied authorities to quickly formulate appropriate measures.

Hoarding and raising prices by grain merchants is not due to a shortage of grain, but to a speculative mentality caused by the soaring price of rice. We hope that grain merchants will be able to act with conscience, quickly exercise self-restraint, reduce grain prices, and buy out as much as possible to help solve the food problem. Otherwise, the authorities will take severe measures for the sake of overall regulation.

In short, the soaring price of rice is the main reason for the rise in all prices. We must both promote benefits and eliminate evils, taking a two-pronged approach to bring down the price of rice and regulate people's food, and then all prices will naturally tend to stabilize at the same time. As the Continental New Daily said, today we should not be discouraged, but should muster courage to overcome difficulties. We cannot stand idly by, nor can we simply cry "no way" to mock ourselves, because the situation is serious, and we cannot destabilize people's livelihood, because inflation is rampant, and we cannot find ways to alleviate it, because past economic policies have many shortcomings, and we must strive to rectify them and start anew. We cannot know that something can be done and not do it, and even if we know that something cannot be done, we cannot but think of ways to make it possible within the impossible.

Translated Commentary

### Urgently Solving the Price Problem

Recently, prices have been very high, and the reasons for this are certainly not simple. Some say that the progress of the war is related to the soaring prices, so unless there is a favorable turning point in the war, there is no hope for solving the price problem. It is true that the progress of the war has an impact on the psychology of the Chinese people and the tendency to hoard property cannot be denied. However, if the recent soaring prices are simply used to prove this point, it will not only be a wrong view, but also may result in the authorities avoiding responsibility. The direct impact of the progress of the war on prices seems to be much smaller than commonly imagined; this argument is likely to be true.

In recent days, the direct cause of rising prices has been the soaring price of rice, and the battle on Okinawa has had virtually no impact. Therefore, how to smoothly promote the rice procurement work and what is the best way to solve the food problem must be fundamentally reviewed. Countermeasures that can be implemented should be implemented quickly and decisively, and then the soaring price of rice can be considerably suppressed. The authorities should not lose the courage to solve the problem because of the difficulties involved, and should resolutely take action with indomitable courage. In fact, isn't it because the various difficulties are too complicated that they have lost the courage to solve them and are simply waiting for a change in the war situation?

For the sake of stabilizing prices, countermeasures in terms of currency must also be considered. Wartime inflation is an unavoidable phenomenon. Even in Japan, where strict control is in place, it is impossible to completely prevent inflation. As in Chongqing, in areas where control is weak, inflation is proceeding at an explosive rate. Therefore, how to stabilize it at a certain level, and even slow down the rate of inflation within a possible range, is the main limitation of currency policy. The issuance of gold-backed securities by reserve banks seems to be for this purpose as well. It goes without saying that this policy must be implemented rationally and thoroughly in all aspects. However, on the reverse side of the effort to recover currency, is it not the result of unnecessary release of currency caused by the complexity of the material procurement institutions and their mutual opposition and competition, or because the parties involved disregard the purpose and allow unrestrained behavior by all means? For example, the procurement of agricultural products must be carried out at a reasonable price in order to be implemented permanently. However, in practice, because the implementation is not necessarily perfect, the reverse side is that the payment of unnecessary prices promotes rising prices, which is also a common phenomenon. We firmly believe that this situation must be greatly reviewed.

In short, there are more than two or three reasons for rising prices, and it is also due to the economic situation that has led to this. Then, there is no way to save the situation other than to explore the reasons and make unremitting efforts to gradually solve them. If, because the situation is too profound and difficult and it is already too late, this effort is not made, and instead a laissez-faire attitude is adopted, it is absolutely impossible. This is a discouraged mentality. We must muster our spirits and overcome difficulties. Although it is not appropriate to regulate the current economic situation with the ordinary duties of peacetime in terms of economic principles, the progress of the Battle of Okinawa is of a deeper significance and surpassing previous concepts of war. Economic policy in Central China is also a part of the war in a broad sense, but compared with Okinawa, it inevitably lacks enthusiasm and is too low-key. Those in charge of economic policy are probably in need of breaking out of the current "no way" doctrine, the bystander's doctrine, and exert their best efforts to find new courage to start afresh!

### US Presidential Envoy Still in Moscow, Efforts to Adjust Relations Among the Three Countries

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Since arriving in Moscow on May 25, US President Truman's envoy, Harry Hopkins, has repeatedly met with Chairman Stalin, striving to adjust relations among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. He was originally scheduled to return home on June 1, but has been postponed for four days to date, but there is still no sign of his departure. Truman sent Hopkins to the Soviet Union to discuss and resolve issues such as the Polish dispute, the German occupation problem, and other independent diplomacy with the Soviet government. However, suspicion and unease between Britain and the United States are increasing.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - According to a report from San Francisco, President Truman and Prime Minister Churchill may jointly send a letter to Stalin to discuss the issue of the veto power in the "Security Conference". It is widely believed that Churchill himself also has questions about this "veto power", and the delegations of the five major powers are paying close attention to how he will respond to the Soviet proposal.

### Discussion on Solving the Shanghai Food Panic

— By Kangyuan Xiang

Yesterday, Mr. Kangyuan Xiang proposed a "Centralized Purchase of Coarse Grains to Urgently Relieve the City's Rice Shortage" at the Advisory Council. Our newspaper specially recorded and published the original proposal yesterday. Immediately, the Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Association sent a letter expressing its approval and support. Now, Mr. Xiang has written another article with more specific details, which we are publishing again. Furthermore, a reader, Mr. Luo, has submitted a letter with his opinions, which also has the significance of arousing public awareness. We are publishing it below as well. - Editor's Note

Recently, the soaring rice prices in this city have created panic and unease everywhere in society. Those who do not have enough grain for even one night are certainly finding it difficult to cope with daily life. Even those who have rice stored for a year or several months are unwilling to replenish it at high prices as they consume it daily, and will soon find it difficult to sustain themselves. Moreover, other daily necessities are also rising sharply along with rice prices. Therefore, the high rice price is a matter of grave concern to all sectors of society, and there is no need to elaborate.

Rice prices are so high, and everyone must eat rice every day, so everyone hopes for a solid source to lower market prices. However, according to surveys, the reserves in the surrounding countryside are extremely depleted, and there is little hope of finding a sufficient source in the short term. Therefore, we have no choice but to rely on our own efforts, passively seeking to reduce consumption, and actively promoting the consumption of coarse grains, while striving to secure a sufficient supply. I will now present my humble opinions as follows:

Centralized Purchase and Transportation of Coarse Grains to Shanghai: Rice prices are high, so we can only reduce rice consumption and eat more coarse grains to ease the burden. Although the market prices of the latter have also risen to some extent along with rice prices, the degree is ultimately more moderate than that of rice. Moreover, coarse grains are abundant in provinces like Huaihai. If we can pool resources and use the power of the government to purchase large quantities and transport them to Shanghai for sale at cost price, I firmly believe that it will greatly help solve the city's food problem. The Shanghai Municipal Government has an unshirkable responsibility for the centralized purchase and transportation work, and should promptly establish a Coarse Grains Purchase and Allocation Committee with a spirit of "acting righteously and bravely" to handle the matter. Currently, there are many obstacles in the acquisition and transportation process. Using the power of the government will be more effective than relying on merchants. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should be tasked with mobilizing the organizations of various trade associations to estimate the number of members and employees, and set a quota for the purchase of coarse grains for each, pay the price according to the types and estimated prices of coarse grains announced by the Municipal Government, and submit the payment to the Committee within a deadline for centralized purchase and transportation. If it takes a long time to pay, they can first consult with the Reserve Bank for a loan, and repay the Central Reserve Bank when the trade association's payment is made. After the goods arrive, the trade associations will take 50% of their originally purchased quota to distribute to their members and employees. The remaining 50% will be sold publicly at cost price by the Committee, and the proceeds will be returned to the purchasing trade associations. The Committee can also accept requests from merchants, social groups, and households that are not members of trade associations for commissioned purchases, but stipulate a minimum quantity for each unit, and the payment and purchase methods will be the same as for trade associations. However, the trade associations' purchase quotas should have priority in acquisition and transportation.

Encouraging Coarse Grain Production: Reclaim wasteland. There is a lot of wasteland in the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Xujiahui, Longhua, Pudong, Jiangwan, Wusong, etc., with wild grass growing and abandoned land, which is a great pity. The Municipal Government should immediately investigate the situation clearly, and sign contracts with the landowners to require them to cultivate the land according to the regulations. If the owners are unwilling, the Municipal Government has the right to lease the land and recruit people to cultivate it, planting coarse grains. All the crops sold will be enjoyed by the cultivators as an incentive. However, the land ownership will still belong to the original owners. Utilize open spaces in the city. After the baptism of war, there are many houses destroyed in Nanshi and Zhabei, leaving only piles of rubble. Some have even had the rubble removed. Some residents have built houses next to them and engaged in small-scale planting of vegetables, wheat, and beans. Although scattered and small, and the harvest is not much, if the Municipal Government uses its power to promote cultivation in an organized manner, the accumulation will be significant, and the yield will be considerable. We advocate that the Municipal Government should immediately instruct the relevant bureaus to lease the open spaces from the owners, clear the piles of rubble, mud, and garbage, and recruit people to cultivate coarse grains. The treatment should be the same as mentioned above. After the crops grow, not only will the people's food be enriched, but the air in the city can also be purified. In addition, the gardens and courtyards of residences should follow the German food production increase method during the First World War. The Municipal Government should conduct surveys and persuade them to change to planting staple foods such as potatoes, so that there is no wasted land and people have enough food.

Passive Measures

To solve the food problem in Shanghai, in addition to increasing production, reducing consumption is also very important. Our countrymen consume more food than any other country, with the ratio being about 1:1.5 to 1:3. In fact, the most suitable amount of food is 5 to 5.5 合 (hé, a unit of dry measure, about 0.1 liter) per day for adults, 4 to 4.5 合 per day for women and children, and 6.5 to 7 合 per day for workers. Now, people often eat 7 or 8 合, or even 1.2 to 1.3 升 (shēng, a unit of dry measure, about 1 liter). A closer examination reveals that this is appalling. However, if someone advocates limiting eating, it will be considered unreasonable. This is formed by traditional habits. In normal times, the harm is still small, but in this time of extreme food panic, the harm is very great. Based on the current population of 4 million in Shanghai, if each person eats an average of 8 合 of rice per day (an underestimate), the total daily requirement is more than 30,000 石 (dàn, a unit of dry measure, about 100 liters). If we can reduce the amount of food by 20%, we can save 6,000 石 of rice per day, and 180,000 石 per month, which is enough to meet the needs of the city for 7 or 8 days. In other words, the rice that can be maintained for one month at the original amount of food can support 37 or 38 days after a 20% reduction, which is not a small help.

From a health perspective, reducing food has only benefits and no drawbacks. The simplest way to reduce food is to eat more porridge, especially porridge for dinner, so that the stomach and intestines work lighter during sleep, which is more beneficial. Several of my friends used to eat rice for both lunch and dinner. Later, they changed to eating rice porridge for dinner. After several months, their weight increased significantly. Also, the amount of food for the workers in a factory was properly restricted by the factory. After several years of implementation, everyone's health is good. Therefore, although our countrymen are only advocating reducing food because of the current high rice prices, even if peace comes in the future, for the sake of national health, we still hope that the people can correct the old habit of eating too much rice, control excessive waste, and reduce the burden on individuals and the country.

Concluding Remarks

In the above article and the encouragement to plant coarse grains, the potato (commonly known as "yang shanyu" or "yang yunai") is the easiest to plant and the easiest to propagate. It can be harvested three or four times a year, so the benefits are the greatest. As for its characteristics and scientific cultivation methods, we have asked the Agricultural College of St. John's University to write a detailed explanation for public release, so that citizens can refer to and adopt it. It will soon be seen in the newspapers.

The food problem in Shanghai is related to the economic burden of each citizen, and is also related to social security. Therefore, people in the government and in the private sector should regard it as a matter of grave concern, and work together to find a solution. Those who rely on their own stored rice and adopt an attitude of indifference, or think that the disease is incurable and give up their responsibilities, will only mislead themselves and others. Therefore, wise political authorities should quickly formulate countermeasures and implement them. Otherwise, if they delay, even if the water of the Xijiang River arrives, the dried carp will have become a withered fish. What use is there then?

### Countermeasures that Cannot Be Ignored

— By Luohan

The severity of the food problem is now on the verge of a crisis, like fish trapped in a drying pond! It is a time of imminent danger, like eyebrows singed by fire! Ordinary people are naturally worried about not having enough to eat in the morning. However, even wealthy merchants and landlords, despite their abundant stores, can they be guaranteed to sit and eat in peace when confronted with the imminent storm of famine and riots? Now, the poor and the rich have truly reached a point of "shared survival"! The wider the gap between the rich and the poor, the deeper the latent crisis! Li Yuanhong once had the slogan "Everyone eats rice together," which will surely erupt from the latent crisis, becoming uncontrollable once it starts! At that time, how can the wealthy merchants and landlords who enjoy fish, meat, delicacies, and white rice survive? I am not trying to scare anyone, but this is inevitable. Writing this, I truly feel a chill down my spine! The proverb says, "Saving from hunger is like fighting a fire!" Before the war, when each 石 (dàn) of rice rose to twenty yuan, people were already in a state of anxiety! Local officials and gentry were already urgently discussing methods for selling rice at a low price. Now, the price of white rice has reached the insane level of forty yuan, yet those in power are helpless? The trend of everyone perishing together is truly serious beyond words! As it is now, instead of one family laughing while the rest cry, it is better to jointly implore the authorities and the members of the Advisory Committee to quickly consider the people's suffering and implement emergency rescue measures to alleviate the people's distress and prevent turmoil! The method should be to persuade the wealthy households to lend grain or hand over forty percent of their stored rice (national reserves). (I believe many wealthy people have white rice stored in their homes, at least six months to a year's worth, right?) Concentrated in designated warehouses, the poor can be investigated and identified through the baojia household registration system, and sold at a reduced price! Other measures such as urgently purchasing coarse grains from the inland and coastal provinces, and transporting them to Shanghai to alleviate the emergency! And limit all flour mills (it is best to send people to supervise) to concentrate the flour in a certain warehouse for selling at a low price, and not to sell it privately on the black market. Those who violate this will be severely punished by donating to relief efforts. If decisive measures are taken quickly, I believe the severity of the food problem can be gradually reduced!

### Model Self-Defense Corps of Three Districts Holds Founding Ceremony Yesterday, Luo, Concurrent Head of Baojia Committee, and Others Attended and Presided Over

The Model Brigade of the Self-Defense Corps of the Taishan, Lujiawan, and Dangshu Three Districts of this city, since following the order of the Corps Headquarters, has been actively organizing and preparing. Yesterday (5th) morning at 10 o'clock, the joint founding ceremony was held at the Donghua Ball Field. Luo, Concurrent Head of the Municipal District Baojia Committee, and Gu, Concurrent Secretary-General of the Corps Headquarters, both attended and presided over the ceremony. Also present were the Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Second Chief, the Deputy Director of the Baojia Section, the Deputy Directors of the District Offices, the Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of the Sections, the Chairmen of the Districts, the General Liaison Committee members, and more than 3,000 Baojia workers. The inspection began on time, with Gu, Concurrent Secretary-General, accompanying Luo, Concurrent Chairman, Man, Deputy Director, and others. First, a review parade was held. Then, members of the three-district model corps demonstrated martial arts, police exercises, and air defense drills. The actions for alarm transmission, communication, evacuation, fire fighting, and rescue were very agile. Then, the founding ceremony was held. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered a speech reporting the training progress of the three districts. Then, the oath was taken, led by Zhang Renzhong, Chairman of the Presidium, and supervised by Gu, Concurrent Secretary-General. After the oath, Luo, Concurrent Chairman, Man, Deputy Director, and Gu, Concurrent Secretary-General, gave speeches successively. Finally, Zhang Renzhong, representative of the Model Brigade, delivered a thank-you speech.

Speech by Luo, Concurrent Chairman

Luo, Concurrent Chairman, said in his speech: "Recently, model teams of the Self-Defense Corps have been organized in various districts of this city, which I think is a good phenomenon. This is because it shows that our Baojia Self-Defense Corps is constantly progressing and strengthening, and at the same time it can also prove the harvest of the hard work of the Baojia staff. In the past, the Self-Defense Corps of this city was unorganized and untrained, and of course had no power. However, with the efforts of the comrades of the Baojia Section and below, countless capable model team cadres have been gradually trained, and these capable members have produced the model teams of each district, making the scattered organized and the weak powerful. I am very grateful for this. Today is the joint establishment of the Model Brigade of the Lujiawan, Taishan, and Changshu Three Districts. From now on, the self-defense power of these three districts will definitely be more substantial, and achievements can be expected. When the model brigades of all districts in the city are announced, our self-defense power will be further promoted, and the future is full of unlimited hope.

You have all been formed into model team members, and from now on you will be the role models for general Self-Defense Corps members. You must guide and train them in peacetime, but your responsibilities will naturally be increased. At the same time, you must also set an example, self-discipline, and self-love, and first make yourself a truly good Self-Defense Corps member, and then be a model for others, so that you can complete your glorious mission. At the current stage of the decisive battle, your work of cooperating with public security and cooperating with air defense is becoming more and more tense, especially air defense is even more urgent. Everyone must work together to prepare for a rainy day, so that you can deal with it calmly once something happens, without being flustered. Therefore, I hope that everyone will work hard and train more. The ancients said: 'Unity is strength,' which means that there is strength only when there is unity. Therefore, I believe that our strength will not be difficult to overcome any environmental difficulties if the Baojia Self-Defense Corps of each district are united sincerely. Finally, I hope everyone will work hard."

Speech by Man, Deputy Director

Deputy Director Man said briefly in his speech: "I just saw the comrades practicing, their movements are neat, and their spirit is full, which is quite admirable. Air defense tasks are very important. The mission you bear in the Shanghai area is actually the reserve force of the national defense combatants. The current war is a total war, integrating manpower and material resources, especially manpower is the most important. It not only needs the power of the masses, but also needs to be organized and trained, and widely gather the creed of excellent national defense combatants. In terms of organization and training, focus on quality rather than quantity. Therefore, I deeply hope that you will fully understand the importance of the mission you bear and train closely. At the same time, I hope that your training will spread throughout the country. In addition, during the training phase, it is especially necessary to develop military-like actions, and must have the posture, movements, and spirit of obedience of soldiers, work hard, and strive for sacrifice. We must understand how to cultivate the combatants of the national defense general mobilization. For example, the national training that the Allied nation Japan pays special attention to can be used as a reference to cultivate the foundation of good citizen models to create the most ideal and best combatants, regardless of men or women, can shoulder this important mission. Finally, I hope to expand the strength and practice the close connection between police and security to complete major tasks."

Speech by Director Gu

Director Gu, Head of the Baojia Section and Concurrent Secretary-General, said briefly in his speech: "When I took on the Baojia work, I had an ideal, but at that time, the general public seemed to be skeptical about the Baojia work. Today, the Baojia situation I have seen has gradually strengthened my belief. To do everything in the world, as long as you work hard, you can achieve results. Today, the model comrades of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps of the three districts of the Corps Headquarters are all powerful members who have completed the organization. It can be seen that the Baojia personnel are enthusiastic about their work, and have established cadres one after another. I firmly believe that in the general training of the major teams in the future, there will be great effects, and they will be responsible for guiding the self-defense state members in this district in the future. I will handle the Baojia in the same way as running a school, engaging in organization and training, and everyone will work hard to teach. All Baojia people are volunteers, and their purpose is to serve the society. I think serving the society is the greatest. Confucius once said: 'To bestow blessings on the people without seeking profit is a sage.' And you are serving the people without receiving remuneration, which is no different from what Confucius said. At the same time, our Baojia work aims to cultivate integrity, gather good people, and try our best to eliminate gangsters. In the future, I hope that all self-defense comrades and Baojia comrades will uphold integrity and take on the mission of serving the society. I now offer this point to you, and I also encourage myself with this, to work harder together and complete the great mission of the Baojia."
