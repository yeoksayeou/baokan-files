### Enemy Warships Around Okinawa Island: Over 50 Destroyed and Sunk; Fierce Battles Rage on Land in Naha and Shuri

Recent Accomplishments of Japanese Air and Submarine Forces over the Past Three Weeks

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on June 1st: Aviation units and submarine units have continued to brave adverse weather conditions to attack enemy air bases on Okinawa Island and Ie Island, as well as enemy warships and mobile units around the main island. From May 11th onwards, the confirmed results obtained by the Japanese side to date are as follows: 6 cruisers sunk, 3 destroyers sunk, 5 transport ships sunk, and 7 ships of unknown type sunk. 2 specially equipped aircraft carriers destroyed and set ablaze, 3 battleships or cruisers damaged, 4 cruisers damaged, 4 destroyers damaged, 6 transport ships damaged, and 11 ships of unknown type damaged. Over 46 aircraft fields were bombed and burned. The majority of the above results were achieved by special attack units. Japanese army units in the southern Okinawa Island area are engaged in fierce battles against enemy forces that have successively invaded the area south of Yonabaru and the Shuri-Naha line.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The land battles on Okinawa, centered on the decisive battles in the cities of Naha and Shuri, are intensifying. Relying on their abundant firepower, the enemy is attempting to advance. From the 29th to the 30th, they finally broke into the northeastern area of Naha City. Japanese forces redeployed and counterattacked vigorously. At the same time, the defense forces holding the city continued to engage the enemy, entrenched in the city streets amidst the artillery fire. In the Shuri area, the enemy not only attacked from the front but also pressed in from the southeast and south. However, Japanese forces repelled them near the city walls, preventing their attacks and engaging in a battle for control.

### Fierce Battle for Every Inch of Territory Unfolds on Tarakan Island; Japanese Elite Troops Launch Valiant Night Raids

Southwest Pacific Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – On April 27th, the enemy, with 5 cruisers and over 10 destroyers and minesweepers, attempted to land on Tarakan Island. The Japanese garrison had long prepared a comprehensive long-term defense strategy, patiently waiting to deplete the enemy forces. On May 1st, when the enemy began landing on the Lingkas coast, the Japanese side had already completely destroyed all important facilities that the enemy could use, and Japanese residents, regardless of age, participated in the fighting. In the early stages of the landing, the enemy focused on attacking the airfield, oil field area, and reservoir area. However, the enemy's fighting spirit was extremely low, and their main attacking force, the air power, was even more weakened. They attempted to support land operations with a small number of aircraft, cut off the Japanese army's supply lines, and transport workers, machinery and technicians. However, Japanese commando units, adapting to the situation and achieving unexpected victories, disrupted their recovery efforts throughout the night. Consequently, the enemy suffered over 2,000 casualties. Since the 16th, the enemy has launched attacks with all their strength, but the elite Japanese troops have also counterattacked stubbornly. On the 21st and 22nd, they carried out valiant night raids to halt the enemy's advance. Since the 27th, they have further expanded the scale of the raids. Intense fighting has been ongoing, and since the start of the general offensive two weeks ago, both sides have been confronting each other at close range, engaged in a fierce battle for every inch of territory.

### Enemy Submarine Sunk off Surabaya

Southwest Pacific Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – On the 29th, a Japanese destroyer, in cooperation with an air unit, located an enemy submarine off the coast of Surabaya and sank it.

### Japanese Kamikaze Corps Achieve High Accuracy

Central News Agency – According to a report by Hamilton from the Associated Press, aboard the British battleship "King George V": Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, Deputy Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, reported on the Pacific war situation, stating that the Japanese Kamikaze attack force has necessitated some changes in our fleet's anti-aircraft warfare methods. The Kamikaze attack force has a higher hit rate than other aircraft. If we want to counter the Kamikaze attack force, unless new weapons are invented, it is necessary to strengthen the effective use of existing weapons. I believe that the invention of new weapons cannot be accomplished overnight. For the present, the only way is to strengthen the effective use of existing weapons. One method is to use more fighters and bombers for air patrols, to repel the Japanese special attack planes before they reach their targets.

### Enemy Large Warships Greatly Reduced in Number

Frontline Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – Japanese air units and special attack units, in response to the heroic actions of the airborne troops on May 24th, inflicted extremely heavy damage on the enemy fleet patrolling around Okinawa Island, leading to a sharp decrease in the number of enemy ships. As of 3 PM on the 29th, the situation of enemy ships around the island is as follows: In the waters off Kadena, there are 35 large and medium-sized transport ships. In the Kerama Islands area, there are 2 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, and 94 or 95 other ships. In the waters off Itoman, there are about 12 large, medium, and small ships. As for Nakagusuku Bay and Minatogawa, due to bad weather, confirmation was impossible. This shows that the enemy ships have suffered great losses. According to reports, before the Japanese army began its offensive, on May 23rd, there were 19 enemy battleships, cruisers, destroyers, etc., patrolling in the waters off Kadena alone. In comparison, the current number of enemy ships is less than half. In particular, the sharp decrease in the number of large warships shows the accuracy of the Japanese special attack units' attacks.

### Oil Tank Type Incendiary Bombs

Southern Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – Since early May, the enemy has begun using large oil tank type incendiary bombs in the Luzon and Southwest Pacific war zones. The upper part of the bomb has four tail fins, each approximately 40 [unreadable unit]. The tank is filled with paste-like petroleum and grease. This is a result of the loss of ships, making replenishment from the U.S. mainland quite difficult, hence this inferior measure.

### 565 Enemy Warships Sunk and Damaged Around Okinawa Island

Comprehensive Results of Japanese Military Operations from March 23rd

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – From March 23rd to the present, the comprehensive results of Japanese military operations attacking enemy warships around Okinawa are as follows:

### 140 Enemy Planes Shot Down in Yesterday's Raid on Osaka; Large Fire in the Northwest of the City Gradually Extinguished

Osaka, 1st (Central News Agency) –

The Central Japan Army Headquarters announced at noon on the 1st that approximately 400 enemy B-29 aircraft from the Southern Base, in formations of about 10 or 30 planes, invaded Osaka from the Kii Channel and Takamatsu sides starting at 8:35 AM on the 1st. For two hours, they focused on dropping incendiary bombs and carrying out indiscriminate bombing. Subsequently, they gradually escaped through the central part of Nara Prefecture. As a result, large fires broke out in the northwestern part of Osaka City and Amagasaki City. However, thanks to the people's air defense efforts, they were gradually extinguished. As of noon, it was determined that 24 planes had been shot down and 30 had been damaged, with the potential for more.

Osaka, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Osaka Garrison of the Central Japan Military District Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 1st that the confirmed results of the Japanese army and navy air defense units are as follows: 47 planes shot down, 83 planes damaged (including the results announced at noon). Japanese losses were 1 plane self-destructed and 1 plane not returned.

Frequent Air Raids on Various Parts of Taiwan

Taipei, 1st (Central News Agency) – Over 110 enemy bombers and over 10 fighters from the Philippine base indiscriminately bombed Keelung City several times on the 24th. On the 30th, over 100 enemy fighters and bombers also concentrated their main force on attacking the Tainan area, dropping bombs. A portion of the fighters attacked various parts of the island, strafing with machine guns and bombing the Hualien Port and Taitung area settlements, before escaping south at 3 PM.

Shonan, 1st (Central News Agency) – At 9:30 AM, an enemy P-47 and a B-29 each attempted to invade Shonan Island. Japanese fighters immediately intercepted them and completely shot them down in the southeastern sea area of Shonan Island. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

### Brave Soldiers of the Japanese Matsuoka Unit Valiantly Killed in Action

Southern Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army, having seized the Umar airfield in northern New Guinea, continued to mop up the remaining enemy forces in the vicinity. On the 13th, 15th, 16th, and 18th, they bravely advanced and launched surprise attacks, confirming that the enemy had abandoned over 140 bodies and suffered many casualties. In addition, over 10 tents were burned. The ability to achieve these great results was due to the repeated fierce attacks by the Japanese soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Matsuoka. The Matsuoka unit penetrated deep into enemy lines, fought valiantly while surrounded, suppressing the enemy forces, responding to friendly forces' operations, and repeatedly attacking. When their ammunition ran out and reinforcements were exhausted, they charged into the enemy barracks, causing chaos in the enemy ranks, and were all valiantly killed in action.

### New York Times Warns of Difficulties in the War Against Japan

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – Due to the recent intensification of U.S. air raids on Japan, there are optimistic views in the United States that Japan can be subdued solely through air raids. U.S. military authorities also tend to encourage this kind of sentiment. The New York Times published a warning in an editorial on the 28th: No matter how intense the air raids against Japan may be in the future, Japan cannot be unconditionally subdued by air raids alone. Japan has only lost one-seventh of its occupied territories. Even if Japan's links with the South are severed, it still has a Japanese inner circle formed by the Japanese mainland, Korea, Manchuria, and North China, which can continue to fight. Moreover, the Japanese people are more tenacious and have a stronger belief in resistance than the German people. The war against Japan will be the most difficult battle, and this is the reason.

### Japanese Gas Balloons Attack the U.S., Six Killed

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Washington, U.S. Under Secretary of War Patterson announced yesterday that six people in the western United States were immediately killed by explosives dropped from Japanese gas balloons.

### The United States of the Pacific Decides to Increase Military Strength

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Times of London published on the 25th a report submitted by U.S. War Mobilization Director Wilson to Truman. The report mentioned the United States' determination to complete the war against Japan, which is particularly noteworthy. The United States currently has 8.3 million soldiers. Even within a year after the end of the European war, it plans to maintain 6.9 million troops in Europe. However, in order to concentrate all forces on the navy for the war against Japan, the budget until June 30th allows for the total military strength to be expanded to 3,385,000. The current naval force is only 478,000.

### U.S. Repair Capacity for Warships Insufficient

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Two months have passed since the enemy began its invasion of Okinawa. During this period, Japanese special attack units have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, sinking or damaging a total of over 600 ships. In response to this damage, the enemy has been trying to conceal it from their own people. However, the Japanese special attack planes' fierce attacks are intensifying, and the enemy's damage is also actively increasing. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal said when meeting with reporters on the 30th that the repair capacity of U.S. shipyards on the Pacific coast is extremely insufficient. A Reuters report from Washington also stated that the current shipbuilding capacity is not sufficient to repair the damaged ships sent back from the Pacific. U.S. naval authorities and frontline reports have repeatedly raised this issue. Recently, the enemy has boasted that they have established preventive measures against special attacks, such as: 1. Thoroughly destroying Japanese special attack unit bases. 2. Strengthening the anti-aircraft firepower of ships. Their expression of fear is proof of the power of Japanese special attacks. In short, the continuous fierce attacks of Japanese special attack planes have caused the enemy to bleed heavily. What is particularly interesting is that Britain wants to have a voice in the Pacific issue after the war. Therefore, it is participating in the Okinawa operation with a strong fleet. After its King George V and other regular aircraft carriers and warships were sunk or damaged, the remaining fleet withdrew from the waters off Okinawa, thus increasing the burden on the United States and preserving its own fleet strength. As a result, the pain within the U.S. camp is gradually deepening.

### Provincial Governor's Subsidy for Teachers' Livelihood

Suzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – Since Governor Ren took office in Jiangsu Province, he has paid great attention to education. At the end of last year, he launched a fund-raising campaign to raise 10 million yuan in living subsidies for teachers, which were distributed to the teachers and completely cleared by the end of the lunar year. Now, in light of the recent rise in prices and the increasingly difficult lives of teachers, Governor Ren has specially donated 10 million yuan to subsidize the faculty and staff of public and private educational institutions in the provincial capital, in order to provide relief and comfort. He has ordered the education department to handle the matter properly and distribute the full amount before the Dragon Boat Festival.

### Weapons from Xiantian Tao Converted into Agricultural Implements

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – After the authorities decisively disbanded the Xiantian Tao in Wuxi, the weapons, long spears and broadswords, of its followers were confiscated in large numbers. It was decided to request the Central Agricultural Implement Factory to convert them into agricultural implements such as grass choppers and cutting machines, which would be distributed to the farmers. This reporter interviewed Vice Minister Wang of the Construction Department, who is also the director of the Agricultural Implement Factory. According to Mr. Wang, he expressed his appreciation for this move and said that the factory will provide assistance within its capabilities to reduce costs and manufacture the implements.

Editorial

### Measures to Address the Urgent Food Crisis

The severity of the food problem is increasing daily, and other prices are fluctuating with rice prices, making people's lives increasingly difficult. This wave of soaring prices centered on rice is not a simple economic problem. Although the soaring rice prices originated from the initial rise in rice prices in the countryside, the reason for the soaring rice prices in the countryside lies in a failure of relevant authorities on both the Chinese and Japanese sides to conduct a serious review and devise effective countermeasures. Therefore, we have always believed that only the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese sides to conduct a review and cooperate sincerely can solve the current food problem in the Chinese-controlled areas.

Looking at the black market rice prices for the past three days, they have risen sharply from the 20s to the 40s. This violent increase, in addition to directly threatening the lives of millions of city residents, is stimulating other prices and tending to throw the entire society into chaos. Nowadays, everyone feels anxious about their lives and harbors feelings of bewilderment and resentment. Therefore, in order to alleviate the panic, we hope that the authorities will quickly discuss and formulate practical measures. Based on our humble observations, we offer the following suggestions:

First, last year and at the beginning of this year, panic occurred in the city's rice supply. At that time, we received rice loans from allied military authorities for temporary distribution and sale at reasonable prices, which helped to quell the panic. Currently, the municipal government should still negotiate with the allied relations to borrow rice for temporary distribution, and the distribution price can be reasonably increased. We believe that the allied relations authorities are extremely concerned about the Chinese food problem and will definitely provide assistance.

Second, we are currently in a decisive battle period, and the purpose of meals is only to satisfy hunger and cannot satisfy the desire for delicious food. Therefore, general food supplies do not have to be concentrated on rice alone and can be mixed with miscellaneous grains. We have previously suggested that the Huaihai Province produces an abundance of miscellaneous grains and must have a surplus supply. We hope that the municipal government will quickly negotiate with the Huaihai Province authorities to purchase and transport them to Shanghai for distribution.

Third, set a maximum amount of rice that each household can store. Those exceeding the prescribed amount should be purchased at a limited price and sold at reasonable prices.

Fourth, restrict the hoarding of miscellaneous grains and strictly prohibit the raising of prices of miscellaneous grains. Those who hoard miscellaneous grains should be purchased at a limited price. For example, it was recently reported that a committee member of a certain control organization hoarded miscellaneous grains in a large scale, making a profit of over 20 million. We hope that this will be reported and severely punished.

Fifth, living expenses have increased so drastically, and the common people are suffering so much. However, there are still some special classes who are still hosting large banquets and indulging in extravagance, which is an abnormal phenomenon that should not exist in the current situation. We hope that all sectors will exercise self-restraint and the authorities will restrict it in order to conserve resources.

The above are only temporary measures. However, the fundamental solution to the food problem depends on the mutual cooperation between China and Japan. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will thoroughly discuss and improve the control measures based on the principles of adapting to the national conditions and public sentiment of China and with the goal of simplicity and speed, and implement them as soon as possible. Time is of the essence, and there is no time to delay. We hope that the parties involved will take action quickly.

### The Key Elements of the Okinawa Operation

— Colonel Matsushima

—Criticizing U.S. Military Commentators—

Major George Fielding Eliot, a military expert known for his contemporary reputation, explained the significance of Navy Day within the current strategic situation on May 27th. As a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy, I cannot help but pay special attention to this. On the 27th, I gave four lectures before the Japanese residing in Shanghai and my friendly Chinese compatriots, explaining the significance of the Okinawa Island defense war. However, the esteemed Major Eliot mentioned the possibility of the U.S. attacking the Tsushima Strait between the Japanese mainland and Korea. This line of thought fully expresses Major Eliot's outstanding talent as a military commentator, which is truly admirable. Major Eliot pointed out the Tsushima Strait, where the Japanese Navy left a victorious record forty years ago, is rewriting history. But I am at least more familiar with Japanese history than Major Eliot, so from that standpoint, I intend to make some slight corrections.

The Battle History of the Tsushima Strait

As far as I know, Japan has faced national crises twice in the Tsushima Strait. The first time was the two invasions by the Mongol army in 1268 and 1281. At that time, the actual power in Japanese politics was held by a young warrior named Hojo Tokimune. He beheaded the Mongol envoys who came to Japan, considering Japan a small country in the East Sea, and resolutely intercepted the Mongol army at the Tsushima Strait, sending the Mongol army of 100,000 and their giant ships to the bottom of the sea. The Mongol Empire at that time had annexed the two continents of Asia and Europe, and it was a vast and powerful empire unprecedented in history. However, even this vast Mongol Empire ultimately could not trample upon the divine land of Japan. The second time was the challenge of the Baltic Fleet in 1905, which Major Eliot referred to. The Imperial Russian fleet, which had traveled 20,000 miles across the wind and waves, was defeated in this strait, eventually leading to the demise of Imperial Russia and the birth of the new Soviet Union. The third time is this time.

U.S. Military Reports Are Absolutely Inaccurate

Major Eliot, after giving a very abstract description of the effects of the U.S. Air Force's activities in the Tsushima Strait, made a grand prediction that the Japanese army would be defeated in the Tsushima Strait. But this is just Eliot's logic, and I couldn't help but smile. I imagine that Major Eliot has committed an unavoidable and unfortunate error. That is: the information on which Major Eliot's theory is based comes from the official reports of the U.S. Army and Navy Departments, Nimitz, and MacArthur. However, these four types of official publications are filled with falsehood and deception, as is well known to countries around the world. Just thinking back to Pearl Harbor at the time and how the United States reported its losses, it is not difficult to understand. 1,400 U.S. ships came to Okinawa, but 80% of their combat power has been shattered. Even at this moment, the combat power of the U.S. military is decreasing moment by moment. By May 29, 1945, there were no aircraft carriers around Okinawa, but Forrestal shamelessly falsely claimed that there were still 92 aircraft carriers. Judging the situation based on inaccurate information will lead to such terrible misjudgments, and Major Eliot is a good example.

Major Eliot confidently states that the Japanese fleet will inevitably defeat the British and American fleets in a magnificent battle, but what does reality tell us? Isn't Japan already winning victory after victory? On the night of May 24th, the Japanese airborne troops seized two airfields in Okinawa, cutting off the U.S. Air Force's activities. The special attack units are constantly sinking and destroying their ship groups, and are also mass-producing a new weapon that can be called a mother-child aircraft, the "human bomb," which hits the target with extreme accuracy. People drive and operate bombs, flying directly towards the target. Who would have thought that such a heroic feat could be realized?

U.S. Combat Power Decreasing Momentarily

With the decisive battleground of Okinawa as the center, the U.S. military's combat power is decreasing moment by moment. When its ships are completely sent to the bottom of the sea, or flee in a panic, the overall situation of the Pacific War will be decided. I hope that Major Eliot, as a U.S. Army Major and a military commentator, will carefully observe the strategic elements of the Japanese side's three-dimensional attack currently unfolding in Okinawa, and not miscalculate the prospects for the war. The opportunity for the Third Tsushima Strait Battle is coming soon. I express my deep respect for Major Eliot.

### San Francisco Conference: Divided Opinions

Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch, 1st: According to reports from San Francisco, the five major powers are divided on the issues of "trusteeship" and "territorial agreements" at the San Francisco Conference. Arab representatives, especially those from Iraq, strongly oppose the proposed "trusteeship" draft. Regarding the "territorial agreement," France suggests maintaining a "mutual assistance agreement status" instead of the previously discussed concept of "enemy nations."

### Song Ziwen Appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan in Chongqing

Guangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch, 1st: According to a military celebration broadcast on the 31st, the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in Chongqing on the 31st decided to replace the Premier and Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan. Premier Chiang Kai-shek and Deputy Premier Kong Xiangxi both resigned. Song Ziwen was appointed as the new Premier, and Weng Wenhao was appointed as Deputy Premier. The appointments have been formally made.

Central News Agency dispatch: According to a London broadcast, Reuters military correspondent John Kinsey offered the following observations regarding Chiang Kai-shek's handing over the premiership of the Executive Yuan to Song Ziwen: Chiang Kai-shek's resignation from the premiership will not substantially change the external structure of the Chongqing regime. Although the reorganization of the Chongqing government is small in scale, it gives the impression that Chiang Kai-shek's position has been strengthened in dealing with newly emerging situations. Chiang remains the head of state and the supreme commander of the Chongqing army. In the past five months, the premiership he relinquished has only been a nominal position, with Song Ziwen actually performing the duties, as Song had already been appointed Acting Premier. Song's trip to San Francisco for diplomacy, and the announcement of his formal appointment immediately after the conference, implies that Song has had some success in negotiations with the United States. The San Francisco Conference also discussed US financial aid to Chongqing. Chiang's resignation as Premier should strengthen his freedom of action on domestic issues, allowing him to deny the authority of the Executive Yuan and its ministers at any time. The economic crisis in Chongqing will certainly be significant, and Song's assumption of the position is to solve this problem. However, Song Ziwen is a banker, not a military man, so his position is certainly not as strong as Chiang Kai-shek's. Although the United States trusts him, the Chongqing army may be indifferent to him.

### Netherlands Abolishes Extraterritoriality in Chongqing

Guangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch, 1st: According to a Chongqing broadcast on the 31st, the Chongqing government signed a new treaty with the Netherlands on the 29th.

Travel Correspondence

### Zhengtong Town, Northern Jiangsu

— Huang E

Zhengtong Town is sixty li from Dongtai and also sixty li from Hailing County, and it is a large town between the two counties. The inland river shipping company's Taidong passenger ships travel back and forth once every other day. The marketplaces are crowded and commerce is booming. It belongs to the seventh district of Dongtai County, and it was formerly known as Jiangyan Town in Taixing County, both of which were centers for the distribution of agricultural products in northern Jiangsu. It holds a decisive position in the trading market of various counties, and all prices must be shifted based on the prices of Jiangyan and Zhengtong. In the past, at its peak, rice and wheat were piled up in abundance, with large and small storehouses filling the land. Now, due to various factors such as transportation interruptions in various counties, heavy losses and taxes along the way, rampant bandits in the countryside, and soaring food prices, the aforementioned prosperity has become a thing of the past as the torrents of history sweep it away.

Extremely Advantageous Geographical Environment

Zhengtong is surrounded by water on all four sides, shaped like a lone bird, and the entire town market is located in the center of the water, so the natural terrain is excellent. Whether it is east, south, west, or north, boats and rafts can navigate, and the development of commerce is also a crucial reason. Normally, the most famous local products are fish, shrimp, and wild ducks. The nearby villagers are simple and honest, and the land is fertile, so most of the residents have adequate food and clothing, and their lives are relatively affluent. The atmosphere of luxury is unrivaled in the entire county. Since the outbreak of the war, due to its remote location, there have never been any major public events. This is a unique phenomenon among the county districts and towns in northern Jiangsu. However, when peace was restored in the 30th year of the Republic of China, all local military and political changes were able to pass through peacefully and steadily, but the disorder and security were abnormal for two or three months. Fortunately, all subsequent garrison officers knew how to maintain discipline and love the people, and straighten out their subordinates, so the people's burden increased but without complaint. Since the 135th regiment of the 34th division was transferred from Pintcha to this town the year before last, the market has become more prosperous and the local area has gradually recovered.

Currently garrisoned in this town is the 20th Independent Brigade of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office, led by Brigade Commander Xu Rong. His military experience and knowledge make him a standout among the peacekeepers of northern Jiangsu. In the autumn of last year, General Sun Liangcheng came to serve as the Pacification Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu, and Division Commander Tian Zhongfu of the 34th Division led his troops to Zhejiang, while the Xu regiment was uniquely left to garrison Zhengtong, which is enough to show the depth of the people's feelings in the defense zone and their desire to retain it.

This reporter took the Taidong bus from Dongtai to Zhengtong on the morning of May 1, and arrived in three hours. After arriving in the town, I went to the headquarters of the 20th Brigade to visit Brigade Commander Xu. Brigade Commander Xu then stated his military experience as follows:

Organize Tax Revenue and Eliminate the Three Evils

"Since I was ordered to lead my troops from Pintcha to garrison here the year before last, I knew that the people here were heavily burdened, with numerous taxes, leading to a sluggish market and a declining economy. The way to save them is to reduce the burden and abolish excessive and miscellaneous levies. Therefore, after the deployment of the garrison was completed, I immediately set about reorganizing tax collection and correcting the people's methods of paying taxes, and at the same time strictly prohibited my subordinates from making demands and forbade them from going out unless necessary, so as not to cause disturbance. At the same time, I eliminated soldiers and officers with dependents, so that they could concentrate on military affairs and avoid being a burden. At the same time, the treatment of soldiers was appropriately improved, and training was never slackened. Even for construction projects, civilian laborers were never conscripted unless necessary, and the officers and soldiers did it themselves, so as to avoid causing trouble when idle. For the three evils of opium, gambling, and prostitution that harm the local area, they were absolutely forbidden within the scope of my authority, and no leniency was given. A military police inspection office was set up to check transport terminals and hotels every day to strictly prevent spies and malicious elements. As a result, security has gradually been established, order has been restored, and the market has become more prosperous over the past year. Our military personnel are responsible for defending the country and protecting the local area, and we dare not boast of having made achievements in our limited duty, but we only seek to have no faults and to be true to our own conscience."

At this point, the reporter asked again, "I have heard that the brigade commander is also extremely concerned about the revival of local education. What is the situation at present?"

He replied: "Since the outbreak of the war, I have felt concerned about the loss of schooling for poor young people and children of school age in various places. Therefore, I have tried my best to set up and restore secondary and primary schools in the garrisoned areas to show promotion. Currently in Zhengtong, dilapidated temples are used as school sites after slight repairs. There is now a private Zhengtong Junior High School, Changjiang Primary School, and Zhenru Primary School. Teachers and staff are given higher salaries with in-kind payments. Poor children are given reductions or exemptions for tuition and food expenses as appropriate to show preference. The regular expenses of the three schools are all arranged by me. The current principal of Zhengtong Junior High School is Colonel Counselor Meng Siyuan of the brigade headquarters, and there are more than 100 students. The principals of the two primary schools are well-known figures in the education sector, and there are a total of more than 500 students...."

The reporter asked again: "From the current situation in northern Jiangsu, there are crises on all sides, and there are deep hidden worries, such as the overlapping collection of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, the clever extortion by strong bandits and powerful figures, the abuse of power by district and township chiefs, and the expansion of the Communist Party, all of which pose a major threat to good people. How to improve it, I wonder if you have ever considered this during your busy military affairs?"

Maintaining People's Livelihood is the First Priority

Upon hearing this, he thought for a moment and replied, "For soldiers, obedience is the first priority. Let's not talk about other things, but just in terms of the situation in northern Jiangsu, since Director Sun came to Northern Jiangsu, various situations in Northern Jiangsu have been improving. If we can be given time, then the points you mentioned will naturally gradually disappear. Currently, the most important work in the military and political aspects is to win the hearts of the people, and to maintain the people's livelihood as the first priority."

After he finished speaking, he invited the reporter to visit his brigade headquarters. The brigade headquarters is located in the ancient Shousheng Temple, next to Changjiang Park (which is dedicated to General Li Changjiang, the commander of the First Group Army), covering a large area. The brigade headquarters is currently strengthening construction work around it. Soldiers are working hard and diligently. At that time, the military officer education class was training on the parade ground in the park, and the staff, political training, military supply, military medical, military law, and military city offices in the brigade headquarters were arranged in an orderly manner. It is deeply felt that his military administration is strict and well-organized, and it is definitely not an empty reputation.

### Director Yuan Reports on This Year's Summer Public Health Administration; Attends Press Conference to Answer Questions

The 19th press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held in the Municipal Government conference room at 10:30 AM yesterday. Director Yuan of the Health Bureau attended to answer the following questions:

Preventive Injections

(Question) Summer preventive injections are of great importance to public health, but many ignorant citizens avoid them in various ways. Does the bureau plan to enforce injections and conduct door-to-door surveys for injections?

(Answer) Citizens often avoid preventive injections, so we requested the assistance of the police department at the beginning. We will soon be conducting door-to-door injections in the Baojia districts, so we have sent letters to the police department requesting assistance in handling all injection locations and schedules.

Isolation Hospitals

(Question) Preventive injections are intended to prevent problems before they occur, but when diseases occur, patients are often flustered. How do you plan to make it easier for citizens to know the location of free preventive hospitals?

(Answer) Our bureau has isolation hospitals on Changan Road, Beihai Road, Nanshi (formerly the Red House Women and Children's Hospital), and Huxi (located on Fanhwangdu Road). The Changan Road Hospital has been requisitioned by the military, so it can only accommodate 60 people. The Beihai Road Hospital has 200 beds, and the city hospital has 35 beds. The above only has a total of 300 beds, so in the event of an epidemic, the accommodation will be insufficient. The municipal government has approved the establishment of temporary isolation hospitals according to the old method, in order to provide more accomodation.

Summer Hygiene

(Question) Summer public health is extremely important. What specific measures does the bureau have for cleaning roads, alleys, garbage, and sewage, and for banning unclean fruits, vegetables, and poor food along the streets?

(Answer) Summer hygiene is very important, and the garbage in the alleys should be cleaned up urgently. In addition to ordering the responsible personnel to pay attention to handling it, we also hope that residents will not litter arbitrarily. We have specially printed announcements and distributed them to residents in various districts, requiring them to dump garbage in designated locations within the specified time for cleaning. Regarding the clearing of sewers and uncleared air-raid shelters, we have sent letters to the Construction Bureau and the Air Defense Headquarters to pay attention to handling them. There are regulations regarding street vendors and they are not allowed to set up stalls arbitrarily. Our bureau has repeatedly sent letters to the police department requesting assistance in banning them, but the establishment of street vendors is closely related to social problems, so it is not possible to simply strike a high note without regard to reality. In addition to strictly banning unclean food and beverages, we are closely discussing the ban on general street vendors with relevant bureaus and departments.

Civilian Treatment

(Question) Infectious diseases occur frequently in the city, and the cost of diagnosis and treatment for the civilian class is often unbearable. Has the bureau considered free treatment and other measures for civilians?

(Answer) Our Beihai Road Isolation Hospital has ordinary wards that are specifically for treating the civilian class, so they do not charge fees. The fees charged by other hospitals are in accordance with the regulations of the municipal government, and the medical expenses charged are very low.

Suburban Epidemic Prevention

(Question) How do the epidemic prevention officials in the urban and suburban areas communicate and implement their work?

(Answer) In order to popularize epidemic prevention knowledge, our bureau sends personnel to broadcast propaganda on Shanghai Radio every Friday. As for the implementation of epidemic prevention work, our bureau has 46 temporary teams for cholera injections, and they are injecting the public in the urban and suburban areas every day, which is going smoothly. However, the number of injections is still only more than 520,000 people (excluding the Hongkou Naval Baojia District, because that district is not handled by our bureau). Starting on the 12th of next month, we plan to send additional injection personnel to Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhenru to carry out injections.

Testing Proprietary Medicines

(Question) Some proprietary medicines that have been tested for hygiene and health by drug merchants often exaggerate their publicity when something happens. What are the bureau's opinions on this?

(Answer) Our bureau's crackdown on exaggerated publicity of medicines is implemented step by step in accordance with the regulations issued by the Ministry of Health. Recently, it has been reported that some drug manufacturers are selling fake medicines, and once the investigation is completed, they will be severely punished.

### Liu Xingliang Takes Office as Economic Bureau Director Yesterday Morning

The newly appointed Director of the Economic Bureau, Liu Xingliang, took office at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 1st). The former director, Xu Jiang, personally went to the bureau to handle the handover procedures. It is learned that in addition to the original secretary's office and six sections, the internal organization of the bureau will be supplemented with the seventh, eighth, and ninth sections to handle distribution, retail stores, and accounting affairs. It is heard that Director Liu will conscientiously implement all economic laws and regulations promulgated by the central government in the future economic policy.

### Finance Bureau Proceeding With Adjustment of Brokerage Tax

The Municipal Finance Bureau has decided to change the previous brokerage stamp tax to a brokerage business tax, and is proceeding with the adjustment of the brokerage tax in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance. It is learned that the bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government, awaiting the Ministry of Finance's reply. According to the bureau's method of adjusting the tax, it plans to change the tax based on the amount of sales or commission. Once the Ministry of Finance's reply is received, it can be implemented on a regular basis. It is also learned that due to the tense preliminary investigation work for the business tax, 40 investigators have been transferred to the city's various tax collection offices to work separately, and 10 investigators have been transferred from the business tax section to the special tax section to assist in the investigation.

### Lost House Donation Receipt; Replenishment Fee Method Revised and Announced by Finance Bureau

The Municipal Finance Bureau's method for taxpayers who have lost their house donation receipt and apply for a replacement has always been based on the amount of the donation, with a handling fee of 10 to 50 yuan per replacement ticket. It has been determined that the originally determined replenishment fee standard is low, and it is proposed that starting from this summer, the replacement ticket handling fee will be charged as follows:

For each quarterly donation amount of more than 1,000 yuan and less than 5,000 yuan, a replacement ticket fee of 300 yuan will be charged each time.

For each annual donation amount of less than 5,000 yuan, and less than 10,000 yuan,

For each quarterly donation amount of more than 10,000 yuan and less than 50,000 yuan, a fee of 1,000 yuan will be charged each time.

For each quarterly donation amount of more than 50,000 yuan and less than 100,000 yuan, a fee of 2,000 yuan will be charged each time.

For each quarterly donation amount of more than 100,000 yuan, a fee of 3,000 yuan will be charged each time. For replacement tickets before the spring of this year, a handling fee of 200 yuan will be charged each time. The Municipal Government has ordered the Finance Bureau to proceed accordingly.

### Tram Discount Method; Unsuccessful Request from Education Bureau

Recently, the price of tram tickets in the city has repeatedly increased. Teachers traveling to and from classes are unable to bear the high ticket prices, resulting in walking back and forth morning and evening, causing fatigue. Considering this, the Education Bureau reported this situation to the Municipal Government, requesting that the Municipal Transportation Company be instructed to follow the example of military and police personnel and allow them to purchase preferential tickets to show sympathy. It is heard that the Municipal Government has sent personnel to negotiate, but the result is that the preferential military and police measures are limited to soldiers in uniform and cannot be changed. As a result, teachers still rush around morning and evening for school every day. It is heard that people from all parties will try their best to find ways for the teachers.

### Special Cosmetics Tax; Increased Valuation

According to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, the tax rate for the special cosmetics tax is 12% based on price for the first category of toothpaste, tooth powder, and soap, and 70% based on price for the second category of rouge, hair wax, face powder, and soap. However, because the originally ordered valuation is not suitable for the current market price, a meeting of the Valuation Committee was specially convened to decide to increase the original valuation by ten times. This has been reported to the Ministry of Finance and a circular has been issued to the subordinate units, which will be implemented from the 1st of yesterday.

### Da Dao-Zhoupu Highway Prohibits Commercial Vehicle Traffic

The Municipal Construction Bureau, considering that the Shangchuan and Shangnan Road Management Office's Shangnan Road-affiliated highway section from Dadao to Zhoupu was prohibited from all vehicle traffic during the commercial period, and since it was taken over by the city, in addition to Allied vehicles, more and more commercial vehicles have been driving back and forth, causing damage to the road surface and railway subgrade. The bureau specially announced yesterday that commercial vehicles are prohibited from passing, and requested assistance from the Zhoupu and Yangsiqiao Garrison Police Bureau to strictly ban these vehicles.

### Securities Exchange Advances Closing Time

The Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange is planning to readjust the market trading time in the summer. Because it is of great importance to the business of brokers, it has been considered and decided to advance the afternoon trading time by half an hour from yesterday (the 1st). The originally scheduled time was from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM, but now it has been changed to close from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. The morning trading time will be changed at any time as the weather gradually becomes hotter.

### Lost Money from Travelers Used for Scholarship Funds

The station chief Hong Yuting found it and handed it over to our office for safekeeping. Our office immediately issued a notice at various stations on Shangchuan Road on May 20th, asking the owner to come to our office in person with a guarantee within seven days to claim it. Otherwise, it will be used for the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund. It is now overdue, and no one has come to claim it. The money is now enclosed in a letter and sent to you. We hope that your newspaper will accept it for the scholarship fund."

Yesterday, we received the following for the scholarship fund: 11,500 yuan from the Shangyong Shangnan Road Management Office, 10,000 yuan from Tong Qing, 5,565 yuan from worker Ma Zhifang, 5,185 yuan from Yongyuchang, 2,000 yuan from Mr. Zhu, and 770 yuan from Pu Qiting.

### Concealing Special Tax: Voluntary Surrender Granted Exemption from Prosecution; Finance Bureau Approves Supplementary Payment to Show Leniency

Wu Xingchang Western Clothing Store, located at 95 Datong Road in this city, concealed special taxes in January and February of this year. Now, due to self-reflection and inner guilt, they have specially submitted a voluntary surrender to the Supervision Section of the Madang Road Finance Bureau, along with the concealed tax situation and related invoice documents. After verification by the section, it was deemed that there was indeed fraudulent behavior, totaling 186,564 yuan in special tax funds occupied. This was truthfully reported to higher authorities. The Finance Bureau has approved that since the store was able to voluntarily surrender and pay the tax after concealing it, it should be considered rare. In addition to approving the supplementary payment of tax funds, it is specifically exempted from prosecution for the portion of the special tax occupied, to show generosity.

### Air Raids on Various Parts of Japan: Civilian Air Defense Situation: Talk by Saito Tadao Returning to Shanghai After Investigation

The Civilian Air Defense Headquarters dispatched Saito Tadao, a senior official from the Police Defense Department, to various parts of Japan in early April of this year to investigate the bombing situation and civilian air defense tasks. After more than two months, he returned to Shanghai on the previous day (the 26th). He talked in detail about the investigation situation, which is recorded as follows:

Enemy Aircraft Carry Out Indiscriminate Bombing

In early November last year, enemy aircraft began to indiscriminately bomb various parts of Japan. Major cities such as Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, and other areas were successively bombed and suffered disasters. The bombing by enemy aircraft was completely inhumane. When attacking, they first formed an "井" (well) shape, dropping incendiary bombs and other bombs, and then divided into vertical and horizontal lines to bomb, forming a checkerboard pattern. Therefore, the cities being bombed were engulfed in flames, making escape difficult. The flames of individual houses could reach two to three stories high, especially in densely populated areas, where they were even more intense. The vertical and horizontal firepower could spread to about 400 to 500 meters, and even wide roads could extend to the opposite side and surrounding areas. In the flames, tires of ball cars and gasoline cylinders often exploded and caught fire. Even reinforced concrete houses could have the firepower enter through the windows and suffer disaster.

Evacuation of Factories Reduces Losses: Various industrial areas made early preparations and implemented evacuation. Large factories were transformed into small factories. To prevent the spread of incendiary bombs in densely populated factory areas, isolation was added, and houses were closed off to create wide roads. Ditches were dug around each factory, and a large amount of air defense water was permanently stored. After being bombed, it could be used for irrigation and rescue, and the civilian fire could not spread. At the same time, each factory built solid and complete air-raid shelters that could accommodate more than 150% of the number of workers in each shift. Even if they were bombed during an air raid, the workers remaining in the factory could also take refuge, so the damage was extremely minor, and production was not affected.

First Aid Measures for Incendiary Bombs: Regarding first aid measures, most of the population in this city has been evacuated. Except for those who are necessary, 19 out of 10 have been evacuated to rural areas. However, people must be stationed in every house because 4-6 pound incendiary bombs can be extinguished by manpower. Therefore, in Japanese cities, a large amount of water is stored in every house every seven meters. Every 120 meters on the road, an air defense water storage pool is built. The water in each pool can be used for fire trucks for at least 4-5 hours. In some areas, it is actually possible to draw seawater and river water in to build small rivers for use when necessary, and air-raid shelters are being dug. Statistics show that each household has dug an air-raid shelter that can accommodate the family. There are more than 700,000 public air-raid shelters in Tokyo. If each air-raid shelter can accommodate five people, then 3.5 million people can take refuge. However, if the air-raid shelter is hit by an incendiary bomb, it will still lose its effectiveness. It was found that a certain doctor's family in Japan built a strong air-raid shelter. When bombed, the family and neighbors took refuge in it. Unexpectedly, the incendiary bomb completely burned down the place, and those who took refuge in the air-raid shelter could not escape and were all burned to death inside. Therefore, when enemy aircraft drop incendiary bombs, the air-raid shelter will also lose its effectiveness because the entrance and exit may catch fire and there will be no way to escape. As for the reinforced concrete houses in this city, if we refer to the bombing situation in Japan, they will also lose their effectiveness when the flames are intense. Therefore, fireproofing is recommended for windows.

Three Measures for Reference: There are three measures worth considering for reference. Once, when Tokyo was bombed, more than 60,000 citizens carried boxes of storage and took refuge in a wasteland. Later, a police station was also bombed, and people flocked to the wasteland, discovering that some boxes were on fire and would inevitably spread. Therefore, the citizens were ordered to throw the boxes completely into the nearby sea, and the fire was prevented from spreading, and the lives of more than 60,000 people were saved. Therefore, people must never carry valuables or boxes when evacuating. At the same time, it is better to bring less flammable items, and clothing should also be simple. Air defense personnel must first save lives. Secondly, when a national elementary school was bombed from the north, because its roof was made of reinforced concrete, no less than 20,000 people took refuge. At that time, the fire was about to invade through the window, so the leaders ordered everyone to quickly lower the fire-resistant window, and with many people working together quickly, they were saved from disaster. Thirdly, also in a national elementary school, which was usually a place of safety, many people took refuge. When it was bombed, the leader discovered that the enemy aircraft was going to use the house as an attack target, so he ordered the refugees to quickly move to another place, and soon it was bombed and caught fire, and the refugees were spared from disaster. Therefore, I feel that at critical times, the self-help ability of the masses is very important, and those who know it should be flexible. In short, civilian air defense must be for one's own air defense, because in times of emergency, it is difficult for others to help. The task of civilian air defense is to save oneself, and I hope that all citizens will pay attention to it.

### "Life and Death as One, Japan Will Prevail!" - A Japanese Officer's Notebook

The decisive battle of Okinawa is progressing day and night. Japanese soldiers, with a tragic determination to die for victory, and with the army, navy, and air force united as one, are incessantly and fiercely attacking the American mobile units, one after another. From the base, special attack units are constantly departing to annihilate the enemy, filling the area with surging murderous intent and overflowing patriotic fervor. Below is an excerpt from a notebook written by a certain officer from a special attack base in Southern Kyushu, Japan. Although unremarkable, it fully demonstrates the Japanese military's determination to annihilate the enemy, as well as the tragic atmosphere on the base.

Scattering Petals, Gentle Song

Although the weather has been cold in recent years, here in Southern Kyushu, it is already a bright spring. Even in early April, the petals are already scattering. However, before and behind the barracks, the large buds of the double-flowered cherry trees, laden with dew, are like clouds and mist, resembling a dream. In the clear morning, the warbler sings sweetly. If it weren't for the drone of airplanes overhead, one would almost forget, upon waking, that they are at war. Twenty-four hours a day, airplanes are constantly flying overhead, some friendly, some enemy. This brief moment of morning allows one to temporarily forget that they are in the midst of war.

"The weather is good today as well, we can continue with the scheduled attack," the Chief of Staff said to the commander as he walked towards the dining hall.

In reality, although it is called a dining hall, it is merely a flat house built of thin boards, only ten [characters] in size, and the wooden boards around [characters] are not even [character incomplete].

"Yes, we can definitely do a good job today, as long as the weather doesn't turn bad. Everyone is confident in their skills!" the commander said leisurely, sitting down at the dining table. The staff members also sat down in order.

"The clouds disperse, the mist scatters, leaving only a spring dream - what do you think?"

The staff members, lacking artistic flair, looked at each other blankly. "Ah," the commander had to explain himself.

"Heroic is heroic, but it lacks a sense of season. Haiku should be related to the season. Mine mentions the season," the commander said with a smug look, handing his bowl to the orderly; this was his second bowl.

"Indeed, but mine is a long senryu, hahaha..." the Chief of Staff laughed loudly.

"The Chief of Staff's is a vulgar song!" a voice said from the corner of the room, followed by the sound of a warbler singing.

"Commander, please come to [Omitted Characters] Team after the meal," the Air Staff Officer, seeing that breakfast was almost finished, said to the commander.

"Hmm," Putting down his bowl, the commander's face immediately changed to a serious expression.

The special attack team members were gathered around their captain, intently discussing the battle plan. The captain was a young lieutenant.

One Plane for One Ship

Attacking an aircraft carrier at a right angle is, of course, the most ideal, but our planes, like our heads, are rather clumsy, so it's difficult to do. Because we can't quickly gain altitude in front of the enemy, we must attack the side of the enemy ship. The part near the water's surface is the best place, but there's a risk of plunging into the sea, so aim for a spot slightly above the water's surface, do you understand, young men? Although the plane is heavy, the bomb is large, so we must use one plane to take out one ship! Everyone must carefully observe the surroundings and avoid bumping into each other. I always aim for the guy in the middle of the enemy ship's line. The two [characters] should follow behind me, diverging to the left and right, each selecting a target to crash into. If you miss, that's our loss. Also, when entering the attack path, don't forget to pull out the safety pin on the bomb. If you forget, it'll be a disaster! Those with poor memories should write in large letters on the windshield: "Pull the safety pin when crashing!" Even the best student who has received imperial favor will fail if they forget this! Ah... Ah - The captain's explanation seemed endless, like lecturing new recruits, no detail was spared. The team members all listened quietly, with smiles on their faces. On the sleeves and backs of their flight suits, small Japanese flags were sewn. On their flight caps, a small sprig of cherry blossoms was invariably inserted. The agile appearance of their heads wrapped in white headbands was even more beautiful than the ancient warriors in red [characters] armor. On the headband of a young team member, on one of the hanging ends, were written the four characters "Dedicate Loyalty to the Nation," and on the other end were the words "Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō" [Homage to the Lotus Sutra]. Did he write it himself? Or did someone else write it for him? I stared at the profile of this young man, no more than eighteen or nineteen years old, and unconsciously clasped my hands together.

Life and Death as One, Victory Can Be Expected "Will Japan still be defeated with such people? We will surely be victorious! We believe that when we are in hardship, the enemy is also suffering. Whoever can endure will achieve final victory, and besides, we do not feel hardship. Look, are not the young men enlisting to serve the sovereign and the nation? Life and death as one, this is why victory can be expected."

One after another, the aircraft of the attack team left behind the rumbling sound of engines, flying towards the other side of the sky. The young man with "Dedicate Loyalty to the Nation" written on his headband grasped the control stick with his left hand and raised his right hand to his brow, paying his respects and saying goodbye to those who were seeing them off. His plane roared off the ground, and I unconsciously clasped my hands tightly. Thinking of the inauspiciousness of a warrior's departure never to return, I couldn't help but shed tears.

"Japan will prevail!" I raised my military sword high. (Translated from the May 3rd Yomiuri Hochi)

Takenaka; A narrow, long mountain path, although receiving strong sunlight, still seemed cold and secluded here. Walking past its highest point, there is a vast airfield. I walked up this slope without thinking. Halfway there, a sudden thought flashed into my mind, causing me to stop involuntarily. Look at the red soil here, firmly trodden by the countless footsteps of special attack team members who have dedicated themselves to the nation. Since March 18th, hundreds of "Divine Eagles" have strode along this road. How can this not move people?

Sacred Path, Sketches of a Special Attack Base

"This little path is a national treasure. Every grain of soil has sufficient meaning to be revered!" A colleague earnestly said such a sentence.

It has been a month and a half since I came to this [characters] base. Under the cool green shade of the bamboo, the seasonal flowers that bloom here and there have changed several times. Plum blossoms, peach blossoms, cherry blossoms, crabapple blossoms, rapeseed blossoms, purple campanulas, azaleas, etc., are all authentically Japanese in feeling. They are the farewell gifts for the young special attack team members who will depart to die for their country in just two or three hours. In fact, naval aviators love these flowers. The so-called Japanese "tradition" seems to be born in these flowers and in the heart that loves flowers.

"I originally thought we would go when the plum blossoms were blooming, but unexpectedly, it's already cherry blossom season!"

The planes equipped with special explosive devices are decorated with cherry blossoms. On those many young and handsome faces, the [characters] team can [characters] the tradition of "Japanese Martial [characters]".

The expressions of the Kamikaze special attack team members are nothing "special." Since the Battle of Hawaii, the bright expressions of naval aviators have remained unchanged. Using the words "Divine Eagle" to refer to them may give a textbook-like impression, but these brave warriors do not pretend at all, they are still as usual, talking and laughing freely. When the Divine Eagles hear the call to go to war, they are even more courageous, setting off with high strides. Especially the non-commissioned officers in their twenties, who come from preparatory training, are even more enthusiastic when they go to war.

"You really can eat!" Before departing, a certain Petty Officer was eating dried bread and drinking soda, his cheeks bulging with candy. His comrades couldn't help but find it strange. However, he didn't mind at all and continued to eat.

"My mom and dad were both very fat until the day they died," he said as he ate.

"Hey, didn't you eat rice?"

"Yeah, but only three bowls!"

"Hahaha..." Everyone laughed.

"Today, the messengers from the Yasukuni Shrine dining hall must be very busy, because there are new people coming!"

"Marshal Yamamoto and Marshal Togo will also come out to greet us."

"Then we mustn't be impolite!"

The time has come, but the order to attack has not yet been issued.

"Go quickly, don't be slow. Also, when you're alive, cigarettes are always important."

If you ask them where they were born, they always like to say they are from Kyushu. This makes the Divine Eagles' patriotism even more fervent and masculine. Here, the "death" looming before their eyes is no longer dark, but makes people feel it is bright and transparent, as if they are doing something extremely "ordinary."

"I will shatter the history of Britain and America in one fell swoop!" The Divine Eagles all have this bright confidence. They will talk and laugh on their way to death.

"Dying for the country is a matter of course for the Japanese. As for names like 'special attack team,' it doesn't matter if they don't exist," said the Chief Petty Officer.

I see the meaning of living for an enduring cause every day at this base. (Written by Shinya Saito) (Translated from the May 9th Asahi Shimbun)

### Solving the City's Water Usage Problem

Since March of this year, the city's water supply authority has further reduced the amount of water available by 30 percent, and as the climate transitions into the summer season, when water consumption is particularly high, it seems that the water usage problem has already reached the point of becoming a serious issue. However, water is one of the necessities of life, and we must find a way to completely solve this water usage problem. I believe that in order to solve the water usage problem, we must devise ways and means in many aspects:

Exchange Light for Water. The reason why the supply of tap water has decreased is reportedly because the electricity supply required for "pumping water" has decreased. To increase the supply of tap water, we must increase the supply of electricity to the water company. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope to restrict all wasteful and extravagant electricity usage. Even for the benefit of all citizens, it would not be an overstatement to completely stop supplying electricity for such purposes. On the other hand, we would rather save electricity used for lighting and transfer it to the pumping of tap water, in order to increase the supply of tap water. There are two feasible ways to save electricity: First, it is already summer, the days are getting longer and darker later. The office hours of companies, firms, and institutions may as well be advanced by one hour across the board. For example, the business hours of banks and money houses originally start at 9:00 a.m., it may be changed to start at 8:00 a.m. in the morning. In this way, not only will there be no inconvenience, but the morning weather is cool and can increase work efficiency. If it is possible to implement earlier office hours, the time when electric lights are on in the evening can be changed from 7:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Second, tap water lacks a suitable substitute and is necessary for everyone, while electric lights have oil lamps as substitutes and are not necessary for everyone. If people can work when the sun rises and rest when the sun sets, they will not need to use electric lights at all. Therefore, when the electricity saved by the former method is not enough to fully increase the water supply, in order to obtain a sufficient amount of tap water necessary for daily life, we would rather completely sacrifice the electricity for non-essential items (relatively speaking). Even if the authorities transfer all electricity used for lighting to electricity used for pumping water, the discomfort felt by the citizens (the vast majority of middle-class citizens) is at least much better than not having enough tap water and having to endure a fine of 20 times the original price for exceeding the limit by more than 20 percent. In addition, the need for light is elastic, while the need for water is not.

Allocate According to Population. The usage limit for each tap water user is based on the actual usage of each household in the past. As a result, users who wasted a lot of tap water in the past and those with fewer people have received great benefits. Users who were very frugal with tap water and those with large numbers of people have suffered greatly. From this, it can be seen that allocating tap water based on actual usage in the past is naturally unreasonable. It is hoped that the water authority will quickly correct this unfair distribution phenomenon and cooperate with the Baojia authorities to allocate tap water according to the number of people. In other words, calculate the maximum usage amount for each household based on the number of people in each household. If the user is a [characters] or apartment building with many residents and no separate water meters, then how the distribution between the residents of the [characters] or apartment building is handled will be decided by the Baojia of each [characters] or apartment building.

Utilize Well Water. Digging earth wells and digging more earth wells is not only an important facility for air defense, but also, in today's situation where the tap water supply has been greatly reduced, it can at least contribute some [characters] to the solution of the water usage problem. Under conditions that do not hinder hygiene, we should try to use well water as much as possible except for washing food and for drinking, such as mopping the floor, washing windows and doors, emptying toilets, and washing clothes. However, I would like to specifically warn each well water user that it is absolutely forbidden to pour used wastewater on the ground near the wellhead. The water must be poured into a clear ditch to flow into the sewer. In this way, the clarity of the well water can be maintained. If wastewater is poured on the ground near the wellhead every day, the well water will inevitably deteriorate over time. At that time, unless a large amount of lime or alum is poured in for disinfection, it cannot be used. This is based on experience, not empty theory.

The water usage problem has reached a very serious point. The most powerful solution lies with the water authority. I hope they will work hard to find ways to relax the water usage limit.

### Filling Dead Ditches and Reconstructing Roads

— Zhan Zhiming

There are many small river branches in the western part of Shanghai, most of which are dead water rivers with blocked ends. Over time, the water has become black and foul, and dirt has accumulated, with waste and excrement covering the ground. There are also some dead cats and dogs soaking in the water. When the weather warms up a little, the stench spreads everywhere, spreading epidemics and breeding mosquitoes. Nearby residents suffer greatly. In particular, a small river in Jinjia Lane, in the southern section of Fanhuan Ferry Road, is the worst. The terrain there is also low, and every time after a heavy rain, the ground is covered with stagnant water, like a swamp. The dirty water in that small river is mixed with the rainwater on the ground, gradually spreading, and is mixed with the stagnant water in the nearby neighborhoods. Most thrifty residents are reluctant to spend money on rickshaws, so they take off their shoes and socks and wade through the water. When they return home, their feet rot within two days. And in that Jinjia Lane, one side is the road and the other side is the river. After heavy rain, it is submerged by water, so you cannot tell which side is the road and which side is the river. Unfamiliar pedestrians and cars will overturn into the river along with their cars. By the time others rescue them, they are already soaked, and they have also tasted a strange taste. In the past, someone had proposed filling the river and building a road, but at that time, because it was a section of road built by the Public Concession beyond its borders, a no-man's land, it was not implemented. Now that the Shanghai Municipal Government is completely unified, it is hoped that the city's Construction Bureau will first send personnel to investigate the area and then seek to improve it. The river extends from Fanwang Ferry Road (near Dihua Road intersection) in the west to Jiaozhou Road in the east, directly connecting to the end of Xinzha Road. If the road is built, the stone road on the riverbank should also be included, and this road can be two zhang wide. Currently, there are many shanties there, but after the road is built, the houses can be gradually rebuilt and shops can be established. At that time, the appearance of the city will be renewed.

### Re-discussing Strengthening Fire Prevention

— Bao Zuoqi

Since the major fires in the shantytowns of Yaoshuinong, Xikang Road, and Yuyao Road, residents of the city have realized the importance of fire prevention work, especially in wartime Shanghai, fire prevention facilities are even more needed. Although the city's fire prevention facilities are more complete than those of other cities, in the areas where the poor live and in the factory areas (especially in the shantytowns), the population is dense, the dwellings are narrow, and once there is a fire, it spreads uncontrollably. The fire trucks cannot reach the scene in time, and there is a lack of fire prevention facilities, which has resulted in tragedies. The fires in Yaoshuinong and Yuyao Road are two obvious examples.

If we look at Tokyo, Japan, because the roads are wide and the fire prevention facilities are relatively complete, it is easier to extinguish fires. Looking back at our country, the roads are narrow and there is a lack of prevention equipment, so the damage caused by fires is also very great. It is hoped that in the future, the Construction Bureau and the Fire Administration Bureau can provide guidance and improvement for the reconstruction work of houses so that it is in line with fire prevention principles.

As for the fire in Yuyao Road, the failure of the Taiping Dragon Head [fire hydrant] was also an important reason. Therefore, sand and water storage for fire prevention are indeed indispensable. It is hoped that the fire administration authorities will often repair the fire hydrants to avoid being at a loss in case of emergency. In addition, there must also be adequate preparation of medicines for rescuing the dead and treating the wounded.

In short, the lesson given by this fire is that it has made us realize that the city's fire prevention facilities are not yet sound. It is hoped that in the future, the Baojia mechanism can be used to strengthen fire prevention facilities so that Shanghai can become a model city for the whole country in terms of fire prevention.

### Construction Administration in the Past Two Months

— Xu Jidun

Managing Land Transportation Facilities

The city of [Character] has a vast area and crisscrossing roads. After the incident, the population reached more than five million. The management of land transportation, which [characters] public safety and order, is of the utmost importance. In the past, due to the existence of the concessions, the administrative system was divided, and the management procedures were complicated. Now that the municipal administration is unified, this administrative matter is now under the jurisdiction of this bureau. In the past two months, we have strived to thoroughly rectify the situation. First, we have adjusted the structure of the vehicle registration offices. Among the various vehicle registration offices established during the Public Works Bureau era, including Jiangning Road, Changxing Road, Gongping Road, Madang Road, Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, Pudong, Wusong, Nanhui, Fengxian, Minhang, Jiading, Baoshan, and Chongming, we have first abolished the Madang Road Vehicle Registration Office. The registration, inspection, and licensing of public tricycles and private rickshaws in the city that were previously handled by that office shall be handled separately by the registration offices in each district according to the location of the vehicle owner, so as to facilitate matters. Furthermore, considering that the original vehicle registration offices in Zhongjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Jiading, Baoshan, and Chongming counties were too far from the bureau, making it difficult to manage, and in order to unify county administration and facilitate supervision, they have all been abolished since April. All matters of the vehicle registration offices in each of these counties will be handed over to the county governments to continue handling them in accordance with the regulations. As for the vehicle registration offices in the districts of Pudong, Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, and the city center, because this bureau has already established offices in each of these districts, for the sake of simplifying administrative efficiency, since April 1, they have all been merged into each office and vehicle management groups have been established to continue handling vehicle registration matters in each of these districts.

As for the inspection of vehicles violating regulations, in the past, the vehicle inspectors of the Public Works Bureau did not handle the inspection of vehicles violating regulations properly. Now, after careful screening, [characters] have been revised, inspectors' service regulations have been formulated to ensure strict compliance. Since April, they have been divided into two groups, going out every day to inspect vehicles violating regulations in the city.

Status of Rectification of Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads

It has been found that Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads are municipal railways connecting the city to Chuansha and Nanhui. Because the environment of these two roads is special and the municipal vehicles are insufficient, all equipment and services are simple and derelict. I paid close attention to this matter during the Public Works Bureau era, determined to reform, and adjusted personnel. Over the past few months, all locomotives and passenger cars have been repaired successively, roadbed sleepers have been replaced separately, station equipment has been gradually repaired, and the suppression of passengers traveling without tickets has been vigorously carried out. It has now been completely renewed, the business has developed, and the income has increased sharply. At the same time, it has united with military and police agencies to assist in ensuring road safety for passengers.

Management of Water Transportation Facilities

The most important aspect of water transportation in the city is the ferry service on the Huangpu River. The current City Ferry Company, which is the former City Ferry Administration Office, was jointly established by China and Japan in 1940, each bearing half of the total capital. The number of routes that had been restored before the incident are now facing implementation due to the shortage of coal allocation, and they are sometimes forced to implement, with services sometimes running and sometimes stopping. Currently, only the four routes of Shanghai to Dongchang Road, Shanghai to Qingning Temple, Shanghai to Dongqing, and Shanghai to Gaoqiao have been restored. Compared to the past, it is less than one-tenth, while the frequency of passengers traveling back and forth is twice that of before the war. (To be continued)

### Detailed Map of the Ryukyu Islands

Okinawa Island, located in the center of the Ryukyu Islands, has now become the decisive battlefield of the Greater East Asia War. Since the start of the battle two months ago, the enemy forces have consistently poured all their strength into the southern part of the island, the area along Naha, Shuri, and Nakagusuku Bay, and have repeatedly launched general offensives on the Japanese military positions. Therefore, the Japanese military line has gradually formed an uneven and complex line from a single line, and the battle is becoming increasingly fierce. After continuous and fierce attacks by the Japanese army, navy, and air force, the enemy forces have suffered significant setbacks, and the enemy's attempt to completely occupy Okinawa Island has been shattered.

### Ah Shun

— Li Tianshen

When Ah Shun played with enthusiasm, he truly resembled a little general, imposing and awe-inspiring. However, the moment he heard his mother call him, he would shrink back like a defeated cricket, retreating.

In just a few more months, Ah Shun would be eight years old!

"An eight-year-old rascal still often wets the bed! Wetting the bed is one thing! But one day, he made a puddle of urine and feces that leaked from the bed planks all the way onto the lid of the chest! And he slept like a dead pig! Tell me, shouldn't he be beaten?"

Ah Shun's mother always had a theory after beating Ah Shun, to show that she was a virtuous mother.

"He should be beaten, he deserves to be beaten! Ah Shun's mother has never been wrong in her life. No one has ever opposed her.

Anyway, someone like Ah Shun who is not made of good stuff, will never amount to much in the future. 'You can tell a person's potential from childhood, what they will be like at six is how they will be when they are old.' He'll just be picking trash, pushing carts, definitely not made of the right stuff!"

Ah Shun really wasn't made of the right stuff. Even the name "Ah Shun's Mother" had been called for less than three years.

Three years ago, Ah Shun's father, after losing another newborn son, was incredibly disheartened. No wonder the fortune teller said that they, husband and wife, were destined to be a lonely old couple. Even their eldest daughter, Zhao Nü, if she hadn't been adopted by the Kitchen God, would have already... But as long as they did good deeds and made up for the karma of their previous lives, perhaps Heaven would have a benevolent heart and the Li family wouldn't be without descendants.

So Ah Shun's mother had vowed to burn incense three times a day. If Heaven granted her a son, she would also abstain from meat for a month.

Sure enough, in less than half a year, Ah Shun's mother was pregnant.

Immediately, everyone in the household was in an uproar, saying that good deeds are rewarded and that someone as devout as Grandpa Li shouldn't be without descendants.

Although she was pregnant, they didn't know if it was a boy or a girl. Even fortune tellers and character readers couldn't predict it, which made Grandpa Li and his wife extremely anxious. If it was a girl, wouldn't that be...

So Ah Shun's mother made another vow. If Heaven granted her a son, she would definitely visit the temple to burn incense every month.

Even though Ah Shun's mother was two months pregnant, she was still uneasy.

At this time, a relative from afar—a highly virtuous and dignified woman—came and pointed out the way for the lost couple.

"The master of the Chen mansion, where my daughter-in-law's wet nurse works, is almost fifty years old. The mistress just couldn't conceive. Later, the mistress had no choice but to go to the orphanage and adopt a child, treating him as her own son. In less than a year, the mistress was pregnant, and it was a boy... Later, the mistress asked a fortune teller to calculate, and found out that it was all thanks to the adopted child..."

"And then?"

"And then... Now both children have grown up, especially the one the mistress gave birth to..."

"Yes—Ling Di, the daughter of Granny Feng next door, wasn't she also adopted? Now she really brought a younger brother. The fortune teller said she had good luck, and Granny Feng is going to recognize her as her own daughter-in-law—marrying her to the adopted brother."

"Ah! This is really effective. Why don't you adopt a child to bring you good luck?"

After the old lady mentioned it, Ah Shun's mother woke up as if from a dream and decided to adopt a child.

The lucky one among hundreds of children—Ah Shun—was adopted.

This was a child with a large frame and very thin, covered in unknown sores. A large head sat on weak shoulders, and large eyes were sunken in skull-like eye sockets, shining with lifeless light. He had a very large appetite—everything showed poverty. But among hundreds of orphans, he could be considered outstanding—the result of Grandpa Li and his wife's two days of selection.

Ah Shun wasn't called Ah Shun at first. What was his name? No one ever mentioned it. The name Ah Shun came with the idea of "bringing good luck." The day he arrived at their house was considered Ah Shun's birthday.

Ah Shun went from hell to heaven. He went from two meals of thin porridge and a bowl of soybean milk a day to three dry meals with snacks to eat. He wore good clothes. In a few months, Ah Shun became a big, fat-fleshed kid. Grandpa Li and his wife put a lot of effort into Ah Shun. As soon as Ah Shun arrived, they took care of his sores and taught him how to address them. Finally, they taught him—:

"Ah Shun, if people ask if your mother is having a younger brother or a younger sister, you say it's a younger brother."

"..."

"Got it?"

"If your mother is having a younger brother or a younger sister?"

"If people ask me if it's a younger brother or a younger sister, I say it's a younger brother."

Ah Shun was really stupid. He took two weeks to learn even these few words, and often said them wrong.

When someone asked him, "Is your mother having a younger brother or a younger sister?"

"Younger brother."

Ah Shun's mother smiled widely.

Then Ah Shun would be praised by the whole family.

But Ah Shun still often said it wrong, which inevitably made Ah Shun's mother unhappy.

"Ah Shun, is your mother having a younger brother or a younger sister?"

"Younger sis..."

At this time, Ah Shun's mother's face would fall.

Although Ah Shun was only six years old, he knew how to read the "wind." Seeing his mother's fallen face, he knew he had said it wrong, and quickly corrected himself:

"...Younger brother."

Ah Shun's mother still smiled, but it didn't seem very happy.

Although Ah Shun often said it wrong, on average, "younger brother" was said more often than "younger sister." In Ah Shun's mother's eyes, it seemed a bit "certain."

Ah Shun's mother grabbed this "certainty" and safely passed the few months of her pregnancy. Ah Shun also lived more than half a year of comfortable life.

After being carefully nurtured by Grandpa Li and his wife, Ah Shun grew white and fat. No one could tell that he was a child adopted from an orphanage.

When others saw him, they were really happy for Grandpa Ah Shun.

"Such good fortune! This child is really growing well."

Fortune. Grandpa Ah Shun smiled. He almost didn't dare to think of himself as a fortunate person. These short two words made him recall the past—twenty years ago...

A white and fat child was moving in front of his eyes, gradually, gradually... The child grew bigger day by day, from drinking milk to eating milk cakes, slowly learning to eat porridge and rice, learning to sit, crawl, and call him Grandpa. At that time, he thought he deserved to be called a fortunate person.

Who knew that a heatstroke would make the child lose more than half of his weight. A bout of measles ended the child's entire life.

The measles were treated by an old doctor with fifty years of experience, even the magic needles of Immortal Liu couldn't cure him. The child was destined to die! Sure enough, later the fortune teller said that the child was a noble person, and they didn't have the fortune to bear it.

From then on, Grandpa Ah Shun thought of himself as an unlucky person.

Then, the second child fell from his wife's belly, his face looked a lot like the one that died before. Grandpa Ah Shun and his wife feared that they didn't have the fortune to keep him, so they quickly adopted him to a fellow villager who had three sons and four daughters.

That way, the child really stayed. Until the birth of the third child—a girl.

At this time, Grandpa Ah Shun's life could be considered extremely happy, looking at his walking son, kissing his breastfeeding daughter.

Unfortunately, a lively child, somehow, suffered from an illness that lasted less than twenty-four hours and died. Grandpa Ah Shun and his wife almost invited Zhang Tianshi, but they couldn't save him. They just didn't have the fortune!

The son was gone, but there was still a daughter, who was very delicate and lively. The family of three—plus the child's maternal grandmother. Fearing that she was also a short-lived ghost, the grandmother came up with an idea to adopt her to the Kitchen God, naming her "Zhao" Nü—so that she could live safely to this day.

Then the fourth, fifth, sixth came down from Ah Shun's mother's belly, one by one were carried out of Grandpa Ah Shun's hands, and finally, from the mouth of a fortune teller, he learned that these were all debt-collecting ghosts. Indeed, Grandpa Ah Shun's savings were completely spent on these debt-collecting ghosts.

Grandpa Ah Shun treated Ah Shun better than his own father, but he also had his intentions. He knew that he was an unlucky person, and the child in his wife's belly was meant for Ah Shun to bring good luck. He served Ah Shun for the sake of the third party, the heaven-sent son in his wife's womb.

Finally, the day arrived when the blessed child was born. The entire back room, no! The whole house was very busy. Almost everyone said that it was a noble son, a heaven-sent child! Everyone was looking forward to the arrival of the noble son.

Heaven answered their prayers! The child who fell to the ground was indeed a boy. So everyone rushed to say that the Li family shouldn't be without descendants, and the celebratory sounds shook the whole house.

The bringer of fortune—Ah Shun—was forgotten at that time.

The noble son had a noble appearance, a pointed forehead, a small round head, small ears. The most noteworthy thing was that he had two large birthmarks on his buttocks! He didn't even cry when he fell into the basin. Later, the midwife hit him several times desperately before he cried. This strange phenomenon certainly showed that this noble son was extraordinary.

The noble son was named Ah Yu.

Under the influence of "bringing good luck", Ah Yu grew up day by day. Ah Shun lost people's praise day by day, and until today, Ah Shun simply became an obstacle to others.

Ah Shun was indeed "disliked". His body was full of fat from who knows where, his cheeks were red and purple, his speech was never clear, he walked unsteadily, and he was extremely gluttonous. As soon as he saw someone opening their mouth to eat, he would stare with wide eyes, as if his soul had been taken away, without moving at all. These were all the reasons why Ah Shun's mother would get angry and hit him.

Ah Shun was not only gluttonous but also stupid. At almost eight years old, he couldn't even wash a bowl. If you asked him to hold his younger brother, he would definitely scare you to death! When cooking, you couldn't ask him to get a bowl or pass a soy sauce bottle.

The prices of goods rose day by day, and Ah Shun's appetite could only provoke Ah Shun's mother's curse, which was a certain thing, because Ah Shun was no longer in Ah Shun's mother's eyes.

Ah Shun also grew a body of steel bones, not afraid of being beaten. When he wet the bed and was whipped with a belt, if you asked him if he would pee again next time! He would shout desperately:

"Grandpa, I won't pee anymore!"

But the next day he would pee again. Such a piece of trash, not good stuff, other than beating him, there seemed to be no other way.

So every night we hear Ah Shun's mother's cursing, loudly escaping from the back room into our ears. Grandpa's belt sound clearly echoes in the dark air, only Ah Shun's crying sound is very small and thin...

Ah Shun is also very silly.

When we see the faint bloodstains on his body and the purple skin, and ask him if it hurts?

He doesn't say a word.

Once I grabbed him:

"Ah Shun, does it hurt?"

He replied faintly:

"It hurts..."

Ah Shun lived a life of pain forever!

But at least we still thought Ah Shun had risen from hell to heaven.

### Agitation of Life

— Yuan Yan

In the journey of life, in the river of life, there should be ripples and waves from time to time, interspersed in between; otherwise, life is too lonely. Even if it is a storm that covers the sky and the sun, it is good to be able to enrich life and not go down a path of mediocrity.

My fragile life is like a lonely boat in this sea of ​​humanity with turbulent waves, maybe it will be swallowed by a huge wave, or sometimes it will be smashed to pieces by the hidden reefs at the bottom of the sea! But I will never be afraid, never be discouraged, I will steer the rudder of my soul and make a desperate struggle against this storm! Because only in difficult struggles can my will be tempered; only in dangerous battles can the perseverance of mankind be revealed. So I don't complain about the current suffering at all, it is giving me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I am so lucky to be on the scene and see the reality.

The suffering of current life is getting heavier day by day, becoming a powerful whip, whipping every citizen, this is also an inevitable process. Because the darkness before dawn is the most unbearable; only after the storm is there a clear and sunny sky, I want to see the beautiful and peaceful river surface after this storm.

### Old Pastry Chef

— Ji Kelou

The sun shone on Right Street with a cool breeze, and the wind was very strong.

The old pastry chef's pastry shop was huddled in a corner of the cobblestone street. Every day, he always looked at the people passing by through his glasses with "broken legs", watching the feet of passers-by familiarly stomping on the cobblestone street.

A college student habitually put down one hundred yuan here and took away a dime's worth of pastry.

"He is a regular customer," looking at the familiar figure, the old pastry chef felt a little unbearable. "Carrying such a thick stack of books every day, maybe he has to walk a lot of road! Tomorrow, tomorrow I'll cut him more pastry!"

The back view with patches all over his clothes reminded him of his own son, the son who unfortunately died of tuberculosis, wasn't he also going to school every day in the past?

A black shadow flashed, and his nimble grandson, carrying a teapot, flashed in through the door and put it on the table:

"Just now - Grandpa, just now the owner of the tiger stove said that the price of boiling water will increase tomorrow!"

He felt a little disappointed in his heart, thinking of his dead son, thinking of his grandson whose life was just sprouting, life was so difficult, and he was such an old age...

With both hands pressing a large mass of flour and pressing hard, he wanted to press all his sorrows, worries, worries, disappointments... into the flour, so he always kneaded it every day; but the dough that could not be kneaded was like the sorrows, worries, worries, and disappointments that could not be kneaded away...

The strong wind brought dust from the street corner and took away the fragrance of pastry from here - the pastry on the stove was about to be baked.

The fragrance of pastry attracted a group of customers.

A woman with bound feet waddled over from across the street.

"How much is a catty?" One hand was tightly holding the banknotes, and the other hand was turning the pastry back and forth and looking at it carefully.

"It looks like she has to catch her breath before she can buy it!" The old pastry chef thought in his heart while answering the price.

The woman with bound feet picked up a small piece of pastry and stuffed it into her mouth, and without waiting for the old pastry chef to speak, she threw the banknotes in her hand on the table:

"Weigh a catty of pastry." The triumphant look on her face seemed to be saying: "I have money to buy pastry, and I don't care about eating a bite."

"Anyway, she is buying a catty of pastry, so let her have a bite for free!" The old pastry chef held back his anger, weighed a catty of pastry, cut the pastry into small pieces, found the change, and then went to knead the dough that could never be kneaded away.

The woman with bound feet stood there counting the money for a long time before putting the money away, and took a big piece when she picked up the pastry.

This time, the old pastry chef couldn't hold back his anger anymore,

"Damn you, auntie, how much do you want to take for buying a catty of pastry?"

The woman with bound feet really had a trick, she threw the pastry on the table calmly:

"Hmph! I'm not talking about it," the woman with bound feet waddled away.

The old pastry chef's saliva splashed on the flour, and his grandson whispered:

"It's really like seeing her mother's ghost, if she wasn't seen, she would have taken it away a long time ago."

After dealing with these customers, the old pastry chef really felt a bit of a headache. Those customers who liked to take advantage of small things came and went in batches, they were willing to go to the street to try their luck and send large stacks of banknotes into other people's pockets.

Look! The woman with bound feet is arguing with Qi Xiaoqing's family again, not because of owing money, but because she bought the vegetables and wanted to get another bargain...

Too much, too much. Every day, the old pastry chef watched these endless dramas, endless arguments.

The strong wind brought dust from the street corner and took away the fragrance of pastry from here. From morning to night, constant customers took away the endless pastry, swallowed the dough that could not be kneaded away.

Now, he has rolled up his sleeves again to knead the dough, and the dough that can't be kneaded is accompanied by endless sorrow, Xia, , , and disappointment...

### September Night

— Hu Damai

Caressing the scars in the history of life.

I was trapped in focused melancholy;

And weave a beautiful net bag of the future,

Put the past into the remote edges of the lacquer-like night.

Who is whispering in my ear,

"Report a good message - the stars in the sky have already come out--" I frantically ran to the small enclosure.

### Six Strong Chinese and Foreign Teams from Across Shanghai Participate in the First Division Softball League, Opening June 10th at the Russian Athletic Association

Last year's Shanghai Softball League, which attracted considerable attention from fans, will soon reappear before our eyes due to the coming of [presumably a person named] Li. It is noted that in last year's league, the Chinese team, the Pandas, participated, but due to inferior skills, failed to win the championship. This year's open league has already held a softball league committee meeting last Sunday, deciding to begin the competition on June 10th. This league is not hosted by Filipino expatriates as in previous years, but rather by Dr. Eduo, the president of the [likely a team name] club, who serves as chairman of the league committee, and has named the league the "Panda Cup." However, its nature is that of an open Shanghai league. Currently, the number of participating strong Chinese and foreign teams has reached as many as six. These six teams are all top-tier softball teams, including talents from countries such as China, Japan, the Philippines, Portugal, and Russia. Each powerful team is actively preparing for practice, and this year's softball season will be a grand spectacle, as can be predicted.

Now, to satisfy the curiosity and inform the fans, we present the lineup and strength of these six teams:

Panda Team

The Panda Team is the only Chinese team in the league, having participated in the league last year, greatly impressing Western teams. However, due to slightly inferior skills, they were unable to win the championship. This year, after a major reorganization by President E'sen, in addition to newly selected players, they have also specially hired Liang Fuchu, a veteran in the Chinese baseball world, as their coach. It is noted that Mr. Liang has been in Japan and Hong Kong and is a renowned baseball coach. His experience and skills are admirable. Previously, he coached the Chung Wang baseball team in Hong Kong and won an international championship. The Pandas now have the possibility of winning the championship. Chinese people have never sought Shanghai softball and baseball championships, which is truly the result of the nation's lack of attention to baseball and softball sports. This time, the Pandas have gathered the strongest Chinese softball players in Shanghai, preparing to compete fiercely with foreign teams. The league will therefore increase in interest, and our military and fanatical fans will naturally be happy to watch. The team boasts famous players who have studied in Japan, such as Shen Yousheng and Wen Ruixiong. With the addition of catcher Huang Yingrui and second baseman Wen Tianhua, it feels like the team is full of talent. The Pandas' fielding was praised as the best in Shanghai last year. The team's only advantage lies in its quick and steady catches, and the infielders are like an impregnable copper wall. The outfielders catch the ball steadily, such as Tang Weiye, [Name] Bao Luo, and Wang Nianzhi, and there are also adhesive glove experts such as Wang Xiushan and Wang Nianzu, who are all excellent in both offense and defense. In addition, the hitting skills of all the players can be applied from both sides, using both soft and hard tactics. Also, the whirlwind-style pitching of pitcher Li Qi is a rare talent. In short, the team is full of vitality and will surely achieve great things in this year's league.

Japanese Expatriate Team

The Japanese Expatriate Team (Crusades) is organized entirely by Japanese expatriates who have studied in the United States, and is one of the most balanced teams in this year's league. The team's offense and defense are both top-notch. For example, the catcher is a player from the most famous Meiji University baseball team in Japan. His steady catching is unparalleled. Also, the shortstop, Zhi Wu, is a student from Southern [Likely a typo] University in the United States. His quick catches and left-handed hitting are both well-known. Moreover, the team's first baseman, Yan Da, catches the ball with absolute certainty. The average hitting skills of all the players will provide the most exciting performances in this year's league. When the team competes with the Pandas in the future, it will be a meeting of strong Chinese and Japanese teams, and a fierce battle is inevitable.

Filipino Expatriate Team

The Filipino Expatriate Team (FM·U·) has a long history. All the team members are Filipino musicians in Shanghai. For example, team captain Tang Qiaosi is a famous heavy hitter. The pitching of pitcher Taishan and the fierce hitting of Basha both make the team's strength impressive. The team posed a great threat to the champion Portuguese Commercial Team last year. The skills of all the players are improving daily, and their offense and defense show considerable skill. Their strength cannot be underestimated.

Portuguese Commercial Team

The Portuguese Commercial Team (Catholc Federation) is a strong team in the local [Shanghai] league, but has won the championship three times in the softball competition, showing that the team's strength is the best of all the teams. The team's pitcher, Tang Bala, is Shanghai's most famous home run hitter, and his pitching is elusive. His cooperation with catcher Peterson is skilled. The shortstop and third baseman, Aolie Weila and Team G. Ruo, both throw like arrows. The outfielders, V. Su Ruo and Pan Lira, both have excellent performances. This year, the team has recruited several famous players and will appear in the league with a new style, making them a team that our Chinese team must carefully prepare for.

Samurai Team

The Samurai Team (Knighs of St Mary) is a newly emerging team, having won the second division championship last year. This year, they have been promoted to the first division and will surely achieve great things. The team's characteristics are its quick steals and runs. They often take advantage of gaps in the opponent's defense to become active. Moreover, the team often uses short hits when attacking, making it difficult for the opponent to defend. The whole team is of mixed race, and all are very young. They will surely fight hard in this year's league.

Western Youth Team

The Western Youth Team (Y Cubs) was last year's runner-up. Team members Bo Ke, Kai Jiemiluo Fu, and Ao Sha Liao are all well-known figures in the league. The whole team is composed of the Western Youth and Meng Nuoke [likely a team name]. However, because the Japanese shortstop, Zhi Dao, transferred to the Japanese Expatriate Team, the team's strength has suffered a major loss. The whole team has skilled cooperation and attacks opponents' weaknesses. All the players have rich experience on the field and remain calm in crisis. The team's weakness is in hitting, which is the same as the Panda's flaw. However, in defense, due to the departure of Zhi Dao and first baseman Yan, whether they can be as active as in the previous season will only be known after the competition.

This year's league also has a second division. There are already more than ten participants. Among them, teams such as the Panda Sharks, the Soviet Union, the Pirates, and the Portuguese Commercial Team are all very strong, especially the Chinese team Panda is the strongest. Such as team members Liang Youwen, Liang You [Name]. In addition, the Shark Team's catcher Wang Xiunan and pitcher Zheng Hanzhong are both young and promising. And there are many good players in each team, so these ten teams will kill each other, which will increase the excitement in this year's league. It has been found that the league authorities have rented the Russian Athletic Association field, and at the same time decided that the first division will adopt a round-robin format, and the second division will adopt a single round-robin format. The organizer of this year is the Chinese. For the sake of popularization, no tickets will be charged, and fans are welcome to watch as much as possible, so as to improve and increase the interest of the Chinese in softball.

### Volleyball League Opens, Review of the Strengths of the First Division and Women's Groups

This year's volleyball league has been in progress since its opening last Saturday, with matches every day, Wednesdays for the first division or women's groups, and the rest of the days for the second division matches.

According to this session, the indoor stadiums could not be rented, so the league authorities first borrowed the Donghua Football Field, but then each team found it inconvenient in terms of transportation, so the league authorities decided to borrow the Zhongbei Stadium on Jing'an Temple Road. League Committee Wang Xi Zhang Baokui contacted Wang Zhongtao, the leader of the Zhongbei team, and Wang agreed to rent it for free, which really benefited the league a lot. For the reasons listed above, the competition is still open to the public, with no tickets sold, which truly meets the purpose of promotion.

Because the number of foreign teams in this session has been reduced, the first division has four teams, and the women's group has even fewer, with only three teams participating due to the retirement of last year's champion Green Team and the lack of leadership after the departure of the third-place Zhi [Likely a team name] team. There are a total of seventeen teams in the second division, divided into two groups, A and B. The first division and women's group both adopt a double round-robin system, while the second division adopts a single round-robin system. After the group champions are produced, the overall champion will be determined.

Since the start of the competition, the author has observed the strengths of each team in the first division and women's groups. Here is a look at the overall situation of the two groups, and a review of the strengths of each team.

First Division Championship: Zhongbei is a Sure Thing

The participants in the first division are Zhongbei, the White Team, the Three Provinces, and Huayan. All four strong teams have had matches in the past week. Zhongbei has won against the Three Provinces and Huayan, Huayan has won against the White Team and lost to Zhongbei, and the White Team has only lost one match to Huayan, and the Three Provinces has also lost one match to Zhongbei. In terms of talent and strength, even without a match, we had expected Zhongbei's neatness and strength, so it can be invincible and stable in all victories. Now it has fought twice, and both have been won under light strokes, which is by no means accidental. Then there is no doubt that it will maintain a winning streak. It is quite difficult to predict the seat of the runner-up. The White Team, the Three Provinces, and Huayan, these three teams, their strengths are indeed similar, each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and because it is a double round-robin, there are many changes, so it depends on the effort at the time. In conclusion, Zhongbei is the chief of the first division, and the second, third, and fourth are uncertain. Now let's review the strengths of each team.

Zhongbei's Talent is Overwhelming

This time, Zhongbei originally had its veterans

In addition, all the people from last year's champion team, Yuejun, have returned, so it is not only a matter of talent, but it is not impossible to divide it into two teams. According to its current standard lineup, it should be the first row Li Shizhong, Mai Bingyao, Chen Xuechong, the second row Zhao Yalin, Hou Ruoyu, Yuan Bingqiu, the third row Chen Jichang, Huang [Name] Jun, Chen Zhaobang. There are still team leader Wang Zhongtao and Li Zhenzhong, Ma Canxi, Yu [Name] Zi, Zhuo Guorong, Bao Songyuan and other generals listed as reserve troops. The number of talents is self-evident. In terms of combat effectiveness, Li Saizhong and Chen Xuechong's kill, and Zhao Yalin and Yuan [Name] Qiu's [Likely a typo] hit in the scoring aspect, all four have the assassin that can kill the enemy, so just by relying on Mai Bingyao's wonderful setting, whether left or right, front or back. Then it is not only winning the ball. And also the beauty of the appreciation. In terms of defense, the lock weaving of the first row and the bravery of the generals in the third row are all above the standard. Especially the three generals in the third row are difficult for other teams to look at. Only the author always feels that Zhongbei's talent should have a more exquisite performance. It is hoped that the team will give full play to it in future competitions, and do not slack off slightly because of a stable victory.

White Team's Experience is Better, but Endurance is Not Enough

The White Team has more than 10 years of history in the volleyball world. Although the team members have changed slightly, most of them remain unchanged. Such as Wang Deyuan, Wang Deyi brothers, and Cheng Yening, Wang Guangzhao, Xie Yiqin, etc., have always been the same. Since there is a long history, the cooperation and experience are naturally better than others. It is a pity that the old generals are ultimately not strong enough. Therefore, the team's first game is more energetic than the last game, and there is a feeling of fighting more and more. This is an irreparable defect. In terms of tactics, scoring seems to depend entirely on Wang Deyuan alone. Zhu Deyi occasionally has achievements, but it is easy to be noticed and suffers too much. The first row is locked [Likely a typo] not old enough. The three new players in the third row, Chen Zuoliang, Xu Xishang, and Xu Pingyang, all have a potential of rapid progress, which is admirable.

Three Provinces has Guidance, with Promising Future

The Three Provinces is the mighty division A team from last year, the original team of Zhongdui, with only Tan Shuizhan, a national player, and Yao Wenyi, a strong player, added. Since this team was suddenly affiliated with the Three Provinces Sports Association flag this year, and Deng Xiaoliang's management is effective, the team members are in excellent spirits. What is even more valuable is that the team hired Mr. Zhu Qigong as a coach, which can be said to be the right person. Mr. Zhu has a very deep understanding of volleyball and is familiar with the theoretical aspects. He has been famous in Guangdong for a long time. Observing the gradual progress of the Three Provinces, it can be seen. Therefore, this session of the Three Provinces will definitely have one or two amazing performances, and the future is unlimited. Strive for it!

Huayan Lacks Cooperation, Difficult to Develop

The Huayan Team is a combination of volleyball lovers living in the same alley of Huayanli, which is very commendable. Therefore, the organizers have always praised the team's organization and believed that the future is promising. This year's ability to resolutely join the first division is especially admirable. Before the opening, I thought that the team would get the bottom, but it would definitely make the most progress. At the time of the first battle, I suddenly saw the former Russian expatriate main general Gu Tange and the French businessman's soul Qiao Qi helping out, which is certainly a lot of enhancement for the team's strength. And watching the game, the two will be selfish and collude with each other. Because the two have excellent skills and score a lot of points, they can win the White Team, but that's all. But I deeply feel that the rest of the generals have less opportunity because of this, and it is difficult to progress naturally. In short, it is reasonable to win over famous generals in order to get better results. But you should pay attention to cooperation. Otherwise, it will become a personal performance. For example, Tan Yongzhan joined a group of new people in the Three Provinces. In addition to his achievements, he also has a heart to promote others. Huayan should pay special attention and change it. If not, it will bury a lot of new talents. What does Qian Jia [Name] think?

Women's Group: the Three Provinces will definitely Win the Championship

Only three teams, Three Provinces, Xinben, and Huayan, participated in the women's group. In the first battle, Huayan lost to Xinben, which should be a competition for the ranking. The seat of the champion will definitely be won by the Three Provinces. The Three Provinces is the runner-up team from the previous session, and the scene of the tragic defeat to the Green Team in the final is still in front of us. The team has been working hard and diligently, and has long had the ambition to win the championship in this session. The writer also believes that with the Green Team not participating, the nail in the eyes has been removed. Walking on the broad road, there is no need for thorns. What is hoped is that they will not be proud or discouraged, and work hard to achieve their goals, so that they can not lose the championship [Likely a typo] attitude. Xinben is a new army that has emerged this year, and it is a team that can be built by winning the first battle. Huayan has Zhi Qian's four knights participating, and although it is currently one defeat to Xinben, it may be able to show its power and avenge this arrow in the second round. The strength of the three heroines teams is as follows:

Three Provinces have been Diligently Planning for a Long Time

Most of the women's team in the Three Provinces is the original team of Shanghai Star, and its strength is naturally strong. After the Three Provinces team won the last session, it participated in the league, and it was determined to win the championship. In terms of its strength, it is indeed considered solid among the women's teams. Chen Meizhen's smash in the first row is unparalleled. Shen Meiying is Chen's old partner, and this year, because Shi Ruijuan is resting, Shen must be in the second row, then she will play the old tune with Meizhen. Some achievements will definitely be better than in the past. Yu Ruo Chen Liuzhen, Lu Cuifang, Chen Yangshu, etc. are all generals, and the team has skilled cooperation and a light lineup, which are far above the other two teams, so they will get what they want in this session.

Xinben Emerges Suddenly and is Admirable

The Xinben Volleyball Team is participating in the league for the first time. The team is organized by the students of Xinben Women's School, and it is a student army. Except for Lu Zhaoshan, the rest are all unfamiliar faces, so it is inevitable to be admired. The two players in the first row, Zhu [Name] and Wu Qu, both have good results. Wang Wuti's skill in the middle row does not seem like a newcomer, and she is very experienced. The third row is hosted by Lu Zhaoshan, but unfortunately the two angles are slightly weak. The team is a student army with strong years of age and strength. Judging from the situation of the first battle, it is not difficult to become famous.

Huayan has Many Strong Generals, but Improper Coordination

Huayan team gets Zhi [Likely a typo] team Zhang Minyu. Shen Yuwen. Weng [Name] Qing. Peng Xiangyuan's four generals helped out, which can be said to be a gathering of strong generals, and they are definitely not the ordinary type. Unexpectedly, the first battle was lost to Xinben, which is thought-provoking. The team lacks guidance, and there are improper uses of people. In the past, Peng Xiangyuan tried the second row, and Zhu Wenpei was the first row left [Likely a typo], which were all mistakes. If Zhang Minyu can be listed in the Weir [Likely a name] row, she can be more competent than Zhu Jingrong and Peng Xiangda, Zhu Wenpei should be in the first row, Shen Yuwen and Weng [Name] Qing assist on the left and right, and Peng Xiangyuan should be in the third row. With such deployment, better results can be expected. The only regret is that Zhang Minyu's wonderful smash will be buried. In short, if the team can coordinate properly, it is likely to win when it meets Xinben in the future.

### Tomorrow Morning Football Charity Match, Friendship League vs. Portuguese Business Great War

Tomorrow (3rd) at 9:30 a.m., there will be a charity football match at the Racecourse Stadium, between the Friendship League and the Portuguese Business team. At a time when the football festival has already passed, it is an unexpected treat for Shanghai fans to see the two strong teams meet.

We can find out that in this year's Division A league, the "League" and "Portuguese" teams are both in the top. The former is two draws and loses two points, and the latter is one loss and less two points. In the final game, it turned into an unpleasant breakup. Afterwards, the Football Association approved a rematch

Tomorrow morning, the Friendship League and the Portuguese Business team will have a charity football match, but the Portuguese Business team appealed and won. Therefore, the rematch that we expected could not be realized. Now tomorrow, with the opportunity of the charity match,

Tomorrow (3rd) at 9:30 a.m., there will be a charity football match at the Racecourse Stadium, between the Friendship League and the Portuguese Business team. At a time when the football season has already passed, it is an unexpected treat for Shanghai fans to see the two strong teams meet.

We can find out that in this year's Division A league, the "League" and "Portuguese" teams are both in the top. The former is two draws and loses two points, and the latter is one loss and less two points. In the final game, it turned into an unpleasant breakup. Afterwards, the Football Association approved the rematch, with the consent of both teams, to have a big battle, which was indeed exciting and stimulating. Especially the Wu Qixiang and Qu Yongfu [Likely a typo] members and generals in the League team, also got the Football Association's resolution and were allowed to participate in the game. Because their [Likely a typo] is limited to symbolic competitions, this will make the fans more active. Therefore, tomorrow the Slope Road business will definitely be red [Likely a typo] men and women, making a fuss. Because of Xu Zhan's views.

With Wu Qixiang and Qu Yong's appearance [Likely a typo], the League naturally has an old lineup, which is quite powerful. Only Zhou [Name] Lin's [Likely a typo] Shanghai will be replaced by former captain Xu Wen [Likely a typo] kicking the left wing. A [Likely a name] is an all-rounder. In the past, he also tried this Yan [Likely a typo], and the results were quite good. So tomorrow's League will definitely be able to play without any mistakes. The group met with team manager Jiang Xili [Likely a typo]. According to him, this League does not have the ambition to beat the Portuguese Business team, but it is insured to have the most imaginable performance, because the team members are morale is high and they are very motivated. With such people coming, the League will not disappoint us.

According to news from the Portuguese Business side, they also attach great importance to this battle. Therefore, they borrowed Xu Erzi and Kelai Tuo, two great generals. In this way, the Portuguese team's lineup is more complete, and it can be called that the whole team is full of talented people. Although they [Likely a typo] wins. Otherwise, it is a bit uncomfortable to win the Division A championship.

Judging from the lineups of the two teams, the Portuguese Business team's offense is better than defense. The League team is the opposite, defense is better than offense. Therefore, I can't help but expect the League to use long [Likely a typo]. In other words, it should take offense from defense. Zheng Yingquan and [Name] Yongfu, the two midfielders, should not be too focused on assisting the attack. Gao Baozheng and Luo Shoufu should also return to the formation more. With seven guards as the main body, once there is an opportunity, they should use the court-style attack, because Gao Luo is assisted by guards, they will definitely fall behind, and naturally the M-type [Likely a tactic] is the best opportunity. In addition, the League should use Qu Yongfu and Wu Qixiang to specialize in the dangerous figures Fu En and V. Su Ruo. In this way, it may be difficult for the Portuguese Business team to get the ball! Therefore, under the tenet of keeping the League from losing the ball, it can find the opportunity to win the ball.

In short, this is a wonderful game. (Guest)

### The Course of the Shanghai Middle School Basketball Tournament for the China Youth Cup

The Shanghai Youth Association Sports Department's China Youth Basketball [Likely a typo] China Youth Cup All [Likely a typo] Boys and Girls Middle School Basketball League has ended. Now, the detailed course is described, and a systematic record is made for reference in the future.

It is noted that the league is divided into middle school, women's, and youth groups. The middle school group is divided into two divisions, China and Learning, due to the excessive number of participating teams. There are ten teams in China, including Nanheng, Jinmo, Huhuang, Chengyang, Fubu, Qingnian, Guanghua, Xuanyi, Zhongli, and Yan. There are nine teams in the Learning Division, including Qinyi, [Likely a typo] Wang, Hulang, Qingzhong, Heibai, Zhonggong, Hubai, Zhonghei, and Gubo. There are four teams in the youth group: Baofeng, Puxing, Yongfang, and Xindan [Likely a typo]. There are four teams in the women's group: Lianyi, Minli, Qin, and Dade. Since the opening on January 20th, it has lasted for four months. Every weekend, the fitness room on Baxianqiao is full of new youth atmosphere. Because the purpose of the league is to improve sports and cultivate new basketball talents, no tickets are charged, which is very popular. Therefore, students from various schools and people from all walks of life are very crowded to watch. The competition order is excellent, the team spirit is high, and there are very few disputes, which is a rare good phenomenon in the league. The champions of each group and middle school division have been produced one after another, and could have ended in mid-April. Because the China Youth Sports Department has to move the [Likely a typo] venue, the remaining middle school group finals were postponed to May 11th and held at the Pudong Middle School Stadium on Donghu Road. Qinyi [Likely a typo], the champion of the Learning Division, was originally the [Likely a typo], because the team used off-campus players to attend the game, and it was found out after investigation, so they were disqualified, and the [Likely a typo] Wang Team was promoted and competed with the China Division champion Nanmo Team on that day. Chen Sailin and Chen Songliang served as referees. For a time, the Pudong Middle School Stadium and the surrounding [Likely a typo] characters were full of fans. The cheerleading squads of the two schools came to cheer, and they were very enthusiastic. The war situation was always tense. In the first half, the [Likely a typo] Wang Team took the lead with 16 to 11. In the second half, the Nanmo Team quickly caught up and reversed the defeat, defeating the [Likely a typo] Wang Team with 36 to 28 and winning the overall championship of the middle school group. After the game, [Likely a typo] cadres Liang Zhaoan and invited league committee member Wang Shoufang, on behalf of the China Youth Basketball Tournament, delivered the closing speech Chen [Likely a typo] [Likely a typo] awarded the prizes. Rong [Likely a typo] Lianyi team won the women's group championship, and Kang donated a silver cup. The champion of the youth group was originally the Ke Xuan Team, because the team had another team member attending the two team games and was disqualified, so the [Likely a typo] Feng Team was promoted by loss, and won the silver cup donated by Zhang [Likely a typo]. Nanmo team, the champion of the middle school group, won the silver cup donated by Chen [Likely a typo]. At this point, the middle school basketball Blue gills [Likely a typo] announced the successful completion. The results of each group are listed below!
