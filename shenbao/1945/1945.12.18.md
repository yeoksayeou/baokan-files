### Chairman's Visit to North China Inspires, Military and Political Circles Actively Exert Themselves

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 17th] The Chairman's arrival in Peiping has deeply inspired the people of North China, leading to positive responses in both military and political spheres. During a lecture convened on the 14th at Huai Ren Hall with heads of various departments, the Chairman not only provided instructions regarding personnel and procedures for the takeover, but also expressed his strong disapproval of the city's appearance, stating that of his six visits to Peiping, his impression of the city's appearance was the worst this time. While this was undoubtedly due to damage caused during the Japanese occupation, a major reason was the failure of those who took over to implement the principles of the New Life Movement, focusing on tidiness and cleanliness, and to clean and reorganize accordingly. In his lecture, the Chairman instructed the vigorous implementation of the New Life Movement, starting with civil servants setting an example for the people. The Chairman's lecture has had a rapid impact in this regard. The Garrison Headquarters decided at the eighth public safety meeting the following day: (1) Military, political, party, and group organizations will jointly conduct regular cleaning campaigns, with each department responsible for supervising street cleaning for one day. (2) Bicycles, rickshaws, and pedicabs should be parked neatly and, when moving, should be lined up as much as possible to avoid congestion. (3) Sandbags inside the city gates should be tidied up by the troops, and unnecessary ones should be removed. (4) The closing time of the city gates will be extended. In the economic sphere, the Chairman was deeply saddened by the failure of the takeover personnel to coordinate and effectively utilize the economic institutions and production enterprises of the enemy and puppet regimes after the takeover, considering it the greatest shame after victory. In his lecture, he instructed the responsible personnel of each department to cooperate fully, quickly utilize resources, continue production, and correct the phenomenon of "takeover equals stagnation." After respectfully listening to the instructions, the relevant authorities immediately began actively planning for the resumption of various state-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned production enterprises. Furthermore, regarding the electricity supply in Peiping, due to the insufficient capacity of the Shihchingshan Power Plant, high-voltage lines from the Tangshan Power Plant were used for transmission. In recent months, due to a shortage of bituminous coal in Peiping, the high-voltage power lines from Tangshan were frequently damaged by bandits, leaving more than half of Peiping in darkness every night, causing great inconvenience to the citizens and particular hardship for the news media working at night. Since the Chairman's arrival in Peiping, although there are still areas with insufficient power at night, the entire city is lit, and there have been no power outages. According to sources from the relevant authorities, the power generation capacity of the Shihchingshan Power Plant has increased, and the high-voltage lines from Tangshan have fortunately been repaired. The citizens deeply feel that they owe this light to the Chairman. The students of Peiping hold the Chairman in high esteem, like children far from home longing for their kind father. Their enthusiastic emotions were fully expressed during the gathering and lecture in front of the Taihe Hall on the 16th. It is generally believed that the Chairman and his children have formed a long wall of love, which is no exaggeration. Today, street gossip revolves around how the Chairman lovingly comforted and embraced the surrounding students yesterday, and how the students tugged at his clothes and sleeves, vying to catch a glimpse of the Chairman's demeanor. This intense enthusiasm is believed to be unprecedented in any meeting between a head of state and young people, and cannot be described with words like "grand spectacle" or "unprecedented occasion."

[Associated Press, Peiping, 17th] People here have expressed surprise and admiration at Chairman Chiang and his wife's approachable behavior. People from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, including the press, are discussing this. The day after Chairman and Madame Chiang arrived in Peiping, they dined incognito at a Chinese restaurant, accompanied by only two officials. Although they were soon recognized by the waiters, they continued their meal. Afterward, they chatted briefly with the manager.

### North China People's Petitions to be Handled Within Two Weeks

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 17th] The Chiang Chairman's office announced that it would accept petitions from the people of North China regarding grievances. After the deadline on the 15th, all letters submitted by the people have been collected and sorted by the office. However, letters sent from distant places have continued to arrive late. It is reported that Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to this matter and specifically instructed the personnel in charge on the 17th that this matter must be handled quickly, accurately, carefully, and thoroughly. They must complete the sorting of all petitions as soon as possible, handle them according to their contents, and even if the full results cannot be obtained immediately, they must provide a proper response to each letter within two weeks to address the grievances.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] People here wept bitterly this afternoon while listening to the live broadcast of Chairman Chiang's lecture to students at the Taihe Hall in Peiping. Although the Chairman's words were not directed at them and did not mention the Northeast, the people of the Northeast, who had not heard the Chairman's voice and seen his face for fourteen years, were deeply moved by his solemn sincerity and passionate voice. The cheers from the broadcast also resonated with them.

### Madame Chiang in Peiping Watches the Latest American Dance

[United News Agency, Peiping, 16th] Madame Chiang Sung Mei-ling suddenly visited the American Red Cross Club this afternoon. A dance tune was playing on the phonograph at the time. Someone told Madame Chiang, "This is a very good American Jitterbug." Madame Chiang immediately replied, "I haven't seen that yet." Sergeant Giles, 21 years old, volunteered to perform in front of the distinguished guest, but finding a dance partner proved difficult. Eventually, Miss Han Minwei, 27 years old, who had served in Burma, was found and willing to give it a try. Madame Chiang's wish was fulfilled, and she was able to watch the latest American Jitterbug dance.

### Central Training Corps to Move to Nanking, Planned Reorganization Under the Examination Yuan, Demobilized Officers to be Transferred for Training in Batches

[This Newspaper, Chungking, 16th] The Central Training Corps is currently planned to be incorporated into the regular administrative system, reorganized under the Examination Yuan, and placed alongside the Examination Committee and the Ministry of Personnel. Since its establishment, over 20,000 people have received training at the corps. It is now in the process of moving to Nanking along with the government. The new location has been selected at the former site of the Training Headquarters outside the Zhongshan Gate in Nanking's Xiaolingwei, which is very extensive. Its organization may be more than three times its current size. More than 300,000 demobilized officers from the military will be transferred to the corps for short-term training in batches, and then assigned to substantive positions based on their skills, interests, and needs to strengthen the military's cadre in various departments.

### Amphibious Glider Successfully Test Flown in China

[Central News Agency, Chungking, 17th] Chen Chih-hsuan, an instructor at the China Gliding Association, recently modified an intermediate glider into an amphibious glider. At 3:00 p.m. on the 17th, it successfully completed its test flight over Fuhsingkuan and safely landed on the surface of the Coral Dam River. This is the first amphibious glider in China.

### Chairman Chiang's Address to Rescued Comrades from the Stationed American Troops in Peiping

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 16th] After inspecting the U.S. Marine Corps in Peiping on the 16th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went to the U.S. military radio station to deliver an address to the American officers and soldiers, which was broadcast by the station to various parts of North China and the United States. The full text of the address is recorded below: "General Rockey, General Jones, officers and soldiers of the 5th and 11th Regiments of the U.S. Marine Corps, and the 12th and 24th Groups of the Air Force. Today, I, as the Chairman, on behalf of the military and civilians of China, extend our warm and loving congratulations to the military and civilians of our ally, the United States. I am very pleased and honored to be able to meet with the officers and soldiers of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force today. The officers and soldiers of the 5th Regiment of the 1st Division of the U.S. Army participated in the First World War and have glorious combat records. During the Second World War, they demonstrated the bravery of all officers and soldiers. You fought continuously and arduously against the enemy in the Pacific, landing from Guadalcanal and New Britain to Okinawa, attacking the heart of the enemy, and inflicting a fatal blow to the enemy. The 12th and 24th Groups of the Air Force participated in the liberation of the Philippines and later assisted the Army in landing on Okinawa, achieving brilliant results. Today, after the enemy's unconditional surrender, your army first arrived in Peiping in early October this year, enabling our national army to accept the surrender of the enemy army as scheduled and actively handle the repatriation of enemy military and civilians. Today, I am personally inspecting our allied forces, especially the solemn and well-trained U.S. Marine Corps, and I am truly comforted as if seeing our compatriots who share life and death. During this war, thanks to the joint efforts of all Allied nations, we were finally able to completely destroy our most stubborn enemy and restore world peace and order. Recalling this precious history, we can be sure that as long as all Allied nations can cooperate to the end, we can permanently maintain world peace and promote the welfare of all mankind. In particular, our two countries, China and the United States, have a traditional friendly relationship. As a result of sharing blood during this war of resistance, a friendship that cannot be separated has been forged. I believe that in the future international community, we will be able to love and trust each other, help each other, and share our responsibility to safeguard world peace. Mr. Truman, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of your country, is committed to promoting cooperation between our two countries. I wish him good health and great success. Now that Christmas is approaching, we are all preparing to piously cherish the Christmas festival of the Lord of Peace, and I wish all officers and soldiers a Merry Christmas." When Chairman Chiang and his wife left the parade ground after inspecting the U.S. military, the onlookers outside the field applauded enthusiastically and shouted "Long Live the Chairman" to express their respect. After the military parade, General Rockey and General Walton hosted a banquet to entertain Chairman Chiang and his wife, and invited Director Li and others to accompany them. After the banquet, Chairman Chiang returned to the office. Madame Chiang visited the women's service team of the American Red Cross this afternoon, demonstrating a strong spirit of Sino-American cooperation. The U.S. officers and soldiers who were inspected were greatly honored and excited by Chairman Chiang's personal visit for the award ceremony and inspection.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 16th] President Chiang Kai-shek summoned 146 male and female party members and league members who had been arrested, escaped, and remained in Peiping during the occupation period in North China and Northeast China at the Juiren Hall at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the 15th. The President was unable to extend his condolences one by one as he had to attend a reception tea party at 4:00 p.m., so he gave a brief speech after taking roll call. He essentially said, "Comrades, you have fought arduously against the enemy and puppets for the party and the country for more than ten years in North China and Northeast China, experiencing life and death and overcoming difficulties. I am truly delighted to see you today. The Founding Father Sun Yat-sen said: 'Revolutionary party members should be nameless heroes.' Comrades, you have taken risks and overcome difficulties in these more than ten years, and your contributions to the party and the country are great, but you have no fame or high position. This spirit of fulfilling obligations without seeking power is the only key to the success of our revolutionary party. If a revolutionary party does not have a number of key members who advocate for their comrades and compatriots with loyalty and integrity, it will not fail. The reason why our party is able to be where it is today and why the War of Resistance ultimately led to victory is due to the successive efforts, sacrifices, and struggles of you comrades. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, I hope that you comrades will continue to uphold the spirit of the past, be the first to worry about the troubles of the world and the last to enjoy its pleasures, serve our compatriots, be loyal to the party and the country, to achieve our goal of realizing the Three Principles of the People. I would now like to offer a sincere prayer for the deceased comrades and offer sincere congratulations to the rescued comrades, and wish success to the future of the revolution." When the President gave his speech, his words were earnest, like a father or elder brother speaking to his children, and the male and female comrades were moved to tears.

[This Newspaper News] A San Francisco broadcast on the 17th stated: General Marshall arrived in Honolulu today and continued his journey to China on the same day. When General Marshall arrived in Honolulu, he received a telegram from President Truman. In the telegram, President Truman expressed his deep hope that General Marshall would do everything possible to complete this great historical mission.

[United News Agency, Honolulu, 16th] General Marshall, the new U.S. Ambassador to China, arrived at the Hickam Air Force Base here today by plane en route to Chongqing. He was accompanied by his secretary, Herrick. Marshall told reporters: "Other than the weather being very good, there is nothing else to say."

### Marshall Arrives in Honolulu, Truman's Declaration Receives Positive Response from All Parties

[This Newspaper News] A San Francisco broadcast on the 17th stated: After U.S. President Truman clarified his policy toward China, the U.S. State Department expressed its support, and the response from the Chinese side was also positive. A spokesman for the Chinese government declared: "The Central Government fully agrees with the policies clarified by President Truman. Establishing a democratic and united new China is the long-cherished wish of the Chinese government."

[Associated Press, Peiping, 17th] People close to Chairman Chiang here and people from all walks of life in China have praised President Truman's statement on China policy with the highest regard. All believe that this statement can strengthen Chairman Chiang's position in the KMT-CPC negotiations.

People close to Chairman Chiang explained President Truman's reference to a "one-party government" by saying: "The leaders of the Kuomintang are aware that the current government is not democratic in its structure, but it is only a transitional 'preparatory government.' They emphasize that although it has been repeatedly postponed, this long-awaited National Assembly will finally be convened in May to formulate a constitutional government."

Various circles in the Kuomintang unanimously condemned the Communist Party for obstructing China's unity, claiming that the Political Consultative Conference had been postponed twice due to the failure of the Yan'an side to send representatives to Chongqing.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Since President Truman's statement on China policy was issued, the reaction from Congress has been one of agreement. They all believe that this statement has clarified the U.S. policy toward China and hope that Marshal Marshall will be able to successfully complete his mission to China with this statement and the detailed instructions he has received.

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] President Truman's statement, which is clearly intended to allow the American people to have an informed understanding, will be generally supported, but it may not satisfy left-wing elements in the United States who demand a policy of "non-interference in China." Those who are particularly opposed are the President's reasons for keeping the U.S. Marine Corps in North China. Opposition from left-wing elements to the President's statement will further clarify the general misunderstandings about U.S. policy toward China.

### The Political Consultative Conference Will Convene Soon, Military Issues to be Thoroughly Discussed

[This Newspaper News] A San Francisco broadcast on the 17th stated: After arriving in Chongqing, representatives of the Chinese Communist Party visited representatives of the Chinese government today to exchange views.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] The Political Consultative Conference is likely to be held on Christmas. The political and military situation in the past 72 hours has clearly turned in favor of the Central Government. The remarks of Propaganda Minister Wu Kuo-chen represent the optimistic mood of various circles in the government regarding the prospect of ending the civil war. He said: "After Chairman Chiang returns to Chongqing from Peiping, the Political Consultative Conference will be held." It is widely believed that Marshal Marshall, who is scheduled to take office on the 20th, may arrive in time to witness the opening of this historic conference.

[Mass Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Propaganda Minister Wu Kuo-chen stated that the government is planning to organize a coalition government so that the Communist Party can participate in the cabinet and be appointed to other senior official positions. Wu pointed out that on September 2 of this year, Chairman Chiang told Mao Tse-tung that if the KMT and CPC could abandon political prejudices and reach an agreement, the Supreme National Defense Council could be reorganized into the National Supreme Political Conference so that the Communist Party could participate in the government on a broad democratic basis.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] The arrival of General Ye Jianying, Chief of Staff of the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army, in Chongqing to participate in the Political Consultative Conference has greatly excited the Chinese political community, believing that the prospect of achieving comprehensive peace in China is brighter than at any time since Japan's surrender. A government spokesman also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party included seven representatives and thirty-five staff members, and believed that General Ye Jianying's personal attendance would enable a more thorough discussion of military issues between the two sides. A Communist Party spokesman declared: "We hope to cease fighting before and during the Political Consultative Conference so that we can negotiate everything, because what China needs is peace, unity, and unification."

[United News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] The Chinese Communist Party's program will be submitted for review at this Political Consultative Conference, but it has not actually deviated from the policies repeatedly announced by CCP Chairman Mao Zedong. It is reported that the Communist Party has brought a draft of a new constitution to Chongqing, advocating the immediate establishment of a provisional coalition government.

[United News Agency, Yan'an, 16th] Four Communist Party representatives to the Political Consultative Conference flew to Chongqing today. Mao Zedong and Zhu De sent them off, and Mao expressed his warm expectations. The seven Communist Party representatives are headed by Zhou Enlai, with Liao Chengzhi as the seventh member. Zhou Enlai said before leaving that he was full of "hope" for the Political Consultative Conference and felt that there was no other way to solve China's problems other than through peaceful negotiations. He considered Truman's declaration to be "good and welcomed it."

### National Army Recaptures Sa County, Communist Army in Sui-Bao Concentrates Along Peiping-Suiyuan Railway

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 17th] The Communist army has abandoned the siege of Suiyuan and Baotou and is retreating to the eastern part of Suiyuan Province.

[Central News Agency, Kweisui, 16th] The Communist army besieging Suiyuan and Baotou is now concentrating along the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway. Those in Baotou are concentrating in Chasuqi and Bikeqi, ninety and sixty li west of Kweisui. At 3:00 p.m. on the 15th, the National Army had recaptured Sa County. Those in the suburbs of Kweisui have also been moving eastward for several days, concentrating around the Qixiaying Station on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, ninety li from Kweisui. The rails and sleepers between Baitasi, the first station east of Kweisui, and Qixiaying have been almost completely dismantled and burned by the Communist army.

### General Commander Ho and Others Awarded the Loyal Service Medal

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 17th] For the National Day merit awards this year, the Army Headquarters, on the order of the National Government, awarded the Loyal Service Medal to General Commander Ho Ying-chin and nineteen others. The award ceremony was held at the headquarters on the morning of the 17th. Ho represented the Chairman in awarding the medals, and personally pinned the medals on the left front breast of each recipient amidst the sounds of military music, and delivered a speech. Those who were awarded medals today included Chief of Staff Xiao Yisu, Deputy Chief of Staff Leng Hsin, Cai Wenzhi, Section Chief Xu Wuyan, Niu Xianming, Xu Xilin, Liu Lianyi, Commanders Ma Chongliu, Liu Yongkun, Peng Mengji, and Political Department Director Li Weiguo, totaling eleven officers. The remaining seven officers are not currently in Nanking and will be awarded the medals separately.

### Yunnan Associated University and Other Schools Still Not Resuming Classes Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 17th] The authorities of Yunnan Associated University, Yunnan University, the British-Chinese Specialized School, and the Chinese-French University had made various preparations for the resumption of classes this morning and had earnestly persuaded the students. This morning, each school rang the bell for classes on time, and the professors went to the classrooms to teach on time. In the morning, students went to class in groups of three or five, but in the afternoon, the strike committee convened a meeting of students to oppose the resumption of classes, resulting in no one attending classes. Currently, the faculty and staff of each school are holding meetings to discuss how to deal with this new development.

### National Government Order

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] The National Government ordered on the 17th that Wei Daoming be specially appointed as the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Republic of China to sign the International Monetary Fund Agreement and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Agreement.

### Foreign Minister Wang Hosts Banquet for Petrov; Airlift of National Army to Commence Soon; Heavy Snow in Changchun, Temperature -14 Degrees Celsius

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and his wife will host a banquet for Soviet Ambassador Petrov and his wife at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 7 p.m. on the 18th. Also invited are Counselor of the Soviet Embassy, Mr. and Mrs. Miklasevsky; First Secretary, Mr. and Mrs. Fedelin; Military Attaché, Major General Roschin; Deputy Trade Representative, Mr. and Mrs. Sleyev; Third Secretary, Mr. and Mrs. Kapicha; and from our side, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao; Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Wang Chonghui; Secretary-General Shao Lizi; Vice Minister Gan Naiguang; Vice Minister Liu Cuo; Director Bu Daoming; and their respective wives.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] There was heavy snow here on the night of the 15th, which continued until the morning of the 16th. It gradually cleared in the afternoon, and the setting sun shone, creating a silvery scene. According to veteran farmers, this year's snow is less and later than usual. In the past, large flakes of snow would fall in early October. However, this does not have any adverse impact on crops. It is noted that this is the fourth snowfall in Changchun since the start of winter, the first snowfall being in early November, but in very small amounts.

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 17th (Broadcast) The Chinese government spokesperson stated that regarding the issue of the Chinese army taking over the Northeast, the Chinese and Soviet governments have now decided on the exact steps to be taken.

[United Press, Beiping, 17th] According to informed American sources today, the U.S. Army Air Forces Command will order U.S. pilots to transport the National Army to Shenyang and Harbin. This airlift will be carried out by U.S. C-54 four-engine transport aircraft, each capable of carrying 50 or more fully equipped infantrymen, and will begin within two weeks. This matter has been negotiated and finalized between China and the Soviet Union in Changchun. Now, we are waiting for the Shenyang and Harbin airfields to be prepared in advance. Currently, the task of airlift will be undertaken by the Chinese Air Force and China National Aviation Corporation transport planes, but it is feared that the number of aircrafts will be insufficient. Three days ago, Changchun had heavy snow, and the temperature has dropped to fourteen degrees below zero, so, despite the harsh winter, every effort should be made to complete the airlift of the main force of the National Army as soon as possible to avoid being hampered by the cold winter.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] Director Chen Liang, who arrived in Changchun yesterday, will fly to Jinzhou tomorrow morning to continue discussing the issue of National Army supplies with Director Du. Chen told reporters that this trip to Changchun was to exchange views with the Provisional Headquarters on the same issue. Chen met with Chairman Zhang of the Provisional Headquarters Economic Commission on the evening of his arrival and will meet again today. Regarding the supply of the National Army in the Northeast in the future, including food, clothing, medicine, etc., the central government has determined the principle that the government will bear all the costs. This type of supply, especially the daily necessities of officers and soldiers, will all be issued in "precious goods" to avoid the impact of local price fluctuations and to avoid stimulating prices by competing for local purchases. However, if the local authorities can purchase them on behalf of the military and hand them over to the military supply authorities for unified distribution, it would also be a reasonable approach. The clothing required for the National Army currently arriving and preparing to arrive in the north has been prepared for winter, and will be increased or decreased depending on the climate of the station. It is reported that each officer and soldier will be issued one cotton blanket, one or two military blankets, a complete set of winter military uniforms, overcoats, shoes, socks, and leather hats. Units that are to be airlifted to Changchun are already completely equipped. As for the salaries and food allowances of officers and soldiers, reasonable regulations will be made according to the local price index, with the overall goal of ensuring that officers and soldiers are well-fed and clothed, with a surplus. Once the currency system issue is resolved, this issue can be stabilized accordingly.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Administrative personnel from the nine provinces and two municipalities of the Northeast, as well as personnel from central government agencies responsible for the Northeast takeover, are successively flying to Beiping and then to Changchun, and it is expected that all personnel will be transported by the 20th. The Preparatory Office of the Northeast Provisional Headquarters, originally scheduled to move to Beiping on the 17th, has been postponed due to the impact of the weather on flights in recent days, and will depart after the takeover personnel have all arrived.

I Come from Guangzhou - Talking About Food, Clothing, Housing, Transportation, Population, Schools, Newspapers by Zheng Yulang

When the China National Aviation Corporation plane rose two or three thousand feet from the Dahe Airport, overlooking the panoramic view of Guangzhou, one could see the densely packed roofs of this Pearl River delta, with the twelve-story "Aiqun Hotel," the central landmark of the city of Five Rams, towering on the Xiti. The Pearl River Iron Bridge, like a giant dragon, spanned the river, connecting transportation between the north and south banks; the red walls and green tiles, ancient and elegant, of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall inspired awe; the Yuexiu and Baiyun Mountains, even in the depths of winter, could not diminish their greenness, standing tall and overlooking the Pearl River.

Having returned south from Chongqing, and having lived in Guangzhou for more than a month, I had not felt Guangzhou to be particularly lovable. Once in the air, however, overlooking this beautiful landscape, I suddenly felt a sense of reluctance. Perhaps it was because I had not long returned to my hometown of Baiyun, and I was about to depart again. Like lovers who had been separated for a long time and had not yet finished catching up, I was about to embark on a journey again. At that time, I really hated that the plane was flying so fast.

As the plane flew deep into the Baiyun Mountains, I looked down again, but the Cloud Mountains and Pearl River were no longer visible. I was thinking: the landscape is extremely beautiful, but as the largest city in South China, urban construction still needs to put in a lot of effort, taking advantage of this opportunity of the re-establishment of Guangdong.

Speaking of post-war construction, in addition to modern large buildings, roads, and transportation, the urgent task is to first restore the vitality of the city - the vitality of the people's lives and production. Many chimneys in Guangzhou are emitting thick smoke, but unfortunately, most of these are the chimneys of large restaurants. The chimneys of many large and small factories have not yet been seen. Since the official surrender of the Japanese army in South China on September 20th, the number of people returning from northern Guangdong, eastern Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi is increasing day by day. The demand for jobs is becoming increasingly urgent. Currently, labor compensation is still acceptable, and the situation of the working class is not too bad. The ones suffering are the skilled workers and middle-level clerical staff. Their employment problem needs to be resolved urgently. According to statistics from relevant authorities, the number of unemployed has reached 30,000 to 40,000. The Machine Workers' Union says that most of the skilled workers who returned after the recovery still do not have jobs. They were all major contributors during the construction period!

There are about 10,000 Cantonese personnel and skilled workers serving in American military agencies in Guiyang, and about 50,000 including their families. Now that the American military agencies have been dismissed, they all have to go home, and their lives will depend on finding employment. This is a major hidden worry behind Guangzhou's bustling appearance. People in central Guangdong are eagerly hoping that the authorities will promote post-war construction and support production to increase people's employment opportunities, and also hope that Cantonese people overseas and in other provinces will invest more.

The population of Guangzhou has increased to over one million, creating a new situation. Merchants from all over are gathering, seeking jobs and doing business, and all have to stay. This has created a golden age for hotels and tea houses. Because hotels are subject to price limits by the Social Bureau, rents are not too expensive, about three-quarters lower than in Shanghai. However, it is still difficult to find a room. For large hotels like the Aiqun, Xin Ya, and White House, you can only get a place to stay by finding a resident you know who is about to leave and "taking over" their room.

"Eating in Guangzhou" is still an undeniable fact. The food is not only good, but also plentiful. There are two types of "plenty": one is that there are many restaurants, exaggerating a bit, on average, one out of every five stores sells food. The second is that there are many varieties. Just the dim sum alone encompasses ancient and modern times, connects Chinese and Western, and harmonizes North and South. "When the autumn wind rises, the snakes become fat." Snake soup is currently the most seasonal delicacy, and many Allied soldiers come from afar to taste it.

The high cost of goods is unimaginable to people far away. The price of rice was 2,200 yuan per dan in September, rising to 5,300 yuan in October, 6,000 yuan in November, and now it is already 8,000 yuan. Daily necessities, foreign goods, and clothing have all risen dramatically. Many people who returned to Guangzhou from Chongqing or Kunming sold all their clothes, hoping to buy new and cheaper ones in Guangzhou, but ended up suffering a great loss. Guangzhou's prices seem to be second only to Kunming. Some say that in the early stages, because counterfeit currency was banned, merchants raised prices to compensate for their losses; later, the circulation of large-denomination red customs gold stimulated prices. Recently, the high exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars has also been a new stimulus.

In terms of transportation, the Guangzhou-Kowloon through train has been running smoothly since it started running on October 16th, but because the locomotives are old, the roadbed is newly built, and the sleepers are damaged, it still takes more than eight hours to arrive on time. Long-distance buses within the city have resumed and are doing well. Water transportation is mostly motorized sailboats and wooden boats. Since the sinking of the "Haizhu" ship on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong line due to a mine, with more than 2,000 deaths, and the explosion and sinking of the "Changming" ship on the Guangzhou-Macau line, with more than 80 deaths, everyone is wary and mostly abandons the sea for land. People are sleeping at the train station waiting to buy early morning tickets. Regarding ships, public opinion believes that the maritime authorities should implement more stringent inspections.

Guangfu Road in Guangzhou is "Wangping Street in Guangzhou." Daguang, Zhongshan, Jianguo, Zhongzheng, and Qianfeng, several newspaper offices are all located there. In the early days of Guangzhou's recovery, there were more than twenty daily evening newspapers, but more than ten were ordered to cease publication by the authorities because they had not obtained registration. Now, in addition to the aforementioned newspapers, there are also Southwest, Yuehua, Seventy-Two Trades Business News, and Qianfeng Evening News. The supply of foreign newspapers has been cut off, and everyone uses local newsprint and flatbed printing presses. Because printing paper is expensive, and the authorities do not allow publication before registration is approved, few magazines are published, and there is a severe shortage of books.

The Lingnan, Guomin, and Guangzhou Universities have all resumed classes. Chungshan University is awaiting the appointment of the new president, Wang Ligong, and has not yet officially resumed classes. Many middle schools have resumed classes, and forty-two municipal primary schools have resumed classes. However, the supply and demand are still far apart, and many young people are still unable to attend school!

Housing is as difficult as in other recovered cities. Because labor and material costs are high, very few houses are being rebuilt. With the large number of returning people, landlords are taking the opportunity to make a fortune, creating various fees such as "shoe money," "hairdressing fees," and "advance rent." Renting a room requires paying a large sum of money upfront. Despite the difficulty in finding housing, those who are returning will eventually return, and everyone wants to go back and see their hometown that they have been separated from for five or six years.

### Soviet Union Announces Establishment of Independent New Government in Azerbaijan Province of Iran

Washington Believes it Violates UN Principles

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th (United Press)] Washington sources believe that Moscow's announcement of the establishment of a "National Government" in the Azerbaijan province of Iran presents Belnas and Bevin with a fait accompli. It is believed that Belnas will oppose this matter because it undermines the sovereignty of Iran and violates the principles of the United Nations.

[USIS, Tehran, 16th] An Iranian government spokesman announced today that the garrison in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan province, has surrendered to the rebels. It also stated that the city of Ruoyeh, 75 miles southwest of Tabriz, has also surrendered to the rebels. TASS News Agency reported that Azerbaijan Province has automatically established a National Government, and the first congress of the province's parliament has elected Shivali as the Premier of the Cabinet. The Provincial People's Congress has requested the establishment of an autonomous government under the Iranian central government. However, TASS did not specify the relationship between the new government in the area and the Iranian central government.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Shortly before the meeting of the three foreign ministers yesterday, Moscow Radio read a telegram from Tabriz, stating that the Azerbaijan Democratic Army had occupied 40 more towns in the province. This agency's correspondent in Moscow said that the Iranian event is undoubtedly one of the main items on the agenda of the Three Powers Conference. Foreign Minister Bevin had a long private conversation with the British Ambassador to Iran, Puratt, before the meeting, saying that it was to discuss possible developments after the establishment of the Azerbaijan "National Government." Moscow Radio broadcasted again last night that the new Azerbaijan parliament had proposed a plan to "establish and consolidate the natural autonomous life of Azerbaijan under the principle of not damaging the national integrity of Iran."

[Reuters, Tehran, 17th] After the fall of Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan province, the city of Lancherai, 75 miles northwest of the province, has also been besieged by 3,000 members of the Kochik tribe, the Kurdish tribe, and the Democratic Party. At the same time, the Iranian government has instructed the defense forces in various parts of Azerbaijan province to resist as much as possible, otherwise they can destroy their weapons, surrender, or return to Tehran. It is heard that after the Tabriz defense forces surrendered to the Democratic Party, their officers have set out to Tehran.

Azerbaijan Government Issues Policy Plan

[Reuters, London, 17th] Moscow Radio broadcasted last night that the new Azerbaijan parliament, calling itself the National Government, decided, based on the will of the people to establish autonomy to end the people's suffering, that it should announce to the world the existence of the Azerbaijan National Government, which will develop autonomous life under the principle of not harming the national integrity of Iran, obtain national life based on the principle of national self-determination, and establish administrative institutions that conform to public opinion. On the one hand, it will eliminate those responsible for the people's suffering. Autonomous Azerbaijan still recognizes the authority of the central government in Tehran. However, it will also take all necessary measures that do not violate the principle of autonomy. For the sake of protecting autonomy, there will be a militia organization, compulsory free education will be promoted, and the use of the Azerbaijani language will be announced. As much attention as possible will be paid to the development of national industries. In order to eliminate the gradually expanding state of unemployment, it will confiscate the land of reactionary landlords and redistribute it fairly. Farmers account for the majority of the population of Azerbaijan, so they should be allowed to purchase land from landlords willing to sell land, paying a reasonable price. In order to facilitate farmers' purchase of land, farmers' loans will be handled by the Farmers' Bank. In addition, in order to help the unemployed masses, an unemployment relief law should be drafted and a social insurance system should be created. The Azerbaijan National Government should respect the freedom of belief of all citizens and make all residents enjoy equal rights and bear equal obligations. The National Government respects private property in all industries, and should provide assistance to private enterprises that improve the national status and raise the standard of living.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Moscow Radio broadcasted this morning that the rights and special interests of foreign governments in Iranian Azerbaijan should be fully respected.

Soviet Union Hopes to Negotiate with Iran; US Troops to Withdraw Within a Week

[Reuters, Tehran, 17th] The New York Times correspondent reported that as Iranian left-wing newspapers continue to call for direct Iranian-Soviet negotiations, rumors have emerged that the Soviet government is willing to make some concessions to a more docile Iranian government. It is said that the Soviet government is willing to make the Azerbaijan incident an event between the two countries. However, because the Iranian government has repeatedly stated that it intends to seek international resolution based on the declarations of other countries guaranteeing Iranian sovereignty, this Soviet wish cannot be realized. Recently, five senior Iranian politicians have been appointed by the government to form a committee to study countermeasures for the Iranian northern issue. Former Iranian Prime Ministers Gavan and Mansur are also two of the five. This committee may be regarded by the Soviet Union as a pro-Soviet group, and Gavan invited American financial expert Dr. Mills Bohr to Iran in 1942, so the United States also has a good impression of him. US troops near Tehran may withdraw within a week, leaving only Major General Xuvalskov's military police and the military mission led by Witlai. In addition, the only non-military Americans remaining in Tehran are Dr. Mills Bohr's second financial mission and the American advisors employed by the Iranian Ministry of Agriculture. The poverty of Iran requires the assistance of such foreign experts. The more knowledgeable people in Iran believe that Iran should have a stable, realistic, and popular government. However, they all oppose foreign interference and believe that this government cannot be established as long as foreign forces remain. The current government of Iran can only represent the ruling class, which accounts for less than 2% of the total population, and the various departments of the government are mostly overstaffed. Although the number of employees is large, the salaries are low, and there are many civil servants who hold multiple jobs. Tax evasion and corruption are also rampant.

### Organ of the Communist Party in Moscow Criticizes British and American Policies, Says Democracy is Not a Monopoly

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] The magazine "Bolshevik," an organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, criticized Britain's policies in Egypt, India, and other colonies, as well as the imperialist methods of American capitalists, stating: Colonial policies are sufficient to endanger world peace, and the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the distribution of trusteeship territories. The Soviet Union should enable these territories to establish regimes that are sufficient to help dependent nations achieve genuine liberation. The banner of democracy has been erected on the ruins of fascism, but democracy is not the monopoly of a few selected nations. The people of the colonies should also have the right to self-government and self-determination. The magazine "Bolshevik" continued: British policy has repeatedly made promises to India, but today the Indian people still have no political rights, and the Indian government has in fact remained unchanged. Only 14% of the population nationwide has the right to vote. The situation in other British colonies is no better. For example, Sudan and Egypt, British control over Sudan is no different from controlling Egypt. As for the United States, the driving force behind the policy of powerful figures in promoting colonial policy does not focus on the political division of the world, but mainly on occupying a dominant economic position in order to eliminate competition from others. British capitalists have erected various trade barriers in their colonies to prevent other countries from sharing the benefits. The Soviet government has always had effective experience in solving national problems democratically. Therefore, unless the Soviet Union closely participates in the establishment of an international trusteeship regime, the trusteeship system cannot gain a progressive foundation. Otherwise, the trusteeship system will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations, and the colonial nations will hardly be expected to achieve final independence.

### British-Siamese Peace Treaty Negotiations

[Reuters, London, 17th] Britain and Siam are conducting peace negotiations in Singapore. Although details have not been obtained, it is known that the conditions proposed by the British side are not harsh. The British side requires Siam to cooperate in dealing with the Japanese in Siam and restore British rights and interests in Siam, as well as the rights and interests of neighboring lands under British control. At the same time, Siam is also required to bear part of the responsibility for maintaining security and restoring the economy in Southeast Asia. According to Dan Ning, a political advisor to the Southeast Asia Headquarters, the British government could have drafted a peace treaty and forced Siam to accept it, but the British government did not do so, nor did it send troops to disarm the Japanese army, nor did it forcibly establish a military government in Siam. The Siamese government continues to exercise its powers. The British government has also restored various conveniences to the Siamese King, who is currently in Switzerland, to enable him to return to his country. It is noted that Dan Ning represents the British side in this negotiation, and the leader of the delegation from the other side is Mr. Cai Yangte.

### Commander of US Forces in Korea Issues Proclamation

[United Press, Seoul, 16th] Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US Army in Korea, announced today that any party, whether openly or secretly, attempting to exercise power in Korea will be severely punished. This statement is intended to declare that the United Nations military government is the sole government in Korea today, dealing a major blow to the "Korean People's Republic" and its affiliated troops or personnel.

### American Post-War Industry and Commerce Face a Great Opportunity, Recession Can Be Avoided, Enter

An Era of Perpetual Prosperity

[United Press, New York, 16th] The National Association of Manufacturers recently held its annual meeting here, celebrating its 50th anniversary. Chairman Mr. Ma Xiao delivered a speech stating that American industry and commerce face a great opportunity to lead the nation into an era of perpetual prosperity. The immediate priority is to increase production. To achieve this, private investment must be encouraged, with government cooperation. Both the business community and the government must provide the public with reasons to feel secure, to no longer fear the spread of recession, then perpetual prosperity can be expected. With increased production, everyone in America will have work, wages will be higher, and the people's standard of living can increase endlessly.

Freedom of economic and political choice has always been a fundamental right of every American citizen and must continue unchanged. America has abundant resources, raw materials, manpower, production capacity, and management technology. Increasing production and reducing unemployment are possible, and the first step is to ensure that private capital flows into productive enterprises that need workers. To encourage investment, the following three steps should be taken:

(1) The policies implemented by the government should not make potential investors hesitant; (2) The tax methods should still allow savers to accumulate wealth; (3) The labor policies adopted should not make labor costs too high, resulting in little surplus in business income and no profit for investors.

The domestic tax system should be re-examined. The collection of individual income tax should not discourage the ambition to work hard and improve. Capital gains taxes, which hinder production, should be abolished. Corporate business taxes should be reduced to a level that does not discourage investment, and excessive taxation of corporate income should also be abolished.

In the past five years, very little private capital has been invested in American industry and commerce. If private capital is ultimately excluded, the economic and political system of the United States will inevitably collapse. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to ensure the flow of private capital into enterprises that employ labor.

In recent years, there has been a policy that also affects the country, namely, special privileges. This policy, whether beneficial to one party or another, ultimately creates turbulent pressure and social dissatisfaction, which is detrimental to the American economic and political system. Therefore, we must eliminate it. One privilege is tariffs, which are often only beneficial to a small number of people while harming the entire country and can be used to reduce production, competition, and employment.

If the United States wants to achieve extreme prosperity, it must not use tariffs to protect or improve the economic position of a certain manufacturer or manufacturing group, but must actively use tariffs to develop and strengthen the basic production capacity of the country. Tariffs should be gradually reduced so that production and consumption can be increased to the greatest extent in a free competitive situation in the United States. However, the rate of reduction should be based on the welfare of the public to avoid sudden impacts on domestic trade and worker employment in the United States. Another privilege involves labor. At the recent management and labor conference held in Washington, management made some very reasonable suggestions, but labor firmly insisted on maintaining the status quo and rejected them all. American labor is unwilling to accept a position of equality with management in terms of law or responsibility, is unwilling to give up the right to strike during negotiations, or to provide any guarantee to capital, labor, or the public in the event of a dispute. They are not "abusers of labor," and anything that harms the basic rights of labor should be vigorously opposed. However, it is felt that today's labor problems should be resolved through legislation.

### Judge of Kyoto District Court Dismissed

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] Ishihara, a judge of the Kyoto District Court, was recently dismissed for improperly handling the Kondo case. Kondo was an army captain who was arrested by the American army for carrying seven hand grenades, a sword, and a pistol. Ishihara sentenced Kondo to a fine of 200 yen, but according to current military law, Kondo should have been sentenced to 15 months of imprisonment. The Allied Headquarters has also instructed the Japanese authorities not to grant Kondo any government position again.

### Konoe's Suicide Affects Japanese Politics, Will Lead to Hirohito's Abdication, Completely Eliminating Inner Court Officials Feels Lost and Helpless, Asahi Shimbun Recalls Old Events to Exonerate Konoe

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] In his urgent suicide note, Konoe has already confirmed that he made major mistakes in the Sino-Japanese War. It is generally believed that this suicide is to take responsibility for the mistakes. Konoe said in the suicide note to his second son, Michitake, "This letter can explain the attitude I have taken in the past few years." The first half of the suicide note said, "Since the outbreak of the China Incident, I have made some mistakes, and I am now very clear about these mistakes."

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] Konoe's suicide is a major blow to the prestige and position of Emperor Hirohito. It is generally believed that this will have a major impact on the Japanese imperial family and political circles. Konoe himself expressed concern about the future of the imperial family in his last few hours. This may be a new sign of Hirohito's abdication. Some Japanese believe that Konoe's suicide may be the final factor that promotes the abdication of the Emperor. Hirohito has been deeply moved, without a doubt. Konoe has long been a close aide of the Emperor. The sudden news of his death is as severe as MacArthur's order to the Japanese government to no longer support Shintoism financially. The war criminals repeatedly wanted by MacArthur have almost completely eliminated those around the Emperor, leaving only two close officials who have entered the inner court for fifteen years. The imprisonment of Prince Nashimoto and the inner court are already in a state of emergency. Konoe's death has made Hirohito feel even more lost and helpless.

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] Asahi Shimbun published the resignation letter of former Prime Minister Konoe to the Emperor on October 16, 1941, stating that Army Minister General Tojo did not allow the withdrawal of troops from China, for fear of affecting morale. (At that time, Japan and the United States were negotiating in Washington, with the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China as a prerequisite for establishing an agreement.) According to Tojo, if Japan made concessions to the United States, the United States would become more arrogant and boastful without end. Although the China Incident could be temporarily resolved, the relationship between China and Japan would break down again in two or three years. Now both sides have weaknesses domestically, so it is advisable not to miss the opportunity to choose a date to launch the Pacific War. Konoe also said that he had met with Tojo four times and knew that he could not change his views, and felt that he could not live up to the Emperor's trust, so he submitted his resignation. Later, Konoe's resignation was approved and Tojo immediately succeeded him. The resignation letter also said that if the Japanese army withdrew from China, there was still a possibility of negotiating with the United States to establish friendly relations. If Japan enters the war, the outcome cannot be predicted today, when the China Incident has not yet ended. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, I have deeply felt the importance of my duties, and it is unreasonable to get involved in a larger war. However, Tojo firmly believed that the Washington Conference had little hope of success, so he insisted on preparing for war. It was decided at the Imperial Conference on September 6 that if there was no progress in the negotiations by mid-October, active preparations for war must be made. The publication of this resignation letter after Konoe's suicide clearly shows that his relatives wanted to prove that Konoe's words in various statements after Japan was occupied, namely, that his resignation was actually caused by the war issue. But at the same time, the Asahi Shimbun commented on Konoe's suicide, saying that his weak nature would inevitably mislead the country, because his weakness made it easy for the war to break out. The general opinion of the Japanese is that Konoe's resignation that day was a sign of weakness. He could not stop the hard-line policies of the Tojo military clique and allowed them to do whatever they wanted, which was a failure of the responsibilities of a senior official.

Remains Left for Public Viewing

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] Konoe's remains were placed in his private residence today, following the northern foot and heading south, for public viewing. Konoe's suicide method was poisoning rather than seppuku, which many Japanese despised for its lack of pain. However, in terms of ceremony, it was quite "honorable." Konoe's wife apparently did not know about his intention to commit suicide, as she had packed her bags and was preparing for him to be imprisoned before the midnight deadline. When Konoe's body was discovered, he was wearing pajamas, with a Western-style pillow under his head, his hands peacefully crossed on his chest, and his face was still calm. At the time of his death, he was head east and feet west. His family changed him into a clean white Japanese-style dress and changed the direction to head north and feet south. Three American soldiers stood guard at the small door of the reception room, also taking off their leather shoes according to Japanese customs. Konoe's residence contained Gibbons's monumental work "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" and Wilde's collection of poems and essays. A section of Wilde's prose was underlined in red, presumably what he read before taking poison, the translation of which is as follows: "In the society we have created, there is no place for me, nor is there a place for me, but in nature, the sweet rain falls equally on the upright and the wicked. I can find a hiding place in the cracks of the hard rock and cry undisturbed in the quiet air in the secret valley."

Potassium Cyanide Suicide

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th, United Press] Konoe Fumimaro committed suicide by potassium cyanide. His secretary, Ushiba, said that although he did not know that Konoe had suicidal intentions, Konoe's wife seemed to know what her husband wanted to do. General MacArthur's headquarters announced that former Prime Minister Konoe committed suicide by poisoning in his residence. He was originally scheduled to surrender to Sugamo Prison today. This news was notified to the Allied Counterintelligence Team by the Japanese Central Liaison Office. The Central Liaison Office apparently obtained this information from people close to Konoe. It is said that he has been extremely troubled and worried since being listed as a war criminal on December 6.

### United Nations Headquarters, Boston and San Francisco, One Will Be Chosen

[United Press, London, 16th Dispatch] The permanent headquarters of the United Nations organization has been decided to be located in the United States. Boston and San Francisco are clearly the main cities in the United States competing for this seat. Representatives from China, the Philippines, and Australia have clearly stated their support for San Francisco, but representatives from European countries would rather choose Boston on the East Coast of the United States.

### The Three-Power Conference Met Again Yesterday, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Seek Understanding, The Meeting Proceeded in a Friendly Atmosphere

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th Dispatch] After a preliminary exchange of views yesterday, the three-power foreign ministers met again this afternoon for more concrete discussions. The three foreign ministers and their entourage were very busy yesterday. Although no communiqué was issued after the meeting, it is believed that the atmosphere was very friendly.

[United Press, Moscow, 16th Dispatch] The three-power foreign ministers held their first meeting here today, chaired by Molotov. US Secretary of State Byrnes, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and their staff attended. It is said that this first meeting was only preliminary in nature. Before the meeting, Bevin met with British Ambassador to Iran, Bulard, who had just arrived from Iran. According to Bevin's statement to reporters, they will discuss the atomic problem "in accordance with policy principles." This statement implies that the British and American foreign ministers have discussed the atomic problem with the Soviet Union for the first time. The British Foreign Secretary also said, "The conference will seek understanding on issues of mutual concern based on realistic principles. We hope to make progress in solving the current difficult issues in the world so that they can be discussed more broadly in the United Nations organization in the end.

### Egypt Approves Participation in International Monetary Agreement

[Reuters, Cairo, 17th Dispatch] The Egyptian government has approved participation in the Bretton Woods International Monetary Agreement.

### "Little Glass Eyes" and Others Will Be Tried in Yokohama Today

[United Press, Yokohama, 17th Dispatch] A US military court composed of nine officers met in a cold, dark Yokohama court today to plan the first trial of Japanese war criminals. The life and death of five Japanese defendants accused of abusing United Nations prisoners of war will depend on this.

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] The first Japanese war criminal trial will be held in a Japanese court here this afternoon. Will "Little Glass Eyes" answer "guilty or not guilty" at that time? "Little Glass Eyes" was originally a guard in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, whose name was familiar to American prisoners of war. His real name is Tsuchiya. "Little Glass Eyes" will be submitted to a military court organized by nine people for trial on the crime of murdering nine Americans. He is also accused of using wooden boards, sticks, and water pipes to torture prisoners of war. The indictment alleges that one of the most enjoyable pastimes of "Little Glass Eyes" was to force Allied prisoners of war to slap each other between two torture instruments for his entertainment.

### The World's Last Remaining Autocratic Monarch, King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, Harem Beauties in Groups, Princes and Princesses Too Numerous to Count Accurately, Opposes Freedom of Speech and Publication, Strong Aversion to Jews

[United Press, Cairo, 16th Dispatch] King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, 66 years old this year, is the world's last remaining autocratic king. Since Muhammad I, he is the first person who has been able to rule the largest Arab country. He governs five million people and has the power of life and death over them.

He does not advocate freedom of speech and publication. He especially opposes smoking, drinking, and gambling, and strictly prohibits the intrusion of ubiquitous films into his territory. He uses religion as a political tool. He is a devout believer in the Koran and goes to Mecca, the holy land of Islam, for pilgrimage every year, and he always brings a large group of people with him, including his courtiers, cooks, Islamic leaders, his "current" and "former" concubines, servants, and his grandchildren. This complex group is not pleasing to Westerners.

There is no accurate record of how many children he has. It is said that he once said: In my youth, I established the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Now that I am old, I want to add more people to the country. Someone once estimated that he had a total of 31 officially married and raised princes who are still alive, but this estimate was later considered too small. The king can marry four princesses each time and can marry and choose harem beauties at any time.

Ibn Saud is six feet four inches tall, has a loud voice, is witty, has a strong memory, and is generous by nature. Those who leave him for the first time never leave empty-handed. He welcomes anyone to Palestine except Jews.

Two and a half years ago, he said: I don't know what reason the Jews have to demand to live in Palestine. It is true that Palestine belonged to the Jews for several centuries before Muhammad, but later the Romans defeated them, killed some of them, and expelled some of them. Palestine has not seen any traces of being ruled by them since then. 1,300 years ago, the Arabs took Palestine from the Romans again, and since then Palestine has become the Palestine of Islam. At the end of the last war, Britain allowed the Jews to establish their home in the holy land of Palestine. Ibn Saud said angrily: This will be an unfulfillable promise, just like the empty promise of the Arab government to allow the Jews to live in Devonshire, England. Since Jerusalem is the common holy land of Muslims, Christians, and Jews, we Arabs do not understand why the Jews must choose Palestine as suitable for them to live in. They can find another branch to perch on.

### Britain, the United States, and France Take Consistent Action, Will Break off Relations with Spain, A Decision Can Be Made After the Moscow Conference

[Reuters, London, 17th Dispatch] Britain's attitude towards Spain will not be decided until Foreign Secretary Bevin returns from the Moscow Conference. However, according to reports from Washington and Paris, the United States and France may soon clearly announce their attitude towards Spain. France is especially anxious and hopes to take consistent action against the Franco government immediately, such as breaking off diplomatic relations.

[United Press, Washington, 16th Dispatch] Diplomatic sources here expressed their opinion today that the United States will definitely break off relations with the Franco government of Spain. The US Ambassador to Spain, Armour, has already resigned and is now returning home via Paris. According to people in the State Department, it has not been decided who will succeed him. According to the French Foreign Ministry, it has asked the United States and Britain to discuss breaking off relations with the Franco government. US Secretary of State Byrnes and President Truman's advisers have strongly urged the United States to clarify its policy towards Spain. It is said in official circles that it is not enough to break off relations with Spain. At the same time, a declaration should be issued to the Spanish people, explaining that Spain has isolated itself from the international community due to the policies of Franco. The declaration should also specify measures to terminate the Spanish fascist political organization so that it can be suitable for the United Nations organization.

[US Information Service, Washington, 16th Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson held an unofficial meeting with former Spanish Republican Prime Minister Dr. Negrín yesterday. This is the first time since 1939 (when the Spanish government still had an ambassador in the United States) that a senior official of the State Department has met with a leader of the Spanish Republican movement at the State Department.

### Burmese Leader Urges the United States to Uphold Justice

[Reuters, Yangon, 17th Dispatch] General Aung San, chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, telegraphed the US President today, asking him to uphold justice for subordinate countries in accordance with the recently decided US foreign policy.

### Japanese War Criminals Will Be Tried for the Murder of Yang Guangsheng and Zhu Shaoping, The Crimes of the Ota Military Police Commander Are Heinous

[United Press, Manila, 17th Dispatch] It was revealed here yesterday that former Commander of the Japanese Military Police in the Philippines, Lieutenant Colonel Ota, will be charged with the murder of Chinese Consul General to the Philippines Yang Guangsheng, Vice Consul Zhu Shaoping, and their entourage on or around April 17, 1942. The original text of the US indictment against the leader of this military police force was revealed this morning. The indictment states, "On or around April 17, 1942, Ota did unjustifiably and unlawfully allow his subordinates to murder Dr. Yang Guangsheng, Zhu Shaoping, Wang Jinghui, and other members of the consulate. The murder site was the Chinese Cemetery of Santa Cruz in Manila." Zhu Shaoping was the former chairman of the Shanghai World Student Association and was known at the time as R.K. Chu. Wang Jinghui was a famous Chinese diplomat and the son of former Ambassador to the United States Dr. Wang Zhengting. Another formally charged crime of Ota is that from January 2 to September 30, 1942, he allowed his subordinates to torture and inflict illegal punishment on civilians of the United States and its allied and neutral countries, and forced these civilians to bury themselves in the Santiago Fortress and Intramuros in Manila under the most cruel and inhuman conditions. The indictment also states that, in view of the above facts, Ota has violated the wartime regulations and neglected his responsibility to manage the conduct of his subordinates.

### Indonesian President Tours, Prime Minister Sjahrir and Others Accompany

[Reuters, Batavia, 17th Dispatch] Indonesian Republic President Sukarno began his tour of central and eastern Java today to "restore order." Cabinet Prime Minister Sjahrir, Information Minister Syarifuddin, and others accompanied him. They plan to go to Yogyakarta, the revolutionary center of central Java, first.

They will meet with local leaders and observe the local situation along the way.

### Local Correspondences

Bangbu: Special Express Trains Added Between Pukou and Xuzhou

Since the realization of victory, although the transportation between Pukou and Xuzhou has been repeatedly disrupted by the Communist bandits, it has been restored to normal operation through the road bureau's active repairs. This section has only received more than forty passenger cars. Except for those that have been transferred or are being repaired, there are only over twenty cars now, and most of them are factory cars, making passengers feel quite cold. With eight trains running, each train can only allocate five passenger cars, resulting in extreme overcrowding for passengers. It is learned that the Huazhong Railway Pukou-Xuzhou Section Management Office, in order to facilitate passengers, is planning to add two special express trains, which are expected to be officially open to traffic around the 20th of this month. However, the entire journey will take ten hours and thirty minutes. Trial runs were conducted twice on the 14th (yesterday), and the results were excellent.

Jiangyin: Cheng-Xi Highway Restored to Traffic

The Cheng-Xi Highway was fully reopened to traffic starting from the 10th.

### A Stroll Through Rome and Paris: The First Footprints on Half the World

— Special Correspondent, Zhu Jiarang

Three days after the National Day, I finally realized my long-cherished wish to travel abroad. This trip started from Chongqing, passed through North Africa, crossed the Mediterranean Sea, set foot on the European continent, and then crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the British Isles to reach America, circling half the globe. Covering four continents, I can't help but feel it was a grand tour. Although I had a mission to accomplish, it was a whirlwind tour everywhere, but the impressions I gained are still worth mentioning, especially since this trip took place after the war. Although peace has arrived, I saw and heard many wartime phenomena. The so-called post-war Europe and America is actually the general dynamic of the transition from wartime to peacetime.

Departing from Chongqing, Taking the Route to India to France

The first major stop when leaving Chongqing was Calcutta, India, as everyone knows. Although Calcutta is located in the tropics, the climate at that time was quite similar to Chongqing, not hot at all, and there was no need to sweat. The cityscape is somewhat like Shanghai, but the area is larger and the roads are wider than Shanghai. Due to the successive departure of American troops, the prosperity of Calcutta may be affected in the future, but at this time and place, it is still bustling and very lively. Large companies and department stores are crowded with people. Although prices are high, even higher than Chongqing, they are not restricted and can be freely purchased, making the market more active. Calcutta is rich in materials and comfortable to enjoy, which will be even more noticeable when you arrive in Europe later.

I remember leaving Calcutta on October 16th, and from then on, a long flight began. There were flights from the British Overseas Airways Corporation from India to Europe, but because the Priority Certificate from New Delhi never arrived, I temporarily changed to a plane from the American Air Transport Command (ATC). It is also necessary to obtain a Priority Certificate to take the ATC, but the Americans are very efficient. After only a few hours, the reply from New Delhi arrived, and we immediately bought tickets. That night, we moved into their airport accommodation to wait for the departure early the next morning. In this way, we also experienced the huge scale of the American air transport organization and how busy their service was. The scope of the airport is so large, and all kinds of planes take off and land one after another, making it noisy day and night. There are also these large and small vehicles that are also very busy, running back and forth. Although the time is already after the war, the way they work is still like wartime. It is even more possible to know the greatness of their contribution by imagining their tense and busy wartime. I can't help but express my deep respect!

The American ATC organization is spread all over the globe. Their mission is to transport important people and goods related to combat to the place where they should be as soon as possible. Due to the division of regions, China, India and Burma are one region; the North African part from Karachi in northwestern India to Casablanca in West Africa is another region; and then Europe across the Mediterranean is another region. Our trip is to experience their three regions, so we may stop for a while in each region in order to check the level of the Priority Certificate we hold and then determine the order of departure. Our Priority Certificate was not the highest, so we were "detained" for a while in Karachi and Cairo.

ATC Transport Planes, 160,000 Miles of Voyage

According to themselves, ATC has more than 1,000 transport planes, flying all over the world, with a total voyage of 160,000 miles. Although it is military transport, all the equipment is as comfortable as civil aviation. Every stop has a well-organized residence and dining hall, so you don't feel any pain. The airport is very far from the city, so there are special cars to pick you up and take you on sightseeing tours. As for the equipment of each airport, not to mention the ground buildings directly related to flying, how huge and complete they are to meet the needs of frequent takeoffs and landings; even other ordinary daily necessities are almost all available, without showing any "simplicity" or "sloppiness." For example, the hospital in Karachi is much better than any hospital in Chongqing. Many of the ATC staff are students who enlisted in the army. Purity and harmony are their characteristics.

It takes eight hours to fly from Calcutta to Karachi, and another eleven hours to fly to Cairo. This section completely flies along the Arabian Sea, flying straight into the Persian Gulf, passing Abadan (a key point in the Near East), crossing the deserts of Iraq, Greater Syria, and entering Egypt. When we arrived in Cairo, it was not yet dawn, so we were taken to the accommodation to rest. This is all desert area. Many buildings at the airport are built on the distant and thick sand. People's leather shoes are never clean.

When you arrive in Egypt, you must visit the pyramids and the museum. We were guided by an American travel agency, and spent more than ten US dollars to provide cars and guides, circling around all day to admire the symbols of this ancient culture; here is the Nile River, quietly lying in the not too distant area. This fertile and beautiful river is dotted with countless sails, like a painting. It nurtured the civilization of Egypt and wrote many brilliant histories; on the other side is the world-famous Sahara Desert, experiencing how vast the universe is and the endless road to walk, and realizing that life is so small! The Egyptian Historical Museum is the source of the world's ancient culture. A large building houses countless historical relics, especially sarcophagi and mummies, which are the most valuable data for archaeologists. Also, the three major mosques in Cairo are historically old and architecturally great, which is beyond initial expectations. The Cairo market is also very lively due to the wartime prosperity, and the population has exceeded one million! Although the roads in the central area are a bit narrow, the buildings on both sides are quite tall and complete, and the traffic is noisy. The expanded new urban area is even more beautiful and elegant, quiet and lovely. Most Egyptians have been westernized and wear suits, but they still wear Egyptian-style cylindrical top hats on their heads, with few exceptions. There are many coffee shops and hotels on the street, and many extend to the sidewalks outside the door, drinking and watching the scenery, which is the same as Paris. Egyptians seem to be very leisurely. They are not too nervous. After the war, in addition to being almost invaded by the Nazis, because of its location at the junction of East and West, business is quite good (now there are still many materials that are relatively cheap and easy to buy.) Generally speaking, it is very stable, unlike the general decline in Europe.

Red Flag Hanging Empty on the Railing: Mussolini's Old Office

It takes only one day to fly directly from Cairo to Paris, but the weather in Europe is erratic in winter, which made us stay in Rome for two days, but gave us the opportunity to wander around; although the mood to hurry is so anxious. This historical city of Rome has been disgraced under Mussolini's dictatorship in the past, but the city is still worth praising and very cute. That day, we entered the city from the airport, and it was only 4 pm. The sky was very bright, and we could see all the scenery. The cityscape is not as wide as Paris, but the architecture is very magnificent, and the traffic is very complete. Especially the artistic talent of the Romans seems to fill the entire city, overflowing in every corner. Any place is beautiful, admirable and unforgettable. Generally speaking, the urban design in Europe has many squares (Sanare), similar to wide intersections. Rome has no place without huge sculptures, monuments or magnificent fountains, making the city air so harmonious and lively. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Rome is the greatest sculptural building, located in the central bustling area, behind the Great Gate, the Colosseum and the ancient theater, which are already ruins; in front is adjacent to Mussolini's former office, a building that is not very tall but very wide, with a not very spectacular exterior but a very particular interior. The balcony where Mussolini used to yell at the people is still the same, but where is the hero of the world now? Only a red flag was seen hanging on the railing, and it is said that some exhibition was being held inside.

The most quintessential area of Rome is the Vatican and St. Peter's Church. We know that the Vatican is now an independent country, but it is all religious in origin, and the situation is different. The police uniforms are still traditional from the Middle Ages. Those who guard the Vatican City are all armed with ancient spears, and it is almost suspected that this life is what age? The Vatican City and Rome are really connected geographically. Although there is a city, the scope is very small, but you don't know that it not only still has the authority of historical, religious and cultural heritage, but also marvels at the splendor of its museum and the richness of its collection! Because of the long time and the vast space, every inch of the Vatican City Museum represents the contribution and achievement of countless writers and artists in the world! No inch is wasted or sloppy. Any rare treasure in the world is concentrated here. When I describe the magnificence of this museum here, I don't know where to start from, and it is difficult to find appropriate words to describe it. Just one sentence: To see the world's rare treasures, you don't have to go anywhere else when you get to the Vatican. I don't know if this is too much? Peter's Church, completed in the thirteenth century, is also one of the oldest and largest world landmarks. The bronze statue of Peter inside is a sculpture from the fifth century. Italian architecture has always been famous, but it also benefits from the easy availability of building materials. Europeans build houses all with stone, so unless they are destroyed by humans, they can always be passed down for a long time, and they will not change for centuries. This St. Peter's Church is especially a masterpiece. The wide square is surrounded by countless long corridors and stone pillars. The stone tower in the square pierces the clouds. This is the exterior. Climbing up the steps of the hall, this building is not decorated with gold and jade. Strangely, it is all made of beautiful bricks and stones, similar to coral agate piled up. The interior is full of carvings, and the atmosphere is ever-changing, which is indeed a world masterpiece.

Entering France from Italy, the Post-War Atmosphere is Extra Strong

Stepping on Europe is naturally the atmosphere of Europe. What I mean by atmosphere here is not someone else, but the post-war scenery is expressed more realistically. In Rome, because of the constant preservation of historical and cultural relations, except for the airport being bombed, no traces of destruction have been seen; but the general atmosphere of withering and decline is undeniably revealed on the streets and in everyone's heart. Everyone knows that since Italy was brought down by Mussolini, its military has been destroyed and its economy has collapsed. Before the peace treaty has been arranged by the foreign ministers' meeting, it is generally still under the control of the Allied authorities. Italy's industry was also very important before the war (their achievements are still beyond the reach of our current situation in China, and this observation has increased our vigilance.) But the war brought decline, and the national economy is now in a stage of decline and turmoil. The general living standard of Italians is still high in terms of clothing, housing and transportation. Everyone is well-dressed, lives in Western-style buildings, and the transportation is smooth when going out; but the enjoyment of food has been reduced. Milk, eggs and meat are generally lacking, and most of them are replaced by artificial fakes. Prices are high, which shows that the currency is inflating, there is a panic of materials, and the black market is rampant. One US dollar is officially priced at one hundred lira, but it can be sold for four or five hundred on the black market.

After passing Rome, we entered France. We landed in Marseille first and did not get to enter the city for sightseeing, but looking from afar, Marseille was still bustling with people. This place is the hub port for Sino-French transportation in peacetime. Recently, I heard that there are already ships sailing to the Far East, and many Chinese students studying in Europe will take ships from here to the East to return to China via Vietnam. It usually takes only two hours to fly from Marseille to Paris, but the weather was extremely bad during this period, and the flight was greatly affected. When we were about to arrive in Paris, the plane kept shaking, almost making people vomit. Fortunately, it landed soon, and we finally completed this long journey safely.

Paris, the world-famous metropolis, is now in the real world, and it is indeed worthy of its reputation. It is a typical standard city. Paris is considered first-class in terms of various conditions: in terms of climate, it is not hot or too cold. Parisians have never been unable to cover themselves with quilts on summer nights, and electric fans are rarely used; in terms of region, it is located in the center of the country, although it is slightly to the north, it is a key point of transportation, and the beautiful Seine River runs through the city, and Parisians have built countless bridges of various styles to add a lot of scenery. Paris has a history of 2,000 years. Emperors of all dynasties have always made their capital here. The brilliance and richness of the palaces show the power and enjoyment of the old royal family; and the accumulated construction, plus the development of modern municipal administration, Paris has indeed reached its peak. The talent and endurance of the French, as well as their achievements, are indeed admirable.

When the plane was about to land, the bird's-eye view of Paris gradually gave people a new impression: the design of the new city street looked like a neat square, and the houses were not as high as New York's, but each one was a huge building, with thousands of windows and hundreds of households, and people were entering and exiting like ants. The city of Paris first originated on a small island in the Seine River, and now the scale is more than a hundred times larger, and Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe has become the central right of the city. The Champs-Élysées Avenue connected to it is as wide as Shanghai's Avenue Edward, just the sidewalks on both sides. Yes, the clarity and tone of the Paris city area are completely wide and open. The trees along the road are lush, reflecting the huge houses that are close to each other, but the interior is golden and magnificent, perfect and beautiful, and it can be imagined that the lives of Parisians are at a very high level.

Underground Trains as Dense as Spider Webs, Using Elevators to Go Up and Down

The main expression of the Paris municipal administration, in addition to the construction of residences, should be transportation. In addition to the Renault and Fiat small cars made by France itself, which are speeding like dragons and water all day long, the greatest engineering and design is the underground tunnels, which cannot but be admired. Because the ground buses were requisitioned by the military authorities and have not yet been returned, there are not many buses due to gasoline. The city's main traffic relies on underground tunnels. Thousands of people travel north and south underground all day long, spending only two francs to travel all over the territory, and the speed is high and the use is convenient. As long as the direction is not wrong, any stranger can learn a little bit, and then follow the map to find anything they want. They will not get lost and cannot find their way home. The Paris underground train network is very dense and complicated, and the routes are stacked on top of each other. Some pass through the riverbed, and some go straight into the deep layer, requiring elevators to go up and down. The difficulty of the project is staggering; and the management is strict, and not many people are used. Except for the fact that the air is a bit poor due to the crowd and some ground or lack of cleanliness, there is simply nothing to criticize.

In the city and suburbs, there are ancient sites and scenic spots everywhere, making people linger and reminisce. The famous Palace of Versailles is a historical landmark in the suburbs, and the ruins of Louis XIV are still as yellow as ever. The music of the small chapel in the rich palace is still preserved today. I remember that when we went to visit that day, they specially played music to show their welcome. In another part, you can also see the place where the peace treaty of the First World War was signed, but after twenty-seven years, who knows that France has experienced many vicissitudes of life. Now, the troubles remain, and looking back, the tomb of the former tiger prime minister has been arched, and I really don't know what to feel!

The Arc de Triomphe and Napoleon's Tomb are the climax of French martial arts. The Arc de Triomphe is now also known as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, to commemorate the nameless heroes who sacrificed in the Great War of 1914-18. The towering giant shows its antiquity in terms of color. A flame at the bottom spurts out from the ground and never goes out, symbolizing that the national soul is still breathing. There are fresh flowers and wreaths piled up on the bronze monument all year round, especially on November 11, which is the place where all people mourn. Napoleon's Tomb, the place where the giant rests, is also attached to the Museum of War Relics of the Napoleonic Era. Countless thousands of armors, knives and spears, as well as battle flags, earth cannons, portraits, and medals, are scattered in it. France's artistic, book and museum talents are indeed very high. I have visited the Animal Kingdom and the Animal and Mineral Samples, as well as the Louvre Museum. Everyone must admire the grandeur of the content and the depth of the achievements.

New Street Fighting Bullet Marks, Blood Stains Still Not Dry That Day

Parisians often regard the Eiffel Tower and the Opera House as their masterpieces, and in fact, these two major constructions do have their deserved value. The Eiffel Tower started construction early, but it was not completed until 1889. It is 985 meters high and cost 7,000 tons of iron. You can take an elevator or walk up, and you can see the city scenery. Its engineering is naturally great. The Opera House is located in the downtown area and still performs ancient operas. It is full every night, and it is very difficult to book tickets, but some people go to appreciate the music and its architecture, because it is too luxurious, extravagant and impeccable.

Living in Paris due to the interlacing of these beautiful environments is indeed somewhat happy; but perhaps it is too enjoyable and leads to pleasure, which led to the tragedy of 1940. The French have learned their lesson and should be alert; especially after the war, although the city has not been damaged, some places still have street fighting bullet marks, and the bloodstains of the underground army fighting in the underground tunnels have not been completely dried; reflecting the poverty of the daily life of Parisians today, the post-war depression in France is indeed quite deep. To give a few examples: France's coal shortage has not been resolved, and the city's electricity is cut off in districts like Chongqing. The weather has reached the time when it should be lit, but where is the coal? It seems that we have to endure the winter. Some large hotels, despite their pre-war equipment, are very proud, and the waiters are all in evening dresses; but because there is no coal, many have no hot water supply. Toilet paper in toilets has been replaced by old newspapers in many places due to lack of materials. Speaking of the problem of food, the exquisite plates are filled with potatoes and cabbage. Fish is very good, chicken is too little, and there is no need to mention eggs and milk. Only wine is still very abundant. France is a good place to drink wine. The cafes and hotels along the street are magnificent, and it is too cheap to spend a few francs.

Due to the lack of materials, Paris is facing the same difficulties as other countries after the war. The two major livelihood issues of clothing and food are not easy to solve, so a quantitative rationing system is also implemented, but general luxury cosmetics and women's products still seem to be everywhere, and you can ask for whatever you want as long as you are willing to pay a high price. The few large department stores in Paris look very novel, but there are few men's needs, and most of them do women's business. In fact, there seem to be more women than men in Paris. The shop clerks, municipal workers, and even the streets are full of young women coming and going. Merchants are still keen regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign.

Paris was originally a place in Europe that attracted tourists before the war. Today, British and American tourists have not yet come on the market, but American children are coming in batches for sightseeing. They are transferred from all over Europe to rest. The American Red Cross has a special guide organization to entertain them, which directly contributes to the repatriation of Paris. It is said that there is a surplus of women in Paris. This is a very good way out. It is fashionable to marry an American husband and go to the New World.

In summary, the impression I got in Paris is that the historical tradition and brilliance, as well as the talent of the French nation, are superb, but it seems that they have been a little looser in this century. The political instability has not been eliminated until recently. De Gaulle has been supported, but the hard-line demands of the Communist Party almost prevented him from forming an obstruction. We understand that De Gaulle is trying to govern, but if there is no stable political situation, France's recovery is still lacking in guarantee. The economic malaise is now universal, and mainly depends on the cooperation and assistance of the United Nations and the restoration of industry, so that it can be quickly recovered. The current currency and material black market is indeed in a bad situation, but the main reason is still the re-creation of national productivity. As of the time of writing, France is working hard to nationalize industry and banks. The time when the Bank of France will be nationalized will be realized soon. But a more important principle seems to be social reconstruction. As mentioned above, the French, based on the legacy of their ancestors, inevitably tend to pleasure, but now to rebuild the Fourth Republic of France, we hope that French friends will work harder and bury their heads for another ten years! The habit of waiting on women is not bad, and the atmosphere of kissing along the way is also harmless, but because everyone's shoulders are heavier after this victory, how should we encourage each other to maintain the permanent peace and prosperity of the future world? We cannot ignore the fundamental revival of a society, but must work more seriously and with more responsibility!

### Four Japanese War Criminals Under International Law

Wartime Cabinet Members, Now Prisoners

Here are four Japanese war criminals with hideous faces, who have been listed by MacArthur in the first list of forty war criminals. From right to left: (Top row) Nobusuke Kishi, Minister of Commerce in the Tojo Cabinet, Kunihiko Hashida, Minister of Education, (Bottom row) Yatsushi Murata, Ambassador to the Philippines, and Tsutose Iwamura, Minister of Justice. All parties firmly advocate severe punishment for this group of war criminals. It seems that none of them can escape the international legal net. Because this is an unprecedented blood debt on the Pacific and Chinese fronts, shouldn't we repay our Chinese and our allies with the blood of Japanese war criminals?

### Editorial: President Truman Reaffirms China Policy

At the time when his special envoy, Marshal Marshall, was departing the U.S. for China, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Three Nations was convening in Moscow, President Truman issued a statement on his China policy, reiterating the U.S. national policy toward China. President Truman first stated that the U.S. government believes that a strong, unified, and democratic China is of great importance to the success of the United Nations organization and world peace. For the important interests of the United Nations and the United States, the Chinese people must not miss the opportunity to reconcile domestic differences through peaceful negotiations. The U.S. government believes that two points are extremely important: (1) The fighting between the National Government and the Communist army or other miscellaneous armies must stop; (2) A national conference including representatives of all major political groups must be convened to resolve domestic disputes as soon as possible and ultimately achieve China's unification. He also said that the United Nations and the United States only recognize the current National Government as the only legitimate government of the Republic of China, and only the National Government is the proper instrument to achieve China's unification. In addition, he also elaborated on the Northeast, U.S. troops stationed in China, and other points.

President Truman's statement is sufficient to completely clarify the somewhat unclear situation caused by Ambassador Hurley's resignation. It has great benefits for the development of the international and Chinese situation.

The first thing we want to point out is that President Truman's statement is, in general, a continuation of the traditional U.S. policy toward China. What is this traditional policy? It is the U.S. policy toward China since the late nineteenth century of supporting the establishment of a strong, unified, and democratic China. Since the establishment of the National Government, its purpose has been to establish a strong, unified, and democratic China. This nation-building work was hindered by the Japanese invasion, which finally triggered our country's eight-year War of Resistance. The arduous War of Resistance, under the leadership of the National Government, achieved victory, which was a necessary stage for China's nation-building. After the surrender of the enemy, the National Government was responsible for the task of accepting the surrender and taking over, but in carrying out this task, it encountered the destruction of the Communist Party. The Communist army was not subject to the control of the central government and attempted to expand its occupied areas, which they called the "liberated areas," and thus did not hesitate to use force to suppress the national army that was carrying out the task of accepting the surrender and taking over. The National Government has never attempted to use force and hopes to resolve the Communist Party issue through political means, as it has done in the past few years, and as it is doing now. Therefore, President Truman's desire to immediately stop the conflict is in line with the wishes of the Chinese people and the policy of the National Government. However, whether the Communist Party army can put the overall national interest first and immediately stop armed separatism, destroying China's unification, still seems to be a question as of today.

President Truman also pointed out that in order to assist the National Government in eliminating Japanese forces in China, the United States must currently send naval and ground forces to be stationed in China. This is a very wise decision. Although the Japanese army on the Chinese battlefield has already surrendered, some have not yet surrendered their arms, and 1.3 million Japanese troops in China are awaiting repatriation. These are all related to the war. Although the fighting has ended, the war has not yet completely ended. The mission of the U.S. military in China is, on the one hand, to assist the National Government, and on the other hand, to carry out its own mission and the common mission of the United Nations in the war against Japan. In order to deliberately undermine the National Government's work of accepting the surrender, the Communist Party army has not hesitated to create many incidents, such as attacking the U.S. military and spreading calls for the U.S. military to withdraw from China. Its purpose is nothing more than to use force to resolve the National Government's army accepting the surrender, expand their occupied areas, and obstruct China's unification. The Chinese people feel that for the sake of China's interests, the United States' interests, and the United Nations' interests, the U.S. troops stationed in China absolutely need to continue to be stationed in China until they have completed their mission. The armies of China and the United States fought side by side with the enemy in Burma and India; they should also complete their unfinished mission side by side.

As for abandoning one-party rule and implementing constitutional government, this has also been a consistent policy of the National Government. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced this spring that the National Assembly would be convened this year, but it was postponed to May of next year due to the Communist Party's opposition. The convening of the Political Consultative Conference was originally intended to accommodate representatives of all parties and social elites to discuss national affairs together, but the convening of the conference was repeatedly postponed due to the Communist Party representatives arriving late. All of this clearly shows that the reason why the current Chinese situation has not been peacefully resolved is due to the Communist Party's deliberate sabotage. What we want to emphasize is that the Chinese Communist Party is different from the Communist Parties of other countries. The Communist Parties of other countries do not have armed forces and do not have their own governments, while the Chinese Communist Party not only has armed forces, but also independently organizes governments to exercise political power. These are all intolerable under national law. In terms of legal principles, the Chinese Communist Party can never stand on an equal footing with the National Government as a negotiating opponent; but the National Government has repeatedly negotiated with it to accommodate the facts, which is enough to show the National Government's tolerance. President Truman said: "The existence of independent and autonomous armies like the Communist Party's army is incompatible with China's unification and makes political unification impossible." This is truly a telling statement. In the process of implementing unified democracy, the Chinese Communist Party must first hand over its army. This is another proof that President Truman has insight into the crux of the Chinese situation.

Regarding the United States' assistance in our industrial and agricultural reconstruction, reorganizing and training our country's military organization, and providing loans to promote Sino-American trade, etc., the Chinese people, after suffering from a long war, will naturally feel excited and inspired by the good intentions of our allied nations. China is facing the arduous task of post-war reconstruction and needs the assistance of allied nations. We hope that the release of President Truman's statement can promote the awakening of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, and after the Communist Party representatives such as Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying arrive in Chongqing, we sincerely hope that they will put the overall situation first and sincerely participate in the Political Consultative Conference, so that the National Government's desire to peacefully resolve all political issues can be achieved, and a strong, unified, and democratic China can be successfully built. Only in this way can we live up to the expectations of our allied friends.

### Large Investors Sell at High Prices; Gold Market Lacks Momentum; Next-Day Delivery System Piloted Yesterday

The price of gold bars was quite stable yesterday, but people's sentiment continued to waver, so the rise lacked momentum and was easily taken advantage of by short sellers. In the afternoon, brokers began to pilot next-day delivery transactions for one hour, but the trading volume was very small. On the bond market, rumors circulated that "Sun Bonds" would be issued early next month. After opening in the morning, prices gradually rose to 759,000. Large investors showed little interest in funds and sold off at high prices, gradually falling back. In the afternoon, short sellers used the next-day delivery system, and prices weakened, falling to below 730,000 at one point, but the trading volume was not large. In the end, prices hovered around the opening price, resulting in a slight increase of 6,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry shops quoted 79,000, tael silver 600 yuan, and silver dollars still hovered below 450 yuan. Secret interest rates were pulled up by brokers who fiercely dragged down public bonds and Chinese stocks, gradually finding a way out. Interest rates also rose to 8 fen and 1 jiao.

The price of U.S. dollars initially strengthened but then weakened. Speculators have gradually become indifferent to this, advancing and retreating with the price of gold. Buyers still surged in, rising to around 1,275 yuan, but later, as the gold market weakened, sellers dumped physical goods, declining steadily. In the afternoon, it once retreated to the closing price of last Saturday, but the result was still a squeeze up of 10 yuan. Hong Kong dollars had no special characteristics, and the closing price was similar to that of last Saturday, but supply exceeded demand.

### Rumors of "Sun Bonds" Being Redeemed are Quite Prevalent; Public Bonds Soar; Both Reached 720 Yuan; Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Also Flourishing

Public bonds continued to soar amidst the clamor of speculation. Rumors circulated that Shanghai public bonds would be redeemed with the "Sun Bonds" planned to be issued early next month, and that the exchange rate of "Sun Bonds" was extremely high. Buyers were like fish in water, pushing Class C bonds to the seventh heaven. In the afternoon, they continued to rise to around 720 yuan, while miscellaneous brands were abandoned like relics, unable to keep pace. As a result, the closing price rose by 75 yuan to a strong 100 yuan compared to the previous session.

After profits were made in the bond market, floating capital flowed into Chinese stocks. After the gold market and U.S. dollars became sluggish, banks also came to favor them. Under the environment of superior interest rates, Mei Ya continued to be surrounded by buying interest. Under the speculation, it almost approached the 400 yuan mark. Among the small-cap stocks, Xin Guang still ranked first, and the rest followed suit. As a result, cotton mills rose by 75 yuan, Mei Ya rose by a good 90 yuan, Xin Guang by 6 yuan, Jing Fu by 4.5 yuan, and Qin Yu only by 2 yuan. After the close, large investors continued to purchase, remaining extremely quiet. Capital saw change and moved, without unexpected attacks. The market may advance.

Foreign stocks were initially flat, but the asking prices were mostly false. Floating capital in the securities industry gradually came to inquire, suddenly presenting an image of demand exceeding supply. The buying interest that had been lurking for a long time could not be contained once it was released. Yi Sha rose by 220 yuan compared to last Saturday, and it was still the buying price. The rest rose by 10%. There was demand but no supply for unpopular stocks, resulting in a buying price for all stocks at the close. After the close, the asking price for Yi Sha increased to 1,600 yuan, and Yi Beer paper industries were all above 400 yuan.

### Yarn Sales Develop; Merchant Groups Seek Spot Goods

Yesterday, the yarn market was firm and people's sentiment was stable. The price of green gold was stable, and sales developed. The Tongzhou group had a strong demand for 16-count coarse yarn, actively searching for spot goods. Some merchants from Jiangxi brought in above-waist yarn, but only targeted those with tax invoices to guarantee spot delivery, with an increase of about 20,000 to 30,000. Stacked bills were not inquired about. Fine yarn and thread also followed suit, rising by 50,000. According to the trend, the yarn market is still in a state of consolidation.

### Rice Market Has Ups and Downs

Yesterday, there were still many arrivals of japonica rice, and the market was flat. Indica rice was scarce and firm, and there was less inventory of white yuan, with supply unable to meet demand, becoming higher and more solid, seeing an increase of 300 to 400 yuan. Yang Indica also increased by 300 to 500 yuan. The turnover of high-priced goods in the oil market was relatively smooth, while the middle and inferior grades were very sluggish. Ningbo merchants slightly purchased flour, but the local demand was flat due to the listing of flat-priced flour. Zhejiang merchants slightly traded soybeans, rebounding by 200 to 300 yuan, and bean cake was still scarce.

### Asphalt Trend Improves

After a sharp drop, the price of asphalt slightly rebounded. Also, it is currently the season for candle making. According to letters from various producing areas, the situation has also improved. Yesterday, brokers in this city offered Jiashan native grass oil for 20,000 yuan and Lanxi oil for 14,500 yuan. Hankou oil continued to arrive, so although the market saw a good trend, it could not be expected to rise too much.

### New Exchange Rate Undecided; Silk and Tea Transactions are Dull

Raw silk transactions were dull, with only a dozen packages sold. Prices were slightly weak, probably because the exchange rate was undecided and people were cautious.

Tea transactions were more lively for fried green and baked green teas. Various black teas were flat. It was heard that foreign firms such as British Zhuang Xie He had inquired about purchasing, and that a certain export company was promoting exports to American firms.

### Demand for White Coal Increases Sharply

As the coal market entered the cold winter, the demand for household white coal increased sharply, and the absorption of the industry became stronger. However, the industry's white coal inventory was thin, and the flat-price allocation took time, leading holders to start raising prices again, and the market became prosperous. Large households' actual sales of bituminous coal did not move, and remained stable. Although retail sales of firewood and charcoal were busy, the agricultural work in the producing areas had passed, and transportation was simple, so they were all splitting firewood and transporting it to Shanghai, with supply exceeding demand, making it difficult for the market to recover.

### Students of Guanghua University in Chengdu Oppose Renaming to Chenghua University

Representatives Elected to Petition the Ministry of Education

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Airmail] Following the decision by the board of directors of the Chengdu branch of Guanghua University to rename it Chenghua University, students have expressed dissatisfaction. After convening a meeting of all students, they unanimously felt that the school had been established for eight years, enduring hardships. Now, as the Japanese aggressors have surrendered and the nation has been restored, all students rejoice in the imminent resumption of classes. Unexpectedly, the board of directors is gifting the school to local individuals for management. This matter is of great importance and related to their studies. Therefore, they organized a petition group, electing representatives to explain to the board of directors the reasons for retaining the name of Shanghai Guanghua University. However, the board of directors refused, citing that the decision was difficult to reverse, leading to increased indignation among the students. Consequently, they voted to dismiss the board of directors and elected over forty representatives to come to Chongqing to petition the Ministry of Education, hoping for a reasonable resolution.

### Charity Basketball Game for Scholarship Fund: Finals Tonight; China Youth vs. Aocina; Hualian Expected to Defeat Haiqing; Awards Ceremony After the Game

The Sino-American Charity Basketball Game for Scholarship Fund, jointly organized by this newspaper and Tongde Medical College, has showcased the outstanding skills of Chinese and American athletes for the past two days, with unprecedented excitement in the matches and universal satisfaction among the fans. The final two games will be held tonight at 7:30 PM, still in the former Canidrome Stadium. To show solemnity, Director Gu Yuxiu of the Education Bureau has been specially invited to perform the opening ceremony. After the games, the awards ceremony will be presided over by Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Dean Gu Yuqi of Tongde Medical College. A charity auction of basketballs will also be held, and the military band will perform to add to the excitement. Basketball fans can both enjoy the skills and contribute to the scholarship cause, creating a sensational event. The schedule is as follows:

American Haiqing — Hualian Pharmacy 7:30 PM

Aocina — China Youth 8:30 PM

Hualian's Victory Likely Not a Problem

The first game tonight is Hualian against American Haiqing. Considering Hualian's battle against Aocina, Hualian lost by only three points, which is commendable. Hualian not only possesses intelligence and courage but also demonstrates excellent sportsmanship, leaving a good impression. American Haiqing has plenty of courage, but their floor skills are not yet refined. Hualian should prioritize intelligent play today. Zhen Zhong should continue to focus on providing support, and Xue Chong and Cheng Zhang must have a tacit understanding of running into open spaces to defeat the enemy. As for long-range shots, Hualian should use them sparingly, as Akong is not yet familiar with the basket in that stadium. Why bother trying too much, only to lose possession? If they can do so, Hualian's victory over American Haiqing by more than five points is likely not a problem.

Employ Intelligent Tactics Against Aocina

In the second game, China Youth will face Aocina. The latter's performance in defeating Hualian in the American military league was truly above par. Xu Meng's one-handed shots, hitting the mark with every attempt, are masterpieces rarely seen in recent years, truly the soul of the team and a major concern for China Youth. China Youth possesses the elite players of the Shantou, Xiexing, and Liangxi teams, making for a strong lineup. Facing such a strong opponent, they must seek both offense and defense to find a way to win. The first priority should be to contain Xu Meng's activity, which can be achieved by having Ma Canxi or Liu Fushan sacrifice and mark him closely. With the loss of this main brain, opportunities will arise. The China Youth forwards should heavily utilize the two young players, He Jinsheng and Chen Qingjiang, as they have excellent floor skills and good darting shots, creating threats on both sides. It is not impossible for the American team to suffer a Waterloo. The team rosters are as follows:

(Hualian Team) Li Zhenzhong, Kong Guangyi, Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuechong, Bo Tuo, Zhang Liangxiong, Zhang Xianlun, Xu Jusheng, Chen Zuoliang, Jin Kun, Yan Youling, Song Hanzhang.

(Haiqing Team) Hu Zi, A'ersun, Jie Kaji, Qu Linwen, Ai Jinxun, Pai Siden, Mo Lings, Lai Wen.

(China Youth Team) Ma Canxi, Zhuo Guorong, Chen Qingjiang, Liu Fushan, He Jingui, Lin Weicong, Zhang Jinxuan, He Lide, Yao Wen, Wang Kuiting.

(Aocina) Xu Meng, Mason, Que Liedun, Hu Sheng, Qu Jingna, Qiong Xun, Bo Ba, Mei Jie, Wheeler.

### Football Referees Association Holds Inaugural Meeting

Chen Jixiang, Shen Huichun, He Chunhui, Zhang Le, Wu Shouheng, Chen Jiaoliang, and Huang Renyi were elected as directors.

### Promoting Art Education

— Lan Zhaotong

During the "May Fourth" Movement, Mr. Cai Yuanpei advocated "Art Education Replacing Religion." Over the past thirty years, China's art education has not seen much success. Specialized schools have few students, and their establishment has not been widespread. Regarding funding and equipment, it is even more pitiful. In primary and secondary schools, art is still a "minor subject," let alone its teaching materials and methods.

For the sake of the overall progress of education, we must raise the issue of art education here because it is an integral part of the entire education system and cannot be ignored.

To promote art education, we should address both fundamental and superficial aspects:

On the fundamental side, it is hoped that the education authorities will quickly use their power to revive art specialty schools nationwide, adjust and enrich them, focusing on teacher training. In teachers colleges, university education departments, and normal schools, art education should be emphasized and excellent art teachers trained. Furthermore, art museums should be established, art exhibitions and art awards should be held, and other substantive initiatives undertaken.

Addressing the fundamental issues may be too slow. Therefore, it is necessary to provide practical guidance on existing primary and secondary school art education, such as: How to supplement the art equipment of existing schools? How to improve current art teaching materials and methods? How to promote further education for current art teachers? The education authorities should quickly plan these aspects.

Finally, we hope that implementing specialist art subject inspectors can improve the status of art education, which is a good way to advance the superficial aspects of art education.

### A Groundbreaking Art Academy: A Visit to the Municipal Drama School

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai's various construction projects have been actively promoted. The dilapidated educational undertakings are also being successively restored and new developments planned. Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau, feeling the importance of dramatic art in social education and noting the lack of dramatic art talent in Shanghai, specially established a Municipal Experimental Drama School to meet the needs of the environment. The former No. 1 Japanese National School on North Sichuan Road, taken over from the Japanese, was allocated as the drama school building. This is a fresh piece of news for the Shanghai drama community.

To understand the internal situation of the school, the reporter took time to visit yesterday afternoon. On the sunny, briskly windy road, with an excited and enthusiastic heart, I walked to the Bund, took a No. 1 tram straight to the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, and the eye-catching and brand-new school sign "Shanghai Municipal Experimental Drama School" came into view.

Entering the school gate, in a wide field, several Japanese residents were playing baseball idly. Walking into the office, I was warmly greeted by Mr. Wu Renzhi, the school's academic affairs director. Mr. Wu has a deep understanding of drama and is a famous expert in the Shanghai drama scene. Mr. Wu's ability to preside over academic affairs at the school will greatly contribute to its planning and dedication in the future. After a few words of greeting, the conversation gradually turned to the main topic. Mr. Wu told me in detail everything about the school's preparation and future expansion plans.

The school was prepared in early October by several members of the preparatory committee, including Chen Lin Duan, Gu Zhongyi, Li Jianwu, Huang Zuolin, Zhang Junxiang, Lu Juewu, and Lin Shengshi. After half a month of active work, it was officially established. The Municipal Education Bureau then appointed Mr. Gu Zhongyi as the principal of the school. Mr. Gu is a well-known playwright and director, with more than twenty years of experience in drama research. After taking office as principal, he began enrolling students on the 15th of last month and held entrance examinations on the 28th and 29th. The list of newly admitted students was announced on the 3rd of this month.

At the first meeting under the leadership of Mr. Zhang Zhefan, chairman of the school affairs committee, it was decided to expand the number of classes and continue to recruit new students. The second recruitment examination was announced to be completed on the 9th of this month.

They are now planning to first run a "Part-Time Class" with a training period of two months. After the term expires, the results of the assessment will be classified into the first or second grade respectively. Classes will start in the spring of next year, preparing to first run the Drama Department, Film Department, and Music Drama Department. The Drama Department will be divided into acting and technical groups, which will be held simultaneously; the Film Department will first run the acting group; the Music Drama Department will first run the opera group, and then gradually expand. In addition to basic subjects such as Chinese, English, history, and geography, their courses include history of Chinese and foreign literature, an introduction to art, an introduction to drama, theater awareness, history of Chinese and foreign drama, selected readings of plays, analysis of plays, an introduction to directing techniques, set design, lighting design, costume design, stage design, technical design, film awareness, dance, singing, art, carpentry, electrical engineering, and thread engineering, totaling more than forty types.

Since the school began registration, many young people from the professional sector have come to request part-time elective studies. Now, in order to meet social needs, Principal Gu is preparing to set up elective classes to provide an opportunity for young people in the professional sector who are interested in drama to study. The regulations are currently being planned and drafted. Starting next year, a research class will be prepared as much as possible. Those who enter the research class must have a university degree and specialize in advanced playwriting and directing subjects in order to train playwriting and directing talents.

Mr. Wu Renzhi and I talked for about thirty minutes. I had gained a clear outline of the school's situation. Then, Mr. Wu led me to visit the school building. The houses are spacious and spacious. In addition to ordinary subject classrooms, the equipment for special classrooms for each subject is being planned, such as carpentry rooms, performance rooms, and dance rooms. There are absolutely different facilities from ordinary schools here. Being able to implement them one by one in the future is indeed a groundbreaking art school.

There are still more than 300 Japanese residents living in the school building, preparing to return to their country on standby. The implementation of all the school's detailed plans will be carried out after this group of Japanese residents leaves. After visiting the school for a week, I bid farewell and came back, and I wrote this note, with unlimited prospects for the school. (Yuan)

### Executive Yuan Approves Policy Scope of Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau; Extended to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; Hospital Water Tings to Be Returned First; Executive Yuan Orders Return of Occupied Civilian Property

[Our Dispatch] Executive Yuan Premier Song has approved the expansion of the policy scope of the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to include the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. It is reported that Peng Xuepei, Chairman of the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee, and Liu Gongyun, Director of the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, were summoned to Chongqing for this matter. It was also learned that at 11:00 AM yesterday, a telegram was received from Chongqing by Executive Yuan Deputy Premier Weng, stating that the policy scope of the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau should extend to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which was approved by Premier Song on the 15th. According to Director Peng Xuepei, the committee has begun planning its organization after receiving the telegram.

Thorough Investigation of Material Leaks

The bureau has begun clearing up the water tings of major buildings that were forcibly dismantled by the enemy and puppets in the past, and those belonging to hospitals will be returned as soon as possible. However, the number of these water tings is quite large, and they are scattered in various places in Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Nanshi. It will be quite difficult to return them all to their original owners in a short period of time. As for the leakage of materials currently stored in various warehouses, the bureau has also mobilized Japanese officers and soldiers to be responsible for investigating the detailed list of initial transfers to our side. After obtaining the exact number, it will be possible to investigate.

Utilization Committee Consults Yesterday

The Municipal Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau organized a Utilization Committee to utilize enemy and puppet real estate, warehouses, factories, docks, and indoor furniture. The committee held its first meeting at the bureau at 4:00 PM yesterday, with Huang Boqiao as chairman.

### Navigation Hindered by Wind

After 10:00 AM yesterday, the northwest wind suddenly turned tight. According to shipping industry news, the sea surface was full of white waves, making navigation dangerous. As a result, ship exports yesterday morning were all hindered. The Jiangfeng ship, which runs on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, dropped anchor outside the port at 9:00 AM. When it sailed to the Tongsha sea area, the wind was very strong. For safety reasons, it returned to Shanghai and arrived at Wharf No. 12 at 2:00 PM, where it was docked. The Jiangmin and Jiangtong ships sailed to Tiansheng Port yesterday morning, and the Jianghong sailed to Chongming. Because the ships were small and the waves were big, it was inconvenient to cross the river, and they also returned to Shanghai one after another. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun ship and the Minsheng Company's Minlian ship also left Shanghai yesterday morning and sailed upstream to Hanyi. Because the ships were larger and sailing upstream in the Yangtze River, they were able to support themselves, so they did not return to Shanghai. The Jiangxin ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Hankou on the 21st. The Minzu ship towing the No. 11 iron barge arrived here the day before yesterday, and it also needs to be slightly repaired, and is scheduled to sail to Yichang around the 20th. Huatong Company's Huatong ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Chongqing via Nanjing and is scheduled to sail upstream. The British Far East Shipping Agency's Yongsheng ship came to Shanghai from Hong Kong last Saturday and is expected to arrive tomorrow, but due to the strong wind on the sea yesterday, it may be postponed.

Mr. Freeman also hopes that the United States and China can cooperate closely and enhance friendship.

### Confucian Society Telegrams to Preserve Sacred Sites

The Chinese Confucian Society yesterday telegraphed Chairman Chiang, stating that the communist army's invasion of Qufu was shocking. It was said that Qufu is the location of the ancestral temple and cemetery of the Most Holy Teacher, Confucius. If it is infringed upon by the communist army, the sacred sites of thousands of years may be destroyed at once. The thought of this is appalling. Therefore, it is telegraphed to the chairman, requesting that large troops be dispatched to rescue so that the sacred sites can be preserved. This is fortunate for the country.

### Municipal Council to Be Established Soon: Quota Set at Fifty Seats; To Be Announced After Approval by the Executive Yuan

More than three months have passed since the recovery of this city, and there is still no news of the establishment of the Provisional Council, which represents the public's opinion. The reporter went to the municipal government yesterday to inquire. According to the person in charge, the original quota for the municipal provisional councilors was set at 25. The municipal government, in accordance with regulations, consulted with the municipal party headquarters a month ago and submitted 50 candidates, twice the number, to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, because the city has a larger population, a special request was submitted to increase the quota. Later, approval was obtained to increase it to 50, requiring the submission of 100 candidates. Therefore, the municipal party headquarters consulted again two weeks ago and submitted the list to the Executive Yuan. It will be announced as soon as it is approved.

### Tram Fares to Increase

(Our Dispatch) According to Mr. Backlock, the person in charge of the Shanghai British Tram Company, the company will soon adjust its routes and fares. Direct trams will run from Jing'an Temple to Hongkou stations, and the entire line will be temporarily divided into five fare stations. First class fares will range from 25 yuan to 65 yuan (each station will increase by 10 yuan). Third class fares will range from 15 yuan to 35 yuan (each station will increase by 5 yuan). The prices of trolleybuses are the same. This application is still under review by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. Mr. Backlock also said that starting next month, the salaries of employees will be increased, but new vehicles will be temporarily suspended due to insufficient funds.

The reporter recently inquired with the person in charge of the Huashang Electric Company and learned that the restoration of the company's Nanshi tram is being negotiated by Chairman Du Yuesheng. It may be possible to first lay part of the tracks and start operations early.

Rectifying Order

According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, tram stops in the city are unusually crowded, and the order is chaotic. In addition to instructing the British and French tram companies to send people to take care of passengers getting on and off at important stations, the Public Utilities Bureau has also sent letters to the Military Police Corps and the Municipal Police Department to send police and military police to assist in maintaining order.

Regarding the trial of traitor cases, the High Court here has established a temporary court within the Tilanqiao Prison yesterday, specializing in the trial of various traitors. The court is named the Collegial Panel, and is presided over by Court President Liu Yugui and judges Cao Jie, Cao Jun, and Zhu Zonghai. It is scheduled to formally interrogate traitors at 2:00 PM today. The first case to be tried is traitor Chen Riping, who had previously been tried in the High Court.

(Our Newspaper News) British lawyer Gan Deyun, who was previously expelled from British nationality by the British authorities, served as a "Legislative Member of the Puppet Organization." After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he changed to Chinese nationality and published English publications for the Japanese side. Recently, the Mountain Military Authorities arrested him for the crime of traitor and transferred him to the High Court the day before yesterday. At 11:00 AM yesterday, the prisoner was escorted to the High Court Criminal Division in Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for a preliminary hearing.

### Allied Headquarters Deputy Chief of Staff Returns Home

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai US Military Headquarters recently announced that Brigadier General Olmsted, Deputy Chief of Staff of the China Theater Allied Headquarters, is scheduled to fly to the United States today. His position will be temporarily filled by Colonel Cade. Mr. Olmsted joined General Wedemeyer's staff this year in January, commanding operations with great merit. Before taking on this position, Mr. Olmsted served as the commander of the Allied G5 team, and planned and coordinated the use of the Hump air transport, the Stilwell Road, and the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act. His assistance to General Wedemeyer extended beyond military matters to include military supply, and political and economic aspects, especially in directing Allied activities behind enemy lines. The G5 team flew to various Allied concentration camps at the end of the war to provide assistance and aid to prisoners of war, much of which was based on Mr. Olmsted's plans. After returning to the United States, Mr. Olmsted will be stationed at the Allied Military Department in Washington, assisting in the demobilization of the Allied forces. However, Mr. Olmsted himself has expressed a desire to retire early and engage in business.

### United Press Reporter Describes the Trends of Japanese Residents in Shanghai

A Portion Actually Resists Democracy

According to a report from the United Press in this city: The re-education movement for Japanese residents in Shanghai has been underway for nearly two months and is now facing serious secret resistance. The leniency of the Chinese authorities initially moved the Japanese to deep gratitude, but this has gradually faded. It is said that a small number of powerful Japanese are engaging in various secret activities to resist the Chinese authorities' efforts to instill democratic thought into the minds of the 90,000 Japanese concentrated in northern Shanghai. Another small portion of Japanese openly advocates abolishing the emperor system and fervently supports MacArthur's plan to control Japan. However, these Japanese are too few in number to influence Japanese society, as the majority are psychologically inclined to accept militarist ideology. According to well-informed sources, the Japanese engaged in secret resistance can be divided into four factions, all of whom are vying for leadership in the Japanese community and are unwilling to yield to each other. It is said that the extreme nationalist faction among the Japanese has formed a commando team, which includes many former members of the Japanese military police.

### British Ships Loaded with Goods Shipped to Hong Kong and Shanghai; British Merchants Eager to Resume Business

British Information Service, London, 17th: After a four-year hiatus, Britain has resumed shipping goods to China by sea. Two ships bound directly for Shanghai are being readied for departure. Another two or three ships are en route to Hong Kong. However, the tonnage of British ships and the quantity of goods are still very limited. One of the ships arriving in Shanghai is newly completed and specifically designed for navigation in the Far East seas. However, it is not yet possible to establish a precise shipping schedule between China and Britain. This is only a temporary phenomenon, and with a little more time, more ships will be loaded with industrial products, and a shipping schedule will be established. The goods and equipment currently being shipped to China are urgently needed by British trading companies in Shanghai to resume business, and London also recognizes clear evidence that China is buying machinery from Britain again. In the past few weeks, large quantities of cotton spinning machines and wool spinning machines have been ordered. China is also inquiring about machinery, automobiles, electrical machinery, steel plates, and other products from Britain. Britain is currently busy manufacturing materials needed by peacetime industries.

### Unlawful Japanese Prisoners Arrested

(Our Newspaper News) According to reporter investigations, some Japanese prisoners of war have been conducting underground activities. It is said that the person in charge is a Japanese major general. The day before yesterday, our single-police authorities, acting on a report, ordered the authorities to go to a certain place to destroy an organization. All the rioters were arrested, and a light machine gun, pistol bullets, magazines, and other items were seized.

### German Exiles Communicate with Relatives and Friends

According to post office sources: The Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications has, at the request of the British military occupation zone authorities in Germany, permitted German expatriates in China to communicate with their relatives and friends in the British military occupation zone in that country. However, only one letter is allowed per person per month, and it must be marked "German Exile" letter.

### Municipal Bureau of Public Works Repairs Roads and Removes Iron Gates

[Our Newspaper News] According to statistics from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the total length of roads in this city is more than 1,800 li, equivalent to three times the distance from Shanghai to Nanjing. The Bureau of Public Works is currently stepping up road repairs. Roads that will soon be completed include the City Center Road, Jungong Road, Songhu Road, Qimei Road, and East Tiyu Road. Roads that are currently under repair in the urban area include Yuyuan Road, Xinzha Road, Linsen Road, South Chengdu Road, and Jiangsu Road.

In addition, iron gates at the border between the Chinese area and the French Concession will also be removed in the near future.

### Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Actively Distributes Relief Goods; Charity Market to Open for Public Sale for Five Days Starting on the 20th

Ten relief ships sailing from the United States to China have arrived in Shanghai. It is expected that two more ships will arrive here within one or two days. The relief goods carried by the above ships, after being received by the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, have been allocated and distributed by the Shanghai Branch, including 60,000 tons of flour, 246 tons of military rations, 3,000 packages of used clothing, and medicines including 200 bottles of penicillin and DDT insecticide.

Relief to Chinese and Foreign Refugees Separately

According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Branch: In addition to the Chinese refugees, there are also 15,000 Jewish refugees, 2,000 White Russian refugees, and about 4-500 Italian sailors staying in Shanghai; in addition, there are some refugees from Central European countries. The relief goods distributed by the branch, with regard to Chinese refugees, are distributed by various charitable organizations and refugee shelters. For Jewish refugees, they are distributed by the United Relief Association, which is organized by the Jews in Shanghai. For White Russian refugees, they are distributed by the White Russian Association. The Italian sailors and refugees from Central European countries also have specialized organizations to apply for and receive relief goods from the Relief Branch, which are then distributed separately. The first batch of flour issued by the branch is of extremely large quantities, and the second batch of flour has also been decided to be issued within a short period of time. 8,000 boxes of military rations have been distributed to various charitable organizations and Jewish associations in the past few days.

Donated Used Clothing Varies in Type

As for the 3,000 packages of relief used clothing shipped from the United States, they were only unloaded from the ship last Saturday. Among them, there are extremely good suits and coats, as well as extremely worn shirts and skirts, and various scattered items such as socks, leather shoes, and even umbrellas. The clothing in each package of used clothing varies in type. This is because people from all over the United States voluntarily donate all their used clothing to refugees in China, so the clothes they donate are quite inconsistent. As the weather is turning cold, the Shanghai Branch has decided to distribute the above used clothing to the compatriots and refugees of various countries within days to protect them from the cold. It is said that they will also be slightly sorted out so that they can be distributed to meet the needs of the various refugees.

Penicillin is Carefully Claimed and Used

Regarding medicines, the Shanghai Branch has received 200 bottles of penicillin (100,000 units per bottle), which have been handed over to Renji, Hongren, Guangci, Red Tenth First, Municipal Second, Ximen Women and Children, Shanghai Children, and Gongji and other nine hospitals, and designated doctors are responsible for signing for them. The penicillin can only be injected if the patient must be treated with penicillin and drugs such as salvarsan have been used without effect. It is also stipulated that free treatment is only given to those who have been investigated and are indeed destitute. Otherwise, the fees are divided into three grades according to the patient's economic strength.

[Another News] When the materials loaded on the relief ship arriving in Shanghai are counted, there are often shortages. The reason is that the American factory fails to deliver the goods in time, and the relief ship cannot be postponed, resulting in inconsistencies with the original manifest. It is said that the missing materials will be transported to Shanghai for replenishment.

Charity Market Public Sale Items

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will jointly hold a charity market from the 20th to the 24th of this month at the original site of the former New Great Bank (corner of Guizhou Road and Tianjin Road, behind the New World Company, obtained for free). There are four types of items for public sale: (1) 10,000 bags of flour, each bag weighing 44 market catties (including the bag), 1,900 yuan, limited to two bags per person. (2) Pineapple, each can weighing one pound, 500 yuan, limited to four cans per person, a total of 648 pieces, each piece 24 cans, a total of 15,452 cans. (3) Pears, each can weighing six pounds and ten ounces, 2,500 yuan, limited to one can per person, a total of 498 pieces, each piece 6 cans, a total of 2,988 cans.

Huang Xuanping, Hu Guoliang, Xue Zhiliang, Yao Junzhi, and Liu Nianli were specially appointed as honorary members of the Su Bei Committee for the public sale of the above items.

### Feng Youzhen and Yu Wen Hosted the Press Yesterday

Feng Youzhen, representative of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai, and Yu Wen, special envoy of the Central Cultural Movement Committee stationed in Shanghai, jointly held a tea party at the Kang Le Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday to entertain the press in this city.

Mr. Feng's Report

Mr. Feng stood up to report, stating briefly: The Central Propaganda Department, as the National Government's return to the capital still requires some time, in order to maintain close contact with the Shanghai press and publishing circles, has specially appointed me as the representative stationed in Shanghai. I will do my best to serve the press in order to assist in the development of the Shanghai news industry. Currently, the Shanghai press has two major important issues: one is the paper shortage issue, and the other is the organizational issue of the press. Regarding the former, the Central Propaganda Department has already consulted with the headquarters of General MacArthur in Tokyo to purchase the newsprint stored in Japan and try to ship it to Shanghai to provide relief. It has also requested the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to purchase paper from Canada. Please notify me of the amount of paper that each newspaper needs to purchase, and I will forward it on your behalf to facilitate allocation. Regarding the organizational issue of the press, before the war, there were two groups in this city: the Newspaper Association and the Reporter Association. The former was established by the newspapers to discuss business contacts, and the latter was organized by colleagues in the press. The persons in charge of the management departments of each newspaper are currently preparing to form a Newspaper Industry Association and are applying for registration with the Social Affairs Bureau. Several executive and supervisory committee members of the former Reporter Association in Shanghai have also submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval to restore the organization of the Reporter Association and organize a reorganization committee to be responsible for preparations, which has been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. Once the candidates for the reorganization committee are decided, preparatory work can begin. I hope that colleagues in the press will work together to expedite its establishment.

Mr. Yu's Speech

Mr. Yu stated briefly that the Central Cultural Movement Committee has decided to set up special envoys in ten major cities, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, in order to promote the cultural construction movement in the recovered areas. I have been appointed to work in Shanghai, and I hope that colleagues in the cultural and press circles will give me a lot of assistance. In order to reward cultural workers for their hard work and struggle during the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Cultural Movement Committee has recently drafted "Measures for Cultural Figures to Receive Medals," which will be implemented after being submitted to the Central Government for approval. Anyone who meets one of the four qualifications for receiving a medal as stipulated in the measures can apply for the medal. After the speech, the attending press raised opinions on applying to the Central Government for the allocation of official exchange rates to purchase art books from Europe and the United States, relieving the paper shortage, and improving the treatment of reporters. Mr. Feng promised to forward the opinions and consider them appropriately.

### Special Envoy Niu Yongjian Broadcasts: A New Style for Greater Shanghai; Taking Diligence and Steadfastness as the Center

The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Central Broadcasting Affairs Administration specially invited Mr. Niu Yongjian, the central special envoy for consolation of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, to give a lecture at the station at 7:45 PM yesterday (17th). The topic was "A New Style for Greater Shanghai," and the full text of the lecture is as follows:

Listeners, I am very honored to be invited by the Shanghai Broadcasting Station today to speak to you. However, what I want to say was all said by Mr. Ye Chucang the day before yesterday, and there are no new ideas to add. It is truly shameful to take some ordinary words, so-called platitudes, to respond to the invitation.

This time we came to Shanghai, following Chairman Chiang's instructions, we are to listen more to the people's words and actively seek

Civil Suffering

Communicate the Central Government's good intentions and hope that the people will have a deep understanding of the Central Government's painstaking efforts in administration, and bring the situation of civil suffering back to the Central Government for consideration, so that administrative improvements can be made and the Central Government and local areas can be strongly united, working hard and forging ahead on the road to building the country, in order to achieve the goal of building a prosperous, strong, and happy new China.

I remember Mr. Chu Cang said the day before yesterday that Shanghai is the gateway for China's transportation with the world, and its politics, economy, culture, education, society, and everything else not only have a great impact on China, but also affect the whole world. Therefore, Shanghai must become a model area, and we must

Everyone Works Hard

In order to live up to our responsibility as Shanghainese. These words really moved us very much. I am a Shanghainese, so I am willing to follow the Shanghai masses to work together to fulfill my due responsibility.

The current Shanghai, thanks to the joint efforts of the Central Government, the Municipal Government, and people from all walks of life, although it has only been a little over three months since its restoration, it has made considerable progress, which we admire. However, after the pain, the losses caused by the war and the plunder by the enemy and puppets are still

Scars Everywhere

The current problems are numerous, such as the high prices, the difficulties in people's lives, the destruction of factories, or being taken over and not yet resuming work, resulting in the unemployment of workers, the lack of materials, and the need for urgent management of education, economy, and industry and commerce. Also, it is unavoidable that the behavior of a few personnel is not up to par, or the considerations are not complete, or the handling is improper, leaving room for criticism, which is the inevitable fact after eight years of heavy destruction by the enemy and puppets. The Municipal Government is observing public sentiment and rectifying matters. After several days of investigation and observation, we have also learned a little about the outline. Now that we are working hard to build a democratic new China, we are very willing for everyone to

Speak Frankly and Without Reservation

As long as it is well-intentioned and constructive. Our coming this time is to represent Chairman Chiang in seeking public opinion, can everyone tell the truth? This is the only key to building a greater Shanghai. The past ills of various public and private undertakings in China are jealousy and whitewashing. Therefore, many people do not tell the truth and do not seek practical results. Because they do not seek truth or practical results, the impact extends to many important things concerning the nation and the country, and there are many things that only talk about the surface and never make actual progress. Therefore, things are not as good as others, which is the worst thing, and we must correct it. Everyone come to

Tell the Truth

In order to establish a new style. Telling the truth is the beginning of our new style. All other virtues and good deeds start from this. Because we can tell the truth, we can seek perfection, diligence, and steadfast practice, so we will go one step further, and we will offer the four words of diligence, steadfastness, and reward to everyone. This is the practical training that Chairman Chiang has always shown, and we must thoroughly follow it. Industry is diligent, so practical work is the fundamental work of excellence. If we can be diligent, then we can be excellent. People who can be active in production work can

Increase Production

Enrich materials. In the small sense, it can enrich personal enjoyment, and in the large sense, it can supply the needs of society and the country, fundamentally stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. In this environment, there will naturally be no corrupt or illegal behaviors. The direct and indirect effects of this diligence are truly limitless. If we can use the word diligence in learning, then we will be tireless, specialize in studying, and strive for excellence. The atomic bomb was created by diligence, so what are we afraid of not being able to do? So, with

Diligence and Steadfastness

Four words, that is a priceless treasure, inexhaustible. Building Greater Shanghai is our current great cause. At this time, when there is a lack of human and material resources, there are certainly many difficulties. However, the new style of diligence and steadfastness is like a panacea. Therefore, the progress of our work and the success of our cause can be as easy as turning a hand. Yongjian has been away from Shanghai for eight years because of his dedication to the Anti-Japanese War. This time, when I come to Shanghai to visit my fellow villagers, I have nothing to give as a gift. I would like to offer these four words of diligence and steadfastness as a gift to the elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters who have been reunited after a long separation, and to express my willingness to work together to help complete the construction of Greater Shanghai.

### The Weather Changed - An Introduction to the Xujiahui Observatory

The weather changed! The night before, everyone felt warm, but unexpectedly, after a night of drizzle, it suddenly became extremely cold yesterday morning. The north wind howled all day long, and the sky was filled with dust. People standing in front of the China United Building on Avenue Édouard VII, waiting for the No. 22 red bus, would have been blown over by the strong wind if they hadn't braced their legs. During the day, the reporter personally witnessed five pedestrians chasing after their hats in the strong wind. Rickshaws parked by the roadside were blown over, and several bamboo fences collapsed in the Avenue Joffre and Route Ferguson area. The small creek in Xujiahui was also half frozen, and not a single pedestrian on the streets of Shanghai was not stamping their feet from the cold!

The day before yesterday, the temperature was still in the fifties (Fahrenheit), but yesterday it plummeted to below freezing.

It was during this sudden change in climate that the reporter braved the needle-sharp wind and rushed to Xujiahui to visit the nationally renowned observatory.

More than Seventy Years of History

Those who care about the history of Chinese science should remember that in the 16th and 17th centuries, Matteo Ricci and Johann Adam Schall von Bell came from Europe to the Chinese court to serve as great scientists in the "Imperial Astronomical Bureau." The names of these two should be immortalized in Chinese history forever, but they only pioneered the trend; it was not until 1873 that the Jesuit Catholics officially laid the foundation for formal scientific research in China – they established universities, middle schools, orphanages, and vocational schools near Xujiahui, and the most valuable in science was the Xujiahui Observatory.

The observatory is located opposite the famous Catholic Church. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese did not interfere because it was considered "private property" belonging to the church, so it was not disturbed. After the victory, it was rumored that the military wanted to occupy it, but after explanation, they withdrew. To this day, the wooden sign at the gate still reads, "Private Property, No Visitors."

Inside the gate is a garden, and beautiful roses dance wildly in the wind. In the middle of the garden are more than a dozen steps, and above them is the observatory's office. Walking through the heavy bronze doors, one feels a sense of silence. Outside, the cold wind howls wildly, but inside, it is so quiet that one can only hear the "tick-tock" of the clock pendulum.

Meeting Father Long Xiangqi

The observatory's reception room is decorated very elegantly, with luxurious cushions on the rosewood kang, and several grand master chairs scattered in the center of the hall. Here, the reporter met Father Ernest Cherzi, the person in charge of the observatory. Father Long is Italian, but he also has a Chinese name, called "Guiqing." His titles are: "Director of Meteorology and Seismology, without salary, at the Xujiahui Observatory, Member of the International Meteorological Society, Member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Member of the International Radio Research Association." He has been in China for twenty-six years. Father Long and Vice President Weng (Yongyi) and Mr. Ding Wenjiang are old friends. The observatory is now entrusted by the highest government authorities and Vice President Weng to handle national meteorological observations and other related canine literature work. The weather reports published daily by the semaphore on the Bund are all supplied by the Xujiahui Observatory.

Considering the importance of the work of the Xujiahui Observatory and Father Long's position in the international scientific community, people would generally assume that he must have many assistants. But in fact, he only has one assistant! Every morning at 5:30, he gets up to listen to weather reports from various places by radio. This radio reception work is extremely difficult. The strength of the signal is unstable, there is a lot of interference, and the isolation is not clear. At first, he asked assistants for help, but they could not hear clearly, making things worse, so he simply did it himself. The reporter asked him, "Isn't that too tiring?" But the lean and agile Father Long simply stroked his gray-black hair and said, "This is a pleasure."

Achievements of Arduous Work

Stepping into the observatory's library, one suddenly feels insignificant. The walls are covered with bookshelves, stacked all the way to the ceiling. Father Long took out a thick "East Asian Meteorological Map" that was four feet long and three feet wide. This is the result of his recent work, which took more than two years and was published in 1944. It includes hundreds of different maps and tables, and it is truly an unprecedented attempt in the Far East. For agriculture, transportation, water conservancy, aviation, hydropower engineering, sanitation, and chemical engineering—the value of this map is unparalleled. Recently, after five years of research, he invented a new temperature table that can be used to predict the approximate climate of a certain day one or two months in advance using a very simple method. He knew about this cold snap two months ago. He predicted that there would be a cold snap one or two days after Christmas. He has already written a paper on this discovery and plans to send it to the United States for publication.

During this war, the Xujiahui Observatory had already applied its principles to meteorological research four years before the outbreak of the Pacific War, which was widely used in air transport. Recently, many people from the Allied forces who came to visit expressed great surprise!

Since its establishment, the Xujiahui Observatory has cultivated more than fifty meteorological talents, who are now scattered in Qingdao, Beiping, and other places. With the current development of the aviation industry, China is in need of a large number of astronomy and meteorological personnel. How many young people are willing to learn from this hard-working and meritorious priest, working silently and serving the country? The reporter cannot help but feel boundless respect for this scholar who has worked diligently for nearly thirty years. (Pingzhai)

For seventy years, the Xujiahui Observatory has been doing continuous practical work in science. Under the leadership of Father Long, it communicates with observatories around the world every day, reporting news. In particular, weather reports have contributed the most to navigation. This is the appearance of the Xujiahui Observatory.

### Cold Wave Strikes Shanghai, Temperature Plummets

At dawn yesterday, a strong north wind howled in the city, and the climate suddenly turned frigid. Thin ice began to form in the ditches, and the wind was so strong all day that many window panes were shattered. This cold wave is likely to linger today, and the severe cold is expected to continue.

A powerful Siberian anticyclone has concentrated over Mongolia and has invaded North China and this city.

Weather forecast: Over the Yellow Sea, clear and cold, with fog, turning extremely cold, northwest gale turning north, weakening by tomorrow night. Over this city: cloudy, with fog, colder, strong northwest wind turning north, gradually weakening. Over the East Sea: cloudy to overcast, rain, northwest gale turning northeast. Over the East Sea: extremely strong northeast wind around the Taiwan Strait.

### American Soldiers in Song

— Zhang Deqian

The bustling districts of Shanghai are filled with American warriors coming and going. They wear different uniforms, come from different regions. Some are pilgrims who have traversed the Ledo Road, some are explorers who have flown over the Himalayas, and some are Columbuses who have sailed across the Pacific. They have just left behind the soil of the Savage Mountain cliffs, the fog over the Jialing River, and the wind from the corners of Okinawa Island, and suddenly tumbled into the worldly affairs of this eastern metropolis.

Shanghai, the city where Eastern and Western cultures meet, feels very familiar to the American soldiers who come from inland China, as if they have returned to their homeland, at least curing half of their homesickness, while those who come from overseas find it very novel and magnificent—only one thing makes those unfamiliar guests feel regretful, that is, after searching all over this overpopulated city, they have not found the braids and bound feet that they idealize as symbols of Chinese culture.

Those who had been to China before the war, even if it was only for three or two days, were immediately dubbed China experts, and they honestly and unceremoniously regarded themselves as experienced guides, leading a group of younger brothers to hunt for curiosities in Chinese shops. As a result, the old stock in the shroud shops was snapped up, and the outdated water pipes that had long been neglected in a corner immediately became ten times more valuable, becoming treasures in the eyes of foreigners. After all, if they didn't bring some longevity-related items home, what would they use to show off to the priests in their parishes and their long-separated loved ones, to make them believe in the exotic tales they told?

Tommy is going back to his country tomorrow, and in his happy mood, some melancholy is inevitably mixed in—he is a little reluctant to part with the charming White Russian Paulina. In the bar exuding an American atmosphere, he and she drink the last glass of wine together. Paulina lovingly takes out a CRB, signs her name, and hands it to Tommy, saying, "Please don't forget this little souvenir brought back from China." Look, it's a large bill of ten thousand yuan! Tommy shyly takes out a twenty-dollar (how ashamed) American bill, also signs his name, and hands it to her, saying, "Please keep it too." Hopefully she can keep it!

Joe is a foodie. He has already learned to play with chopsticks as well as the Chinese, and can distinguish the characteristics of Cantonese cuisine and Sichuan cuisine. He knows that even in San Francisco, New Orleans, or even New York, he can't necessarily eat as much to his liking as in Shanghai. On the eve of his departure from Shanghai, he is going to have a hearty meal.

The unlucky one is Bob. Not only can he not bring some oriental souvenirs home, but even the Parker pen and Hamilton watch he brought from his hometown have fallen into the hands of stateless gold-digging girls. Strolling on Nanjing Road in the cold night, having thrown the last firecracker, recalling the heroic spirit of the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the boldness when he first arrived in Shanghai, reflected in the loneliness at this moment, he couldn't help but feel a myriad of emotions. Feeling his pockets, he still has a CRB of five thousand yuan. He uses it to exchange for a Chinese evening newspaper (that's right, this is also a very valuable souvenir); he then happily strides (he doesn't have the money to take the tricycle he likes) towards the Bund.

American soldiers come and go in droves. They quietly leave this fantastical and chaotic eastern city, each with different emotions of joy and sorrow, and return to the embrace of their motherland. Let us bless these innocent big children to always maintain their vigor, and wish them a safe journey!

In the fall of 1943, Peng De was subjected to an absentee indictment in the United States. In May of this year, he was captured by the militia in northern Italy. He was not escorted back to the country from Italy until November 18 of the same year; he also left behind a concubine, two sons, and an 86-year-old mother in Italy. This is the first case of treason leaked via radio waves in the United States. When he was sent to the prison in the American capital, he was still saying: "In the age of radio, if there is no freedom of speech on the radio... then I will die for an idea...".

### Eternally Discriminated Against Black People

— Shen Yin

In the democratic country of the United States, black people have always been discriminated against. During this war, they went on expeditions to various parts of the United Kingdom and built a lot of special achievements, but discrimination is still unavoidable. Racial concepts are indeed difficult to eliminate.

As soon as the black troops arrived in Wales, the mayor of Cardiff discussed with the American military officer: What methods should be used to "prevent" young girls from mingling with the black troops? The authorities do not blame the black people. They hate that the girls should not be with the black people, and the black people naturally feel discriminated against when the authorities simply do not allow the girls to be with them.

The attitude of the British towards black people also varies from place to place. Generally, in small towns where there are no American soldiers stationed, the residents are much more affectionate. They are as indifferent to the black troops as they are to other troops, and gradually become familiar. Sometimes they invite black people to play in their homes, and the girls watch movies, dance, and joke with them. There are very few marriages, according to the American military authorities, there is only one case, but there have been a number of mixed-race illegitimate children discovered.

In some places, the residents and black people have a harmonious relationship because of the promotion of the Red Cross. As soon as the black troops arrive in a certain place, the Red Cross asks the local residents to cooperate and entertain the black people. The housewives often invite black people to dinner, and the Red Cross club also has dances, where American black people are all entertained, but most of the dancing is done by black people.

In Cambridge, there are both black people and American soldiers, and the attitude of the local residents looks somewhat different to the black people. Black people often quarrel. When they take white girls walking down the street, the police often stop them and advise them to go back. After the intervention of the Red Cross staff, these things no longer happen, but women who are with black people are often suspected of being prostitutes. In order to avoid misunderstandings and preserve their reputation, good women are not very dare to approach black soldiers after this.

In Ipswich, where the Eighth Air Force is gathered, dance halls often rotate every other day to entertain white people and black people. The black people say that this increases discrimination even more. Because when black people dance, there are several white soldiers watching next to them, originally they want to see clearly who is dancing with the black people, so that they can ignore those girls next time. White people also insist that girls who are with black people can be divided into two categories, one is those who have a fetish for black people, and the other is "semi-professional" prostitutes.

According to black soldiers stationed in London, the discrimination against black people by the locals is extremely deep. In hotels, they often charge higher prices when they encounter black people. Restaurants have empty seats, but when they see black people, they say they are full. Some public places close their doors to reject guests a little later. Some hotels leave a mark once black people have been there, and the next time they use that name to book a room over the phone, they will never be able to book it.

Some black people say that the discrimination they suffer in the United Kingdom is not as deep as they suffer in the United States. In the United States, they often have a sense of inferiority, but in the United Kingdom, they are treated equally. They may be disappointed when they return to the United States in the future, but they will no longer feel inferior. But some black people say that the British people's discrimination against them is only increasing day by day, mainly due to the influence of the American soldiers. Some discrimination can be avoided in the southern United States, but in the United Kingdom, it is simply unbearable.

Musings

### Vicissitudes

— Ke Ding𥂜

Recently, I rummaged through my old suitcase and found several old five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender notes that had been carefully stored at the bottom of the suitcase. Because I had picked out new ones to collect at the time, they are still crisp, the patterns are gorgeous, and the printing is clear.

These ten-yuan legal tender notes could buy a stone of first-class white rice eight years ago. But today, three months after the victory eight years later, a ten-yuan legal tender note can only buy a thin pancake. Eight years ago, a stone of first-class white rice was enough for a family of five to eat for more than a month; but today, a thin pancake, I don't know which corner of the hungry stomach it can be placed in!

Therefore, I only have the idea of appreciating these few different five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender notes that have been carefully stored for a long time, and I don't have the courage to use them. Fortunately, there is a large mirror frame, so I put it on black card stock, put it in the large mirror frame, and titled it "Vicissitudes" as an ornament for my Shanghai residence.

Book Review

### Life Is Ours

— Yu Xin'en

Mr. Liu Renjie's three-act tragedy "Life Is Ours" profoundly depicts the patriotic people who sacrificed for justice in this Anti-Japanese War, under the double iron hoofs of the enemy and traitors, bravely moving forward, passionately and resolutely, each completing their indelible great mission in this turbulent era. However, these patriots did not receive medals, nor did they receive high positions or titles, but they exchanged today's freedom and peace from the lives of these thousands of unnamed heroes.

Dr. Jiang, and his only son, Han, Dean Mendelssohn, Lin Yin, and Old Liu are all good people in the occupied areas, as the author said: "This world cannot tolerate good people." The author, with his professional relationship and literary talent, depicts Dr. Jiang and these characters in the play vividly; their patriotism and their sacrifices, under the extremely dangerous and difficult circumstances, their merits are no less than those of the group who received medals and high positions, but they are neglected in today's world.

The first act tells that Dr. Jiang, with the duty of a doctor, saves the life of Zhao, the president of the Great Traitor Association, who kills people without bloodshed, under a contradictory mentality. In the second act, Dr. Jiang and his only son, Han, are captured by President Zhao and subjected to torture and great humiliation for their patriotism. In the third act, the good people finally sacrifice at the hands of the wicked. Act by act, the emotions intensify, showing a clear contrast between good and evil, life and death, and the contradiction between killing and saving people. It is a singable and tearful, regrettable and sighable drama that fits the era and deserves our attention.

### New "Iron Lung"

— Bai Hua

The deeds of the iron lung were sensational before the war. With the progress of science and industry in recent years, a new "iron lung" has been introduced. The new iron lung is made of plastic, which is much lighter and more compact than the heavy and bulky steel machine.

The new plastic iron lung helps paralyzed patients breathe and promotes blood circulation in patients with heart disease, just as effectively as the heavy iron lung.

### The Enemy (19)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

But Sadao was rewarded that night when he searched for the little black dot in the sea at dusk. There was no flash of light in the twilight. The island was deserted. His prisoner was gone—doubtless safe. For he had warned him that he should wait only for a Korean fishing boat.

He stood for a moment on the veranda, gazing out to the sea from whence the young man had come that other night. And into his mind, though without reason, there came other white faces he had known—the professor at whose house he had met Hana, a dull man, and his wife had been a silly talking woman, in spite of her wish to be kind. He remembered his old anatomy teacher, who had been so insistent on mercy with the knife, and then he remembered the face of his fat and slatternly landlady. He had had great difficulty in finding a place to live in America because he was a Japanese. The Americans were full of prejudice and it had been bitter to live in it, knowing himself their superior. How he had despised the ignorant and dirty old woman who had at last consented to house him in her miserable home! He had once tried to be grateful to her because she had in his last year nursed him through influenza, but it had been difficult, for she was no less repulsive to him even in her kindness. Now he remembered the youthful, haggard face of his prisoner—white and repulsive.

Strange, he thought, strange that I could have killed him?

### The Number One Cultural "American Traitor"

— Ling Dai

At the time when the elder Zhitang was arrested in Beiping as a traitor, news also came from the United States that the number one cultural "American traitor" had been arrested and escorted to a prison in Washington, D.C.; this was Ezra Pound, formerly renowned in American literary circles as a poet. Pound was a famous poet who had always lived in Europe. His poems had been published in top-tier American literary journals. He was a stalwart of the American surrealist movement and had proposed the revolutionary "Image Movement" in poetry. From the 1920s to the 1930s, his status was more or less comparable to that of T. S. Eliot, and he was an idol for many young poets.

Pound was originally born in the mining district of Idaho, in the western United States, and was the son of a prospector. He felt that the American environment was not suitable for literary creation and that his talents could not be appreciated. Therefore, after a short period of teaching at a university in the central United States, he left the United States in 1908, lived in London for a while, then in Paris, and finally moved to the "Corner of the Azure Sea" in northern Italy, spending his life as a resident alien under the leisurely and antique Mediterranean coast with its azure southern skies. During this time, apart from his poems being published in American magazines, he rarely had the opportunity to return to the United States. In 1936, he discovered Mussolini's "greatness"; in the same year, he also wrote poems praising the leaders of the Nazi party as heirs to the American democratic tradition. In 1939, he returned to the United States and openly declared that fascist Italy was "more free than anywhere in the West."

After the outbreak of the European war, he could not receive royalties from Britain and the United States, so he appeared on the "Axis" radio waves. After the Pearl Harbor incident, he said to the American people on the radio: "The crime of participating in the war caused by the president's abnormal nerves is illegal." He also said to the American people: "No matter how you think you are under the leadership of Roosevelt or Churchill, in reality Hitler and Mussolini are your leaders." He also said: "How long you fight depends on Hitler's pleasure, depends on Japan's pleasure."

Social Services Anti-Tuberculosis Lectures

### Optimistic View of Lung Disease (Part 1)

Chinese Health Association

Editor's Note: In recent years, the number of patients with lung disease has been increasing daily, and young men and women are also easily infected. Confined to bed for years, the suffering is profound. This is greatly related to the health of the nation. In view of this, this column has specially invited specialized physicians from the Chinese Health Association to write a lecture on anti-tuberculosis, approximately three thousand words, to be published in four installments. We hope that patients will pay attention.

(1) To Drift Along and Be Content with the Status Quo is a Suicidal Policy for Lung Disease

People in cities often unconsciously suffer from lung disease, but they think their lungs are very healthy. They do not think about how to determine whether their lungs are indeed healthy, but allow the disease to develop secretly. Also, because the initial symptoms are very mild, they often do not notice them and pay no attention. It is not until the disease has progressed deeply that they become anxious, flustered, and blame others, without knowing that they have missed the opportunity for early and appropriate treatment. This is due to their own complacency. Such a trend toward a suicidal policy in unawareness is bound to lead to tragic results.

(2) There is No Specific Medicine for Pulmonary Tuberculosis

If there were a specific medicine for lung disease like 606 for syphilis or quinine for malaria, then the reduction of tuberculosis would be obvious, and we would promote it without hesitation. There is no reason to oppose the use of medicine to treat lung disease. However, Chinese people are dominated by two mentalities: a desire to save trouble and a desire to be content with the status quo. They tend to be superstitious about conditioning and taking medicine. In fact, apart from symptomatic effects such as stopping coughs and reducing fever, any medicine has no effect on the tuberculosis bacteria. Especially those medicines advertised, they mislead patients the most. Although such medicines are not directly harmful to the human body, they attract patients to take them for a long time, and easily miss the proper timing of treatment, to the point of being unrecoverable, spending countless amounts of money, and still sacrificing their lives. Is this not unjust and in vain?

(3) Coughing Up Blood from Lung Disease is a Happy Thing

When a patient with lung disease coughs up blood, it will inevitably cause some fear in the patient's mind. In fact, if a patient with lung disease has a hemoptysis phenomenon, it is a happy thing. Because in this way, one can seize the opportunity to seek medical treatment without hesitation. In today's developed medicine, stopping bleeding is not difficult, but after stopping the bleeding, do not forget the importance of fundamental treatment, in order to achieve the goal of completely curing lung disease.

### Notre Dame Infant Asylum Asks for Generosity from All Sectors

Saving Suffering Children with No Clothes and No Food

The Notre Dame Infant Asylum at 201 Pudong Road, Xujiahui, writes: "Respected Sirs, In recent years, our asylum has received much help from your esteemed newspaper, and we are deeply grateful for your generosity! Your esteemed newspaper has a prominent reputation and benefits the poor in society. It is truly accumulating merit and establishing a legacy. Our asylum is in financial straits, and we are in a state of anxiety as we are facing the possibility of not being able to make ends meet. Therefore, we are writing to you to appeal to people in society to donate generously. If you could publish the current suffering of poor children in winter who have no clothes and no food, it would awaken the enthusiasm of kind-hearted gentlemen and we would be grateful. Or, if you could introduce us to wealthy people in Shanghai to inspire a spirit of generosity, it would greatly benefit society. Many requests are made above, we feel extremely apprehensive, and respectfully implore. With best wishes, Notre Dame Infant Asylum."
