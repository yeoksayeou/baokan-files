Central News Agency Dispatch from Southern Front Base, 5th. American and Australian forces have landed at Balikpapan. Under the cover of intense naval bombardment and aerial bombing, they attempt to expand their beachhead and actively dispatch reinforcements to land. The Japanese garrison responds with accurate artillery fire, inflicting heavy damage. Simultaneously, they engage the enemy's powerful mechanized units, spearheaded by three heavy tanks and sixty light tanks, attempting to breach the Japanese first line of defense. Japanese troops bravely employ melee attacks. At one point, enemy forces manage to penetrate part of the defensive line, but through valiant Japanese fighting, the main enemy force is repelled by evening. The enemy, fearing Japanese night raids, retreats at night, avoiding a decisive battle with Japanese forces.

### Protracted Pacific War: Enemy American Strategy Frustrated, Military Commentator Discusses Enemy American Intentions

A certain military commentator in this city recently made the following statement regarding the enemy's future operational intentions:

Enemy American Tactics Stalled

After the enemy began their counteroffensive, the most active and prominent tactic was that of Nimitz. However, since the end of the Battle of Okinawa, it has entered a state of stagnation. The enemy forces in Okinawa suffered heavy damage from Japanese kamikaze attacks. Although the enemy is currently replenishing and repairing, it is still far from meeting the needs of a new operational fleet. Therefore, only small-scale mobile units have recently appeared in the Southwest Islands. A large-scale operation has not yet been realized. Especially for land operations, the enemy suffered unprecedented losses, resulting in criticism from various domestic quarters, and the argument that land operations should be undertaken by the Army. The enemy's boasted island-hopping strategy has also failed to hop quickly and has changed its approach to a step-by-step approach. On the other hand, MacArthur's base-advancing operational method, originally intended to invade Southeast Asia via the Philippines and the Chinese mainland, has now turned to Borneo and is currently fighting the Japanese army. The reasons for this move by the enemy are: first, the American mobilization has not been realized as hoped; second, the Chongqing army has failed to rapidly transform into a modern force. Therefore, before the European forces can be shifted to the Pacific, they must first cultivate combat power and seize resources.

Low Supply and Transportation Capacity

The American army, operating thousands of miles away, must have very low capacity in terms of the supply ships and transport ships required for replenishment. In the future, if they want to conduct long-term operations, they must have a self-sufficiency method. Therefore, they recently seem to have shifted their focus to the resources of the South, and are turning them into combat power. The enemy needs a considerable period of time to move European forces to the East. Before completing the concentration of forces for the next phase of operations, they are engaged in preparation work. For example, MacArthur appointed Lieutenant General Lichey, commander of the US Army forces in the Central Pacific region under Nimitz's Pacific area command, which is one example. Also, Admiral Kincaid, commander of the Seventh Fleet under MacArthur's command, which was originally operating in the Dutch East Indies, recently declared to reporters that the Seventh Fleet will be under the command of General Nimitz in the future. Therefore, the Army and Navy will fully participate in operations against Japan in the foreseeable future.

War Against Japan Will Be Protracted

In the past, Nimitz and MacArthur had two different strategies. In the future, the trend will be to merge them into one, with the Army and Navy taking charge of the sea and land respectively. Before the movement of European forces is completed and the supply lines are not fully established, the temporary operations are only part of the preparatory work and cannot have any significant activity. The United States originally hoped for a short-term decisive battle. Now that things have gone against their wishes, they have no choice but to engage in long-term operations. Therefore, President Truman requested that the movement of European forces be completed within ten months. Chiang Kai-shek also recently told reporters that the war against Japan will require at least eighteen months. Moreover, Vincent, Director of the US War Mobilization Bureau, said, "Although we are working hard to resolve the war as soon as possible, we must also consider the protracted nature of the war and the production situation." All these statements are worthy of contemplation.

Air Offensive Will Inevitably Unfold

Based on the above points, whether in the military or political sphere, Japan believes that the future decisive battle is still half a year or a year away. During this preparation period, the Japanese mainland will definitely become a fortress, and the entire population will be armed, cultivating a strategy for final victory. However, there are also things that we cannot underestimate in this year, that is, the enemy's strategic bombing will inevitably become more active. The exploits of Arnold's 20th Bomber Command in the Mariana Islands, and Doolittle's offensive of the Eighth Air Force, which occupied Okinawa, and the future destruction of Japanese cities or military production industrial areas, and the bombing of other places overseas, are all within Japan's understanding. Before the major operation is completed, these two offensives will inevitably unfold, but Japan is already prepared. Also, the number of Type 29 aircraft in the Air Force under Doolittle's command has increased. Areas that were not previously within the bombing range, such as Manchuria, Korea, and North China, will also be included in the bombing range in the future. However, the enemy cannot win by relying solely on air combat. Especially for the Japanese people, morale is high and unity is strong, and they are not afraid of enemy bombing at all.

Japanese Mainland Completed Fortress

The fortification of the Japanese mainland is based on the lessons learned from the islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in the past and is a strong fortress that cannot be broken. It is said that a certain underground factory in Japan can produce hundreds of aircraft per month. It can be seen that Japan's aircraft production is very promising. What is there to fear from enemy bombing? Japan will definitely be able to complete the production of invincible combat power and seize the final victory. Especially the Japanese people are full of the spirit of special attack to kill ten enemies with one, and firmly believe that the final victory will belong to Japan.

### Colonel Robarts Dies in Okinawa

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 5th. According to a New York dispatch, General Buckner, commander of the US Tenth Army, died on Okinawa Island on June 18th. According to a report from an embedded Associated Press reporter, Colonel Robarts, commander of the 22nd Regiment of the US Marine Corps' Sixth Division, also died there on the same day. The reporter reported as follows: Robarts, in order to rescue US Marines trapped and unable to advance due to Japanese artillery fire, went to a monitoring post to seek a road passable for tanks. After arriving at the post, he saw a charred soldier's body nearby and immediately advanced. Before reaching fifty feet, a bullet suddenly flew and pierced the Colonel's chest. The bullet was fired by Japanese soldiers in ambush.

### Sea Lion and Shikuka Islands Shelled by Submarines

Central News Agency Dispatch from Sapporo, 5th.

### Guangdong and Huaihai Provincial Governments Reform Institutions

Central News Agency Dispatch from Xuzhou, 5th. The Huaihai Provincial authorities previously established a political work group to assist in construction work, with Provincial Governor Hao concurrently serving as the head of the group and the first district commissioner concurrently serving as the deputy head. In order to strengthen work efficiency, personnel have been adjusted, with Zu Guohua appointed as the head of the group and Liu Jie as the deputy head of the group. The focus of work will be on the railway line to ensure the safety of the transportation line. Zu and Liu officially took office on the 1st.

Editorial

### Japan's Decisive Battle Politics and Extraordinary Legislation

Japan is standing at the juncture of the decisive battle on the mainland. The structure of Japanese politics, due to the implementation of the Wartime Emergency Measures Law, is fully equipped with the function of the decisive battle. To understand the characteristics of Japan's decisive battle politics, it is necessary to start with an analysis of the Wartime Emergency Measures Law.

In the extraordinary Diet session at the beginning of last month, the Suzuki Cabinet proposed the Wartime Emergency Measures Law with the greatest determination. Because the goal of the Wartime Emergency Measures Law is the overall renewal of the political realm, and the full concentration of government power. The Wartime Emergency Measures Law had to be proposed for the following reasons.

First, the Okinawa battle situation has become extremely urgent. The decisive battle of Okinawa is the prelude to the great decisive battle on the Japanese mainland. In order to quickly complete the mainland defense system, it is necessary to implement wartime emergency measures and take the most concise and effective methods.

Second, Japan has been implementing a controlled economy in recent years, and numerous laws and regulations have emerged, causing the problem of overlapping and redundant structures. Today, for the sake of quick decision-making and action, and to adapt to the decisive battle situation, it is necessary to exceed the power of existing laws, orders, and customs, and to act decisively and flexibly. Now, let's examine its legislative characteristics.

First, past Japanese control laws were based on the National Mobilization Law. When necessary, they were legislated by issuing imperial ordinances. However, this Wartime Emergency Measures Law is not subject to this limitation. Regardless of whether there are other regulations in the past, as long as the necessary orders are issued, they can be disposed of. Even cabinet orders and ministerial orders can be issued. Moreover, in the future, the Japanese administrative structure will inevitably be based on central planning and local implementation. Therefore, after the central government cedes part of its authority to the local governments, even if transportation is cut off during future battles, the local self-government function can be strengthened.

Second, the content includes: 1. Maintaining and increasing military production; 2. Securing food and other essential supplies; 3. Maintaining and enhancing transportation and traffic; 4. Strengthening defense and maintaining order; 5. Appropriateness of the tax system; 6. Post-war placement of war disasters; 7. Those designated by imperial ordinance as necessary matters for the concentration and development of other combat capabilities can be said to encompass the entire national life. Therefore, even if it is not a very powerful activation in form, it is legislation supported by the Diet, but in reality, the government can wait for the activation of extremely great power upon request, and thus be able to exert its enormous political power.

Third, for important emergency measures, the government, by imperial ordinance, consults the Wartime Emergency Measures Committee. The committee is generally composed of a small number of members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. Therefore, although it is handled by the government with full authority, it still maintains considerable contact with the people's representatives.

In short, Japan is at the juncture of the decisive battle on the mainland, and the political system of the decisive battle must be quickly established. The Wartime Emergency Measures Law is the high-level engine of Japan's decisive battle politics. After the Japanese army launched the final attack in Okinawa, although the surface of the battle situation was relatively calm for a time, the degree of emergency was increasing day by day. From the outline of this extraordinary legislation, we can see that the Japanese political structure has been completely renewed, and the power of the government has been fully concentrated. The Japanese government and the national will to fight will make the Japanese mainland a strong fortress.

### Clearing Corruption and Increasing Revenue, Zhejiang Rectifies Tax Collection, Industry and Commerce Associations Conduct Registration

Central News Agency Dispatch from Hangzhou, 5th. Governor Ding believes that local taxes and special consumption taxes have always been important sources of revenue in this province. However, in recent years, the burden of tax payment for local governments has been heavy, but the revenue of the provincial treasury has not increased significantly. It is inevitable that there have been corrupt and opportunistic events. In order to effectively rectify this situation, in addition to strictly adjusting the responsible personnel of local tax bureaus, he is also making efforts to eliminate corruption and ensure that the burden on the people is not increased, and the revenue of the provincial treasury is increased. As for the tax amount collected each week, it will be increased uniformly from July of this year, and all county magistrates and concurrently security brigade commanders are ordered to assist in the provincial treasury revenue as much as possible, and to instruct the chambers of commerce in each county to strictly prohibit merchants and people from evading taxes. In the future, the performance of county magistrates, security brigade commanders, and police chiefs will be assessed by the provincial government, and whether they have sincerely cooperated in the collection of provincial taxes will be listed as one of the important items.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Hangzhou, 5th. The Zhejiang Provincial Government's Construction Department believes that the government has implemented wartime economic control policies since participating in the war, and various trade associations are the basic institutions for promoting this policy. In order to improve the organization of these associations, to promote the development of industry and commerce, and to understand the industrial and commercial situation in various places, a registration of industrial and commercial associations throughout the province is being conducted. It is expected that through active rectification, the industrial and commercial associations in cities and counties can gradually get on the right track, and the social economy can become more stable in the future. In order to facilitate the application for registration and legally obtain licenses for industrial and commercial associations in various cities and counties, a specific application form format has been specified and sent to the municipal and county governments, instructing them to follow suit.

### Chen Gao Returns to Nanjing to Discuss Inspection Impressions

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th. Chen Gao, commander of the Central Military Police, previously went to Wuhu, Bengbu, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places to inspect the service conditions of military police in various places in order to understand the local military police service situation. He has now returned to Nanjing after completing his official duties. The reporter specially visited him on the 5th and asked about his impressions of this trip. He said as follows: In recent times, the situation has become increasingly serious, and ensuring local security is a top priority. The responsibilities of military police in various places are particularly important. I am responsible for the military police supervision mission, and recently went to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other places to inspect the service situation of the military police under my command, and to urge their work efficiency. The impression of this trip was quite good. The military police in various places are able to fulfill their responsibilities. In the future, I will further strengthen the military police institutions throughout the country to ensure local security and serve the country and the people.

### Guangdong Farm Bombed

Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou, 5th. At 11:30 AM on the 3rd, three enemy aircraft infiltrated from the northeast and dropped sixteen bombs on the Shipai Gongzhen Farm in this city. In addition to the destruction of the farm's water tower, two Gongzhen team members were killed and eight were seriously injured. The injured were immediately sent to the hospital for treatment by personnel from the fifth section of the Civil Affairs Department. It is said that the enemy aircraft ignored humanitarianism and invaded charitable institutions, and everyone expressed extreme indignation.

### Truman and Churchill to Go to Berlin Soon; Pence and Eden Will Also Attend

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Washington dispatch: The date of the Three-Power Conference has been hinted at in a speech by the new U.S. Secretary of State, Pence, who stated: "In the very near future, I will accompany President Truman to Berlin to participate in the Three-Power talks." A rumor from the Hendaye area on the Spanish-French border states that British Prime Minister Churchill will leave London by plane next Tuesday with his wife and daughters for Bordaos.

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A dispatch from London states that the British Foreign Office announced on the 5th that Foreign Secretary Eden had been ill previously, but has recently recovered and will be able to attend the Three-Power Conference.

The Old League of Nations to Dissolve in February or March

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to the *New York Times*, since convening for its last meeting in 1939, the Old League of Nations will hold a dissolution ceremony in Geneva in February or March. Although the new international organization claims to be established, complex legislative, administrative, and political procedures have not been implemented urgently. Therefore, the Old League must be dissolved. It is hoped that the new and old international organizations can work simultaneously in the shortest possible time and give greater development to the New League. The work undertaken by the New League rarely involves political work within the League. Currently, there are two matters that require attention during the Old League's meeting: first, the meeting will propose a request to endorse the work and activities carried out by the Supervisory Committee of the Old League of Nations during the war. Second, the meeting will send committee members to discuss work handover matters with representatives of the New League of Nations. Under these circumstances, two major difficult problems will arise. The first is that all the work of the Old League's committee includes as many as two to three hundred treaties, and the provisions in these treaties are executed by the League's organization. Some of these treaties involve the name of the League of Nations. However, changing the name of the Old League to the New United Nations organization is a simple change, so the issue of these treaties will be discussed in detail by international law experts in the United Nations. At the same time, a legal procedure is also required to conclude the trusteeship system of the Old League of Nations, and the New International League will replace it with a new method. Furthermore, the status of the International Labor Office should be determined, and since the new International Court of Justice has been established, how should the old International Court of Justice be formally dissolved? The second serious problem is how to dispose of the majority of the Old League of Nations' assets in Geneva. The Soviet Union opposed establishing the new international organization in Geneva, but this issue was not discussed in detail at the San Francisco Conference.

Zhejiang Materials Management Office Increases Management of Local Products

Hangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The province's local products and materials are known to be abundant, sold to the southeastern provinces and northern China, with staggering figures, making them a major source of wealth for Zhejiang Province. Since the incident, due to transportation, the circulation of these materials has not been as smooth as in the past. Since Governor Ding took office, he has deeply cared about the flow of these materials. In order to develop Zhejiang's resources and encourage the transportation and sales of Zhejiang's local products and materials to various places, in addition to designating six types of materials – local paper, tea, silk, flue-cured tobacco, and local wine – to be managed by the Zhejiang Local Products and Materials Management Office to facilitate transportation and sales by merchants, starting from June 6th, medicine, porcelain, mountain goods, and ramie will also be placed under the management of the office. It is also learned that starting from July 1st, various materials closely related to military use, such as oils and fats and their raw materials, as well as non-ferrous metals, bamboo, wood, firewood, charcoal, meat, and vegetables, will also be managed by the Local Products and Materials Management Office. The procedures are simple, providing merchants with great convenience.

### Guangdong Province Police to Increase Pay

Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The provincial government is committed to police work, but their pay is meager, and prices have risen several times over, which is a matter of great concern. Starting July 1st, police pay will be increased to stabilize their lives and encourage them to work hard. The specific measures for increasing pay will be announced in the near future.

### Wuhu to Handle the First Batch of Low-Priced Rice

Wuhu, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The county's survey of rice reserves and registration work has been completed. The total amount is more than 27,000 shi (石). According to the decision of the second session of the Price Stabilization Committee, 20% of the village rice will be extracted to serve as low-priced rice, which will be sent to the Price Stabilization Committee by county government personnel. The committee has decided to start selling the first batch of low-priced rice from the 6th, priced at 2,000 yuan per sheng (升). Each person is limited to purchasing six he (合) for large families and three he for small families per day, and purchases must be made with a rice purchase certificate.

### Australian Prime Minister Curtin Passes Away

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a dispatch from Canberra, Australian Prime Minister and Labor Party leader Curtin passed away yesterday morning at the age of 60. Curtin has served as Australia's Prime Minister and Labor Party leader since 1941.

### The Warsaw Polish Government Will Be Recognized by Various Countries

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, informed sources in London believe that the Warsaw Polish Provisional Government of National Unity will be formally recognized by the United Nations. The British and American governments recently received a notification from the Warsaw Polish administrative party, stating: "The establishment of the government has been completed, and we guarantee that our provisional government will abide by the provisions of the Yalta Conference to implement a free election system."

### Simla Conference Postponed; Bose Broadcasts to the Country

Shaonan, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, recently broadcast to India regarding the postponement of the Simla Conference, the main points of which are as follows: various Indian factions at the Simla Conference have tried their best to avoid an immediate solution and have adopted a postponement decision. In fact, this is only a superficial move. The Indian people can have ample time to judge the British intentions during this period. At the same time, it can eliminate the use of the Anglo-Indian compromise plan by Churchill and other Conservatives in the general election on the 5th. In the future, the Indian side can negotiate with Britain from a favorable position. It was a good strategy for Gandhi not to participate in the Simla Conference, but the danger period has not yet passed. It is said that Gandhi told a United Press reporter: "I sincerely hope that the Simla Conference will be successful and can solve the problem." I hope that the meaning of Gandhi's "solution" does not mean surrendering to Britain. It seems that within the conference faction, there are those who believe that if the British cannot compromise with the Muslim League, the Governor-General should mediate. However, it is absolutely impossible for the Governor-General, the highest authority of British imperialism, to mediate, because this kind of measure is an outrage that the Indian people cannot tolerate. We must pay attention to the attitude of the Muslim League. Jinnah told reporters that they want to accept Wavell's proposal because it makes the separation of India possible. We often believe that the Governor-General and the Muslim League are in cahoots, using insidious means to suppress the conference faction.

### Strictly Observe Light Control Regulations

Regarding the implementation of light control, the Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters has repeatedly issued statements urging citizens to pay close attention and prevent light from leaking. However, it is now summer, and the weather is hot, causing many residents and shops to be negligent in light control, which is dangerous. Based on past experience, the hotter the weather, the more frequent enemy reconnaissance planes are at night. Therefore, it is hoped that all citizens will abide by the notice issued by the Longhai Air Defense Headquarters on May 10 of this year and the statements issued by the Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters, and implement alert control from 10:00 PM to sunrise the next day, regardless of whether there is an air raid alarm, and implement preparation control from sunset to 10:00 PM.

### After Crackdown on Check Drafts, Discounting Gradually Disappears

In order to eliminate the development of empty check drafts and crack down on the evil practice of discounting to maintain finance, the Central Reserve Bank, all clearing banks, and members of the money industry association stopped developing check drafts from the 3rd. Starting from the same day, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Reserve Bank, in addition to cash, parallel money immediate notes could be issued to customers for payment. The Central Reserve Bank, in order to adjust the market's cash needs, specially increased the issuance of 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan new banknotes from the 3rd, gave special cash payments for the salaries of employees of various financial institutions and all expenses, and increased the amount of cash that each bank could withdraw based on the total amount of deposits. The amount of cash that can be withdrawn daily must not be accumulated. The Central Reserve Inspection Office sent personnel to continue to conduct strict inspections in accordance with the regulations. It is reported that after the Central Reserve Bank took this decisive measure, the wind of discounting has slowed down slightly in the past two days, and the discount has also fallen a lot.

### Piles of Garbage in Various Districts – Steps Being Taken to Clear it Up; Director Yuan of the Health Bureau Talks About Disposal Measures

Recently, piles of garbage in various districts of Shanghai have accumulated into mountains. It is summer, and the impact on public health is significant. The police authorities are also very concerned about this issue. The Second Section discussed it at a meeting of the Second Sections of various sub-bureaus and decided to contact the health authorities to discuss measures to clear it up. A reporter visited Director Yuan of the Health Bureau yesterday to ask about the disposal measures. He said:

Garbage Piles Being Cleared Up

Regarding the garbage clearance issue, the health authorities are very concerned and are actively taking steps to clear it up. Before the war, the authorities sent workers to take garbage trucks to various garbage docks, and then contractors transported the garbage by boat to the suburbs. Today, transportation is difficult, resulting in the accumulation of garbage. We are now planning a proper solution, urging contractors to find ways to transport it away, and strictly ordering garbage workers to actively clear it up. It should all be cleared soon.

Unified Management of Feces Clearance

When asked about the issue of feces clearance, he said: The city's feces cleaning business has always been contracted by merchants in different districts. Because of the separation of powers, management was difficult to perfect. Therefore, starting this spring, in order to unify the city's administration and implement the purpose of unified management, with the approval of the municipal government, the contractors merged and organized the Yongda Cleaning Company to uniformly contract the business. The scope of the contract includes the old First, Eighth, and Southwestern City districts, as well as Zhabei and other districts. The results of the cleaning work have been very satisfactory, and there has been no obstruction to the guidance of the authorities. In short, the health authorities are constantly striving for perfection in the city's public health issues.
