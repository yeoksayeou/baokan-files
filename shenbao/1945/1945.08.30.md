The General has been imprisoned by the enemy for three and a half years and has now been liberated. We are especially pleased to welcome the General to China. The Chinese people respect General Wainwright, and his fame will not only remain in the history of the United States but will also be recorded in our Chinese history."

### Sino-American Loan Negotiations Underway

London, Reuters, 29th: The report regarding China, the Soviet Union, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands requesting the establishment of a contract lasting 30 years to purchase American goods is not true. France, Belgium, and the Netherlands had such agreements long before the Lend-Lease Act ended. Negotiations between the United States and China and the Soviet Union are still underway. Yesterday, the Soviet delegation visited Mr. Crowley, the Director of the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration. Mr. Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan of China, also had several meetings with Mr. Crowley. No country has expressed a willingness to sign an agreement with the United States regarding the purchase of American goods based on a 30-year contract. It seems that each country may obtain large loans from the Export-Import Bank. It is expected that the United States will provide fair credit loans to each country to replace any agreements requiring cash payments. China may obtain a loan of US$2 billion for two years of construction. At the same time, Mr. Crowley has also allocated US$1 billion in bank funds to the Soviet Union.

### Foreign Press Conference; Foreign Minister Wang Speaks; Sino-Soviet Cooperation is a Cornerstone of Peace

Chongqing, 29th: A foreign press conference was held at 3:00 PM on the 29th, hosted by Foreign Minister Wang. First, he expressed his views on the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and related documents have been announced. This treaty resolves many important and complex issues, which I believe you are all aware of. What I personally find particularly gratifying is that in the long negotiations discussing these many issues, both sides were always considering each other's viewpoints with sympathy. The reason for this is that both sides have a strong desire to seek closer cooperation and mutual respect. The world has undergone many dramatic changes in the past few years, but this desire for cooperation and mutual respect between China and the Soviet Union has not been shaken by any world changes. This is one of the most fortunate things. The terms of the treaty are certainly very important, but even more important is the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect that lies behind the text of the treaty. The Sino-Soviet agreement will certainly be a cornerstone of world peace and security. As Commander Stalin told me, this treaty benefits not only China and the Soviet Union, but also the entire Asia and the world."

Striving to Resolve the KMT-CPC Issue

Wang continued, "Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Zhou Enlai arrived in Chongqing yesterday. Regarding this matter, I have no further explanation at this time, but I can solemnly tell you that the government will do its utmost to achieve internal peace and national unity. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to you all for your past cooperation with me and to inform you that within the scope of my new duties, I will continue to do my best to facilitate your work, and I hope that you will continue to assist me."

### General Jiang Bocheng, as Representative, Continues to Console Allied Nationals in Concentration Camps

General Jiang Bocheng, Representative of Chairman Chiang in Shanghai, invited Ambassador Yen Hui-ching and six others to represent him in visiting and comforting the foreign nationals in various concentration camps. They visited the three camps on Longhua, Zhabei, and Lincoln Road the day before yesterday morning. Yesterday morning from 8:00 AM, they continued to visit three other concentration camps in other districts. When they crossed the Huangpu River to visit the Pudong concentration camp, five American planes happened to be flying overhead. The Allied nationals in the camp cheered and the riverboats sounded their horns. The representatives proceeded to offer their condolences in this lively and tense atmosphere. The Daxilu camp they visited held 459 Allied nationals, mostly former Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) staff and teachers from Western schools. The Yangshupu camp held 1,198 people, and the Pudong camp held 1,100 people. Mr. Crow, former Principal of the Hanbury Public School, Mr. Robertson, former Acting Chief of Police of the SMC, and Mr. Ault spoke on behalf of their respective groups. They also wished General Jiang Bocheng a speedy recovery. After Mr. Yen's speech, the Allied nationals cheered and applauded thunderously. Then, Mr. He Dekui was also invited to speak, as many of the Allied nationals in the three camps were old friends of his. The translated version of Mr. Yen's speech is recorded as follows:

Mr. Yen's Speech

The delegation I represent was organized by General Jiang Bocheng, the representative of Chairman Chiang in Shanghai. General Jiang is unable to come to the camps in person due to illness, so he invited myself and others to convey Chairman Chiang's condolences. Since the sudden end of the Pacific War, Chairman Chiang has been deeply concerned about the Allied nationals in the concentration camps in China and is eager to inquire about your recent situation. (Mr. Yen explained the nature of the delegation and introduced each representative.) He continued: At this moment, words and language are insufficient to express our feelings. We deeply understand your unfortunate experiences in the camps, the long loss of freedom, and the physical and mental suffering. You have been isolated from the world and separated from your compatriots and relatives in your home countries. What is most regrettable is that you were deprived of the opportunity to serve your home countries during the war. (The Allied nationals answered in unison, "Yes," with thunderous applause.) However, your strong sacrifices have also become a major factor in contributing to your home countries. During the period of confinement, some Allied friends in the camps unfortunately passed away. We should pay tribute to their spirit of sacrifice and their unwavering faith in God. Now that the nightmare has passed and light and hope have arrived, "forgetfulness" is the only natural way to eliminate unpleasantness, and I would rather offer "forgiveness" to the enemy. Without this spirit, life on Earth, with its weaknesses and evil thoughts, would be unsustainable. Most of you have lived in this second homeland for many years and have always assisted our country and people with a friendly heart.

China is now embarking on the road to revitalization and needs all possible assistance. With your knowledge and experience, I firmly believe that you will continue to provide us with valuable contributions. You may need to rest and recuperate in China or return to your home countries afterward, but I am confident that you will return to China to help with our reconstruction efforts. Furthermore, we firmly believe that the new alliance formed by peace-loving nations has succeeded in curbing aggression and permanently eliminating terrible wars. We hope that the "peace on Earth" proclaimed two thousand years ago may become a reality.

### Two Commissioners from the Central Organization Department Arrive in Shanghai

### Special Inspector Liu from the Ministry of Education Issues Statement

Liu Shaozhong, Special Inspector of the Ministry of Education for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and issued the following statement yesterday: I have been ordered by the Ministry of Education to supervise educational affairs in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. Chief supervisors were originally stationed in the administrative regions of each province to carry out secret supervisory work. Since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered to our Allied countries, I have been ordered to station in Shanghai to handle educational supervisory work. On behalf of the Ministry of Education, I extend my sincere condolences to the educators who have endured hardship, remained loyal, and remained unchanged from beginning to end. Education is a cultural undertaking, and educators are social leaders. At this time of transition between military and political affairs, and with the chaos of personnel matters, a moment of carelessness can easily lead to regrets. The points that should be noted are as follows:

(1) All middle and higher schools, whether public or private, must register. Registration forms have already been prepared. Schools at all levels in Shanghai should register with this office. Other provinces, cities, and districts should register with the chief supervisors, supervisors' offices, or巡敎團 각队部 in their respective provinces and cities.

(2) Before the takeover of all levels of schools established by the puppet regime, all school property, equipment, books, documents, and other public property must not be moved without authorization. If there is any loss or sale, once discovered, the person originally in charge will be severely punished according to law.

(3) All new and old bookstores, second-hand shops, and private individuals must not purchase items owned by Japanese puppet schools and cultural organizations at all levels. Once discovered, not only will the purchased items be confiscated, but they will also be severely punished.

(4) Finally, I hope that the responsible persons of schools and social education institutions at all levels will comply with the 14 articles of the Educational Rehabilitation Work Measures for Recovered Areas recently promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Other issues to be decided will, I believe, soon have more detailed instructions from the central educational authorities.

### Three Municipal Affairs

— Cheng

The municipal administration of this city, especially in terms of public health, should be actively maintained until the new authorities have formally taken over. Moreover, there will soon be large-scale victory celebrations, making the cleanliness of the city even more important. The following three things should be noted:

(1) Street lights on thoroughfares should be restored to their pre-war brightness. The former International Settlement has been gradually restored, and the Nanshi and former French Concession should also be universally restored. It is hoped that the utilities department will pay attention.

(2) Many air-raid shelters have not been filled and contain dirt and filth. This is not only unhygienic but also unsightly due to the unevenness of the ground. It is hoped that the 保甲 will pay attention and persuade citizens to clean and fill them.

(3) Some road surfaces are uneven. Road maintenance should not be interrupted. It is hoped that the public works department will pay attention. Furthermore, the urine and feces on some roadsides are harmful to public health. It is hoped that the police and health departments will pay attention to correcting this.

### "Drifters" Two Years (Middle)

— Yan Fu

Six to seven hundred people had arrived at the institution before us, and we were almost the last second or third batch.

Within this group of dregs, there were university students, primary school students, civil servants, wealthy merchants, peddlers, and city slickers. There were people from all over the country... When we first entered the institution, we were confined to the district quarters and not allowed freedom.

The district quarters were a long corridor, with forty or fifty rooms lined up on both sides. High up in the corridor, on both sides were glass windows, and each room also had windows, so the air and light were plentiful. The district quarters also had access to two dining halls, washing facilities, and latrines, all well-equipped, so eating, drinking, sleeping, washing, and disposing of waste were all available in the district and there was no need to go outside.

We were all shaved bald and dressed in blue cloth shirts and trousers. In the rooms, straw was spread on the floor for bedding, with blue cloth blankets and blue cloth sheets, covering the entire room in blue. After entering the institution, I felt that life was extremely boring. Simple and primitive, it made me not believe that I was living in the 20th century, the pinnacle of scientific civilization!

My roommates all had scabies, and the room reeked. The thick pus was smeared everywhere, making my heart tremble!

"Those with scabies line up for bathing!" someone shouted in the corridor, heard throughout the district quarters.

"............" Only the rustling sound of movement could be heard.

Forty or fifty people lined up in the bathroom, all naked, some sitting, some lying down, some standing sideways, some leaning, reminding me of Li Longmian's painting of Arhats. It was truly a spectacle. A large bath, with steam rising to the skylight, and the smell of stinky medicinal water spreading in the water. I immediately saw ΧΧ standing up, with his skin from his feet to his buttocks covered in red and black scabies, looking like the claws of a five-clawed golden dragon from afar. Some had it growing straight from below the navel to the thighs, like wearing a grass skirt. His whole body was mottled like a leopard. The pool water was covered in a greasy film. I stood for a while, and the fishy, stinky smell made me nauseous, so I had to go outside to change.

I pondered: This can truly be said to be a corrosive life!

Everyone returned to their rooms and lay down, applying yellow ointment and scratching the scabies that had just turned red from the hot water, diligently and murmuringly, everyone talking and laughing, as if they had just been baptized with holy water.

"We are all people fallen from the ends of the earth, why must we have known each other before?"

We spent two or three months like this. Everyone became much more familiar. Every day, besides eating and drinking, we just lay around leisurely, returning to the dreams of childhood, no, searching for the lost sweet dreams.

Soon, the institution established "Agricultural Arts Area," "Industrial Arts Area," and "Special Area." The workshops in each area began to work, and the sick gradually recovered over time. Work was assigned, and I entered the grass weaving section of the Industrial Arts Area to learn to weave grass bags.

"Labor is sacred," I kept thinking in my heart. I got up very early every day, with the morning stars shining coldly, or a white, misty fog falling, and frost accumulating before the steps. After breakfast, it was not yet bright, and after a short rest, work began. In this way, one by one, strands of rice straw were brought into the wooden machine. The wooden machine being stepped on made a crisp sound, mixed with the rumbling sound of the grass rope making machine. The sunlight lazily came out, scattering the thick frost at the edge of the eaves, scattering the misty white fog, and reflecting the flying grass debris inside the workshop through the window sills.

"Labor is sacred!" I kept thinking in my heart, constantly comforting myself.

During snowy nights, and cold rainy mornings that pricked at the skin, I missed my own background, and thought of the poor and weak who had been turned into gullies by the high pressure of life. How could this not make my heart tremble, making me feel the warmth of mutual assistance between people. Although people occasionally escaped from the institution, I was weak. I was already tamed, tamed like a lamb. The raging fire could never ignite my dead heart.

### To the Youth of Shanghai

— Xi Kai

Dear young people of Shanghai:

We have been separated for eight years! In distant places, in these difficult and arduous eight years, we have always been thinking of you! It is said: "When a scholar has been away three days, he should be looked at with new eyes!" Thank heaven, the day for looking with new eyes has finally arrived!

But you have left us utterly surprised. In the eight years since, the times have progressed, and the people of the rear have also progressed, but we do not see progress in you. You still love to enjoy yourselves; you still lack the spirit of hard work and struggle. "You" are still the "you" of eight years ago. Dear young people of Shanghai, you have been asleep for eight years!

In the southwest, blocked by mountains and passes, there also live many of the "you" of eight years ago. They also enjoyed themselves and lived in complacency. But in these eight years woven with blood and tears, they have all been willing to endure hardship and willing to struggle. I must apologize and say that they are more accomplished than you and more worthy of expectation. They often say spiritedly: "We want to compete with the people of our hometown!" Friends, I can't help but feel worried for you.

Now the bells of victory have awakened you from your slumber. After celebrating and cheering, you must also have been imagining your own bright future. Indeed, now that the final victory has arrived, a bright future belongs to every young person in China. But a bright future is not something that can be achieved overnight; it still belongs to those young people in China who are willing to endure hardship and willing to struggle. Therefore, I say to every young person in Shanghai, I ask you to redouble your efforts in time!

In the near future, many of the "you" of eight years ago will return to their homeland. When they tip their hats, bow, and shake hands with you, they will never forget the cry of "We want to compete with the people of our hometown!"

So, dear young people of Shanghai, are you ready?
