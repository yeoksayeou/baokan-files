Ryukyu Islands, 12th (Central News Agency) – Since the end of May, enemy forces in the southern area of Okinawa Island have been gradually advancing southward from the Yonabaru area, increasing pressure on the Japanese defensive positions at Shuri and Naha. Japanese forces have withdrawn their battle lines, inflicting heavy damage on the pursuing enemy, and are now defending established strongholds in the Ozato area and the Shimajiri district in the south, continuing their brave resistance.

### A Glimpse of the Hardships of the American War Against Japan

Former Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – A diary was found in the uniform pocket of Navy Lieutenant Sulaofu, a pilot from the U.S. 38th Mobile Task Force's 4th Air Group carrier "Shangri-La," who was shot down by Japanese fighters in the Southwest Sea. According to the diary, the enemy is suffering immensely. Sulaofu was the flight leader, and his unit had 12 aircraft. He had accumulated a total flight distance of 3,600 hours. Sulaofu was born in Ohio and had fought against German fighters on the European front. This was his first deployment on the Pacific front. One page of the diary stated that the "Shangri-La" was fully supplied and arrived at Ulithi on the 23rd, berthed for a week, and then sailed to Okinawa, later returning to Ulithi once. On April 26th, it departed again for Okinawa to participate in operations there. Due to a shortage of ships and extremely difficult food conditions, the "Shangri-La" did not have sufficient food supplies, especially meat, alcohol, and cigarettes. At Ulithi, he first saw six aircraft carriers, two of which were immobile and four of which were heavily damaged. The second time, there were four aircraft carriers docked, all of which were severely damaged, almost entirely by Japanese kamikazes.

### The Inside Story of the Blind Obedience of Tens of Thousands to the Xiantian Dao Sect

— Yu Yu

Frequent Riots Occur

The local Wang Bingshan's troops are their only object of hatred. The reason is that Wang's troops collect heavy taxes in the area, fifteen pounds of rice per mu, in addition to other miscellaneous taxes. The initial spark was this, but later the members of the sect became complex, the command and guidance were not unified, and those in charge were unable to control the situation. This was followed by the "Changjing Bridge Incident" on March 3rd, the "Zhu Family Lane Incident" on March 4th, the "Yangjian Incident" on March 26th, and the "Fangqian Town Incident" in April. In just one or two months, numerous incidents have occurred.

Secondly, other nearby troops, such as Bao Hansheng and Zhang Xiaoguang, as well as the corrupt officials who levied heavy taxes, the district, township, and bao chiefs, and the local bullies, as long as they were usually cunning and extortionate, and helped the wicked, were all targets of their revenge, and many were captured and killed by them. Since their power expanded, they have not paid any field taxes, levies, or military and police supplies. The other side, intimidated by their power, dares not go to the countryside to urge payment of legitimate income.

Spreading to Jiangyin and its Vicinity

In the Jiangyin area, since the beginning of March, it has gradually spread from the Anzhen area of Wuxi, through Donghutang and Huangtutang, to Changjing Town and other places. Because the purpose of the Xiantian Dao sect is to resist taxes and levies, it is extremely attractive, and many people have joined. By the beginning of April, it had spread to Zhutang in the fourth district and Xuejia Lane in Zhouzhuang in the second district. In particular, almost all the farmers in Xuejia Lane were attracted and became members of the Xiantian Dao sect. Thus, on the one hand, they concentrated blacksmiths from various towns in Xuejia Lane to rush to make broadswords. Each person prepared their own funds, and those who were poor used their farm tools as weapons. Every day, they stood guard around the villages and towns, like regular troops. Another extremely tragic event occurred on the morning of April 11th, when Chen Bingyan, the captain of the Second Company of the Zhouzhuang Clearing Brigade, took fifty-one soldiers and set out for a certain place. On the way, they passed near Xuejia Lane and saw dozens of Xiantian Dao members standing guard with broadswords. One of the soldiers in the team suddenly saw a member of the broadsword team staring angrily at him with his broadsword. He felt frightened and fired a shot into the sky. The broadsword team immediately sent a part back to report and sounded the alarm. Everyone took up their knives and guns and surrounded them from all sides. They were captured without resistance and taken to the Xiantian Dao assembly hall. After being interrogated for over an hour, they were completely killed around 4:00 PM, and the heads of four people, including the company commander, were hung high in Zhouzhuang. When the military and police authorities and the Japanese garrison received the information, they sent a large force to rescue them, but before they had left the city, the bad news had already arrived, and the situation became even more serious. They immediately rushed to attack. After contacting the broadsword team, they were ultimately outmatched in weaponry, and the broadsword team retreated. As a result, many houses in the area were burned, and people fled, with dozens being killed or injured.

Later, it gradually spread to the fifth and eighth districts of Jiangyin. The sect cadres greatly promoted the sect, and almost the entire first township joined, with the momentum being extremely strong. They also set up incense halls in villages with more residents, called "Kun Fa," with clothing being completely black. Sometimes, on both sides of the Wuxi-Shanghai Highway, black-clothed, black-hatted Xiantian Dao members could be seen walking around with knives and guns. They did not threaten merchants, but they frequently attacked military and police personnel and forcefully levied additional taxes on township chiefs in various places, otherwise they would be treated unfavorably.

The Authorities Advise Reorganization into Self-Defense Corps

When the Xiantian Dao sect emerged, because it was a secret activity and also in the rural areas, the authorities did not pay much attention to it. When the situation became serious and tragedies occurred one after another, the local county government felt that it could not be allowed to grow. On the one hand, it immediately reported to the provincial government for instructions. On the other hand, it summoned gentry and influential people from various districts to repeatedly persuade and persuade. Provincial Governor Ren issued an order to Wuxi County Magistrate Zhang Xiuming on May 8th, ordering him to strictly ban it and disarm them by May 20th. If they did not listen to persuasion, they would be killed without exception. A public notice was issued, and Huang Xiya and others were sent to organize a mobile propaganda team, carrying a large number of propaganda materials and slogans, to go to various cities and villages along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway (from Anzhen to Wuxi) to carry out widespread propaganda among the people. Wuxi County followed the provincial order and instructed various districts and townships to organize strong men's propaganda teams to break superstitions and actively promote the truth. County Magistrate Zhang once went to Anzhen in the fourth district on March 3rd with Xu Meichu, the deputy captain of the security team, and Huan, the police chief, and convened a mass meeting of the people in the district office to inform them that local peace was important and that there should be no more recklessness. Because the farmers had been deceived in the past, it was decided not to punish them for their past actions. On April 6th, Zhang also inspected the first, third, and fourth districts with related parties and his subordinates and met with the persons in charge of the "Xiantian Dao" in various places. On April 13th, representatives of the "Xiantian Dao Buddhist Force for Protecting the Home" in various districts, Ziyu and Zhao Jinqing and 47 others, were summoned to Wuxi. A symposium was held that afternoon, attended by related parties and the police chiefs of various security teams, hosted by the county magistrate. The government's countermeasures for the "Buddhist Force for Protecting the Home" were explained, hoping to assist the government in promoting government orders and maintaining law and order, that the association would cease its activities, cancel the name "Buddhist Force for Protecting the Home," and reorganize into a self-defense corps. On the 14th, a joint meeting was held, deciding to reorganize the "Buddhist Force for Protecting the Home" into a self-defense corps, and the area of activity was reduced to the third district. In the afternoon, a pledge agreement was signed. On April 26th, a joint memorial service was held in Anzhen, commemorating the military police and Xiantian Dao members who had died in the past.

After the pledge agreement was signed, although the members of the sect in the first, sixth, ninth, and tenth districts usually communicated with the third and fourth districts, they had already lost their commanding power and it was difficult to unify them due to the intrusion of bad elements. At the same time, the members of the association were ignorant and thought that the county's order to reorganize into a self-defense corps had been approved for activity, so they used self-defense as an excuse to openly conflict with those who did not please them. As a result, unfortunate events still occurred from time to time. For example, on April 29th, more than 400 Xiantian Dao members in the tenth district surrounded the Dazhi Township Office, insulting the township chief and bao chief. On May 4th and 5th, the transshipment tax bureau of the Jushanhang Customs was stormed by a large number of Xiantian Dao members, and four people were killed and six abducted in two days. On May 6th, more than 3,000 Xiantian Dao members stormed the large checkpoint at the East Wuxi Station on the railway blockade line, destroying all the equipment in the station. On May 7th, Yang Hongqing, the former district chief of the first district of Wuxi, was killed by Xiantian Dao members near the Jiangxi Bridge. In total, since the signing of the temporary agreement, there have been no fewer than twenty incidents involving misunderstandings with the military police and revenge killings.

Editorial

### A Message to the Citizens Regarding the Evacuation Problem

We have repeatedly discussed the issue of population evacuation in this city, gradually moving from theory to implementation. Although there are various practical difficulties, the Population Evacuation Committee has not been able to implement the evacuation plan quickly. However, those responsible in various aspects, aware of the importance of this matter, are still overcoming all difficulties and working hard to move forward. Recently, preparatory work has been gradually completed. The first evacuation ship to Suzhou will depart on the 11th of this month. The fare is 3,330 yuan per person, and it is free for children under ten years old. Citizens who wish to evacuate to their hometowns can first register with the Baojia district designated by the executive group of the committee and complete the relocation procedures. To facilitate the evacuation of citizens, the procedures are made as simple as possible.

However, in contrast, most citizens still have a wait-and-see attitude towards evacuation. What is particularly perplexing is the attitude of general charitable organizations. According to the original plan of the Evacuation Committee, the first step is to evacuate charitable organizations in the city. This is because charitable organizations have no need to stay in Shanghai, and each charitable organization accommodates a considerable number of consumers. The daily life consumption is not small. At a time when food and prices are rising every day, it is absolutely necessary for charitable organizations to evacuate as soon as possible. In the past, the Evacuation Committee summoned representatives of charitable organizations to talk, and they unanimously agreed. But to this day, most have not made evacuation preparations, except for a very few. The evacuation locations for charitable organizations include Dongting West Mountain and Jiaozhi, where there are surplus houses for rent. It is also easier to obtain food locally than in Shanghai. As for the transportation problem, concrete measures have been planned for both waterways and roads. The authorities can also subsidize the evacuation costs as appropriate. Under these circumstances, there is no reason for charitable organizations not to evacuate automatically as soon as possible. If they do not prepare to evacuate, donations from all sectors of society will have to be temporarily suspended.

Secondly, we believe that the lives of ordinary citizens have become increasingly difficult recently, especially the food problem, which is even more serious. In terms of food difficulties, those who have no need to stay in Shanghai should make every effort to find a way to evacuate as soon as possible, to avoid being trapped in a city of worries and facing a threat to their lives. In the past, transportation was a problem. Now, evacuation routes in various places are gradually opening, and the authorities in Suzhou and other places are particularly willing to provide assistance to the city's evacuation work. Therefore, evacuees not only have no problems along the way, but also can obtain various conveniences after arriving at their destination. On the other hand, if they stay put in Shanghai, the difficulties will be even greater. Even from a personal point of view, it is necessary to evacuate as soon as possible.

To promote the city's evacuation work, we hope that the various hometown associations and trade associations will be responsible for guiding and assisting the evacuation of their fellow countrymen and members. At the same time, relevant parties in the city and in various places should make it as easy as possible for evacuating citizens during exit and entry inspections. In addition, we have repeatedly proposed that the promotion of population evacuation in the city should be based on preventing counter-evacuation. Therefore, the authorities must strictly limit the methods for those who move into Shanghai in the future. Otherwise, those who leave will be reluctant, and those who come will be eager. This is a major obstacle to the city's evacuation work, and the relevant authorities must pay attention to it.

### Zhejiang Governor Announces Administrative Policy: Stabilizing People's Livelihoods Considered an Urgent Priority

Hangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Governor of Zhejiang Province, Ding Mocun, was sworn into office at the provincial government yesterday and announced his administrative policy as follows:

My current appointment to govern Zhejiang is premised on the hopes of the people. Whatever the people desire will be my future administrative direction. The reason for the delay in this announcement is that I believe governing lies in deeds, not words, and I did not want to offer empty promises. Now that I have been in office for over a month, I have closely examined the local situation and gained a clear understanding. Therefore, I have ordered each department to draft detailed and specific plans to alleviate the suffering of the people, abandoning empty talk and seeking practical solutions. I will now present a few of the more important points:

Regarding the issue of people's food supply, this province will prioritize increasing the production of rice and other grains as a fundamental solution. Currently, in addition to personally consulting with the Jiangsu Province authorities regarding the transfer of grain to Hangzhou, I have also dispatched personnel to the Nanjing and northern Jiangsu areas to purchase large quantities of miscellaneous grains. These shipments will soon arrive in Hangzhou to meet the immediate needs.

Regarding the issue of public security, the current police and security agencies are actively planning. In the future, Zhejiang's public security will surely improve step by step.

Regarding the issue of civil affairs, the success of local administration depends entirely on the integrity and competence of officials. They must be honest. In addition to instructing subordinates to exert themselves, I will strictly prohibit corruption, to establish a clean government and win the trust of the people.

Regarding the issue of police administration, the police have close contact with the people, and therefore, the people's suffering is more direct. Strict rectification is necessary to reduce the people's suffering. I have decided to start with active rectification in the provincial capital, and then gradually extend it to other counties.

Regarding the issue of finance, the financial situation of this province is strained and difficult after years of war. I plan to implement thorough reforms, eliminate accumulated malpractices, and ensure that the people's burden does not increase, while tax revenues are sufficient.

Regarding water conservancy and transportation, in order to enhance smooth transportation, land and water transport are extremely important. Currently, important trunk roads within the province are either under construction or being planned. Regarding water conservancy, projects such as the Hai'ning seawall, the Shangtang River in Hangzhou County, and Xiang Lake in Xiaoshan are all planned for repair and construction, and work will commence soon.

Regarding the issue of economics, Zhejiang Province is rich in resources. In recent years, these resources have not been sold effectively. In the future, we must improve public security and rectify transportation to facilitate transportation and the smooth flow of materials.

Regarding the issue of education, I will make every effort to promote it. On the one hand, I will improve the treatment of cultural and educational personnel. On the other hand, I will appoint local educators to take charge of educational undertakings.

In my current role as governor of Zhejiang, I deeply desire to serve the people. To facilitate communication between the government and the people, and to ensure that the people's voices are heard, I have established an advisory committee. I hope that all elders and brothers will provide guidance and assistance at any time.

### Compromise Reached on Great Power Veto Issue: Soviet Union Also Concedes on Trusteeship Proposal

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from San Francisco reports that an agreement has been reached among the five major powers on the issue of voting procedures in the Security Council. Regarding the content of the agreement, the Procedure Committee of the Security Council issued a joint statement by the representatives of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China on the 8th.

### De Gaulle Affirms France's Strong Position

London, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Paris, De Gaulle delivered a speech while traveling to Normandy last weekend. The gist of his speech was that the current terrible international situation is due to small countries trying to put large countries in a position where they cannot unite. However, the united unity of these large countries is an indispensable element for all countries in the world to seek peace. Although my France is in a difficult situation today, it will not necessarily be so forever. Therefore, it is unwise for countries to despise my France at this time. If anyone thinks that the unity of the great powers should be broken, and then use this corrupt environment to regard France as a pawn on the world chessboard, they will make a big mistake, and unpredictable things will happen in the future. We must conquer and remove the obstacles placed in our path by those who do not know the danger of disuniting the great powers. If countries do not cooperate with France or conclude agreements with it, it will be difficult to establish world peace. The entire French people, regardless of this bad environment, adhere to their unwavering position. We French people deeply understand what we lacked a month ago and will do our best to obtain it with fairness, courage, and perseverance.

### Severe Drought in Guizhou Province

In order to save this tragic situation, Yang Sen, the chairman of Guizhou Province, applied to the Chongqing authorities to not implement the grain and gold contribution campaign, but no improvement has been seen so far.

### Important Points to Note When Digging Individual Air Raid Shelters

Statement by the Air Defense Headquarters

The Shanghai Special Municipality Air Defense Headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the widespread digging of individual air raid shelters in the city, pointing out the following important points to note for these air raid shelters. The content of the statement is recorded as follows:

During this week of intensified air defense facilities, all citizens have enthusiastically worked hard, and individual air raid shelters have been widely dug throughout the city, which is a commendable phenomenon. Most of these individual air raid shelters are dug along the sidewalks and streets, which will further enhance their effectiveness. However, the following points should still be noted:

First, many air raid shelters do not have earthen berms around them, which will reduce their effectiveness in preventing the force of bomb explosions. Therefore, earthen berms must be built around the shelters, preferably with a sloping shape and width. In several places, several stones on the sidewalk at the boundary line between the road and the sidewalk have been removed to dig air raid shelters. Therefore, the earthen berms around the shelters only have three sides, with one side facing the road, which is actually very dangerous.

Second, the earthen berms around the air raid shelters should not only use soil. To resist heavy rain and explosive force, finely chopped straw should be mixed with the soil, or cement should be mixed in to strengthen it. The surface should also be made smooth.

Third, individual air raid shelters are mostly dug on sidewalks. To prevent danger to pedestrians at night, the surroundings should be surrounded by lime, white paint, or white paper to make pedestrians aware. Once attacked, air raid shelters can protect the lives of citizens, so the inside of the shelters should be kept clean at all times.

### Over 30,000 Taels of Third Installment of Gold Securities Sold

This is an increase of 19,070 taels compared to the 13,957 taels in the first installment, and an increase of 2,425 taels compared to the 30,602 taels in the second installment. The 3,303 gold bars in this installment's reserve have been delivered to the monthly inspection committee for inspection and confirmed to be consistent.

### Household Sugar Distribution After Dragon Boat Festival

The last distribution of household sugar in this city was over a month ago. The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and citizens are in urgent need of it. Sugar merchants have been requesting the detergent bureau and the China-Japan Trade Federation to implement a special household distribution for the Dragon Boat Festival. It is understood that the relevant authorities, considering the needs of the people, have agreed to distribute it. However, because the procedures for this special distribution could not be completed before the festival, the distribution will only take place after the festival.

### City Ferry Plans to Expand Routes

The city ferry company authorities, in order to make it easier for residents in the north and south districts of Pudong to cross the Huangpu River, have decided to expand the ferry routes. The opening of closed wharves is currently being planned. It is also learned that the amount of coal used for ferries is very large, and a request is being made to the relevant authorities.

### Income Tax Bureau Handles Securities Registration

The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance began collecting temporary income tax on securities transactions on the 7th of this month and has entrusted the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange to forward securities transaction certificates to various brokers for collection. It is understood that the bureau has ordered various brokers to urge securities holders, whether corporate bonds, government bonds, or stocks, to go to the bureau to complete supplementary registration within one month.

### Cotton Control Committee Plans to Register Yarn Factories

In addition to the registration form, there is also an appendix. It is said that this move by the committee is of great significance.

### Scope of Miscellaneous Grain Association Reduced

According to news from the Shanghai District Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association yesterday, the association has completed its reorganization, which was mandated by order.

A short-term committee will be established first, and the candidates for the preparatory committee have already been submitted to the Municipal Economic Bureau for review.

### Banks and Money Shops to Close Tomorrow

The 14th of this month is the traditional Dragon Boat Festival. All banks and money shops in the city will hold a summer holiday on this day in accordance with the holiday schedule stipulated by the joint meeting of the banking and money industry. The industry associations, clearinghouses, bill exchange offices, money reserve depots, and money market will also be closed at the same time, suspending business. All exchanges and settlements due by colleagues and customers will be completed the next day. In addition, the Zhongqiao Mud Company, Postal Savings Bureau, Foreign Banks Association, major foreign banks, and various securities exchange markets will also be closed for one day on this day. It is understood that the banking and money industry has made fewer loans to the public during this year's summer festival. 80% are fixed-term loans, so banks and money shops are opening as usual. Because merchants, companies, and factories have many dealings with customers and colleagues, they mostly handle external settlements before this summer festival. The situation in various industries has been quite busy in the last two days.

### Middle Eastern Nationalities Adopt Independent and Autonomous Policies

Statement by Director Matsudaira

The regular press conference hosted by the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy was held yesterday (the 12th) at 3:00 PM. Director of Information Matsudaira delivered a speech on the issue of British and American troop withdrawals from the Arab countries of the Middle East. He stated that the reason why Britain and the United States sent troops to the Arab countries of the Middle East in the past was because Germany was advancing in the Balkans, and Britain and the United States feared that German troops would advance into Turkey, Egypt, Arabia, Iran, and other regions. In order to counter the German troops, they had no choice but to send troops to these areas. Now that the European war has come to an end, the withdrawal of British and American troops is inevitable. However, to date, Britain and the United States have not yet implemented the withdrawal of troops, and the French and De Gaulle governments are deeply afraid that the old French influence in Syria and Lebanon will be seized by British forces. They have increased the number of French troops stationed in Syria, Lebanon, and other places, willing to cause friction between Arabs and French. Subsequently, the Iranian government also formally requested the withdrawal of troops from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the independence of the Arabs in the Middle East has been deepened by the occurrence of these two incidents, forcing Britain and the United States to reconsider the Middle East issue. Given the above situation, countries such as Iraq and Egypt have also adopted the same request, launching public opinion to demand the withdrawal of British and American troops. It can be seen that the lessons of this war will definitely make the various nationalities in this area adopt independent and autonomous policies.

### Inside Story of the Xiantian Dao (Continued from Page 1)

Provincial Government Promotes Pacification Work

The provincial government, realizing that the situation had become unbearable, ordered the Wuxi-Jiangyin authorities to intensify pacification work. If the Xiantian Dao followers did not submit to pacification, did not surrender weapons, and took any further action of resistance by May 20, measures of extermination would be taken. A regiment headquarters was also established, and Yang Yanbin was appointed as the commander. Mr. Yang left for Zhangdai on May 29 to assess the situation. The work is still being carried out. When reporters traveled from Wuxi to Jiangyin, they saw many Qing and Zheng soldiers stationed along the highway. In the past, Xiantian Dao members carrying weapons frequented the roads along the Wuxi-Jiangyin highway, but this is no longer the case.

Green Jiang Provincial Government Proclamation: (Cultivate the fields, provide for the needy, be filial to parents, love the country and your home, pay taxes, obey the law, respect officials, follow the right path, overthrow cults, learn to read, live and work in peace, gathering in crowds is not allowed by the law of the state, violating the criminal law will harm your wives and children. May my brothers remember these words.)

Excerpt of Wuxi Government Proclamation: (May the followers of the Xiantian Dao know that we have gone through many deliberations. The deadline is May 20th, do not forget the last chance. Time is running out, we reiterate the three chapters of the order: First, surrender your weapons, do not abandon your livelihood or hide them. Second, prohibit gatherings, immediately disband the crowds in all four directions. Third, do not wash your hair, each of you should stay in your own land and keep to the reins. If you can practice all of these prohibitions, the other aspects can be understood. The crucial moment has arrived, please do not be reckless. You must know that the rule of law has no exceptions, the original intention is to eliminate evil and ensure the safety of the good people. Inform the people of the strict elimination of the disaster, so that you do not disturb the villagers. The government will solve the supply of all military and police forces, and has issued a general order to secure the people and not harm the people. From now on, live in peace and happiness, and do not spread rumors. Your fathers have issued a decree, and stop your actions as soon as possible. If you continue to be stubborn and uncooperative, a large-scale suppression will occur. At that time, it will be too late to regret, and your family will bring about their own destruction.)

Xiantian Dao Representatives Detained in Wuxi

During the period, on May 6th, twelve representatives from various districts of the Xiantian Dao, including Ni Yucai, and Zhang Zhixian, a consultant from the Xiantian Dao General Assembly in Beijing, felt that the situation was serious and deeply concerned. They stepped up their activities and held a banquet that day. The relevant authorities deemed it necessary to detain them, and together with the authorities, arrested all thirteen Dao members and detained them in the security team, awaiting disposition by the provincial government. When reporters visited the Wuxi government, they had detailed talks with Ni Yucai and Zhang Qingguang.

Golden Light Magic Proves False

If it were not for the public trial of the Golden Light Magic in Wuxi on May 18th, I am afraid that the Xiantian Dao's influence would not have been quelled so quickly. It turns out that after Ni Yucai and the other thirteen people were detained, dozens of people, including Yi and Bingmingdu, saw that the Xiantian Dao had lost its leaders. At the same time, seeing that the Xiantian Dao had extensive power and could be exploited, they entered the three districts and two counties, falsely claiming that the Golden Light Magic was sent from Beijing, and that its magic was more profound than the original Xiantian Dao. Those who practiced it had to cut themselves with a knife ninety-nine eighty-one times, and falsely claimed that by chanting one (Liao) and waving the other hand in the air, they could make a stone fall from the sky. The villagers, who had already been deceived by the demonic teachings, were worried about losing their leaders. Suddenly, such an even more brilliant Dao master came to help them, which was really too difficult to come by. Of course, they deeply believed in it and treated him like the above. Therefore, in less than half a month, the number of Daoists and the depth of their superstition were indeed excessive.

This group of Jiang Mingbo, in order to wantonly publicize their power, and make the authorities believe in their so-called fabricated demon magic, actually conceived an unrealistic plan. They did not fear death, and made a desperate gamble. In mid-May, they repeatedly requested the Wuxi Sun government, claiming that the Dao's method of being invulnerable to knives and guns was indeed true, and they were willing to come to the county for a public trial. The authorities initially dissuaded them, but they were willing to reduce the tearing, and at the same time, the people were so deeply affected by it that the future was very weary. If the test was not carried out, it would not be enough to wake up the people. On May 18, the government notified the military and police along the way and allowed them to come to the city.

On that day, Jiang Mingbo brought dozens of proud Dao followers and requested to conduct the trial at Tianguanlun. The location was near the Luosheqiao bridgehead guard team. At that time, there were more than 20,000 spectators. During the trial, Jiang Mingbo arbitrarily designated five Dao followers with white cloths on their heads and black secret buttons. He announced more than 300 meters away, and when the bell rang three times, Jiang and others completed their performance and verified what they called (equal division of the crowd). They tried to flash away, but the soldiers were already in place, and in a month, the soldiers arrested Jiang and the other six people. The so-called (invulnerability to knives and guns) was also revealed to the public.

Since then, the Luo family has made a very strong effort. The general public has also been attacking such events. They felt that the (golden light magic) teachers (one step higher) were still acting as if they did not want to. Therefore, they were immediately indifferent to the evil doctrines of the Xiantian Dao, fearing that the authorities would impose a persuasion attack. They have handed over the knives and guns voluntarily, and the power of the Xiantian Dao has suddenly been reduced by more than half. Although some have other intentions, they want to make a final struggle, saying that the day test was invalid, because the Zheng Yin star was highly dangerous (said the various long officials) and there were unclean things. In fact, although the long is stupid, he has already lost his faith, unless his power is treated, and it is impossible to escape.

Now there are remnants of the Xiantian Dao in the remote areas of Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Chushan, but their power is no longer great, and it is only for self-defense. The local government authorities (with military and police supplies, the government has a solution, and has issued a general order for inspection, securing the people and not harming the people), if this can be done, what the people expect is only this, it is predicted that in the near future, without using force, all the remnants of the Xiantian Dao will be self-destructive.
