### Tea Party of Beiping Party, Government, and Military Officials: Chairman Chiang Instructs Leaders to Uphold the New Life Movement and Build a New Beiping

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] Chairman Chiang convened a tea party for responsible personnel from Beiping's Party, government, and military circles at Huai Ren Hall on the 14th, attended by over 350 people. The Chairman arrived at 3:50 PM, appearing radiant in military uniform and sword. Upon entering, all attendees stood and applauded. The Chairman delivered an impromptu speech, stating briefly: "The victory of this War of Resistance was the result of the heroic sacrifices and struggles of the nation's military and civilians for fourteen years since the September 18th Incident. Responsible comrades from all sectors should reflect on the heroic sacrifices of the martyrs, seize this opportunity of victory, strive unremittingly, take responsibility autonomously, concentrate our strength, and cooperate with each other to ultimately fulfill our mission of nation-building." The Chairman then pointed out the urgent tasks for all sectors going forward, saying that Party affairs personnel should practically devote themselves to local self-government, lead the people, exercise the four powers, to realize the Principle of Democracy; political and economic personnel should devote themselves to stabilizing people's livelihoods and raising the people's living standards, to achieve the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The military is the guarantee of the country and the nation. After the victory of the War of Resistance, it should especially abide by discipline, cherish the people, and promote the glorious tradition of the national army. The Chairman finally explained that Beiping is our country's former capital and one of our country's most magnificent cities. The current city appearance and order have greatly declined. Now, after its recovery, it is hoped that Party, government, and military circles, and all our city compatriots, can vigorously implement the regulations of the New Life Movement to create a vigorous new Beiping and serve as a model for all cities in the country.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] The Secretariat of the National Government Chairman's Xing Yuan announced that, in accordance with the date and location of the announcement, the people may submit their grievances starting from 8:00 AM on the 15th.

### Heavy Snow in Changchun Disrupts Air Transport; Citizens Bravely Endure Severe Cold and Eagerly Await All Day

[Report from Our Newspaper] The former Yushan Radio Station broadcasted that, according to reliable sources, the Chinese army has crossed 30 miles beyond Shenyang and is currently advancing towards Harbin.

[Central News Agency Reporter Liu Zhuzhou, Changchun, 13th] The northwest wind was strong last night, and this morning the ground was covered with about an inch of snow, with the temperature dropping to minus 14 degrees Celsius. The general public here is extremely concerned about the recent weather and eagerly hopes that our air transport fleet can fly in formation across the clear sky. Several large buildings suitable for setting up camps here have been cleaned and prepared, awaiting the arrival of the National Army. It is heard that after the arrival of the National Army, local security will still be the responsibility of the Soviet army until its complete withdrawal. Also, the Public Security Bureau has now been renamed the Police Bureau and is directly under the Municipal Government. The Cultural and Educational Section of the Municipal Government has also been reorganized into the Education Bureau.

[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] According to news from Changchun: The entire population of the city, braving the extremely cold weather, waited all day on Thursday for the arrival of the National Army.

[Another Dispatch] Authoritative sources in the Chinese military circles today believe that the news reports that the National Army has arrived in Shenyang or has been airlifted to Changchun are still "premature." The source pointed out that the airlift of the National Army to the Northeast is limited to Changchun alone, and this work has been delayed due to the severe cold and heavy snow. The first batch of troops to be airlifted to Changchun will be the 5th Division of the 94th Army, which is currently still in Beiping. The occupation of Shenyang, with Soviet approval, will be undertaken by troops of the 13th Army and the 52nd Army, which are advancing towards Shenyang by land.

### Factories Resuming Operations; Prices Have Not Fallen

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Factories here related to daily life have now resumed operations one after another. As of now, the number of food factories that have resumed operations using existing equipment has reached 30, along with 16 sauce shops, 6 wineries, over 100 newly opened tofu factories, and over 50 pickled vegetable businesses. As for other major factories, due to the lack of coal, only one in ten has resumed operations. Most government agencies and companies with heating equipment have switched to using stoves to save coal. All schools, lacking coal for heating, have scheduled an early winter vacation starting on the 15th. Currently, the workers employed by the Xing Yuan are mostly poor students from various middle schools. They are all diligent and eager to learn, and consider it an honor to serve here. Various prices, after falling at the time of Japan's surrender, have gradually risen and are now almost the same as before Japan's surrender. The prices of staple foods are: white rice, 5 yuan per catty; flour, 7 yuan; sorghum, 1.5 yuan; millet, 3 yuan; soybeans, 8 jiao; mung beans, 2.5 yuan; sesame seed cakes, 2 yuan each; steamed buns, 1 yuan; dumplings, 5 jiao.

### Political Consultative Conference Expected to be Held Next Week

[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] The Political Consultative Conference, if not further obstructed, will be held within the next week. Its urgent task is to consider all outstanding issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and find ways to stop the current internal strife. Observers in the government believe that the National Government seems likely to maintain its previous proposal, requiring the Communist army to withdraw ten kilometers on both sides of the railway lines. The Communist Party seems likely to insist first, that the National Army must withdraw in the same way; and second, that any actions by the National Army on these lines must be approved by the Communist Party. The voting procedure issue also needs to be resolved, as both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are unwilling to be in a position of minority obeying the majority. Therefore, obstacles may arise from the very beginning of the meeting.

### US Planes to Continue Aerial Demonstration; Bodies of Seven Missing Pilots Recovered

[Reuters, Beiping, 14th] Major General Locke, commander of the 3rd Amphibious Corps of the US Marine Corps, stated today while hosting journalists: "Last Saturday, six US Marine Corps planes crashed in the mountains during a formation flight. According to reports from Chinese farmers on the Shandong Peninsula, the bodies of seven US pilots have been found. At the same time, two other injured pilots are reportedly in Communist-controlled areas and have also been found by Chinese farmers. The corps headquarters is now making every effort to recover the two pilots. Each crashed plane carried two people, so the whereabouts of three others are still unknown. The search team has recovered the wreckage of five planes and is continuing to search for the sixth plane." Major General Locke also stated: "Sixteen planes conducted a demonstration flight on Saturday to commemorate the Pearl Harbor incident. Six of them encountered a blizzard and apparently attempted a risky landing. In the future, US planes will continue aerial demonstrations and 'shows of force.'

### Marshall Concludes Testimony; May Arrive in China Next Week; Hurley to Return to His Legal Career

[United Press, Washington, 13th] General Marshall, the newly appointed US Ambassador to China and former Chief of Staff of the Army, has concluded his testimony before the Pearl Harbor Disaster Investigation Committee today after seven consecutive days. Marshall admitted that on December 7, 1941, he could have notified Hawaii by phone to implement precautions without revealing the secret of intercepting Japanese encrypted messages. However, Vice Admiral Short, commander of the US military in Hawaii, received a warning, it was after the Japanese attack. When Marshall attended the committee, a plane was waiting at the airport, ready to carry Marshall to China to assume his new post, so after speaking, he left hastily amidst applause.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Today's editorial in "The Washington Post" stated: "General Marshall, President Truman's special envoy to China, has the same main task as his predecessor, General Hurley, which is to encourage the Chinese central government to move towards liberalization. The Chinese problem is second in importance only to the atomic bomb at the upcoming Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference. The consistency of US-Soviet policy toward China is our greatest concern. At present, both countries recognize the Chongqing central government as the sole government, but the overall situation in China is not stable and can change at any time, so our policy must be able to adapt to constantly changing facts in order to deal with it comfortably."

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] According to the US News Service Washington on the 13th, according to the US News Agency, Hurley will soon return to his legal career. Hurley was ill yesterday.

Referring to Marshal's appointment as a special envoy to China, Hurley said: The US statement of policy toward China "makes it certain for my successor to succeed." According to Hurley's opinion, all aspects of foreign policy should be regularly announced to the people, since it is the people who ultimately create or abolish foreign policy. Hurley's return to his legal career ends his five years of service in the US military and the State Department.

### Government Spokesperson Details Facts, Hopes Communist Party Will Not Engage in Confusing Propaganda

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A reporter from this agency, noting that the New China News Agency and the New China Daily frequently report on the National Army attacking "Liberated Areas" and put forward the slogan "Oppose Civil War" to expand their propaganda, specifically asked the government spokesperson for their opinion. The government spokesperson replied that the consistent propaganda strategy of the Communist Party is to do whatever it wants to do itself, knowing that it is not permitted by public reason, and then, while actually carrying out its plan, it simultaneously engages in large-scale propaganda saying that the other side is doing exactly that, in order to shift the focus, shirk responsibility, and conceal its own intentions and actions. The reports from the New China News Agency and the New China Daily should be viewed in this light. In fact, one only needs to conduct a completely objective investigation from the perspective of propaganda to know that their so-called National Army attacking "Liberated Areas" is actually the Communist Army obstructing the National Army's surrender acceptance. The "civil war" they are propagating against is actually the internal unrest manufactured by the Communist Party itself. This can be proven by the various facts of the Communist Party expanding its territory by force after the Japanese surrender and the government and Communist Party representatives continuing to discuss matters after the publication of the October 10th government-Communist Party representative meeting minutes.

"Liberation" is actually "Separatism"

According to the "Map of the Situation of the Anti-Japanese War Behind Enemy Lines in China" self-made by the "Yan'an Headquarters" at the end of June this year, the Communist Party occupied only 69 county seats nationwide, including the so-called "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region," which included counties such as Yan'an. According to the Communist Party representatives' statements to the government representatives and the Communist Party spokesperson's answers to foreign reporters' questions, before August 14, the "Japanese surrender," the Communist Army only occupied 81 county seats. If the Communist Army calls the areas it occupied during the war "Liberated Areas," then the so-called "Liberated Areas" are only these 81 county seats. After the Japanese surrender, the Japanese and puppet troops all surrendered to the government, awaiting the National Army to disarm them. The anti-Japanese military operations ended. However, in mid-October, the Communist Party representatives stated to the government representatives, and the New China Daily publicly proclaimed, that their "Liberated Areas" already had over 300 county seats. So, how did these extra 200+ county seats come about? Was it after the enemy and puppet troops had already surrendered, disregarding the suffering of the people, using violence to attack the areas recovered by the National Army and seize them? Or was it by attacking the already surrendered puppet troops? This does not need a reply, it is already clear. Moreover, within a period of two months, their so-called "Liberated Areas" increased by more than 200 counties, almost occupying three county seats every day. The intensity of the Communist Army's attacks is self-evident. However, during this period, the New China News Agency and the New China Daily daily published reports of the National Army ordering the enemy and puppet troops to attack the Communist Army. This precisely proves the Communist Party's propaganda strategy mentioned earlier: on one hand, they themselves carry out attacks to expand their territory; on the other hand, they slander the government, saying that the government is using the enemy and puppet troops to attack them, even saying that the National Army is attacking them. This can also prove that the "Liberated Areas" claimed by the Communist Party are actually only their "occupied areas," "separated areas." Furthermore, regarding the Communist Party's claim that the National Army attacked the Communist Army, since the Japanese surrender, there have only been five locations where relatively large conflicts occurred: (1) The incident that the Communist Party claimed was Governor Yan Xishan attacking the Shangdang area in September. This area included Changzi, Changzhi, Tunliu, and other counties, which were occupied by the enemy forces before the Japanese surrender. After the Japanese surrender, the National Army recovered Changzi on August 19, recovered Changzhi and Tunliu on August 21, but the Communist Army launched a large-scale attack, capturing Tunliu on September 10, capturing Changzi on September 12, and capturing Changzhi on October 12. Simply comparing the timelines of both sides, one can know who attacked whom. (2) The Ma Fuwu and Gao Shuxun incident that the Communist Party has greatly publicized. The Ma and Gao troops were ordered to go to Tianjin and Beijing to accept the surrender of the enemy forces. On October 8, while passing through Cixian County in Hebei, they were suddenly attacked by the Communist Army. Because the incident was unexpected and the troops were not concentrated, Ma Fuwu and Gao Shuxun were both captured. This clearly shows that the Communist Party attacked the National Army and obstructed the surrender acceptance. The Communist Party has no way to defend against such facts, so they can only fabricate rumors, saying that Ma and Gao were ordered to suppress the Communists. Ma and Gao have already lost their freedom, so naturally the Communist Party can fabricate rumors at will. (3) The siege of Guihua and (4) Baotou. Guihua and Baotou were besieged for two months, and the suffering of the people was several times greater than when the enemy occupied them. What is most strange is that the New China News Agency and the New China Daily, aside from scolding Governor Fu Zuoyi, did not mention a word about the conflicts in the two places. (5) The incident of obstructing the National Army from entering the Northeast around Shanhaiguan. The National Army entering the Northeast to recover national territory is a matter of course. The fact that the Communist Party had no activity there during the puppet Manchukuo era under Japanese control in the Northeast is also a well-known fact. After the Japanese surrender, the compatriots in the long-occupied Northeast eagerly hoped to see the light of day again. Anyone with a bit of national consciousness would never take this opportunity to obstruct the National Army from recovering lost territory. However, the Communist Party actually mobilized troops to obstruct them at every step. What else is there to say? Looking at these five incidents calmly, one can know what the truth of the "civil war" that the Communist Party is calling out to society is.

The Government's Negotiations with the Communist Party

Furthermore, regarding the progress of the government's negotiations with the Communist Party after October 10, everyone knows that there are several practical problems that have not been resolved after the publication of the meeting minutes. Among them, (1) is the Political Consultative Conference. The meeting minutes stated that "Both sides will consult with all parties on the number of seats, organization, and powers of the Political Consultative Conference. Both sides agreed that the Political Consultative Conference should be convened quickly as soon as the consultations are completed." In reality, the issues of the number of seats, organization, and powers were all agreed upon by all parties at the end of October. The government originally planned to convene it in early November, but it has been delayed until now because the Communist Party has delayed in designating representatives. (2) is the Military Subcommittee. The meeting minutes stated that regarding the "issue of the Communist Army's garrison locations, the Communist Party can propose a plan for discussion and decision," and "to specifically plan for each issue mentioned above, both sides agreed to organize a three-person subcommittee, with the Military Command Department, the Ministry of Military Administration, and the 18th Group Army each sending one person to carry it out." This is a fundamental solution to the conflict. Once the Communist Army's garrison locations are agreed upon, then conflicts can naturally be avoided. However, the Communist Party has never proposed a plan for discussion according to the meeting minutes, and there is still no news of the 18th Group Army representative coming to Chongqing, so the Military Subcommittee cannot proceed. During this time, the government is doing its best to carry out demobilization and continue negotiations, while the Communist Party is vigorously destroying transportation, preventing the demobilization work from progressing and preventing the people from returning home. On October 26, the government representatives presented three points to the Communist Party representatives: (1) Railway transportation must be restored. (2) "The Communist Party's army must withdraw beyond the railway lines, and the areas it has already occupied will temporarily maintain the status quo." (3) The Communist Party's military representative, Ye Jianying, should be invited to come to Chongqing as soon as possible to hold a Military Subcommittee meeting to discuss the reorganization and garrison locations of the Communist Party's army. The Communist Party representatives telegraphed these three points to Yan'an for instructions. On the 29th, the Communist Party replied: In order to resolutely avoid civil war and quickly restore transportation, the Communist Party proposed three points regarding the railways: (1) A. Stop advancing troops, attacking, and occupying; B. Stop using enemy and puppet troops; C. On the eight railway lines (Ping-Sui, Tong-Pu, Zheng-Tai, the northern section of Ping-Han, the eastern section of Long-Hai, Jin-Pu, Jiao-Ji, and the western section of Bei-Ning), neither side will station troops. D. If the government side needs to transport troops to Tianjin and Qingdao, it must be done through consultation. (2) The Military Subcommittee can only formulate specific measures after the principles of the above-mentioned issues have been decided, otherwise it has no authority to resolve this matter. (3) If the issue cannot be agreed upon in advance, the Communist Party does not oppose first holding a Political Consultative Conference, but when the meeting is held, the issue of avoiding civil war and restoring transportation must be resolved first. On October 31, the government, with the greatest tolerance, proposed six points in response: (1) Both sides order their respective troops to temporarily garrison in their original locations and not attack the other side. (2) The Communist Party's troops on all railway lines will move to locations ten kilometers away from the railway lines. The Communist Party will not station troops at these relocation points, except for railway police maintaining railway order. (3) The National Political Consultative Council will organize a transportation inspection team, dispatching councilors to go to the railway lines to inspect the situation with local impartial individuals and submit reports on the true facts at any time. (4) If the Central Army needs to transport troops on the Ping-Sui, Tong-Pu, Zheng-Tai, Jiao-Ji, northern section of Ping-Han, eastern section of Long-Hai, and northern section of Jin-Pu railway lines, it will be decided through joint consultation. (5) Both sides should agree on fundamental measures regarding the Communist Party's troops' garrison areas and their reorganization within a month to facilitate peaceful reconstruction. (6) The Political Consultative Conference will still be convened immediately according to the original plan.

Who is Tolerating and Who is Pressing

The Communist Party telegraphed to Yan'an for instructions, and did not receive a reply until November 8. Their reply did not mention any of the measures proposed by the government. In particular, the government suggested that both sides order their armies to cease any attacks, but the Communist Party's answer was only a unilateral statement. The answer has four points as follows: (1) The Military Committee orders the National Army to completely stop attacking the Liberated Areas. (2) The National Army withdraws completely from the occupied areas. (3) The National Army withdraws from the eight railway lines. (4) The government cancels all bandit suppression orders in various places and guarantees that it will never attack the Liberated Areas again. We don't need to say much, just compare the proposals of both sides, and it will be clear at a glance who is tolerating, who is pressing, who sincerely wants to seek peace, and who is deliberately creating division. The government needs peaceful nation-building, and the people need to return to their hometowns and live and work in peace. Therefore, even after the Communist Party proposed those unilateral ultimatum-style conditions on November 8, the government still tolerated them and advocated that the issue of restoring transportation and avoiding conflicts be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference for discussion. The current international and domestic situation does not allow us to have internal strife again. What we need most is to seek a factual and reasonable solution with a spirit of sincere unity. What should be avoided most is propaganda that reverses right and wrong and is not in accordance with the facts. The government deeply hopes that the Political Consultative Conference will be convened as soon as possible and that the Military Subcommittee will be established quickly. We hope that the Communist Party can prove its sincerity in seeking peace and unity with facts and no longer confuse the hearing of domestic people with propaganda.

[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 14th, the Three-Foreign Ministers Conference, scheduled to open on the 15th, will discuss the issue of managing Japan in addition to discussing the atomic issue. A commentator from Moscow Radio stated that only strong cooperation among the three powers can obtain a satisfactory solution to the Japanese problem.

[Reuters, London, 14th] Foreign Secretary Bevin departed this morning for Moscow to attend the Three-Foreign Ministers Conference.

British Ambassador to Iran Sir Reader Bullard will also travel from Tehran to Moscow to attend. Judging from the enormous size of the British delegation, it can be seen that the scope of this talk will be very broad. Issues such as Iran and the Far East will definitely be involved.

### Iran Again Sends Notes to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Demanding the Swift Withdrawal of Troops

Hoping They Will Not Interfere With the Free Actions of the Iranian Army and Police

[Reuters, Tehran, 14th] The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a memorandum to the British, American, and Soviet embassies here yesterday, demanding that a decision be made quickly on the withdrawal of the three countries' troops from Iran, as the presence of foreign troops in Iran damages Iranian sovereignty and is enough to cause unfortunate incidents and increase the suffering of the people. Moreover, the presence of foreign troops in Iran, even if extended for one day, has no military or administrative basis. The Iranian government deeply hopes that the Moscow Conference can discuss this legitimate demand of the Iranian government, and before the discussion, it hopes even more that the foreign military authorities within Iran will not interfere with the free actions of the Iranian army and police, so as not to hinder the emergency measures taken by the Iranian government to maintain stability and order.

### Editorial: Expectations for the China Silk Company

The Executive Yuan decided to establish the China Silk Company at its regular meeting on the 11th of this month. The company's articles of association, which were also disclosed in full in yesterday's newspaper, consist of twenty-three articles. Article 2 stipulates the source of capital. In addition to the enemy and puppet silk assets in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces received by the government, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will allocate an additional 500 million yuan in one lump sum. Article 5 stipulates that the business term is two years, which may be extended by one year if necessary. Article 21 stipulates that all official interest and net profits from the profit distribution will be turned over to the national treasury. From this, it can be seen that the company is a state-owned enterprise with a fixed term (up to three years). Its business scope, which includes the cultivation of mulberry trees, the reeling of silkworm cocoons, the processing and spinning of natural silk, the transportation and sales of finished products, the academic research of silkworm breeding, and the guidance and encouragement of private silk businesses, is stipulated in Article 4. This shows that its mission is not only related to silk but also to the silk industry. It is not only a state-owned enterprise but also involves the guidance and encouragement of private silk businesses. Moreover, the government has set its business term to a maximum of three years, which clearly indicates that it will eventually be returned to private operation, and the current control is only a temporary measure.

The current operation of the silk industry in China inevitably involves a degree of control, which is a necessary consequence of the situation. Firstly, the silk institutions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces are all managed by the central competent department, which sends personnel to take over and plan comprehensively, which is more logical. Secondly, for future export trade, silk will undoubtedly be the main product, and state operation is easier to promote. After eight years of aggression by the enemy, the silkworm breeding and silk reeling and weaving industries have suffered the most and will not be easily restored in the short term. Therefore, whether from the perspective of the farmers' side industry or from the perspective of foreign trade, there is a need for comprehensive planning and a rapid catch-up. This is not necessarily done solely to secure foreign exchange and adjust the balance of international payments.

After the establishment of this China Silk Company, we expect the following points to be achieved first:

1.  Exports: Although raw silk is a major export commodity, it is undeniable that the power of this trade has been entirely in the hands of foreign merchants since the beginning of trade until before the war. Chinese silk merchants, due to various reasons, can mostly only rely on the crumbs left by foreign merchants. As for the genuine silk export business that we can directly operate, it is still rare to see it today. This company, since it is funded by the government and is entirely state-owned, its strength, equipment, personnel, and various connections are naturally far superior to private businesses. Therefore, promoting direct and proactive export trade is certainly possible and must be done.

2.  Silk Reeling Industry: Although the modern silk reeling industry has a history of several decades, it has mostly become outdated due to stagnation. Moreover, after years of plunder and occupation by the enemy, even these outdated facilities have mostly been damaged or even completely destroyed. If we want to actively replenish and strive to restore them, it may not be easy, at least in the short term, without the state taking responsibility.

3.  Improvement of Sericulture: In the past, private or semi-official organizations have made considerable efforts to improve sericulture, and have achieved considerable results. Even the government has implemented corresponding measures. However, the scope is too narrow, the scale is too small, and the talent and funding are too scarce. Like a drop in the ocean, the effect is ultimately limited. Although this China Silk Company is nominally a company, it is somewhat inseparable from the meaning of profit. However, it is established by the government, not by merchants. Therefore, we sincerely hope that while making profits, it can also cooperate with local competent administrative agencies to fundamentally invest more effort in cultivation and education. It should also actively and extensively carry out academic research on sericulture and provide guidance and encouragement to private sericulture businesses, as stipulated in the articles of association, to ensure that China's sericulture and silk industry truly have hope for improvement.

4.  Procurement of Silkworm Cocoons: When it comes to control, it is always inseparable from the means of unified collection and purchase. This work was partially tested before the war, and during the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy and puppets in the occupied areas especially ruthlessly exploited the farmers, causing them unforgettable pain. Therefore, in this regard, we hope that there will be reasonable measures. People seek profit just as water flows downwards. As long as there is profit to be made, people will naturally be happy to comply. Even if we want to improve, to implement science, and to implement various new methods, it is not very difficult. Otherwise, if we only talk about encouragement and protection, and the people do not receive real benefits, and secretly only feel pain and exploitation, how can we arouse their interest?

Because the Japanese sericulture industry has declined, only we Chinese can replace it. We expect this, and the Allied countries also expect this. This China Silk Company clearly holds the key to supporting the weak and rescuing the ailing. It is expected that the China Silk Company will not shirk its responsibility.

### Strengthening Railway Transportation: Twenty New Locomotives Arrive in Shanghai

Transportation Equipment Arrives Simultaneously

[Report from Our Newspaper] The twenty locomotives shipped to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou the day before yesterday afternoon. Officials stated that the purpose of shipping these locomotives to China is to help solve the difficulties in our railway transportation and to improve the convenience of passenger and freight transportation. It is also learned that UNRRA also has another batch of goods, including gasoline and engine oil, which are expected to arrive here in the near future. The China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration stated that once these materials arrive, part of them will be sold publicly to facilitate private use.

American ships "Flyer" and "Remington" arrived in port the day before yesterday from New York, carrying a large number of relief supplies and transportation vehicles, including more than six hundred jeeps and cargo trucks. It is reported that the American ship "Cape St. Thomas" will arrive in Shanghai today, loaded entirely with heavy cargo from the Relief and Production Bureau.

### Foreign Nationals' Civil and Criminal Lawsuits: Courts Accept All

### Municipal Government Plans to Establish Advisory Committee

[Report from Our Newspaper] Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Shihua told our newspaper reporter yesterday that the entire plan for building a new Shanghai is currently being studied in detail by various specialized personnel of the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government now intends to invite leaders and specialized talents from all sectors of the city to form a municipal advisory body to collect public opinions and jointly promote municipal administration. In the future, issues related to the construction of the city will be submitted to the advisory committee for advice. Under the joint cooperation of the government and the people, a new Shanghai will be built. Shanghai is an international city, and foreigners have made many contributions to the construction of the city in the past. After the advisory body is established in the future, it is also planned to invite foreign leaders to participate. At the beginning of the Municipal Government's arrival in Shanghai, it received instructions from the central government to divide the work into three stages: reception, consolidation, and construction. Currently, the reception work has come to an end, and the consolidation work has also reached a considerable stage. Measures are now being prepared for construction work. However, the city's finances have not yet been put on track, tax revenues are short, and administrative expenses are very high, requiring monthly subsidies from the central government. Therefore, large-scale construction plans need to be promoted after the financial situation improves. The Municipal Government is now making every effort to enrich the city's finances from all aspects so that it can achieve the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure in a short period of time, so that the plan to build a new Shanghai can be gradually promoted.

### China Silk Company: Key Personnel Appointed Internally

[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the Executive Yuan's approval of the "Articles of Association of the China Silk Company," the responsible parties are actively planning the establishment of the company. It is rumored that Minister Zhou Yichun of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry hopes to be appointed as the chairman of the company's board of directors, and Ge Jingzhong is said to be the most likely candidate for the position of general manager. It is reported that Ge arrived in Shanghai a week ago and is currently actively inspecting and planning. Once the company's board of supervisors is established and the management personnel are selected, the head office will be established in Shanghai. It is estimated that more than 90% of the enemy and puppet silk assets in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been received. In addition to valuing them to offset part of the company's total capital, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture will also allocate an additional 500 million yuan in one lump sum to increase capital. Therefore, the company will be the only large-scale silk company in the country.

Received Silk Factories Can Start Work Soon

Among the companies taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' China Silk Company in this city are the China Silk Company, the No. 1 and No. 2 Silk Factories in Zhabei, the No. 1 Silk Weaving Factory on Yanping Road in West Shanghai of the China Silk Company, and the No. 2 Silk Weaving Factory on Bailinan Road. It is rumored that the silk weaving factories will soon be preparing to start work, but the silk factories, because their original machinery is only suitable for weaving short staple fiber, still need to be planned for renovation.

### Confiscated Daily Necessities: Decision to Accelerate Sales at Low Prices

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has decided to accelerate the sale at low prices of various daily necessities in sealed warehouses from today, including fabrics, cigarettes, soap, white sugar, and refrigerated fish and meat. A portion of liquid fuel will arrive in Shanghai within days, with a selling price of approximately 400 yuan per unit.

Low-Priced Flour Widely Available Today

The first phase of the UNRRA's low-priced flour sales is scheduled to be widely implemented starting today. The selling price is 1,900 yuan per bag (including the bag), weighing 44 city catties, equivalent to 40 yuan per city catty. There is no limit to the amount sold. All retailers selling flour will have the words "UNRRA Flour Retailer" on their doors.

Refrigerated Fish: Chemical Tests Before Resale

Because enemy goods have been stored in this city for a long time, whether they can be eaten is of great importance to the health of the citizens. The fish market has sent a letter to the Municipal Health Bureau, requesting that personnel be sent to the warehouses to take samples from four locations, divide them into two copies, and perform chemical tests separately. After it is proven that they are edible, they will be distributed for sale at low prices.

Mr. Ke Gaoda Explains the Situation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Colonel Ke Gaoda, head of the Civil Affairs Group of the US Military Headquarters, especially hosted a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Construction Building at 4:00 PM yesterday on this matter, representing General Weidelin. He said that the current price list for wine, dishes, and snacks includes 40 items. These prices were determined based on a survey of 22 high-end restaurants in the city and jointly agreed upon by the US military, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Except for the 20% not collected by the Municipal Government, it includes all additional expenses. The restaurants or cafes that set these prices must have music and other entertainment facilities. Currently, there are 186 establishments in the city that hold permits to serve US military personnel, but they will be re-designated starting December 17. The purpose of the prices set is to ensure that US troops are not charged excessively high prices, not to attempt to control the prices of stores in the city. Therefore, the food prices for non-military personnel are still determined by each store and have nothing to do with the US military. If stores still use other methods to charge prices in the future, US military personnel can obtain invoices and menus and report them to the US military police captain, who will then prohibit US military personnel from going there.

Another report: The Minquan ship, coming from Chongqing, was slightly delayed in Nanjing and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai next Tuesday.

### Crackdown on Unlicensed Vehicles: Postponement of Strict Enforcement

In order to rectify traffic, the Municipal Government's Public Utilities Bureau and the Police Bureau originally stipulated that all motor vehicles must have a license plate with "National...Shanghai" to be allowed to pass in the urban area starting today. Since this decision was made, many people have obtained license plates from the Public Utilities Bureau. However, because a large number of license plates are needed, and it is impossible to issue them all at once, it has been decided to postpone the implementation to the 20th of this month. At that time, the Municipal Police Bureau will strictly enforce it.

### US Authorities Strictly Deal With Military Vehicle Violations

[Our Correspondent] Central Special Commissioners of Comfort, Ye Chu and Niu Yongjian, attended a symposium convened by the Xinwen Bao newspaper yesterday afternoon to listen to the appeals of leaders from the city's industrial and commercial circles. Those present included Pan Xulun, Xu Jiting, Xu Yongzuo, Qin Liankui, Kui Yanfang, Chen Taoyi, Cheng Cangbo, Zhan Wenhufu, and others.

Representatives Hope to Enhance Productivity

Pan Xulun was the first to offer his opinion, stating briefly that orders from local administrative organs should not conflict with existing laws. Secondly, administrative officials should lead by example in abiding by laws and regulations. Furthermore, administrative expenses must be economized. Subsequently, Supervising Censor Cheng Cangbo delivered a speech, stating briefly that the government should emphasize the five-power constitution, giving equal status to the legislative, examination, supervisory, judicial, and administrative branches, without favoring the administrative branch. For example, the judicial aspect in this city currently involves extremely complex and heavily burdened reporting of traitorous activities, yet there are only eleven prosecutors. Similarly, the Office of the Supervising Censor executes supervisory powers with heavy responsibilities, but the regular funding is only 300,000 yuan per month. Mr. Xu Yongzuo stated that people in the occupied areas, having long been oppressed by the enemy and puppet regimes, are afraid to express their opinions or recount their sufferings to the government. Under these circumstances, the government should take the initiative to diligently seek out the people's concerns. Mr. Xu also said that underground workers should be rewarded with honors or money, rather than with official positions as compensation. Kui Yanfang continued by saying that the government should focus on public security and seek to enhance the productivity of industry and commerce in this city. Qin Liankui recounted the suffering under the oppression of the enemy and puppet regimes, his voice choked with tears as he spoke. He then said that although there are many unsatisfactory issues since the victory, the current situation is significantly better than before. Finally, Commissioner Ye delivered a speech, stating briefly that he came to Shanghai hoping to hear more opinions from all sectors dissatisfied with the current situation, because if the people can express their suffering, it can encourage the government to improve. Mr. Ye is willing to relay all opinions to the central government. It is reported that Mr. Ye and Mr. Niu will attend a reception held by local associations today.

Ye Broadcasts Yesterday Introducing New Shanghai

Mr. Ye delivered a speech on the Shanghai Broadcasting Station last night entitled "Introducing New Shanghai." The main points are as follows: (1) According to the Premier's Founding Strategy and the President's "The Destiny of China," Shanghai is of important value and must be actively reorganized and expanded. (2) Shanghai is a region where talents gather and people from all directions reside. In economics, attention should be paid to Shanghai; in politics, Shanghai should also be considered. (3) The people of Shanghai are capable and enterprising, trained, possess common knowledge, and are relatively well-organized. (4) Shanghai should take on the responsibility of helping others, and only Shanghai has the strength to help others. (5) The good customs of all provinces should be concentrated in Shanghai. (6) Shanghai is a cultural center, and the publishing industry, the education sector, writers, and students are all second to none. In particular, young students have unlimited prospects. Finally, Mr. Ye expressed his unique and boundless hope and earnestness for Shanghai.

Songjiang: Frequent Robberies Reported in Towns and Villages East of the City

At around 9 p.m. in Huayang Bridge Town, east of Songjiang's east gate, over twenty plainclothes bandits speaking local and Jiangbei dialects, each carrying modern firearms, first robbed small pig boats moored in the town's river, and then broke into the Xi Yongyuan general store, using the gun's handle to injure the store's young owner, who fled in pain from the back, provoking the bandits' anger, who fired two shots, hitting another store owner, Xi Tianling, in the leg, before turning to rob the Hengmao South Goods store, bagging relatively valuable items from both stores, as well as clothing and legal tender, and heading northeast. It is reported that the losses of the two stores are each worth tens of millions of yuan, and the pig boats also lost over 50 million. Currently, Zhang Wenqi and others in the town are petitioning the authorities for: (1) deploying troops to garrison the town, (2) issuing firearms to the town's security team, and (3) immediately installing telephones. The authorities have responded satisfactorily and have first dispatched a security squad to garrison the town. Furthermore, Qianpu Jing town northeast of Huayang Bridge, and the Huayan Temple outside the east gate, were also robbed on the night of the 8th.

### Social Services: American and Chinese Athletes Compete, Thousands Line the Streets to Watch the Game

Observing the Art of Basketball - A Rare Opportunity. Benefiting the Impoverished - Education Assistance First.

Tonight at 7:00 p.m., American and Chinese athletes will compete in a basketball game at the China Sports Field. The anticipation has been building in Shanghai for some time, and general fans are eagerly waiting. At that time, there will be a scene of thousands lining the streets, vying to be first. The motivation for this game is entirely to raise funds for education assistance, to relieve impoverished students, to enable them to continue their education, strive for progress, and complete their studies. This meaning is very profound. Therefore, enthusiastic people are doing their best to support, saving on unnecessary waste, buying a few honorary tickets or regular tickets, and accompanying their siblings, relatives, or old friends, to appreciate the excellent basketball skills. The courage of the athletes of both countries is so exciting and pleasant, and indirectly helping the suffering of out-of-school youths is so psychologically comforting. I earnestly urge you all: to vigorously promote and introduce this great undertaking with active meaning!

In order to facilitate busy people, this office has entrusted eight places to sell ball tickets. Please contact them nearby. The locations are: International Hotel, Wing On Company Gift Certificate Department, Grand Theater, Grand China Theater, Nanjing Theater, Xianqiao YMCA, Tongde Medical College, and this office. As for the technical aspects of the competition, it has been reported in detail by our newspaper and the sports pages of various newspapers, so I will not repeat it.

### Report on Donations for the Sino-American Basketball Charity Game

We are grateful to all sectors of society for purchasing honorary tickets for the charity game yesterday, enthusiastically helping education and benefiting the impoverished.

Shi Zhifu, Zhong Biao, Zhongnan Bank, Ding Fangyuan, Jianghai Bank, Sun Ruihuang, Xu Chao, Wang Boyuan. Each of the above 12,000 yuan, Gu Nanqun 9,000 yuan, Tu Kaiwei, Yuan Hesong, Wah Fei Tobacco Company, Bao Guochang, Chen Bangdian, Sino-British Pharmacy, Chen Zhitang, Ke Ji, Sincere Company, Yan Bolin, Yang Fuchen, Yao Junzhi, Cai Shengbai, Wang Jitao. Each of the above 6,000 yuan.

### Local Magazines: Two Hundred and Sixteen Types

Since the victory, up to the present, the total number of magazines published in this city has reached 216, with a monthly circulation of over one million copies. Among them, 180 types have been registered with the Bureau of Social Affairs. At least five of the remaining 36 types have been suspended due to financial reasons. Looking back at the publishing industry in Shanghai in the first half of the year, not only was it restricted by the enemy and puppet regimes, but the quantity was also less than 50 types. It can be seen that the freedom of speech and publication in the recovered area has been demonstrated in the number of magazines. The following is a statistical analysis of the nature of the 216 magazines: 91 general types, 10 children and youth types, 17 literary types, 13 popular types, 2 science types, 18 film and theater types, 11 industrial types, 19 pictorial types, 5 commercial and economic types, 8 language types, 8 medical and health types, 5 women's types, and 9 other types, for a total of 216 types.

### Cousin Comes to Chongqing

— Mei Youyun

When the first steamboat down from Chongqing returned, it brought my cousin, whom I hadn't seen for many years. He came to this mountain city easily and happily. In this small house, we happily listened to him tell us about all sorts of things in Shanghai. He told us that this trip from Shanghai to Chongqing was such a pleasant journey. The train from Shanghai to Nanjing was so fast, and the boat from Nanjing to Chongqing was so good. There were so few passengers. It made my heart fly out of my chest, to Shanghai and then back to Chongqing. Flying back and forth. Easy and pleasant.

He told me he came to Chongqing to pick up his luggage. He bought a boat ticket and would go back to Shanghai right away. At most, he would only be delayed for a few days. So he and a friend who came with him were staying at the Victory Building for 6,000 yuan a day.

More than half a month later, I met my cousin on the street again. He greeted me in a hurry, with a worried look on his face. He told me that boat tickets were hard to buy. The room rate at the Victory Building was increasing the longer he stayed, so he had moved into the Times Inn. He was running around everywhere trying to buy a boat ticket.

Twenty-some days later, my cousin appeared in our small house again. He was already looking impatient and anxious. He said boat tickets were really hard to find. After running around for more than a month, he had finally found a "way," which required him to pay 250,000 yuan for the "ticket price" to pretend to be a worker in the coal bunker, holding a shovel to "load coal." He was willing to pay the money, but he didn't know how to "load coal," so that route had to be "blown."

A few days later, he ran over in the middle of the night and gave me some foreign books, saying they were hard to carry. He said I could keep them to read. I asked him if he had found a "way" yet. He said he had. He was asked to pay 200,000 yuan to pretend to be a sailor's son. He was going to meet this fake father tomorrow. It was like a play! As long as he could go back.

But a month passed, and I still hadn't received a letter from my cousin saying he had returned to Shanghai. The "way" of pretending to be a son must have "blown" again.

Yesterday, I received a letter from my cousin from Yichang. He said he had arrived in Yichang. He had to find another "way."

Holding this letter, I recalled the easy and pleasant way he was when he first arrived in Chongqing!

### Studying Mussolini's Brain

— Bai Hua

American military doctors examined Mussolini's brain tissue under a microscope, but found no signs to explain why the fascist leader was so violent.

Colonel Ash, director of the U.S. Army Medical Museum, said that the museum received two pieces of Mussolini's forebrain. The study of these two pieces of forebrain has not been completely completed. As far as the results obtained so far, Mussolini's brain has no disease or structural defects.

However, Dr. Ohaushep, director of the National St. Elizabeth's Mental Hospital in the United States, believes that Mussolini's brain has no physiological or structural defects, but this does not mean that he has no mental illness.

Dr. Ohaushep said, "Brain physiological defects are often the cause of mental illness; however, mental patients do not necessarily have significant brain defects. In addition to brain physiology, there are other factors that can affect a person's behavior. For example, living environment, the body's chemical mechanisms - especially the activity of the adrenal glands, can affect a person's brain and even a person's behavior."

Colonel Ash said: "You can't rely on microscopic examination of the brain to determine that he is a genius or an ordinary person. What the microscope can see is only severe brain structural defects, such as intellectual weakness. Mussolini is obviously not a person with intellectual weakness."

### Business Philosophy

— Yale

Various industries in our country are still very fragile. "Poor personnel management" is of course one of the main reasons, but there are too many people engaging in infighting for private gain, and too little competition for normal progress, which is also a real situation. As a result, people who are not worthy of their names and those who have made ill-gotten gains fill society, while those who have truly achieved success in their careers and can "benefit the country and the people" are rare.

In fact, people's evaluation should not be based on wealth and status, but on the meaning and contribution of their careers. Although the War of Resistance has been completed, the work of nation-building is still in its early stages. If the youth of today still have the wrong understanding of this, then the future of the country is still unimaginable. Therefore, it is very important for every young person to have their own business philosophy and take on the heavy responsibility of nation-building. Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen said: "With the spirit of tens of millions of our people who will die in a few decades, we will create a foundation that will last for hundreds of millions of years." This is to instruct young people to establish a business philosophy and work hard to create it. Although an immortal career cannot be achieved by everyone, regardless of the size of the career, we must do our best to contribute to human welfare. The so-called "learning for application" is to use what we have learned in meaningful work, which is the correct business philosophy of young people.

Although everything at present is too far from ideal, it is inevitable to be disappointed, but we must know that the war has just ended, and all order has not yet been restored. We still have to go through a short period of hardship, which is also expected. As long as the whole country works hard to overcome the hardship, this period of hardship will be easily shortened. Understanding this, there is really no need to be disappointed and depressed, but we should be more energetic and move forward. Hold on to the business philosophy and work hard for the cause of nation-building.

It is not a concern for a person to go through a period of hardship. If he does not achieve success in his career and cannot fulfill his responsibilities to society and the country, then it is truly regrettable. Therefore, Mencius said: "A gentleman has lifelong worries, but no momentary misfortune." This sentence is indeed the truth, and we should think about it repeatedly.

### The Enemy (Eighteen)

— Pearl S. Buck, Translated by Zhu Qi

"Are you saying that man escaped?" the General asked weakly. He had been operated on a week earlier, and Sadao had been called in to perform the emergency surgery that night. Sadao had twenty-four hours to determine whether the general would live. The disease had spread to the gallbladder too much. Then the old man began to breathe deeply again and want to eat. Sadao could not ask about the assassination. As far as he knew, they had never come. The servants had all returned, and Hana had thoroughly cleaned the guest room, and had even used sulfur inside to fumigate away the white man's smell. No one had said anything. The only one who was angry was the gardener, because the chrysanthemum season was over.

But a week later, Sadao felt that the General was a little better, and he could tell him about the prisoner.

Sadao was now saying, "Yes, sir, he escaped." He coughed, indicating that he had not finished what he wanted to say, but was unwilling to disturb the General any further. But the old man suddenly opened his eyes and looked at him.

He said forcefully, "That prisoner, didn't I promise you that I would kill him for you?"

Sadao said, "You did, sir."

The old man said in surprise, "Yes, I did say that. But you know, I was very sick. To be honest, I didn't think of anything but myself. To put it simply, I forgot what I promised you."

Sadao murmured, "I was wondering too, sir."

The General said, "This is indeed my negligence. But you also know that this is not unpatriotic or negligent of duty." He looked anxiously at his doctor. "If this matter is revealed, can you understand this?"

Sadao said, "Yes, sir." He suddenly realized that the General was in his control, and in the end, he was safe. He said to the General, "I can vouch for your loyalty and your enthusiasm for resisting the enemy."

The General murmured, "You are a good man, you can be rewarded." He closed his eyes.

### I am

— Lin Bao

I am the recorder of the times.

I speak every language in the world, I go to the ends of the earth.

I bring knowledge, inspiration, and entertainment to mankind.

I am the enemy of ignorance and slavery, the ally of enlightenment and freedom.

I interact with people at any time, encouraging them to move forward and pointing them in the right direction.

I treat people of all races, colors, beliefs, and social statuses equally.

I have the power to expand human horizons, deepen their emotions, improve their commerce, and fulfill their lives.

I am a true friend, a wise consultant, and a loyal leader.

I am as quiet as gravity, as gentle and powerful as electricity, and as durable as the mountains of eternity.

I am a book?

### Rumors of Differential Exchange Rates Abound, Market Favors Cash over Gold

Gold Prices Close with a Weakening Trend

Yesterday's gold market started high and then fell sharply, gaining strength then becoming weak. Small investors rushed to buy, but banks took the opportunity to release stocks. Large investors shifted from long to short positions, leading to extreme volatility. The morning saw a strong upward trend, with prices once surging above 770,000. However, large investors sold aggressively after advancing, turning the market bearish. Rumors of Chairman Chiang's visit to Shanghai prompted many small investors to liquidate their positions, causing prices to fall back to below 720,000. Ultimately, the market closed with a slight gain compared to the previous day's close. Sichuan banks profited by unloading their holdings, and the market gradually became more fluid. General sentiment remained cautious about raising the market too much, despite differing opinions on the new exchange rate. As such, today's gold prices reached saturation points twice, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both times, the market lost its will and changed after the big investors sold stocks. Thereafter, the market persisted in a fixed situation. Jewelry stores listed gold ornaments at 79,000, tael silver at 600 yuan, silver coins at around 440 yuan. The spot exchange rate remained at around one corner. Small investors dared not take action easily, and the money supply remained abundant.

Foreign Exchange

U.S. dollar initially saw strong market conditions with individuals going to sell gold to buy US notes, with the market robust pushing above 1310 yuan. Foreign traders, trading companies, and large holders aggressively discounted and sold their holdings at high prices. The markets then were loose and easy which saw an immediate retracement to near 1260. Then the gold price went up. However, in the afternoon, the color shifted again in the gold market. The merchants all rushed to sell their US notes which saw a sharp decline back down to 1200. In the end the US note still finished up 50 plus or minus yuan over the previous day. The spread between the price of 10 taels of Gold vs the US dollar shrunk from 620 yuan down to 580. Finally it settled a bit higher around 600. In general there was an obvious feeling of gold being less desirable vs. holding cash, which was under the influence of different exchange rates. The HK dollar also followed a trend of going up and then going down again. Old HK dollar notes had previously traded near 240 yuan, and the new ones went near 70 yuan, however, in the end they both finished similar to the trend seen on the previous day.

Securities Public bonds trended generally flat, top rated shares were okay. Lesser rated shares were off a little bit. Finally, the market finished down around 5 yuan to 15 yuan. Local shares followed the same pattern as gold by going up and then falling in value, traders took advantage of the high levels to sell, as a result, the price of Mayer, after going up as high as 305 Yuan, did not stay up at those levels. Mayer's share price finished up 20, Yarn shares finished up 40. Jingfu finished up 2, Qin Xing and Xin Guang both finished up 1.5. However, the market was still more than half a percent off of its high levels that it was seeing earlier that day. The foreign shares also trended to be flat. Iisha Iip and Paper all showed gains. Other shares finished down around 10 percent. Some people were interested.

Rice Grain Yesterday's rice market saw an uptick of prices of goods from inland due to an increase in the cost of goods coming in. As a result, white rice from Jiangxi all went up 400 or 500 yuan. Slightly earlier rice from North went down a bit, and the price went up 600 or 700 yuan. White rice finished up 600 or 700 yuan. There were still a lot of cooking oil coming in, with the prices up 300 to 500 yuan. Demand for soybean oil outstripped supply which saw prices going up 1000 yuan. Flour was also up 100 or 200 yuan. Supplies of yellow beans were low which also resulted in demand being higher than supply. High quality ingredients were up 400 or 500 and middle and lower quality ingredients also went up 200 to 300 yuan. Sales of raw ingredients also recovered which saw prices up 1000 yuan. The Soybean market also finished up a bit more than 100 yuan. However, the alcohol market stayed pretty quiet.

Yarn Market The market opened too high in the morning, a good four or five million more than yesterday. However, with sellers lining up to get their orders in, the market trended down all the way. For example, a 16 thread Guangming yarn fell straight from 350 thousand all the way down to 320 thousand. 20 thread and 32 thread threads saw a sharp decrease in demand. However, the mills were still trying to sell a lot, however, they were seeing little activity and the orders were few and far between, Even though it finished up one or two million over where it was from the day before, the trend still seemed very fragile and nervous.
