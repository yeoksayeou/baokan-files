Allied Aircraft Roar into the Sky, Forming an Aerial Bridge

Chongqing, 30th – According to a Tokyo Allied News Agency broadcast on the 30th, Reuters noted that its reporter, Rubin, arrived in Tokyo this morning. Due to difficulties with telecommunications, he requested this agency to forward his report. He is one of the first four war correspondents from the Allied side to arrive in Tokyo. His report is as follows: On average, one Allied aircraft is landing at this airfield every two minutes, and simultaneously unloading and taking off, so that troops and supplies can continuously pour into this "beachhead" without obstructing air traffic. The first Japanese sight that catches the eyes of the soldiers in the plane is Mount Fuji, which stands tall in clear weather. After dawn today, a clear blue sky welcomed them, and Allied aircraft roared into the sky from the airfields of Okinawa, averaging one every two minutes. This air transport team thus formed a bridge reaching Atsugi Airfield.

### General Wedemeyer Speaks to Reporters; Answers Various Military Inquiries

Chongqing, 30th – General Albert Wedemeyer, Chief of Staff of the China Theater and Commander of U.S. Forces in China, held a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters at the U.S. military headquarters at 3:30 PM today. Wedemeyer did not make any statements, but only answered the questions raised by reporters. Key points are recorded as follows:

Regarding the issue of sending U.S. troops to Shanghai, Wedemeyer replied that we will not send any troops to the Shanghai area until all circumstances have reached a safe point, and the Japanese troops within the China Theater have not signed the surrender agreement in Nanjing. Wedemeyer solemnly declared here that the policy of the U.S. government has not changed, and my mission is to assist China in redeploying its troops to the liberated areas and disarming and disbanding the Japanese military. The government has not authorized me to perform tasks other than combat.

When a reporter asked whether the United States would participate in the Japanese surrender signing ceremony in Nanjing, Wedemeyer replied that this is because the Chinese military and civilians in the China Theater have fought hard for eight years, and should now have full merit and glory to be responsible for accepting the surrender of the enemy. However, the United States and all Allied countries will have representatives present at the ceremony. The U.S. representative is General McClure. As for the issue of the enemy's surrender, Wedemeyer stated that he had not encountered any difficulties.

When a reporter asked how many planes would be needed to transport Chinese troops to various locations, Wedemeyer stated that it was difficult to give a specific number of planes, and the most difficult thing was the inconvenience of transporting fuel, but Chairman Chiang was determined to use any means to ensure that Chinese troops were quickly transported to designated areas.

Regarding the redeployment of U.S. troops, Wedemeyer replied that only an advance unit had advanced to the Nanjing area, but the redeployment of large numbers of troops would have to wait until later.

Wedemeyer discussed the issue of the surrender in Hong Kong, saying that British troops accepting the surrender were from the Pacific Theater and were anchored in Hong Kong's harbor awaiting orders. All surrenders within the China Theater, including Hong Kong and Vietnam, must wait until after the signing ceremony in Nanjing before proceeding. The surrender location in northern Vietnam will be held in either Kaiyuan or Haiphong, and Chairman Chiang will send a representative to accept it, while France will also send a representative to attend the ceremony. At this point, Wedemeyer announced that a prisoner-of-war camp had recently been discovered in Thailand, containing several Chinese and American prisoners.

When a reporter asked whether Chinese troops had entered Guangzhou, Wedemeyer replied that Chinese troops were advancing towards Guangzhou, but the enemy troops there were already prepared to surrender.

When answering questions about the repatriation of U.S. troops, General Wedemeyer stated that the issue of U.S. troops returning home was very complicated, and a concrete plan would have to wait for the Army Department to decide, but a large-scale repatriation of troops would have to wait until maritime transportation was restored. Currently, only a small number of troops are concentrated in Kunming, preparing to go to the India-Burma area, and then waiting for an opportunity to return to the United States.

Wedemeyer announced that the U.S. Navy was responsible for mine-clearing work in the Huangpu River area, while the British Navy was responsible for the Hong Kong area. Mine-clearing in the Wusong area is expected to be completed within the next week, and U.S. naval units will also travel up the Yangtze River to clear mines within the river, but the work will be more difficult.

### The Truth About the Pearl Harbor Attack

Chongqing, 30th – According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch from New York on the 29th, the Japanese military's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and military and naval facilities near Hawaii on December 7, 1941, not only caused the United States to participate in a global war, but also prompted the United States to study the facts that led to the Pearl Harbor incident. The full results of the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor were temporarily not announced by the United States for safety reasons. A year later, the Navy Department announced that the Japanese had temporarily rendered eight U.S. battleships and most of the aircraft in Hawaii ineffective. A total of 19 U.S. ships were sunk or damaged, and certain coastal facilities were also damaged. However, at that time, most of the damaged warships had already returned to the United States with the fleet. 80 naval aircraft were lost, 97 army aircraft were lost, 2,117 Navy and Marine Corps personnel were lost, 960 were missing, and 876 were injured. The Army lost 226 personnel, and 396 were injured. Former Secretary of the Navy Knox immediately flew to Pearl Harbor. In his report made one week after the attack, he blamed the commander of the area for dereliction of duty. A five-member commission headed by Supreme Court Justice Roberts also confirmed the guilt of the land and sea commanders in dereliction of duty in its investigation report submitted in 1942. Admiral Kimmel, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, and Lieutenant General Short, Commander of the Army in Hawaii, were both dismissed, but no formal charges were filed. The Army Department and the Navy Department both argued that a formal trial should be held at a certain time when public interests and safety allow. At that time, another special investigation committee was designated and organized by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy to conduct an independent investigation. On December 1 of last year, they submitted a report that had changed the previous argument that the two derelict officials should be handed over to a military court for trial, stating only that there was "an error in judgment" at the time. From the current evidence, the United States has not considered punishing them again.

### First Batch of European War Criminals - List Announced - Includes Göring and Hess

### Press Conference by the Ministry of Information - Minister of Military Administration Chen Speaks - Striving to Maintain Conditions for Victory

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th: Chen Cheng, Minister of Military Administration, attended a press conference held by the Ministry of Information at 4:00 PM on the 29th and made a statement. Regarding the reasons for China's victory in the War of Resistance, he stated it was due to: 1. The correct decisions and unwavering stance of the Supreme Commander. 2. The continuous sacrifice and struggle of the Chinese military and people. 3. The tremendous assistance provided by the Allied nations, especially the American forces in China. Chen stated that while victory has been achieved, there are still many conditions to maintain it. Failure to strive diligently would be a disservice to the Supreme Commander and the Allied nations. The error in judgement on the part of its leaders and the power of the atomic bomb were reasons for failure. The Soviet Union's participation in the war was also a major factor. However, certain advantages should not be overlooked: 1. The loyalty and bravery of the Japanese officers and soldiers in combat. 2. Even after surrender, the enemy remained obedient to orders and attentive to discipline. Therefore, to maintain lasting world peace, we must cooperate sincerely with the Allied nations; otherwise, the enemy may rise again. It should be understood that while the enemy's weapons have been disarmed, its army did not suffer heavy casualties, and its recovery may be faster than after World War I.

Future Military Reorganization Requires Three Things

Chen then discussed the issue of future military reorganization, stating that after the Japanese surrender, the entire country remained very concerned about this issue. He believes that military reorganization is important in both peacetime and wartime. It should be understood that even if we dedicate the full strength of the nation, it would be insufficient to support 300 divisions. We cannot put all the able-bodied men in the country into the military, leaving them unfed, nor can we spend all the money on the military. Therefore, future military reorganization must be carried out more actively. Regarding the requirements for military reorganization, Chen stated: First, military administration and military command must be unified. Second, the military should be a tool to ensure national defense and security, not a tool for personal promotion and wealth. Third, modernization is required in terms of organization, training, equipment, and supply, that is, a lean and efficient military. Regarding the disposal of demobilized officers and soldiers, from the start of military reorganization until January of this year, 30 armies, approximately 80 divisions, have been cut, totaling over one million people, and the process has been going well.

Demobilized Officers and Soldiers Should be Enabled to Produce

The spirit of patriotism and obedience to orders demonstrated by demobilized officers and soldiers is comparable to the contribution of those who shed blood on the front lines. They should be given the same treatment, both materially and spiritually. After the war, efforts should be made to transform them from consumers into producers, such as implementing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's policy of soldier-laborers. In short, the government will not allow anyone to become displaced. During my inspection of eight provinces in the Southwest and Southeast, I met with the commanders of three field armies and the officers of four war zones. In our conversations, I learned that the officers and soldiers understood the purpose of military reorganization. All units reorganized according to the central government's regulations have received the same treatment. Before reorganization, each soldier received only 50 yuan per month; after reorganization, they receive 900 yuan. Before reorganization, the food and expenses for each soldier ranged from 900 to 1,000 yuan; after reorganization, they are 3,600 to 10,000 yuan. Regarding weaponry, Minister Chen believes that after military reorganization, uniformity must be strived for, otherwise, supply will be very difficult. The main weapons must be self-sufficient.

Dispatching Forces to Occupy Japan

After Minister Chen finished speaking, he was asked whether the number of troops we would send to occupy mainland Japan had been determined. Chen replied that the amount of troops was still being studied and would depend on the needs. A reporter asked how veteran soldiers should be treated after the war. Chen replied that this plan was under review. The government would guarantee the livelihood of those with complete disabilities, while those with partial disabilities would be given appropriate jobs. A reporter also asked how the suspension of supplies under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act would affect the war. Chen replied that according to the regulations of the act, it should be suspended after the end of the war. Therefore, the U.S. government's suspension of supplies under the Lend-Lease Act was legal. In the future, if we have any needs, we can obtain them through loans, exchanges, and other means.

Few Remaining Mines in the Yangtze River

A reporter asked how the mine-clearing work in the Yangtze River was progressing. Chen replied that, to the best of his knowledge, there were few remaining mines in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. When he (Chen referring to himself) was serving in the Sixth War Area, there was mine-laying work in the Yangtze River, which was very effective at first, and many enemy ships were sunk. Later, the enemy became aware and took strict precautions, and there were few remaining mines. In the lower reaches, enemy ships constantly traveled back and forth, and even sailed at night, which clearly proves that there were not many mines. However, we should still continue to clear them to avoid accidents.

The Sino-Soviet Treaty Has Far-Reaching Significance

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th: Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng recently made a statement on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, stating: In my opinion, this treaty is of great importance and far-reaching significance. The Sino-Soviet alliance can not only lay the foundation for peace in East Asia but also maintain world peace. This treaty can indeed prevent the enemy's attempts at aggression. However, we ourselves must not become complacent because peace is guaranteed. On the contrary, we should work harder to ensure world peace. The Soviet Union is a peace-loving country. This war was forced upon them by Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has suffered greatly during the war. Therefore, the Soviet Union's need for peace is even more pressing, and we should also work hard from now on and strive for self-improvement so as not to let down the conclusion of this treaty.

### Military Agencies in the City Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday - Over Thirty Representatives Attended and Made Five Resolutions

The Representative Office of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission in Shanghai and the Shanghai Military Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of representatives from various military agencies in the city at the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters at 10:00 AM yesterday. Representatives from the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, the Third War Area, the Military Intelligence Bureau, the Ministry of Military Operations, the Military Police, the Action Corps, and other units, totaling over thirty people, attended the meeting. After discussion, the following five urgent measures were decided:

Procedures for Borrowing Buildings

Each unit must follow specific procedures for borrowing office buildings and must not exceed the actual needs of the office. Those who have already borrowed buildings should maintain the status quo, but must immediately report the location of the building, the circumstances of the borrowing, and details to the Military Commissioner's Office.

Regulations for Plainclothes Armed Personnel

Each unit must have regulations for plainclothes armed personnel and immediately inspect the issued weapons, including: 1. The name of the officer or soldier. 2. The type and serial number of the gun. 3. The number of bullets and two photos of the person carrying the gun. A form must be created and sent to the Military Commissioner's Office for review and verification, and a gun license must be issued. Anyone found carrying a gun without a license after this has been organized will be investigated and confiscated by the military police.

Applying for Car Licenses on Behalf of Others

Recently, unlicensed cars have been found driving in the city, which seriously hinders public safety. If any agency has a car without a license, they can immediately apply for a license and send it to the Military Commissioner's Office to be processed on their behalf.

Establish a Temporary Liaison Office

Due to the current needs of the city, a temporary liaison office for the various military agencies stationed in Shanghai should be established to ensure consistent action.

Report Irregular Conduct

Each unit should report any past actions taken in other’s names or beyond regulation. Once verified, they will be severely punished. (Daguang News Agency)

### Surplus of Air Raid Relief Funds Allocated to Scholarship

Shen and Xin Two Newspapers Decide to Handle Similarly

The Scholarship Office of this newspaper will begin distributing scholarships from September 3rd. Elementary school students will receive 100,000 yuan each, junior high school students 150,000 yuan, senior high school and vocational school students 200,000 yuan, and university students 300,000 yuan. However, if the tuition fees of various schools are lower than these amounts, the actual amounts will still be issued. Based on the number of students receiving assistance this year, the 350 million yuan already raised will be allocated as much as possible, but there is still a shortfall of over 60 million yuan. This newspaper has consulted with the Xinwen Bao and decided to incorporate the surplus of air raid relief donations previously collected into the scholarship fund, with both newspapers handling it in the same way. Providing disaster relief and scholarships each have their significant meanings. Now that world peace has been restored and a bright future is here, disaster relief has become a thing of the past, while scholarships are urgently needed. This move to shift from what is no longer needed to what is urgently needed will surely be welcomed by donors from all walks of life.

Furthermore, according to records, this newspaper collected a total of 376,066,700 yuan in air raid relief donations, plus 244,300 yuan in interest, totaling 376,311,000 yuan. Of this amount, 339,750,000 yuan was paid to the former "Citizens Welfare Association" (see the revenue and expenditure report in the Social Services section of this newspaper on August 15th). The remaining balance is 36,561,000 yuan. This amount will be incorporated into the scholarship fund for distribution. In addition, another 30 million yuan shortfall will be raised from all walks of life to meet urgent needs. The office stipulates that starting from September 3rd, a "Notice of Approval" will be issued. It is hoped that approved students from all schools will bring their slips and identification to the office to collect them on time, and they can use these slips to pay their tuition fees to their respective schools. The dates are as follows:

Date　Morning　Afternoon

September 3rd (Monday)　Senior Elementary School　Junior High 1

September 4th (Tuesday)　Junior High 2　Junior High 3

September 5th (Wednesday)　Senior High　University/Vocational

·Note· If approved students transfer to other schools or move up to a higher level in the next semester, they must report the details in writing as soon as possible, or consult in person at the office.
