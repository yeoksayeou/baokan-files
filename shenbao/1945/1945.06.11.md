### The Ministers of the Army and Navy Report on the War Situation

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At yesterday's special session of the Diet, Army Minister Anami reported on the war situation, with the following main points: Regarding the situation in Okinawa, seven weeks have passed since enemy forces landed on the main island. During this time, our forces, fighting against numerically superior enemies, have inflicted heavy damage. In late May, our forces withdrew from the Shuri and Naha areas to reorganize the battle lines in the rear. In Burma and the Philippines, our forces are fighting fiercely against superior enemy forces, but morale is extremely high, and they continue to engage the enemy. American-style Chongqing troops from North Burma have been transferred to Kunming and the Yangtze River area. The enemy is also attempting to land and conduct operations from the Pacific side, and we have made thorough preparations. Although the soldiers and officers on each front continue to fight bravely, we must frankly admit that the entire East Asian war situation is currently in a difficult state. We are now standing at an unprecedented national crisis. Now is an excellent opportunity to proclaim to China and foreign nations the true essence of our glorious national polity. Our army and navy are working together as one, and under the single operational concept, we are confident that we will be able to destroy the enemy. We will repay the assistance and trust of our compatriots in the army with the fact of resounding victory and live up to the expectations of the people.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Navy Minister Yonai reported on the war situation at yesterday's special session of the Diet, with the following main points: Frankly speaking, the situation in Okinawa is very unfavorable to us. Although we are currently exerting all our efforts under the cooperation of the army and navy to destroy the enemy forces, we have not yet been able to destroy all of the enemy's warships and mobile units to gain air supremacy, and our ground forces are being suppressed, which is extremely regrettable. However, we have also inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy during this time. The war results that have now been confirmed have reached a considerable amount. As of now, the number of enemy ships that have been bombed and sunk by our forces, compared with the American naval power unique to the Okinawa campaign at the time of its start, accounts for one-half of aircraft carriers and cruisers, and one-fifth of special aircraft carriers and battleships. In addition, there are still many ships of unidentified types. From various points of view, the enemy's operations are actually more difficult than ours. The outcome of the war must be decided in the final five minutes. Therefore, no matter what difficulties we encounter in the future, the Imperial Navy will fight to the end with an indomitable spirit to achieve the objectives of the holy war.

Situation of the House of Representatives Meeting the Day Before Yesterday

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 9th, after deciding on the answer to the Imperial Rescript, the entire assembly stood and passed the resolution to present a memorial regarding the previous disaster in the Imperial Palace, and then entered into general reports. In the afternoon, Prime Minister Suzuki delivered a policy speech, followed by Army Minister Anami and Navy Minister Yonai, who gave separate reports on the war situation. The entire assembly then unanimously passed a resolution of gratitude and condolence to the army and navy officers and soldiers, and after offering a silent prayer for the fallen soldiers, the army and navy ministers delivered their thanks. Then, it was the time for representative questioning. Mr. Masataka Ota of the Japan Political Association raised questions regarding the national guidance policy for the war situation, the responsibility for guiding the war situation, and the strengthening of coordination among military officers, and expressed the hope that war disaster countermeasures and price countermeasures would be implemented promptly. Prime Minister Suzuki replied: Regarding the national guidance policy, in order to deal with the decisive battle on the mainland with the unity of the whole country, we plan to prepare and establish a posture, boost the national will to fight, and ensure food and weapons, with the organization of national volunteers as the key points, and give play to its function. Regarding the responsibility for the war, the government and the Supreme Command are cooperating closely, but as the war situation is gradually becoming serious, the close cooperation between state affairs and command should be further enhanced in order to carry out the war. Regarding the adjustment and strengthening of policies between government and civilians, it is gradually being implemented. Regarding the prompt implementation of government policies, I deeply agree. After the Prime Minister finished answering, Minister of the Navy Yonai and Minister of Health Okada provided supplementary explanations. Following the addition of the agenda, four items, including the Wartime Emergency Measures Bill, were submitted in turn. The government side explained the reasons for the proposals and referred them to a committee. The meeting adjourned at 4:25 PM.

Japanese Combat Volunteer Corps Will Be Supplied with Firearms at Any Time

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of the Army, Nasu, stated on the 9th during the Diet’s volunteer military service bill committee, in response to questions, a policy to provide combat volunteers with hand grenades and other weapons. Regarding the status and rank of volunteer corps members when they are transferred to combat units, he elaborated as follows: The actual tasks of the volunteer corps are mainly rear service and other communication and information during combat. However, in urgent situations, combat members must also engage in guerrilla warfare or self-defense combat and, to the extent possible, under the consideration of local troops or divisions, be given hand grenades or other firearms. Second, regarding status and rank, when volunteer corps members are transferred to combat units, the status and rank of the volunteer corps will still apply.

Wartime Emergency Measures Bill

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to adapt to the current difficult situation, the Japanese government has proposed a Wartime Emergency Measures Bill in this Diet session. According to this bill, the Japanese government has specially formulated a legislative bill based on wartime law in order to implement emergency measures and deal with difficult situations. Therefore, its purpose is to take any emergency measures when implementing various measures to enhance combat power, to enhance combat power, and not to be bound by any existing laws. This is what is called the "Parliamentary Bill of Complete Delegation of Authority." In short, this bill has the same effect as invoking Article 31 of the Constitution, the "Emergency Great Power." The full text of the bill has five articles. As for the following matters: Maintaining and enhancing military production, Ensuring food and other daily necessities, Maintaining and enhancing transportation and communication, Strengthening defense and maintaining order, Amending tax rates, Post-war measures for war damage, Other matters necessary for the concentrated exertion of combat power, will be stipulated by imperial ordinance.

### Japanese Troops Launch Special Attacks, Assault Enemy Warships, Naval Infantry Charge at Night

Southern West Islands Base, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Japanese torpedo squadron discovered traces of enemy battleships and cruisers in the sea area around Okinawa Island on the 9th and launched a daring attack. Other Japanese air units also attacked three large enemy ships and three ships of unknown types in the same area with large direct-hit bombs, causing large fires. Also, on the morning of the 9th, they attacked the enemy airfield on Ie Island, causing continuous explosions in several places, with flames soaring into the sky, visible from afar. From the night of the 9th to the 10th, the Japanese air force continued to repeatedly attack the enemy positions.

Forward Aviation Base, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It has now been determined that the Japanese Army Special Attack Unit had previously carried out a close-quarters assault on enemy warships around Okinawa, with the entire aircraft crashing into one enemy battleship, one large transport ship, and one ship of unknown type. From the night of the 8th to the morning of the 9th, special attacks were again launched against the enemy.

Southwestern Islands Base, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - For four days in early June, Japanese naval infantry used artillery and explosives to break into enemy positions in the Ozato area, killing and wounding 1,340 enemies and destroying and burning approximately 19 enemy tanks and other vehicles. In particular, on the night of the 7th, a suicide squad of more than ten soldiers, including Petty Officer Inoue, charged into an enemy camp near the Ozato airfield, destroying enemy vehicles and tents, and killing and wounding dozens of enemy soldiers. On the night of the 7th, a suicide squad including Seaman Yamaguchi infiltrated the Tamagusuku area, set fire to enemy warehouses, and destroyed one enemy vehicle.

All Okinawa Island Residents Help in the War

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the enemy landed on Okinawa Island in early April, all the residents of the island have been assisting the military in fighting the enemy, and the spirit of loyalty and patriotism of the Japanese people has been fully demonstrated. The young men of the island go without saying, even women and children all place the country and the home above all else, and life and death as secondary. There are often elementary school students carrying explosives and rushing into enemy positions, causing the enemy to marvel in surprise. Governor of Okinawa Prefecture Shimada and other local officials are currently leading civil and military volunteer corps, urging the army to direct operations on the front lines. On the 14th of last month, when the conference of local leaders was held in Tokyo, a telegram was sent in the name of the conference to encourage Governor Shimada. The governor replied: "I swear to fight to the death on the battlefield and not fail your expectations." By the end of last month, communication between Okinawa and Tokyo had become difficult, but every effort was made to maintain contact. Recently, the Governor's report on the war situation and political affairs has reached the Japanese government. The document details the current situation of the islanders' heroic resistance. Practical measures have been prepared regarding actions after the enemy landing. As for the governor himself, there is not a word of mention, because the governor only knows loyalty and patriotism and has long put his personal affairs out of his mind. In addition, Okinawa's only newspaper, the "Okinawa Shinpo," is still being published as usual, contributing greatly to the war effort.

### The Inner Workings of the Xicheng Yuman Blindly Followed Innate Taoism (2)

— Yu Yu

Organizational Insider

Due to the accumulated resentment of farmers over the years, once there is something to rely on, even if it is a belief, they are extremely trusting, so the momentum is expanding day by day. Its sphere of influence is also gradually widening. At first, it was only settled in the Fourth District, and the incense hall was set up in Zhujiali, which can also be said to be the birthplace of Southern Innate Taoism. Later, it was extended to Zhangjing Bridge in the Third District, which was determined by the power of the masses. The membership fee was initially 200 yuan per person, and later increased to 2,500 yuan. The money collected was handed over to Xu Cuichu for safekeeping and processing, and there was no reimbursement, relying on credit. Because farmers' knowledge is naive and they lack training on weekdays, their belief in Innate Taoism is like a raging fire, so branch halls are everywhere. As long as there are dozens of people, setting up an altar can form a branch hall without contacting the general hall or applying for establishment, so there is a lack of national unity. Their combination is based on a village as a unit. If there is an accident, they will sound the gong twice as a signal. When each village hears the gong sound, they will respond immediately and gather quickly to the place where the accident occurred, those with knives taking knives, those with guns taking guns, in various forms, regardless of men or women. They gather when something happens, and disperse when nothing happens.

Although the organization of Innate Taoism is completely disorganized, and its growth is also completely blind, their goals are all the same. Their goal is to protect the righteousness of their hometown. Therefore, they believe that anyone who opposes them is their enemy. In order to protect their hometown, they can only gather together and fight the other side. Their targets are bandits who rob them and corrupt military police and evil officials who extort them. They feel that in this chaotic world, the power of the government cannot protect them, so they can only rely on the power of God and their own power to protect themselves. Because they feel that only God is selfless, and only divine power and their own struggle can relieve their own suffering. The reason why Innate Taoism can be promoted so rapidly today may be based on this point.

Success is Easy, Failure is Also Easy

A group, if there is no overall planning and strict discipline, is naturally easy to degenerate. Innate Taoism was originally an unorganized mob, but they have the power of a swarm, which will naturally be coveted and used by general swindlers. After becoming public from secrecy, many unscrupulous speculators, mostly bandits, hooligans, villains, and those who attempt to avenge personal grudges, gradually intervened. Their purposes are also inconsistent. Bandits attempt to gain their power and increase their own strength. Hooligans include two types: one is opportunistic and tries to take advantage, and the other is usually hated by farmers and is afraid of being harmed by farmers, so they express repentance in order to preserve their lives. Villains are generally idle people who specialize in making trouble and prefer to turn small things into big things, so they can seize power and profit from it.

As for those who seek revenge for personal grudges, they use the power of Innate Taoism to avenge personal grudges. At first, there was a sense of loyalty between members, and if a member had difficulties, they would compete to help. I heard that a month or two ago, a couple had difficulty living in Shanghai and evacuated back to their hometown. After passing through a checkpoint, they were detained by an inspector who claimed that the items they were carrying were contraband and should be seized. As a result, the man was insulted and his belongings were forcibly taken. After this stimulus, he was silent and depressed, and over time he became ill and died. The wife was deeply saddened, harboring resentment and hatred. At that time, I heard that "Innate Taoism" was popular in the countryside, so she became even more enthusiastic. One day, she let her hair down and said that her husband's ghost had silently told her to take revenge. The farmers believed it to be true, and everyone hated the people in the checkpoint in the countryside, and they were all resentful. So, with one voice, they swarmed towards the checkpoint, with the woman at the head, pushing out her enemy who killed her husband. Without saying a word, knives and guns moved in unison, and he died under the anger of the crowd.

After this turmoil in Innate Taoism, no matter how much the rules say "No illegal money, no collusion with bandits," it is difficult to guarantee that evildoers will not break the rules in secret. As a result, once the members become complicated, the customs become more and more corrupt. After a long time, even the leaders have no power to control, and orders are equal to waste paper. Now, the members of Innate Taoism can be roughly divided into the following five types: Pure farmers account for 50%, bandits and corrupt members account for 10%, hooligans and ruffians account for 20%, those who attempt revenge account for 10%, and the curious and unemployed idlers account for 10%. In a group with such five different thoughts and different purposes, how can the customs not be corrupted? This is the main reason why Innate Taoism is so easy to establish and so easy to fail.

### The Departure of Japan's Special Attack Politics: The Significance of Japan's 87th Extraordinary Diet Session

The Pacific war situation has gradually approached the decisive battle stage. The battle on Okinawa Island continues to be a bitter struggle under the defensive tactics being employed. The enemy, the United States, is still constantly probing for an opportunity to invade the Japanese mainland. Under this severe situation, Japan's 87th Extraordinary Diet session convened on the 8th and decided to continue the session on the 9th and 10th. Its significance is such that not only must the entire Japanese nation be inspired by it, but our nation must also recognize and pay attention to it.

Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki's policy speech was straightforward and frank. From the talks he gave when he took office and his repeated broadcasts to the nation, he has consistently conveyed the spirit of "dedicating himself to the utmost" in loyalty to the emperor and love for the country. In his inaugural address, Prime Minister Suzuki said, "The great task of reversing the desperate situation rests solely on the shoulders of one hundred million compatriots." In the broadcast upon receiving the imperial mandate, he also said, "The distance between the stubborn enemy and our homeland is decreasing day by day, and the only way to save the crisis is to arouse the people's animosity towards the enemy and to concentrate the nation's total power with one mind." Today, he further elaborates on the previous meaning, believing that although the domestic situation is fraught with difficulties, "if the entire nation can fight bravely and make desperate efforts to defend their respective positions, I am confident that we will be able to overcome the difficulties and achieve the purpose of the war." Prime Minister Suzuki's will is even more determined than before, and his expectations are even more earnest. Under the indiscriminate bombing raids by American aircraft, the Japanese people will surely take Prime Minister Suzuki's will as their own, live up to Prime Minister Suzuki's expectations, unite together, and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of resolving the crisis.

There are several points in Prime Minister Suzuki's speech that we must deeply recognize and pay attention to. The analysis is as follows:

First: Prime Minister Suzuki repeatedly clarified the essence of the Greater East Asia War. Japan's motives for waging war are, first, to fight against the tyrannical attitude and insatiable desires of the United States and Britain; second, to fight for Japan's self-preservation and independence; and third, to fight for the security of the entire East Asia. In short, Japan's declaration of war stemmed from justice. Secondly, Prime Minister Suzuki solemnly stated that the founding aspiration of the Japanese Imperial Family lies in "cherishing peace and seeking the well-being of mankind," and "enabling all nations to find their place, and all people to understand the righteousness of humanity and promote culture." From this, it can be further understood that Japan's pursuit of war was originally a measure taken out of necessity. Although the current situation is extremely serious, the future of the war must be deduced from this point of view. Even if it is already well-known, it must be recognized anew.

Second: Regarding Japan's attitude towards war, Prime Minister Suzuki declared twice in his speech, "Having heard that the enemy is now demanding our unconditional surrender, which would destroy our national polity and exterminate our nation, we have no choice but to fight to the end." He also said, "Observing the trends in the enemy's domestic situation and the direction of international affairs, one cannot help but painfully feel that we have no choice but to fight to the end, and there is no other way to go." Japan's direction of war is very clear, and all enemy rumors will be self-defeating.

Third: Prime Minister Suzuki stated the fundamental principle of Japan's courtesy towards the Greater East Asia and world order: "To establish a path of security that does not threaten or invade." The expression of this sentence is very powerful. Secondly, he declared, "We express our support for the opportunity for the Republic of China to unify and save the country." We must pay attention to this. In mid-April, various regions in our country held "Wartime People's Representative Congresses" and put forward the proposition of unifying and saving the country. Now that it has received Prime Minister Suzuki's response and support, the movement to unify and save the country must be promoted and realized.

Fourth: The Japanese mainland has now become an iron-walled fortress. The decisive battle on the Japanese mainland is the only key point at present. Prime Minister Suzuki, who is familiar with strategy, naturally knows the advantageous conditions, so he said, "If the homeland becomes a battlefield, we will have ten thousand times more advantages than the enemy in terms of geographical advantage and popular support." The so-called "the victory or defeat of the war depends on the last five minutes" in the war situation report by Navy Minister Yonai also lies in this. The decisive battle on the Japanese mainland has become an inevitable and important strategy to achieve the purpose of the war. Therefore, the mission of this extraordinary Diet session is to complete the posture of the decisive battle on the homeland.

The great significance of this extraordinary Diet session is as revealed in Prime Minister Suzuki's speech. Judging from the agenda, the goals of the discussion can be divided into the following two points:

First, the concentration of political power for the decisive battle. The most noteworthy "Wartime Emergency Measures Law" does not base its content on Article 31 of the Constitution, which pertains to "extraordinary powers," but in practice, it grants the government full authority over the Diet. This is a precursor to the government's implementation of decisive battle politics and an emergency measure to transform Japanese politics from pluralistic to monolithic.

Second, the universality of military power for the decisive battle. Two of the six bills submitted by the Japanese government to the extraordinary Diet session concern the National Volunteer Corps. The organization of the National Volunteer Corps is not only the hope of the Japanese government but also the hope of the Japanese people. The significance of the discussion of this volunteer service bill lies not only in providing a legal basis for the National Volunteer Corps movement but also in serving as a mobilization order for the joint uprising of one hundred million Japanese compatriots.

In short, the entire Japanese homeland, regardless of its key areas, material elements, or human elements, must be equipped within the system of the decisive battle. Japan's strong political power must overcome all difficulties to shoulder this major task. Japanese politics will, without distinction between the Diet and the government, implement special attack politics with the spirit of one hundred million special attackers. The unprecedented significance of this extraordinary Diet session in Japan is the departure point for Japan's special attack politics.

### Japan Implements Decisive Battle Administration: Establishes Local General Supervision Departments; Lt. Gen. Nishio and Others to Serve as General Supervisors

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – In order to implement decisive battle local administration, the Japanese government has decided to establish local general supervision departments in the administrative council locations of one circuit and seven regions nationwide. The current chairmen of the local administrative councils will serve as the local general supervisors. This morning, the general supervisors held an imperial audience ceremony in the presence of Prime Minister Suzuki. The names of the general supervisors are as follows: Hokkaido General Supervisor Kumagai Hajime, Tohoku Regional General Supervisor Maruyama Tsuruyo, Kanto-Shinetsu Regional General Supervisor concurrently Governor of Tokyo, Lt. Gen. Nishio Toshizo, Tokai-Hokuriku Regional General Supervisor Ko Tadaharu, Kinki Regional General Supervisor Yasui Eiji, Chugoku Regional General Supervisor Otsuka Koremasa, Shikoku Regional General Supervisor Kimura Masayoshi, Kyushu Regional General Supervisor Totsuka Kuichiro.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – This spring, in January, Prime Minister Koiso took measures to promote the coordination of defense and administration and to expedite the operation of policies, strengthening the connection between the chairman of the cooperative council and the commander of the military and the commander of the naval base. In order to strengthen the comprehensive operation of local administration, the Japanese government has now dissolved the local administrative councils and created a local general supervision department system based on the council's area as a unit, serving as a powerful administrative organ responsible for overseeing and supervising the local administration within its jurisdiction, in order to establish a self-reliant and self-sufficient posture in each region. According to the official system regulations, the local general supervision department is a purely administrative agency with the power to direct and supervise the local offices and special local offices within its jurisdiction. Thus, Japan's domestic administration operating mechanism is divided into three levels: the government, the local general supervision department, and the local office. A total of eight local general supervision departments are established according to the council areas. The local general supervisor is an imperial appointment official, and six local deputy general supervisors are appointed below him as imperial appointments officials. What is even more noteworthy is that in the past, the chairman of the council also served as the governor of the prefecture in that area, but in the future, the local general supervisor and the governor will be appointed separately. However, due to regional considerations, the Shikoku region and the Hokkaido region will still be held concurrently.

### Trieste Issue: Three Countries Sign Agreement; Southern and Northwestern Borderline Delineated

Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to news received here last night, the agreement between the British, American, and Yugoslav governments regarding the occupation and provisional administration of Trieste and the Slovenian coastal area was signed yesterday in Belgrade. This agreement will serve as the basic principle for the representatives of the Yugoslav military and the representatives of the United Nations military in establishing other necessary agreements in the future. According to an official announcement from London, the border line between the United Nations and Yugoslavia has been delineated from the southern region of Trieste, north through Gorizia, to Villach (i.e., Carinthia) on the Austrian border. West of this border line, the entire Venezia Giulia area will be under the jurisdiction of General Alexander, the Supreme Commander of the United Nations forces in the Mediterranean. East of this border line, it will all be under the control of the Yugoslav government. At the same time, a small part of the Yugoslav army (approximately 2,000 troops) will remain in the western part of the border line to form a joint administration agency directly under the command of General Alexander.

### Hitler: His Fate Uncertain

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Reuters special correspondent, H. Beattie, stated that General Zhukov told United Nations reporters today, "Two days before the fall of Berlin, Führer Hitler held a wedding ceremony with a movie actress named Braun."

Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a British correspondent stationed in Moscow, Lieutenant Colonel Bursarin, the commander of the Soviet garrison in Berlin, revealed his personal opinion yesterday, stating that Führer Hitler has not yet died and will inevitably be placed somewhere in Europe in the future, or he may live with Spanish leader General Franco. Although we have repeatedly found corpses that closely resemble Führer Hitler, we have not yet dared to assert that he is definitely dead. At the same time, General Zhukov also stated that Führer Hitler's marriage to the actress Braun is a fact. When the German General Staff headquarters fell into the hands of the Soviet army, it was found in a part of the adjutant's daily record book that there was an entry regarding Hitler's marriage.

### Financial and Commodity Prices Continued to Rise Sharply Last Week

The financial and industrial and commercial market conditions in Shanghai continued to change drastically in the past week, and the trend has become increasingly dangerous. Due to rumors and volatility, people's minds are restless, and the speculative market is active. Those who have funds are manipulating the market for profit, and the black market has risen and fallen dramatically, repeatedly hitting new highs. Large households are buying in and refusing to sell. Although the third installment of gold securities has been issued, it is difficult to curb the increase in the official price and the high prices on the black market. Only on Wednesday did it see a slight rebound, but it soon rose again, jumping 30 major points compared to the previous period. Silver also continued to rise. Allied banknotes rose steadily, which is considered stable. Although the authorities strictly prohibit enemy currency, it is still difficult to eliminate secret transactions. The price increase is particularly severe, but the drop is also large. Chinese stocks continued to rise. On Wednesday, due to the tightening of credit, a general limit down was once reached. On Thursday afternoon, the upward trend resumed, and the upward trend was even more severe on Friday. On Saturday morning, the market rose and then fell during the half-day session. People's minds are firm, and the buying wind is still strong. However, the three popular stocks, namely the American-Asian, Wing On, and Yarn Factory companies, are trending weakly, because they have been raised too high, and the volatility is very dangerous. The appetite of buyers is relatively weak. Small and medium-sized stocks. In terms of industry and commerce, due to the rise in the black market, and the difficulty in obtaining production raw materials, holders are reluctant to sell. In addition, asset holders are hoarding, causing a wave of price increases. The price of grain has risen by tens of thousands of yuan in one week. Coarse grains, oil, sugar, fuel, coal, and firewood have successively risen by 80% to 100%. Among daily necessities, the market prices of soap, matches, and cotton fabrics such as gauze, silk, and wool have exceeded 100%. Vegetable market prices have risen without any standards. The marked prices of goods sold by various companies and shops change several times a day, exceeding the door-to-door limited price approved by the Commodity Price Review Committee by three to four times. However, it has not been heard that the authorities have taken any measures. The Commodity Price Review Committee has not yet announced the implementation of the recently reviewed commodity prices. Citizens believe that if swift commodity price reviews and strict implementation of new limited prices are not adopted, the livelihood of ordinary people in society will be unimaginable, and the impact on people's livelihood and public order will be a cause for concern.

### Baobing [Neighborhood Watch] and Evacuation

— Jin Xiongbai

Mr. Jin Xiongbai, member of the Baobing Publicity Committee of the Shanghai Municipal District and President of the Pingbao Newspaper, broadcast the following speech on Shanghai Radio at 7:00 PM on the 10th: "Since the government implemented the Baobing system, the security and defense of Shanghai have made significant progress. In peacetime, the Baobing can supplement the insufficient strength of the military and police, ensuring the safety of our homes. In times of crisis, they can help each other, reducing unnecessary harm. Especially in wartime, such as air raids and fires, it is even more necessary for the Baobing to be united and work together. In the past, we saw a great shortcoming, which was the belief that serving in the Baobing was merely a government decree, a citizen's obligation. All the things that the Baobing should do were done with a perfunctory attitude. This is truly regrettable. Because our homes are our homes, and this place is a place we all share. By pooling the small amount of effort that each individual makes, we can make every home and the entire place as solid as a rock. The results and benefits we receive are our own. Therefore, we should all make the greatest effort to make the Baobing organization strict and its strength effective. If we continue with the current perfunctory state, we will only waste manpower and resources. Such a formalistic Baobing will be in a panic and helpless when accidents occur. In the end, we will still suffer ourselves. Therefore, I first appeal to all citizens to pay attention to the Baobing.

Reduce Losses and Preserve National Strength

Speaking of the evacuation problem, there are many practical reasons why people cannot leave. The common ailment of Shanghai citizens is that they do not have a firm will of their own. They all look at what others are doing and follow suit. If we continue to procrastinate in this way, we will not be able to leave when the time comes. Everyone, why put your family's life at risk in this way!

We know that evacuating the population under the threat of air control is to reduce damage and preserve national strength. In densely populated large cities, casualties are inevitable in the event of an air raid. Although we cannot completely eliminate the threat of air raids, we must find ways to minimize the damage. Manpower is the only resource in wartime, and we must cherish it, value it, and therefore, we must not ignore the dangers that manpower may encounter and try our best to eliminate or reduce those dangers. Therefore, evacuation work is truly the most important and necessary thing to do in Shanghai at present.

Secondly, the seriousness of the current food problem in Shanghai is an undeniable fact. The sharp increase in rice prices means that the common people will be unable to solve their "eating problem." This time, the rise in rice prices is somewhat different from the past, because rice prices in various places are gradually rising. Even in areas known for rice production, the same situation exists. Therefore, the increase in rice prices in Shanghai is unlikely to be reversed in the short term. Furthermore, along with the rise in rice prices, the market price of miscellaneous grains is also gradually increasing. In this way, the panic over the food problem is becoming more and more serious. Today's citizens should voluntarily evacuate. Those who have homes in the countryside should return home, and those who do not should go to their relatives and friends. Although rice prices in the countryside are more expensive, they are still lower than in Shanghai. The supply of food is also easier than in Shanghai, and the risk of air raids is also much better than in Shanghai. Why are the citizens not willing to evacuate?

The Bureau and folk leaders have already established a Population Evacuation Committee, which is scheduled to carry out the first evacuation starting on the 11th. Citizens who want to go can register at the offices in each district. If they hesitate and fail to move forward, missing the opportunity to evacuate, they may suffer damage in the future. Then it will be too late to regret it.

Now is not the time for theory, but the time for thorough implementation. To implement this important work, it must be done with the cooperation of all citizens, especially the Baobing, who must take on a very important role.

Use the Baobing to Promote Evacuation

Although the organization of the Shanghai Baobing has only a short history, it has generally laid a foundation. How to use the Baobing organization to promote the practice of evacuation is a major issue for the Baobing at present. We know that the public's lack of knowledge, superficial understanding, and insufficient judgment have led to the habit of treating most things, regardless of their importance, with indifference. The failure to thoroughly carry out the evacuation work is also one of the reasons. In the future, the Baobing personnel must explain the necessity of evacuation to each household in a sincere manner, and at the same time, inquire about their family situation and work environment. Those who do not need to stay in Shanghai should be persuaded to evacuate immediately. If there are any difficulties, they must also help to solve them, which will be of great benefit to the country and the people. Only in this way can the mission of evacuation be completed and the purpose of evacuation be achieved.

Everyone, the war has reached a decisive stage, and the dangers of war and the panic of food shortages are unavoidable facts. The countryside is definitely better than the city. The density of the population in Shanghai is such that the consequences of a major air raid are unimaginable. In terms of food, we are now in the transition period, and transportation is particularly difficult. The situation is getting more and more serious day by day. The security situation is also worrying. Now is not the time to stand still. Everyone, do not gamble with your life and family because you are greedy for the comfort of life in Shanghai. Evacuate quickly, evacuate as soon as possible!

Social Service

### Introduction to Amateur Library

With soaring prices, books and magazines are no exception, but spiritual food is indispensable, so libraries are particularly needed.

The China Amateur Library was formerly founded by the China Vocational Education Society. It has a collection of more than 20,000 books, with literature and social science books being the most numerous. In recent months, a large number of new books published by Commercial Press and World Book Company have been added, with emphasis on drama, natural sciences, and applied technology.

The original site was on the seventh floor of the Pudong Building. After the elevator stopped running, readers felt very inconvenient. Now it has been moved to the second floor of 80 Yandang Road (formerly Hualong Road). The procedures remain the same as before. Circulation and borrowing have already started at the new location.

In order to cover expenses, the library charges 200 yuan per month, but in order to take care of the poor and needy, there are also "free" quotas. There is no limit to the number of places. A brochure can be obtained from the library. (Chen Wei)
