### Dim Stars in the Azure Sky: Northeast Takeover Awaits Communication; National Army Captures Beizhen and Continues to Occupy Heishan

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] On Christmas Eve, looking into the distance at the Northeast, there are dim stars in the azure sky. This is a confirmed report: Malinovsky has stated that he cannot assist the National Army in taking over Dalian, as it is not within his military district. Therefore, the Mayor of Harbin has already left for the Northeast to assume his post, while Mayor Shen Yi is still suffering from a toothache in Beiping. Regarding the takeover of Andong, the Soviets have also indicated that they cannot send liaison officers to assist, as there are no Soviet troops stationed there at all. Originally, provincial chairmen were ordered to arrive in the Northeast before New Year's Day, but due to the current circumstances, it may be extended to early January. Before the National Army can transport and station large numbers of troops in each province, a small number of troops will be sent as guards when each provincial chairman assumes office. Since the Northeast Headquarters moved to Beiping on the 17th of last month, it needs to establish itself in North China. Its jurisdiction now extends south to Dezhou and east to Shuhe, including Tianjin. The Northeast Headquarters, temporarily residing in Beiping, will soon relocate for the third time, with Tianjin, Jinzhou, and Changchun being possibilities. Director Xiong stated: "It depends on the Chairman's orders." When the Chairman was in Beiping, the elders of the Northeast gathered. Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, Zhai Wenxuan, and others from Beiping once visited the Chairman and held joint discussions. Afterwards, the Chairman kept Zhang Zuoxiang for a long private conversation. Ma Zhanshan, who fought hard in Suiyuan and Baotou and achieved remarkable results, is also receiving preferential treatment from Director Xiong here. These may not be entirely unrelated to the future of the Northeast. Additionally, it should be reported that, except for the Changchun Railway, the rest of the railway transportation in the Northeast is almost completely paralyzed due to the extreme shortage of locomotives and carriages. Usually, only coal-carrying vehicles are operating along the Changchun Railway. People in areas where the railway network is dense have to rely on donkeys, horses, and carts again. In the future, to ensure smooth transportation in the Northeast, the need for locomotives and carriages will be an enormous and staggering number. Liu Guangpei, the Director of the Northeast Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, hurriedly flew to Changchun today. If he doesn't go, the clothing and other supplies allocated by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the Northeast will not be unloaded from the Chinese coast. The salaries of military officers in the Northeast have also been stipulated. It is generally said that a general's salary is 10,000 yuan in circulating currency, and Xiong Shihui is probably no exception. Recently, many personnel from the Rehe provincial government have arrived in Beiping, and Chairman Liu Duoquan is also exceptionally busy, seeming quite capable.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 25th] After our army captured Beizhen County on the 23rd, they advanced rapidly and occupied Dahushan (Tiger Mountain) Heishan at 4:00 AM on the 24th.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 25th] After completing the first phase of takeover tasks, the National Army, which entered the Northeast, began its second advance on the 23rd. Troops on all fronts advanced more than 130 li (Chinese miles) in one day and night in temperatures below minus 20 degrees Celsius. The vanguard troops crossed Goubangzi and advanced north to Beizhen County, stationed in Heizhi County and Heishan County, and recovered Dahushan. The Communist army collapsed without being attacked. Our staff is in contact with the Soviet army in the Xinmin area. Once the connection is established, our army can enter Xinmin County and await orders to enter Shenyang.

[United Press, Jinzhou, 23rd] General Du Yuming's troops have begun to clear the Communist forces and miscellaneous troops in Rehe. A portion of General Du's troops is still awaiting Soviet permission to enter Shenyang. Another strong force has begun to advance from Goubangzi towards Beizhen. It is claimed that more than 10,000 Communist troops are garrisoned there. It is estimated that General Du plans to occupy Beizhen within a few days and then advance towards Heishan. Observers point out that the National Army's occupation of these cities in the Liaoning-Rehe border area could cut off the Northeast Communist forces from their new operational base in Zhangjiakou. Control of Rehe will give the National Army access to many land routes to the Northeast.

### Residents of Beizhen Welcome the National Army Empty Streets; Experts to Fly to the Northeast This Week; Supervisory Committee of Changchun Railway Holds First Meeting

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 25th] Xinmin County is about one hundred kilometers from Shenyang. After Chief Du arrived in Goubangzi, he supervised the advance of his troops. In the villages they passed, the residents came running to welcome them. When they arrived in Beizhen County, County Chief Yu Jinfan, who had entered the city with the army last night, led 20,000 residents to welcome them outside the city. Du got out of the car to return the salute and offer his condolences. Beizhen County has a population of 70,000 and more than 400 shops. After being ravaged by the Communist army for three and a half months, almost every household is empty. According to the town mayor and the chairman of the chamber of commerce, the Communist army levied funds on a per-household basis, requiring each household to pay 5,000 yuan. Shops paid 800,000 yuan, and banks were allocated 1.8 million yuan. In addition, important materials such as coal, salt, grain, and cloth in Beizhen County were all looted. The total public and private losses in the entire county exceeded 15 million yuan.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 25th] This morning, soldiers and civilians in Jinzhou held the first National Renaissance Celebration at the sports ground. General Du Yuming presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the National Renaissance Festival. Another dispatch stated that the weather here today is extremely cold, with sleet and snow, the first rain and snow since winter. It is a good omen for a bumper harvest, and soldiers and civilians are expressing their joy.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The Supervisory Committee of the Changchun Railway held its first meeting at 11:00 AM today. The Chinese and Soviet chairmen and vice-chairmen, Levashev and Mo Dehui, and Chinese and Soviet supervisors Gao Lunjin, Qiu Weiying, Trupine, and Li Fangnuofu all attended. The meeting held a general discussion on the internal organization of the committee and its affiliated audit bureau, and it was decided to hold another meeting on the 26th.

[United Press, Beiping, 25th] The *Yi Shi Bao* here hints that the Soviet army transported away most of the vehicles before handing over Changchun to the representatives of the National Government. In a carefully worded essay, the newspaper stated that the only railway open to traffic in the Northeast is the Changchun Railway. Even on that line, all the railway equipment is old and dilapidated. The new locomotives and luxurious vehicles used by the Japanese and the Puppet Manchukuo authorities are nowhere to be seen. Prominent Chinese figures living outside the city of Changchun must travel by horse-drawn carriage.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] For fourteen years, Dong Jiu provinces have suffered under Japanese oppression. Today, they celebrate their first Christmas free from restraint. The Northeast is rich in resources, but the Japanese invasion led to World War II. It remains unclear whether it is under Soviet or Chinese administration. Changchun currently has a Chinese mayor, but his authority over the 800,000 Chinese people is still tightly controlled by the Soviet army. Without the support of the Soviet army, he cannot execute orders. However, the people of Changchun know that this is temporary and that they will see the National Army arrive within a week or two. The mayors of Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian have led their entourages by plane to the north to prepare for their inaugurations. Only Dalian has experienced complications. Soviet Commander-in-Chief Malinovsky must send a liaison unit to guide the National Army into the city. According to a newspaper report, Malinovsky said that Dalian is not under his jurisdiction, so he cannot send liaison officers to guide the Chinese army. In fact, Malinovsky is the only official of the Soviet authorities in the Nine Provinces of the East who has made diplomatic contact with the Chinese side. General Xiong Shihui announced at a meeting of directors of the Northeast Headquarters, which is temporarily located here, that all economic and technical experts should prepare to fly to the Northeast this week. The Central Bank has established a branch in Changchun, and 30 employees left for the Northeast yesterday. A second batch will leave Beiping in a day or two.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th] Dong Yanping, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Headquarters, accompanied by Li Chengyi from the Beiping Office of the Northeast Security Command, arrived in Jinzhou by plane from Beiping to convey Director Xiong's condolences to Chief Du and to discuss matters related to the takeover of the Northeast.

### Pope Appoints Chinese as Cardinal Bishop

[United Press, Rome, 23rd] Pope Pius XII announced today the list of 32 new cardinals (commonly known as red-robed archbishops), including one Chinese bishop who has also been newly appointed as a cardinal. This is the first time in the history of the Catholic Church that a Chinese person has been appointed as a cardinal. It is widely regarded as another proof of China's rising international status.

The newly appointed first Chinese cardinal is Archbishop Tian Gengxin, the Apostolic Administrator of Qingdao. Cardinal Tian was born in Yanzhou, Shandong in 1890. He was ordained as a priest in June 1918. In March 1929, he joined the Society of the Divine Word (the religious order that runs Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping). In 1934, he was promoted to Prefect Apostolic of Yanggu, Shandong. In July 1939, he was promoted to Apostolic Vicar of Yanggu, given the title of bishop, and consecrated by Pope Pius XII in Rome in October of the same year. In 1943, he was transferred to Apostolic Vicar of Qingdao. Cardinal Tian is kind and gentle. His new appointment as a cardinal not only enhances the glory of the Catholic Church in China but also brings honor to the country. All parties express their congratulations.

### American Newspapers Discuss American-Soviet Relations in the Far East; Marshall Holds Frequent Social Gatherings; Met Soviet Ambassador at Randall's Banquet

[United Press, New York, 24th] Howard newspaper's former correspondent in China, Lamo, stated: Marshall's appointment as special envoy to China will be a turning point in the situation in China, and the dawn of peace is breaking. The special correspondent first stated: "During the war, the Communists referred to Chairman Chiang as a fascist because the newspapers published by the Communists in Chongqing were subject to censorship. However, in reality, the Communists' activities were not significantly interfered with, while the National Government's request to publish newspapers in the Communist areas was rejected by the Communists. The Communists exaggerate their fighting power all day long. This propaganda is aimed at the United States, and its purpose is to induce us to abandon our financial and spiritual assistance to the National Government. Lamo also said: If the United States has abandoned its attention to China, the Soviet Union will take the opportunity to enter. The current disputes in the Northeast are a test of the United States, but Marshall's new appointment has changed the situation overnight, because Marshall's appointment has shown that the United States attaches importance to the situation in China.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 25th] Brigadier General Randall, the US military commander, hosted a reception last night for Special Envoy Marshall and the diplomatic corps stationed in Chongqing. Special Envoy Marshall met with Soviet Ambassador Petrov at the reception.

### Provisional Meeting of the Standing Committee of the People's Political Council; Reviewing the Draft General Budget; Finance Minister Yu Personally Explains the Compilation Situation; Guiding Principle Is to Stabilize People's Livelihoods and Gradually Begin Construction

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 25th] After the National Political Council obtained the power to review the government budget, it exercised its authority for the first time today. The standing committee of the council held a provisional meeting at 3:00 PM on the 25th to review the draft national revenue and expenditure budget for the 35th year of the Republic submitted by the government. Present were Chairman Zhang Boling, Wang Yunwu, Jiang Yong, Councilors Wu Zhaoxu, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Shaoxian, Qian Gonglai, Chu Fucheng, Xu Deheng, He Baoren, Chen Bosheng, Hu Jianzhong, Hu Lin, Huang Yanpei, Yin Shuxian, Yu Jitang, Kong Geng, Fan Yushui, Chuan Sinian, Li Zhongxiang, Secretary-General Shao Lizi, and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen. At today's first review meeting, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin of the Executive Yuan and Finance Minister Yu Hongjun were invited to attend and explain. Chairman Zhang Boling presided over the meeting. After a report from the Secretariat, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun explained the compilation of the national general budget for the 35th year of the Republic, giving a concise explanation of the process, guiding principles, and overall situation of revenue and expenditure. He stated that the guiding principle of the national general budget for the coming year is to stabilize people's livelihoods and gradually begin construction work. Wartime budgets required coordination with military affairs, resulting in huge military expenditures. In the draft budget for the coming year, military expenditures have been greatly reduced. In terms of general administrative expenses, the focus for the coming year will be on post-war rehabilitation, with particular emphasis on restoring transportation, managing water conservancy, and protecting agriculture and forestry. All new emerging industries must be coordinated with this guiding principle. In short, after the war, people's livelihoods are in a state of decline. Stabilizing people's livelihoods in the future will depend on price adjustments and financial stability, so that international trade and the domestic economy can be gradually promoted, and efforts will be made to balance revenue and expenditure in the financial sphere. After Yu's report, Jiang Menglin gave a supplementary explanation on the relationship between the budget and prices and the issue of rehabilitation, stating that stabilizing prices depends on adapting the supply and demand of materials. Rapid restoration of transportation will facilitate the flow of goods. At the same time, the materials supplied by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will gradually lower prices, so that the national finances will gradually stabilize, and the government's revenue and expenditure can be expected to be implemented according to the budget. After the speeches, Councilors Huang Yanpei, Zuo Shunsheng, Xu Deheng, Chen Shaoxian, Yin Shuxian, Li Zhongxiang, and Chu Fucheng raised many questions regarding taxation, agriculture and forestry, military expenditure, and other issues, which Minister Yu answered one by one. Finally, it was decided to continue the meeting at 3:00 PM on the 27th and to invite the ministers of military affairs, transportation, and economic affairs to attend and report.

Conference Approaching Completion; Good Results Expected

[Our Newspaper Report] According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 25th, Marshal Stalin has expressed his willingness to strengthen cooperation with various countries, and it is expected that an agreement can be reached on the atomic bomb issue. Furthermore, discussions on the issue of Allied administration of Japan also appear to be proceeding smoothly.

[Reuters Moscow Dispatch, 25th] Diplomatic circles here expect good news after Christmas. U.S. officials said yesterday that the Three Powers Conference is nearing completion and good results are expected. Some progress has been made on several issues discussed at the conference. When the three foreign ministers attended a play at the Bolshoi Theatre on Sunday night, Molotov held Bevin and Byrnes by the arms and gestured to the audience, who cheered enthusiastically. Such scenes are rare in Moscow. After the play, Bevin attended the French Embassy's Christmas reception and led diplomats in singing the hymn "We Are United," showing unusual delight. Byrnes, suffering from a slight cold, did not attend. Based on these various phenomena, diplomatic circles in Moscow are very optimistic about this Three Powers Conference. The conference is progressing rapidly, but the general public is still keen to keep a close watch, seeking a "panacea" for all post-war issues. Responsible parties have said that even if the Three Powers Conference does not have concrete solutions, at least a mechanism for cooperation has already begun to work.

### Kremlin Banquet for Guests

Stalin Also Talks at Length with Bevin

[Reuters London Dispatch, 25th] Moscow Radio reported that Marshal Stalin hosted a banquet last night for Bevin and Byrnes. Other guests included Molotov, the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union, several Red Army generals, and Sir Jebb, the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Moscow Radio also announced that Stalin received Bevin at the Kremlin, along with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Under-Secretary of State Jebb, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Gusev, and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr. According to a dispatch from Moscow, a British spokesman said that Stalin's conversation with Bevin was "friendly and helpful."

[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 25th] Foreign affairs officials here stated yesterday that, according to recent reports from Moscow, mutual compromise at the Foreign Ministers' Conference has been painstakingly achieved. Diplomatic circles also said that the foreign ministers discussed a wide range of issues in detail in an attempt to issue a statement to the world, opening the curtain for the United Nations General Assembly next month.

### McNutt Reaffirms U.S. Policy Toward the Philippines

[United Press Manila Dispatch, 25th] McNutt, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines who recently visited China, declared: "The rumor that I said Filipinos do not want independence is inaccurate. This statement is merely a report and not official. The United States' policy toward the Philippines is extremely clear. We have promised to grant the Filipinos independence on July 4, 1946. If the Filipinos do not want to obtain this status, the initiative should belong to the Filipinos. The United States will never take the initiative. The independence of the Philippines is no longer a question. Our work is how to prepare the Filipinos for independence. We cannot deviate from this goal and work."

### U.S. Expresses Dissatisfaction with Incomplete Prosecution of Philippine Traitors

[Our Newspaper Report] According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 25th, the Philippines is not thoroughly prosecuting Philippine traitors. Senate President and presidential candidate Roxas is "the mastermind behind the purchase of military rice for the Japanese for a time." During the Japanese occupation, Roxas was the chairman of the Philippine Economic Committee. Most of the senators also cooperated with the Japanese. Local evening newspapers claim that the U.S. is extremely angry that the Philippine authorities have been slow to prosecute Philippine traitors. If the current Philippine government and the Philippine people do not immediately purge the "collaborators," the officials of the Laurel puppet government who previously worked for the Japanese will all regain their power. Philippine Liberal Party members point out that unless the U.S. participates in the prosecution of Philippine traitors, the Philippine traitors will be able to escape justice, because the current ruling party members are all friends of the Philippine traitors.

### Austrian Prime Minister Delivers Policy Outline

[Reuters London Dispatch, 25th] Austrian Prime Minister Figl delivered a policy outline in parliament, forcefully arguing for the determination and methods of cooperation between the Catholic People's Party and the Socialist Party. Figl believes that the failure of the First Austrian Republic was due to the two parties' inability to compromise. Austrian President Renner and Vice-Chancellor Schaerf also share the same view. Figl said that although voters want free enterprise, state control of enterprises is currently necessary, and special enterprises should even be state-owned. This is because Austria's important industries were mostly stolen by the Nazis, so they cannot be quickly restored without state control. In terms of education, emphasis should be placed on training young people in democratic thinking.

### Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshida Deploys Tactics; Conspires to Alienate Allied Nations; Invites British Journalist to Lunch, Attacking U.S. Policies in Japan

[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch, 25th] Japanese Foreign Minister Shigeru Yoshida's new diplomatic policy for occupied Japan is to alienate the Allied nations and make them enemies of each other. This old diplomat, devoid of diplomatic skill, has launched the first step of this conspiracy, attempting to use Britain to control the United States in order to "soften" the Allied nations' policy towards Japan. Yoshida first had an official from the Information Bureau invite two Irish journalists among the Allied journalists to lunch. His daughter then sent formal invitations to these two, namely Smith, the Reuters correspondent in Tokyo, and Deane, the London News Chronicle reporter, inviting them to lunch and adding a note that "her father will also be present at that time." When Smith and Deane arrived, they were first greeted by Yoshida's "private secretary," Shirase, who was closely related to the late Fumimaro Konoe. Shirase said, "If your American colleagues ask later why you had lunch with Foreign Minister Yoshida, please answer that it was invited by Yoshida's daughter, and Foreign Minister Yoshida was also present." During lunch, Yoshida, who is known for his inherent hatred of journalists, was unusually talkative. He said that the Emperor was very worried that MacArthur's orders were becoming increasingly strict and that an incident would definitely erupt in the future, and that the lack of rice could lead to upheaval. While Yoshida made this warning, the meal included egg noodles, fried lobster, roast beef, and butter, which had not been seen in Tokyo for two years, as well as fresh vegetables and tangerines for dessert. Yoshida then suddenly said in his unique and candid tone, "These orders are all from the hands of those who do not understand the situation in Japan at all. The American experts are like carps crossing the river." Yoshida then asked if there was anti-American sentiment in Britain, France, and other parts of Europe. He implied that if there were British people in Japan, everything would be very different, because they understood the situation in the Far East. Yoshida then excused himself to attend an important meeting. His secretary said at the end of the meal, "You are both Irish, and you should know the emotions of the people in occupied countries." Who knew that the angry guests invited by Yoshida's daughter had reported the above to MacArthur's headquarters. A senior official at headquarters commented, "This fact coincides with the current concepts of the Japanese cabinet." An editorial in the Japanese Sangyo Keizai Shimbun this morning stated that Japanese officials are exaggerating the various difficulties in Japan, as well as the various difficulties faced by Japanese residents in northern Korea and the Northeast, in an attempt to cover up their own mistakes and incompetence. The newspaper also accused officials who previously worked in the now-dissolved Greater East Asia Ministry of neglecting their duties during the difficult and urgent times after the surrender, leaving the Japanese people at a loss. They are now trying to distort the facts to cover up their dereliction of duty and blame the difficulties of Japanese residents in Korea and the Northeast on the Soviet army.

Japanese Small Parties Seek Unity

[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch, 25th] The Japanese newspaper Nikkan today reported that minority political groups will confront major parties in the upcoming elections.

### Soviet Union Attaches Importance to Trusteeship System Issue; United Nations General Assembly to Open on January 10

[Reuters London Dispatch, 25th] Leming, a political commentator for Moscow Radio, broadcast that the work of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations is an important page in the history of good countries. The most important item on the Preparatory Committee's agenda is the issue of trusteeship, which is the most important issue after the war. The colonial system is the cause of international disputes and will inevitably hinder the work of the United Nations. At present, the national consciousness of the people in the colonies has gradually grown. The people of India, Java, Vietnam, and the Middle East are fighting for freedom.

[United Press London Dispatch, 24th] The first plenary session of the United Nations will officially open in London on January 10 next year. The General Assembly will elect a Secretary-General, as well as temporary members of the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council, so that the United Nations can actively proceed. Thorny political issues at the first meeting will include the atomic bomb, and several small countries have notified that they will continue to resist the superior position occupied by the five powers in the United Nations.

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 25th] Iranian Ambassador to the United States Hossein said today that when the United Nations General Assembly meets in London on January 10 next year, the Iranian government will submit the Azerbajiani provincial riots to the conference. Iran has high expectations for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### Papal Christmas Message: Three Basic Conditions for Establishing Lasting Peace

[United Press Vatican City, 25th] On Christmas Eve, the Pope broadcast to the world, stating that the world is not at peace, but merely in a "post-war" state. Regarding true and lasting peace, the Pope put forward the following three points: (1) Cooperation, goodwill, and mutual trust between nations are currently needed. (2) All systems of checking public opinion that guide the will and thought of the elected must be condemned. (3) All sectors of the world must urge totalitarian countries to immediately cease their hegemonic behavior.

International Need for Goodwill and Mutual Trust, Totalitarianism and Democracy Incompatible

[Reuters] The full text of the Pope's broadcast is as follows: "Totalitarianism and true and sound democratic systems cannot coexist. Totalitarian regimes have stained the earth red with blood, destroying the existence of nations, and the world can never escape the threat of war. The purpose of future peace institutions should be to eliminate the will to aggression and eradicate aggressive forces. Dictatorial actions, whether internal or external, should be stopped uniformly. In this chaotic world, there is only one solution: to return to the embrace of God and obey God's will. Although the war is over, the world has not entered true peace; peace is only in the preparatory stage. Never before have those responsible for restoring peace borne such a heavy responsibility. Humanity has now awakened to the importance of wisdom, patience, and goodwill for world peace and order." The Pope continued, "The supernatural and indivisible nature of the Church is like that of Jesus Christ himself. The wholeness of Christ means that the head and the body must be inseparable; this is the wholeness of life, applicable to all mankind at any time and in any place. Therefore, anyone who makes the Church a captive of any nation insults all of humanity. The current situation requires close cooperation of all kinds and reduction of political competition. To preserve future freedom, the inner strength of individuals must be enhanced. Full cooperation is necessary between people and between nations. So-called public opinion must not be manipulated by money; the true and free will of the majority must be respected, and the existence of dictatorship and arbitrary regimes must never be tolerated. This year, as we celebrate Christmas, we can be free from fear of threats on land, sea, and air. This is the first truly joyful Christmas in six years, and we should thank God."

US President Issues General Amnesty, Four Thousand Prisoners Released

### Japanese Assets in Korea All Taken Over by US Military

The assets taken over include all property, whether private or state-owned. The US military will hand over the property immediately after the Korean government finds suitable personnel to take it over.

### Communist Party Gathering in Italy Attacked with Poison Gas Bomb

[Reuters, London, 25th] A communiqué from the Italian authorities broadcast by Rome Radio stated that at 5:00 PM yesterday, when Communist leaders were gathering in a large venue in Rome, someone threw a poison gas bomb, which exploded on the spot, shattering glass windows.

### East Indian Independence Leader Returns to Batavia After Tour; Heavy Fighting Continues in Bandung Area

[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] Indonesian President Sukarno, after touring central and eastern Java with Prime Minister Sjahrir and others, stated that the local security forces have agreed to assist in transporting Allied expatriates and Japanese troops to the Allied authorities. The result of his trip has further convinced him that the people have firm support for his government. He also met with many local leaders, some of whom he had never met before. The lack of cooperation in the past was part of the reason for some unfortunate events.

[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] According to the Dutch news agency, the extremist leader Hartje in the Bandung area has been killed in battle. Hartje often sold amulets to Indonesians, claiming that having these amulets would protect them from all harm. After Hartje's death, Indonesians began to believe that amulets were just that.

[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] Yesterday, British airborne troops were attacked by Indonesian extremists while searching the Kramat area outside the city, injuring ten people. The British troops captured 25 people and seized some weapons and ammunition. However, the Indonesian people no longer seem to fear the extremists. In the Bandung area, Indian troops are clearing the southeastern area of the city. On Sunday, they captured 70 people, including several members of the "Black Buffalo" association. The Allied headquarters in the Buitenzorg refugee area between Bandung and Batavia was attacked with hand grenades. As of Friday, the Allies had suffered 16 deaths, 795 injuries, and 163 missing.

### National Revelry in the United States; Anxious Mood Difficult to Conceal Amidst Superficial Joy

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] For the first time in five years, Americans are holding peacetime Christmas celebrations. It is said that they are preparing to make this Christmas the happiest since the Pearl Harbor incident. The busy sales of Christmas gifts in department stores have broken records, and the number of Christmas cards and packages sent by the post office is also the largest. The congestion of holiday travel is also unprecedented in the United States. Americans can enjoy five pounds of meat for Christmas dinner; only the most fortunate of the countries participating in the war, the United States, where the impact of the war has been minimal, has this possibility. However, amidst the superficial joy, there is still an anxious mood. Today's Christmas messages in various newspapers all remind Americans that most of the world is filled with misery and misfortune. While the United States can enjoy the blessings of prosperity, it is by no means without difficulties in domestic and foreign affairs. For example, labor strikes are still ongoing, industrial recovery is particularly slow, and consumer goods are still lacking, especially clothing. Chronic inflation continues, and the shortage of housing is becoming more serious. Therefore, while Americans celebrate this first peacetime Christmas since 1941, although conditions are superior to those of other countries in the world, they, like other countries, cannot but produce fear and hope.

### Patton Buried Deep Underground; His Military Achievements Will Endure Forever

[Reuters, Lintfort, 25th] General Patton's remains were buried yesterday in a solemn ceremony at the Hamm American Military Cemetery near Luxembourg. Thousands of American military personnel attended the funeral, and many residents lined the streets to watch.

[United Press Special Feature] General Patton was injured in a jeep accident and died of his injuries last week. General Patton was a veteran of over thirty years, known for his strict discipline in commanding troops. The general was a brilliant genius among professional soldiers, often surprising his peers, and single-handedly brought tank warfare to perfection. However, when it came to diplomatic matters, he was unable to cope and was often in an awkward situation. During World War II, the general fought his way from Africa through France, Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, winning every battle and conquering every city. During the African campaign, the general was already widely praised. It is said that when conquering Tunisia, he wore two pearl-handled pistols on his waist, roared like a tiger, and took the lead in charging with tanks. The general was always in danger, always on the front line, believing that this was the privilege of officers. His operational secrets included the following maxim: "We must constantly attack the enemy until we are exhausted, and then attack again." The Third Army, which was established after the invasion of France, achieved brilliant results, which was the result of applying the above maxim.

### Defenders of Mahabad in Northwestern Iran Continue to Resist

[Reuters, Tehran, 25th] The Iranian Army General Headquarters received a telegram stating that the government defense forces in Mahabad in northwestern Iran have not yet surrendered to the communist forces and are continuing to resist.

### Former Spanish Republican Prime Minister Arrives in London

[Central News Agency, London, 24th, Reuters] Former Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín arrived in London on the Queen Mary.

### Christmas in Berlin: Using Cleavers to Chop Branches for Firewood and Filling Up on Greased Black Bread

[United Press, Berlin, 24th] In front of a public building in Berlin, there is a notice that reads, "Only those who die from infectious diseases can get a coffin." Next to it is an ambassador made of cardboard, saying, "Merry Christmas, may there be peace on earth and goodwill to all men." This is the scene of Christmas in Berlin this year. In the past, this German capital also indulged in wild revelry, with Nazi soldiers goose-stepping and marching, invincible, but now it is a bleak sight. All that can be seen are broken tiles, dilapidated walls, and people with sunken eyes. Although they are grateful for the arrival of peace, they look forward to a dim future and are also at a loss. The zoo used to be a famous park in the city center. Elderly men and women with tired steps are pulling several carts, which are full of branches. When they take a short rest on the side of the road, they take out black bread smeared with lard to eat. This is their Christmas feast. In the once magnificent garden, women in expensive fur coats are seen chopping the remaining tree trunks with cleavers, picking up small pieces of wood to keep warm. This scene is not harmonious. At the same time, in the city hall, thin, pale-faced children are waiting for the Santa Claus rally. Many of them were disabled by bombing during the war. Each person can get a toy, some warm clothes, and a piece of food with a little sugar. The "Save the Children" campaign in the city has at least achieved some success. On the street, an old man is seen sticking strips of cloth on the shutters and muttering to himself, saying that the cardboard on the window fell off last night. His wife is lying in bed, gasping for breath. Most poor families have no Christmas tree this year. Although there are thousands of trees brought to the market for sale, priced at one to eight marks, most are bought by those willing to pay twenty times this price.

### Beiping and Tianjin Enthusiastically Comfort Allied Troops; Wang Shuming Represents Chairman Chiang to Present Gifts; Capital Holds First Post-War Christmas Celebration Service

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 25th] When Chairman Chiang left Beiping, he personally instructed Wang Shuming, Deputy Director of the Aviation Committee, to convey to the military and political leaders of Beiping and Tianjin that he would represent Chairman Chiang in comforting the Allied troops on Christmas Day. Representatives from the General Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, the Municipal Government, the Air Force Headquarters, the Battlefield Service Corps, and other agencies discussed and determined the method of consolation. On the 25th, 7,000 kilograms of wine and 7,000 kilograms of beef were prepared and distributed to American soldiers in Beiping. In addition, Deputy Director Wang, on behalf of the Chairman, presented precious items such as ancient bottles and paintings to senior American generals, and also distributed enamel toys and more than 500 beautiful silk scarves printed with the characters "Chiang" and "V" and the Allied victory to officers at all levels. A cocktail party was held at the Beijing Hotel on the evening of the 26th to entertain guests. Deputy Director Wang, on the 23rd, returned to Beiping from Chairman Chiang by special plane and immediately contacted Mayor Zhang and Deputy Mayor Du of Tianjin to discuss consolation matters. It is reported that Tianjin's preparations are more enthusiastic and grand than Beiping's. From Christmas Day to the 5th of next year, there will be consolation programs every day.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Today is the first Christmas after World War II. Churches in Nanjing held a music celebration service at Hanzhong Church on Mochou Road at 2:00 PM. Hang Liwu was invited to give a Christmas speech. In the evening, the Battlefield Service Corps of the Military Affairs Commission and the Allied forces in Nanjing held a grand party at the International Friendship Society, and the Catholic Church also held a Christmas Mass.

### Christmas in the Old Capital: First Time in Eight Years Without Threats and Humiliation

[This newspaper, Beiping, 24th] This is the first time in eight years that the citizens of Beiping have been able to welcome Christmas without threats and humiliation, but Christmas here is not all happy. To borrow someone else's phrase, Beiping is still a Dragon City. Although this refugee population is expanding day by day, hundreds of thousands of out-of-town residents are still trapped in Beiping after the victory and cannot return to their villages. How many people have waited for eight years, looking to the door every day, and still not seeing the return of their exiled children. After the factories were taken over, most of them stopped operating, and unemployed workers were struggling in the cold, let alone starvation. Even the staff retained by various agencies are worried about their insufficient salaries after the probation period is over. Although American children embrace Beiping ladies and enjoy American meat hotpots while remembering their wives across the ocean, they will also feel sad. But the most unhappy people are Wang Yintai, Wang Kemin, and others in prison. Are they thinking about this night last year, when they were gambling all night or playing with women?

The Chairman came a little early, otherwise he would have been Santa Claus for Beiping. He brought justice and warmth to the people of the old capital, and especially allocated food and coal for the winter to hard-working students. He sowed the seeds of permanent remembrance in the hearts of the people of Beiping. Zhang Puquan and Lu Ruibo, two elders who happened to be there, acted as Santa Claus for the old capital in 1945. The large bags they carried were full of soap, washing away the dirt that should not have been on the faces of the people in the occupied areas. Lu comforted the compatriots in North China, saying that except for a few traitors, everyone, whether in the rear or in the occupied areas, has made a considerable contribution to the victory. Zhang said something even more popular: the so-called "pseudo" character, I believe, should be abolished from today. We only ask whether someone is a traitor or not, and there is no question of whether something is "pseudo" or not. This soap is the most precious gift for the people in the occupied areas. The indiscriminate use of the "pseudo" character for the past three months has been too heartbreaking. On Christmas Eve, apart from the all-night dance parties of American soldiers and a few people, music was constantly heard from high-rise buildings, but the general public had already fallen asleep. Perhaps they were dreaming that the flour and cloth from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, free of tax, had already been delivered to their doorsteps.

### Local Correspondences

Songjiang

Temporary Issuance of Substitute Coupons for Purchasing Military Grain

This county has repeatedly received orders from the province to purchase 50,000 shi of military grain, priced at 5,000 yuan per shi, with half to be delivered by the 20th of this month and the remainder to be delivered by February 15th of next year. Because the allocated funds are only 35 million yuan, it is difficult to comply with the order to purchase all the grain. In addition, the county treasury is in deficit, and there is no way to raise funds. After discussions among various agencies, legal entities, and gentry, it was decided to temporarily issue military grain substitute coupons as proof of grain purchase, which will not circulate in the market. It is rumored that a public announcement will be made for allocation and payment as soon as the province's funds arrive.

As for the repair of highways, the Wartime Transportation Administration is actively rushing to repair them. It is reported that the Jingwu section of the Jinggan National Highway is under construction, so that it can run directly from Nanjing to Chongqing, which is expected to be completed within a month.

### Tianjin After Liberation: Heading Towards Revival and Prosperity, Translated by Our Editorial Office from the December 24th *Ta Mei Wan Bao* (North China American Daily)

Post-liberation Tianjin has seen few changes in its appearance, fundamentally remaining much like it was before the war. American Marine Corps vehicles speed along the streets of Tianjin, each jeep adorned with a uniquely conceived name.

The headquarters of the Third Amphibious Corps is located in the former French Concession's grandiose *gong bu* (municipal council) building. Various regimental headquarters and military offices are scattered throughout the city. American soldiers in leather-collared winter uniforms and short leather jackets are unusually active everywhere. All of Tianjin's English street signs were removed by the Japanese and replaced with wooden boards.

Low Prices, Still Priced in Counterfeit Currency

Prices in Tianjin are much cheaper than in Shanghai, but Tianjin residents still find them very expensive. For example, pork sells for 220 National Currency (Guo Bi) per pound. Wheat flour, the staple food of the North, is slightly more expensive than in Shanghai, costing about 140 National Currency per pound. Bread costs around 116 National Currency per pound. Chunk coal costs about 8,000 to 9,000 National Currency per ton. The Kailan Mining Administration no longer sells coal to private individuals as it once did. Tianjin "locals" still price goods using counterfeit Federal Reserve Bank of China notes. If they are priced in National Currency, they will immediately discount it to one-fifth of its value. For some reason, currency exchange dealers on the streets are not very welcoming of Customs Gold Units.

Telegraph Communications Awaiting Active Adjustment

Transportation in North China remains obstructed. There is still no officially fixed transportation method between Tianjin and Shanghai. Any ships that do set sail are managed by the Military Affairs Commission. A few small ships of about 300 tons travel between Tianjin and Qingdao, but the safety of these ships cannot be absolutely guaranteed at present.

China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) is not yet selling tickets to ordinary passengers. Only military and government personnel are allowed to board CNAC planes. Telegraph communications are also not very reliable; sending a telegram from Tianjin to Shanghai often takes one and a half to two days.

American Banks Permitted to Open Current Accounts

On December 20th, the Tianjin branches of two American banks, Chase Bank and National City Bank of New York, reopened. Chase Bank Manager Mr. Felt and Chief Accountant Mr. Schmidt, and National City Bank of New York Manager Mr. Towle and Chief Accountant Mr. Henry, all received many flower baskets and gifts from friends and old customers, and many people came to offer their congratulations. Neither bank has opened savings accounts yet, only current accounts in National Currency or US dollars. Old accounts from before require special permission to be unfrozen. The remittance of National Currency between Tianjin and Shanghai has not yet begun. According to Mr. Towle, "I am very optimistic about the future."

Swords Selling Well, General Market Conditions Ordinary

Many of the old companies in Tianjin that have resumed operations are open in name only; there is simply no business to be done. The North China interior is completely isolated from Tianjin and Peiping (Beijing), so it seems that import and export trade cannot be restored for the time being. Most Tianjin residents place great hope in Special Envoy Marshall's visit to China. However, a small number of people feel very pessimistic about the future.

Today, Tianjin seems like a city of bars and antique shops. Their trade targets are the American soldiers. The business of exchanging foreign currency is thriving, especially around the Victoria Cafe in the former British Concession. Recently, due to the severe weather, the volume of transactions has inevitably been affected. Among the items sold by street vendors, Japanese military swords sell the best, because American soldiers are most fond of hunting for souvenirs. It is doubtful whether these Japanese military swords are genuine "war trophies." Even Japanese sword experts would probably not be able to tell the difference. It is estimated that American soldiers have spent about seven million US dollars in North China so far, with particularly large sums spent in Tianjin, Peiping, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao.

The Tianjin Municipal Government recently issued a notice prohibiting men and women from sharing rickshaws, which is quite a disappointment for the soldiers. If the soldiers in Shanghai hear about this news, they will surely have special feelings and hope that Shanghai does not follow suit.

Gold and US Dollars: Market Prices Lower Than in Shanghai

Banks in Tianjin, both Chinese and foreign, do not handle remittances between Tianjin, Shanghai, and other cities in Central China, because of the difficulty of transferring funds and transportation difficulties. The market price of gold and US dollars in Tianjin tends to be lower than in Shanghai, so it is likely that many people are engaging in arbitrage to adjust their positions. US dollar bills in Tianjin are currently around 980 National Currency, but the degree of fluctuation is more severe than in the Shanghai market.

### The Elevator Stops Halfway, Hair is Half-Permed, Light is Half-Shining: France Overcomes Difficulties This Winter, Translated from *Newsweek* President Carroll's Original Article

The recent political unrest in France, which began after the vote of confidence in the government, has come to an end. The parliament will spend seven months studying the constitution. During this period, there is nothing to be done in politics, so the French government has begun to calm down and consider how to get through the winter. President de Gaulle arrives at the office very early and leaves very late every day. The only visible change is that he has taken off his military uniform and put on civilian clothes. The most serious difficulties faced by de Gaulle and the French people this winter will be coal shortages and electricity conservation.

A Lump of Coal Equals a Golden Ingot

Two charcoal trucks collided on the road, and several bags of coal fell from the trucks to the roadside. A little child cried out frantically: "Mom, Mom, there's coal here!" In an instant, a large crowd gathered. Many people grabbed handfuls of coal and ran away, jumping and skipping. A dignified old man picked up a piece of coal, praised it with a reminiscent look, as if it were a beautiful shell or a golden ingot.

No French person does not pay attention to coal. The headlines in the newspapers are all about coal. A female soldier in the British army discovered that her maid was stealing coal. She smuggled coal out of the coal bin in her handbag, piece by piece, until she had stolen almost half a ton. Currently, black market coal prices are between 180 and 240 US dollars, and it is still not easy to buy.

No Answer at the Door, Pick Up a Pebble and Hit the Window

Because of the coal shortage, electricity must be conserved. To conserve electricity, the power is cut off several times a day, for one hour each time. The elevator stops halfway, cutting off the electricity and suspending passengers halfway up or down for as long as an hour. In the barber shop, the perm is only half-done when the electricity goes out, and the curling iron pulls the customer's hair straight and tight, making it impossible to move. Telephones are even busier, because for a very long time each day, there is no dial tone, the doorbell does not ring, and people knocking on the door have to pick up a pebble and hit the window. The French have to remember every day when there is electricity and when there is no electricity, and they must be careful everywhere and pay attention at all times. Therefore, half of their time and energy is wasted on this. In peacetime, when there is a prolonged drought, affecting hydropower generation, insufficient electricity can be compensated for with coal. Since France was liberated, the French coal industry has immediately worked valiantly to restore domestic coal mines and resume operations in the Saar coal mines. Of course, mechanical failures, miners' lack of food and clothing, and a shortage of pit props are major obstacles. However, coal production is constantly increasing, and now it is able to produce 147,000 tons of coal per day, that is, 53.635 million tons of coal per year, which is more than 6 million tons more than normal production.

Emergency Measures: Shops Strictly Prohibited from Using Electric Lights

However, in peacetime, France needs to import 20 million tons of coal every year, but now it cannot import that much to make up for the amount it lacks. For example, the amount imported from the United States in September was 406,700 tons, but in October, due to the US miners' strike, it dropped to 380,200 tons. What is worse is that France cannot obtain the expected amount of coal from the Ruhr area. It was expected to obtain 313,000 tons in November, but as of November 16, only 8,700 tons had been received.

In such an embarrassing situation, the Paris municipal authorities had to take new emergency electricity-saving measures. All non-essential factories are only allowed to operate three days a week. Families and offices are absolutely prohibited from using any electricity except for two hours at noon. Shop windows are prohibited from using electric lights. All shops, except for food stores and pharmacies, must close at 5 or 6 o'clock in the afternoon. Subways also enter the depot one hour earlier. Writing this, the translator has a few words to add here:

The current situation in Paris reminds us of Shanghai before the victory. At that time, Shanghai was also implementing emergency electricity-saving measures. Most factories had to close due to power outages, or they tried to install charcoal engines as a substitute. At the same time, the Japanese military factories were operating day and night. Under air raid precautions, the streets were dark. Families and hotels used old-fashioned soybean oil lamps and candles to replace electric lights. The worst were those who lived in high-rise buildings, because elevators stopped working, and they had to run up and down the stairs, panting for breath.

Now, the light has come, and thanks to the efforts of the government and the assistance of the American army, the difficulties here have finally been resolved to a considerable extent. When we see the situation in Paris today, how can we not be happy for ourselves and express our heartfelt sympathy to the unfortunate citizens of Paris?

### Northeast Statistics

Northeast steel production is two million tons per year. These steel mills are quite small by American standards, but very large by Far Eastern standards. They can be expanded to assist in the industrialization of Asia.

Chemical industry production includes industrial alcohol, chemical fertilizers, cement industry raw materials, etc. These factories have abundant raw materials and can also be expanded.

Lumber mills produce large quantities of lumber because the Northeast has an inexhaustible supply of wood, which is sufficient for China to rebuild houses, factories, railways, and other necessities for modernization.

Mines produce large quantities of coal, copper, lead, zinc, and a considerable amount of gold.

Machine factories can manufacture locomotives, railcars, assemble automobiles, and manufacture gasoline engines and other machinery.

Gasoline plants refine gasoline and fuel oil for industrial use from shale.

Other factories are also complete and usable, capable of producing a large number of different goods, ranging from simple agricultural implements and synthetic rubber tires to paper, plastics, vegetable oil, and paint.

Therefore, China has now received this large inheritance. Although it has 450 million people, who are generally impoverished, with the industry and natural resources of the Northeast, it can form a single, large industrial country. However, China has very little experience in operating large enterprises, and how it will utilize them remains to be seen. (US Information Service)

### The Recent Eloquent Discourses of Three Diplomatic Giants

Byrnes is the United States Secretary of State, a confidant of the late President Roosevelt. He accompanied the President to the Crimea Conference. On April 2, 1945, he resigned from the position of Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion, intending to retire to his hometown. However, ten days later, President Roosevelt died, and he flew back to Washington to assist President Truman. On July 2, 1945, he was appointed Secretary of State. This October, he participated in the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London. Recently, he has had important discussions on the issue of international cooperation:

Byrnes

The World Should be the Home of All Nations

"We now live in a world where, in this atomic age, regional isolationism is even more dangerous than national isolationism.

If our world is divided into spheres of influence and privileged areas, then the kind of cooperation necessary for peace is unthinkable.

The Moscow Declaration of 1943 is important because it pointed this out. This joint declaration made by the world's largest and strongest nations promised the mutual cooperation needed to win victory and maintain peace. It is truly a milestone in our efforts to establish a national society and abandon the untrustworthy international relations system based on spheres of influence.

After the Moscow Four-Power Declaration, there followed the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, the Yalta Conference, the Crimea Conference, the San Francisco Conference, and the Potsdam Conference. The United Nations organization and the London Foreign Ministers' Conference were also established in the spirit of the Moscow Declaration.

In my recent report on the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, I solemnly pointed out that international cooperation requires intelligent compromise. This principle does not require us or any other country to ignore its special relationship with its neighbors, but it does require that all good neighborly relations be coordinated with an organized system of global international relations.

The world system we are striving to build must adhere to the principle of equal national sovereignty.

This principle does not mean that all countries are equal in strength and power, because their inequality is like the strength and power of individuals. But it does mean that the independence and sovereignty of large and small countries should be equally respected. Nations, like individuals, should be equal before the law. This principle is the cornerstone of our Pan-American system and should also be the cornerstone of the United Nations.

If we are to achieve lasting peace, it is necessary to adopt the above-mentioned principles for the establishment of peace. Because lasting peace is indivisible. It is not only a matter of concern to a few great powers or a few large groups, but a matter of concern to the people of the whole country.

The United States believes in this, and therefore believes that all countries, large and small, that bear the responsibility of combat must participate in the work of building peace.

Over the past centuries, some strong nations have divided the world for various reasons. But they have all failed, and their failures have left a bloody trail in history. Now that all the countries of the world have become neighbors, it will be even more difficult to succeed in dividing them.

Today, the world must choose. The world should be the home of all nations, not the world of one nation."

Bevin's Policies

Bevin has broad knowledge and great ambitions. He has more boldness than Eden. Bevin's diplomatic experience is very different from Eden's, and even if diplomacy is handled entirely by the foreign minister, his policies will not be the same as Eden's.

He is Not Like the Thorough Eden

Bevin will absolutely not be like the thorough Eden. I believe he may achieve great success, not only because today's foreign policy is largely decided jointly by the cabinet. Bevin is a man with a strong democratic consciousness, sufficient experience, and great boldness—he may ignore all outdated foreign policies and the foreign policy passed by the Labour Party Congress last December and go his own way. When reviewing the Labour Party's attitude towards major foreign policy issues, we should not ignore the most important fact that Bevin's personal views have a great influence on it.

For example, the Potsdam Declaration on the future of Germany should be viewed together with Bevin's usual views. We may wish to look at Bevin's speech at the banquet for representatives of workers from various countries at the World Federation of Trade Unions this spring, the Labour Party's Blackpool Congress, and his foreign policy speech in Parliament. He explained that the German people should recognize their responsibilities and do their utmost to compensate for the losses of European countries. He also explained that it is unusual to plunge Germany into large-scale unemployment and an economic mess in which people struggle on the starvation line. Undoubtedly, he did explain that Germany should restore democracy and the freedom to organize trade unions. His words were not a smokescreen to mislead people, and he did not support those reactionary elements who tried to maintain the old social order.

The key to Bevin's diplomatic speech lies in its emotional richness in international relations. Bevin looks at international relations from the perspective of workers and ordinary people without homes or jobs, not from the perspective of power politics and abstract emotions.

What Bevin said at Blackpool was the most meaningful. He said: "America is a country that advocates private investment. The Soviet Union has socialized its domestic economy. Britain is now standing between the two and has the opportunity to move towards a socialized economy, which we need." Ms. Wilkinson also said the same thing in her speech in Parliament when discussing the United Nations Charter. She said: "San Francisco believes that we are... a country between the extremes of two major economic systems." She and Bevin similarly believe that Britain has a special mission to mediate between the United States and the Soviet Union. Britain should promote the cooperation of the United States and the Soviet Union.

Molotov

Molotov recently summarized important international and domestic situations, which provides people with an understanding of the Soviet Union's direction and has always been closely watched by people. As the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is about to be held, all parties are particularly concerned about the Soviet Union's intentions. Mr. Molotov's recent speech should be one of the most important reference documents, and the Associated Press's report on Mr. Molotov's speech is translated below:

The Soviet Union Should Consolidate Cooperation in Victory

Molotov said: "We hope that our country will flourish and have atomic energy, as well as many other things. Today, it is impossible for great secrets to be kept by a small circle composed of one or a few countries..." Therefore, the discovery of atomic energy should not be used as a display of force in international policy, nor should we be complacent about the future of peace-loving countries.

He said that the great destructive power of the atomic bomb has not yet been used to prevent aggression or protect peace. He did not mention the United States or any other country when he mentioned atomic energy in his speech.

Molotov demanded compensation from the defeated Axis countries without revenge, and at the same time warned the people that the roots of imperialism in today's world have not been eliminated. "The Allies should do their best to consolidate the cooperation gained in victory."

Molotov suggested that the victorious Allied countries should not treat the defeated Axis countries entirely according to their own feelings, but only according to the need to prevent new aggression.

Speaking of which, Molotov is the only senior Soviet official to talk about atomic energy. He advocated that the Soviet Union must actively pay attention to industry and train advanced technical personnel. "We must acquire the achievements of modern world technology in all aspects of industry and the national economy, and make the conditions for Soviet science and technology to play the greatest role."

Editorial

### Returning the Military to the Nation, Returning Power to the People

Chongqing (Central News Agency): National Assembly representatives yesterday issued a joint opinion on the current situation on National Renaissance Day, stating that the solution to the current national crisis lies in two points: returning the military to the nation and returning power to the people. Although we have not yet read the full text of their opinion, judging from the gist of this telegram, it already outweighs tens of thousands of words of political commentary.

The army should be organized by the nation, and political power originally belongs to the people. The Republic was established, and the Lunar New Year's Eve of the 34th year is approaching, yet we still need to return the military to the nation and return power to the people. The government and the people should truly feel ashamed and blame themselves. How can we allow old stories to obstruct progress and continue to hesitate? Currently, there is a high call for the government to convene a Political Consultative Conference. Representatives of various parties, including the Communist Party, as well as so-called social elites, are all gathered in the temporary capital, engaging in frequent social interactions, filled with joy. It seems that the Chinese political situation is very optimistic. Standing from the perspective of the people, we sincerely hope that this bright atmosphere will not be like the fleeting ephemera of previous negotiations between the government and the Communist Party, quickly covered by dark clouds again. Therefore, we feel that the opinions of the National Assembly representatives are indeed worth careful consideration. Whether it is the government or various parties, if they do not thoroughly realize this and unanimously move towards the broad path of "returning the military" and "returning power," China's political situation may never embark on the track of democracy and the rule of law.

Special Envoy Marshall has come to China, and all parties have placed deep hopes on how he will promote China's internal unity. However, he is quite humble, saying either that he does not know much about China or that his primary purpose here is to listen to opinions from all sides. It is evident that determining how to handle China's internal affairs in the most reasonable and legal way is not something that can be answered in a moment. It is better to seek solutions from ourselves rather than rely entirely on allied nations and place our hopes on foreigners. In fact, the Chinese people understand and are the fairest judges of Chinese affairs. Therefore, solving China's national problems, while difficult, is also quite easy. As long as all parties can respect the opinions of the people and listen to their judgments, no one can deceive anyone, and no one can intimidate anyone. Temporarily gathering a group of people, writing a few letters, claiming to be representatives, and boasting as public opinion might fool foreigners, but it will not necessarily deceive the people! Today, the people have very simple and reasonable standards for commenting on national affairs. Whoever can immediately return the military to the nation, truly subject to the command of the nation's supreme commander, and no longer be an enemy of the people, engaging in actions detrimental to the people, will earn the praise of the people. Whoever can return political power to the people—the true masters—sooner rather than later, implement constitutional governance in which the people have rights and the government has ability, and no longer rely on any party to obstruct the convening of the National Assembly, will earn the support of the people. Therefore, the two proposed solutions to the national crisis provided by the National Assembly representatives, "returning the military to the nation" and "returning power to the people," are indeed the common opinions of the majority of the people. The National Assembly representatives are truly worthy of being representatives of the people for being able to express this concisely and directly.

Currently, what everyone is most worried about is: whether China will split and whether it will evolve into a situation of separate regimes seeking only partial peace. Looking at the current international environment: the United States has publicly recognized the National Government led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the only legitimate government of China, continues to support it, and believes that maintaining a strong and unified China is an important factor for world peace; the Soviet Union not only shares this sentiment with the United States, but the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance also has clear provisions to this effect; and as for other allied nations such as Britain and France, even if there are some imperialist colonial officials, as condemned by General Hurley, attempting to obstruct China's unity, their governments and far-sighted politicians all hope that China will become a strong, unified, and democratic country. Thus, it is the common desire of major allied nations that China should be unified and not allowed to have further division and separation. Looking at the domestic situation: the National Government has long advocated stopping armed conflicts, convening a consultative conference, and peacefully discussing solutions to the national crisis. Fortunately, the Communist Party has recently sent representatives to the temporary capital, and other parties are also preparing to participate in the discussions. If everyone has sincerity, no one will suspect that there are still people who intend to play the game of armed separation. In theory, China's unification should not be a problem. However, as General Hurley said, "The existence of armed political parties and independent armies in China makes China's political unity impossible." Therefore, if we want China to truly become a unified and strong country, we must first meet the basic condition of returning all armies to the nation. Otherwise, despite verbally saying "ceasefire" and submitting "ceasefire proposals" in writing, attacks and battles can still occur every day. Just by flipping through yesterday's and today's newspapers, we can see eye-catching news such as the Communist army attacking the northwest suburbs of Tianjin, the Communist army harassing Liangxiang, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu destroying postal institutions, and the Communist army in Dingxian demanding grain and conscripting soldiers... From this, we can see that if the return of the military to the nation is not done immediately, the Chinese people will not have a peaceful night's sleep. Moreover, the result of political parties engaging in military activities can lead to separation and division, or even invite foreign aggression, brewing wars, and plunging China back into a state of utter destruction!

Secondly, what everyone is paying attention to is: how will China create a democratic country? In fact, this is not difficult either. In various countries, the forms of democratic systems may be different, but the spirit of democratic systems is the same. This spirit is nothing more than that the political system of a country is determined by the people of that country themselves. Therefore, sovereignty in China rests with the Chinese people. The people have the right to elect and the right to recall, so they can elect which party and recall which individuals. The people have the right to initiate and the right to referendum, so they can initiate which laws and reject which regulations. No one, no party, can deny or seize this political power of the people, and no foreign country can influence it. Although we hope that the Political Consultative Conference can give various parties an opportunity to discuss with an open mind and work together harmoniously, the government should not and cannot grant this conference, which has no legal basis and is not elected by the people, a special privilege to represent our people in resolving all national affairs. Therefore, China will either not embark on the path of democracy, or if it wants to have a democratic China, the only proper path is to hope that the government will move from "tutelage" to "constitutionalism" as soon as possible. This step from "tutelage" to "constitutionalism" is also what President Truman expects from the National Government: "revising the period of political tutelage." How to revise it? How to move towards constitutionalism? Other than convening the National Assembly on schedule in accordance with the law so that the National Assembly can be seen convening in the capital in May 5th of next year to formulate a constitution, which the whole country will follow, there is no other shortcut. Chinese people often seek convenience and like to take shortcuts; in fact, democratic politics is a politics that has been nurtured and grown in Europe and America for hundreds of years, and there is no convenient shortcut to take. If we want to learn democracy and truly become a democratic country, we can only do it diligently, seriously, and without delaying the convening of the National Assembly and the formulation of the fundamental law of the country for any reason. Furthermore, the preparations for the National Assembly to convene and formulate the constitution on schedule must not be delayed due to the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. As for the Political Consultative Conference, it must be open so that our people know what they are discussing, which is a matter of course and does not need to be discussed in depth. Only in this way can the government show its sincerity in returning power to the people. Talking about anything else without this is just trimming the branches, which will only make things more chaotic and will not clarify the Chinese political situation.

### Snapshots of the Guangzhou Gas Factory: From Takeover to Resumption of Production

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng

Even the name "Guangzhou Gas Factory" is unfamiliar to Guangzhou people. What exactly does this factory produce? What kind of gas does it refine? The outside world does not know. They did not expect that the inexhaustible air, in addition to sustaining the survival of all living things in the universe, also has great uses. The carbon and oxygen contained in the air can both be utilized. However, this gas factory currently mainly produces compressed oxygen, which is also very useful. It is needed for welding, mines, machine factories, submarines, hospitals, etc., and can also be used as other chemical raw materials. Therefore, during the nation-building period, it is of great help to national defense or economic construction.

In order to understand the organization and manufacturing process of the factory, the reporter made a special visit. It turned out that it was established by the enemy after the fall of Guangzhou, originally called "Toa Teikoku Compression Gas Co., Ltd., Guangdong Branch." After the Japanese surrender, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a special commissioner in September of this year to take over, and it was renamed "Guangzhou Gas Factory."

Since Mr. Wu Chaozhu took over as director of the factory, and Engineer Wu Yaorong concurrently served as chief of the Engineering Department, all Japanese personnel were dismissed. After more than two months of reorganization and preparation, the factory officially resumed production on December 9th, making it the first factory to resume production among the factories taken over by our authorities in Guangdong.

Walking into the factory building, the scale is not very large, a T-shaped room about three zhang long. The first thing that catches the eye is an oxygen storage tower with a capacity of eight cubic meters at the edge of the building. Looking up, there is a white iron pipe erected in the upper right corner, which is the air inlet. Walking into the inner room, there are two steel water towers about seven or eight chi high and one and a half chi in diameter, filled with sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda liquid preparation). The air is sucked in from the air and passes through these two sodium hydroxide water towers, absorbing carbon dioxide gas. The air then flows into the compressor, which compresses the air to a pressure of 200 atmospheres. It then enters a dryer to absorb the moisture in the air. It is then introduced into a high-pressure sodium hydroxide cylinder to wash the air again. After that, it passes through a cold water tank to cool it down before being introduced into the separator. Under normal temperature and high compression, the air is compressed and separated. After six hours of liquefaction, seventy-nine parts of nitrogen rise and are discharged, and the remaining twenty-one parts of oxygen sink and enter the storage tower. After the tower contains six cubic feet of oxygen, the gas is introduced into a high-pressure machine for recompression, with a pressure reaching 150 atmospheres, which is equivalent to 150 kilograms of pure oxygen. Finally, it is introduced into a water separator to separate any remaining gas before being filled into iron cylinders of three capacities: five cubic meters, six cubic meters, and seven cubic meters. This is the finished product of oxygen. The shape of the iron cylinder is quite like a two- or three-hundred-pound bomb. The power of oxygen is very great. If it leaks out from a small hole, and you bring a match close to it, the match will ignite before you even get near the small hole.

Currently, the factory's oxygen production is 90 cubic meters per day. Because of the limited power supply from the power plant, it is impossible to start work during the day, and it can only be manufactured at night, so the output is not much. Based on the current production costs, excluding the fact that the air does not need to be purchased, the rest requires 10 pounds of sodium hydroxide, 5 pounds of cleaning oil, 10 pounds of asbestos, 450 degrees of electricity, and 30 technicians. Currently, because the factory has just resumed operations, it has not been able to fully utilize the nitrogen discharged from the separator (nitrogen can be used to make ammonia). If the power plant extends the power supply time, then the factory's output can be increased to meet the needs of the city's agencies and factories.

According to Director Wu, there is a similar gas factory in Chongqing, which is run by the Resources Committee, and its scale is not as large as this one. In addition, there is one in Guiyang, which is run by the Aviation Committee, and the output is unknown. He also said: What is currently worth reporting is that, in addition to the fact that our factory is the first factory taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to resume production, we have not used any funds from the Ministry of Economic Affairs from the takeover to the resumption of production, and we already have a considerable surplus. (December 16, Guangzhou).

### Cloth Produced by State-Run Factories: City Urgently Awaiting Purchase; Speculation about Dumping Enemy and Puppet Cloth Not Confirmed by Competent Authorities

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Recently, the price of grey cloth has risen on the market. There are rumors that the authorities will dump more than 10 million bolts of cotton cloth seized from the enemy and puppets. However, according to Mr. Pan, a member of the Reorganization Committee of the Dyeing and Weaving Factory and the Cotton Cloth Merchants' Association, this has not been confirmed by the competent authorities. Moreover, according to what our association and others know, the state-run textile mills have been operating for more than 20 days, producing approximately 4,000 bolts per day, so the stock should be around 1 million bolts. As for the cloth seized from enemy and puppet organizations, there are more than 3 million bolts delivered by the Puppet Chamber of Commerce, one-third of which is grey cloth and two-thirds of which is processed colored cloth. This cloth was forcibly collected from our association's member factories and firms by the enemy and puppet governments through illegal means. We are currently petitioning the government to thoroughly investigate and return it, so there is no reason to dump it immediately. The cloth produced by state-run factories is urgently awaited for purchase on the market. The government may be able to sell it in advance, but whether this can be implemented before the Textile Construction Company takes over remains to be confirmed.

### Domestically Produced Goods Shipped to the United States: Two Batches Recently

Sino-American trade has now begun. Imports from the United States include foreign wine, canned milk and other food, and White Tower Oil and other food products. The largest items are gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and other oils from Mobil and Texaco. The wheat, flour, cotton fabrics, and wool that arrived in Shanghai previously were all relief supplies, and commercial goods have not yet been imported. Most import and export merchants do not dare to trade fully because foreign exchange has not yet been regulated. A small number of export goods have already been shipped to the United States. The first batch was shipped out on the American ship Grand on the 13th of this month, including tung oil, lake silk, straw hats, and other miscellaneous goods. The second batch was shipped to Vancouver and New York by the British Far East Shipping Management Office's Java Prince last Saturday, and then transferred to the American interior, including 153 boxes of lake silk, 117 boxes of Shandong pongee, and 158 pieces of pig bristles. There were also 5,570 pieces of old clothes and old shoes from the Relief Agency shipped to Hong Kong.

### New French Exchange Rate to Be Announced Soon

### Economic Briefs

Li Guanghua, chairman of Yongxing Industrial Company, has organized a commercial and industrial inspection group to Korea with colleagues for a period of one month, and preparations have been completed.

The Police Department has decided to ban loud selling by used clothing stores and other shops, as it is detrimental to hygiene and the city's appearance.

Lihua Enterprise Unlimited Company in this city has recently been reorganized into a limited company with a capital of 5 million yuan, with the business of import and export trade, investment in production enterprises, and manufacturing industrial raw materials.

Zhenhua Paint Co., Ltd. had a capital of 500,000 yuan before the war, and has recently increased it by 11.5 million yuan, for a total of 12 million yuan.

Ningbo Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Weaving Factory, formerly a partnership, has also recently been reorganized into a limited company with a capital of 68 million yuan, which has been fully subscribed, and still engages in cotton spinning, weaving, printing, dyeing, and finishing.

### Coal Prices in This City in the Last Six Months

— Xue Peng

Coal is broadly divided into two types: bituminous and anthracite. Anthracite is used for fuel, while bituminous coal is used by factories and ships for power. Currently, most of the anthracite sold on the market is Yangquan lump, Jiaozuo lump, and Yangquan fines. Bituminous coal is mostly Dazhashan fines and Dazhashan lump, followed by Huainan lump.

After the September 18th Incident in 1931, when the Northeast fell, the enemy seized coal from Fushun and Benxi Lake and aggressively promoted it to various places. At that time, according to coal industry statistics, Shanghai needed 5 million tons of coal annually, but 80% was enemy coal. Therefore, this period can be called the enemy coal dumping period. In 1933, the state-run coal industry specially formed the National Coal Relief Committee, stepped up coal mining in various places, worked hard to expand shipping, and levied special taxes to try to resist it. Coal from Datong, Daxing, Kailuan, Hanyeping, and Changxing came continuously. During this period, it can be called the period of national coal rising. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, coal mines on all roads were successively occupied by the enemy. The enemy then reorganized the Coal Association to strictly control it. When the Pacific War broke out, the source of foreign coal was cut off, and coal use in this city relied entirely on existing stocks. This period can be called the coal industry panic period. When the enemy was defeated and the earth returned to spring, factories and vehicles resumed operations one after another, and the demand for coal increased day by day. However, because transportation tools were not yet sufficient and transportation had not returned to its original state, and Kailuan, Fushun, Benxi Lake, and other places were disturbed by bandits and order had not been restored, although the government did its best to transport coal from Qinhuangdao and other places to Shanghai, it was still too little for too many, barely enough for public use. Even less anthracite arrived. Therefore, although other commodity prices have been declining recently, coal prices have remained unchanged. The following is a list of coal price fluctuations in the last six months:

(Note 1) The above is calculated in puppet currency.

(Note 2) The above is calculated in legal tender.

According to the coal prices listed in the above table, the period from August 15th to September 1st saw the most severe price drop. One reason was that after the sun was restored and people generally believed that coal transportation could be smooth from then on, hoarders emerged and buyers waited and watched. However, the biggest reason was that the enemy took advantage of the inconsistent pace of the government's takeover work to secretly sell the coal that had been controlled and plundered over the years. Now the government has established a Fuel Committee to coordinate mining and sales for fuel. Kailuan Coal Mine is actively mining, and the Qinhuangdao shipping route has been opened. The takeover work in the nine eastern provinces is proceeding smoothly. Coal from Fushun and Benxi Lake can continue to be mined, and the takeover of enemy coal has also been opened. With these sources coming later, coal prices may gradually be leveled out.

### The Coal Shortage Remains Difficult to Resolve, Few Coal Businesses Have Resumed Operations

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Coal prices have recently shown signs of stabilizing, but because the base price was already high, it remains an essential commodity that is both scarce and expensive.  For example, the common bituminous coal dust used by factories still costs more than 100,000 yuan per ton, a difference that is immeasurable compared to the pre-war price of only ten to twelve yuan. Even compared to this summer, when the price consistently hovered between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan in puppet currency, the rate of increase has not returned to its original state.  At this time of rebuilding and revitalizing industry, it remains a problem worthy of anxiety. Before the victory, the enemy puppet government had already felt a severe shortage of coal for several months.  When the light of day returned, the enemy puppet government had naturally surrendered, but the stagnation of supply extended for another month or two.  With the assistance of the Allied forces in facilitating the government's efforts and the Fuel Committee's strenuous attempts to find solutions, batches of accumulated coal were gradually transported from Lianyungang, Qinhuangdao, and other places to Shanghai, totaling approximately 80,000 tons.  The Fuel Committee allocated this to public utilities and state-owned factories.  Among these, the power company needed about 1,000 tons per day.  Although some state-owned factories received coal as a foundation, coal is a consumable fuel, and its consumption is rapid, so it was not long before it was exhausted.  It is said that the amount they received from the Fuel Committee was still insufficient.  The low operating rate of textile factories after their takeover indicates that a lack of fuel is one of the main reasons. As for private industries, the situation is even more dire. During the enemy puppet period, there was a so-called "Greater Central United Association" that provided some allocations as a perfunctory policy, but the amount was small and the duration was short. Except for those with special backgrounds, they almost always relied on "private goods" to operate.  At that time, the puppet government repeatedly conducted registration and investigation of coal reserves, and cracked down on hoarding. The severity of transporting coal on the streets was second only to that of transporting military supplies. The puppet economic security team used this as an opportunity to extort and exploit in every possible way, so the coal reserves in Shanghai had long been completely depleted. Since the arrival of victory, the crackdown has naturally been lifted, but due to poor connections and insufficient transportation, the amount of coal that merchants transported themselves was sporadic and insufficient to be statistically significant. As a result, factories have no good solution for coal use except to scrape together the small amounts left in various places.  Currently, a large quantity of American diesel fuel is expected to arrive, which can be used as a substitute for coal, thus reducing the severity of the coal shortage. However, it is uneconomical for our country, which could originally have a surplus of coal, to need to purchase imported fuel.  Investigations show that the coal sources for Shanghai have historically been the Kailuan, Huainan, Yangquan, and Datong mines. Currently, Kailuan has resumed production and is shipping about 4,000 tons per day.  Huainan has partially resumed operations and was able to produce 2,000 tons per day before the war. It is said that it will soon be fully operational.  While Kailuan ships a larger quantity, transportation is often hindered, making it difficult to receive.  Huainan is easier to receive, and merchants have been going there to purchase and transport coal in recent months, but the amount is small and the quality is lower.  As for the Yangquan and Datong mines in Shanxi, one produces anthracite and the other produces bituminous coal.  Before the war, they had large-scale production, but now they are completely shut down.  Even if there are coal reserves there, political instability makes it impossible to transport them to Shanghai.  Currently, the source of coal in Shanghai still depends on the government's facilitation. Since Xie, a prominent figure in the coal industry, returned from the rear, he has been facilitating coal transportation with a self-reliant attitude.  A batch has already been transported from Huainan this month. Originally, there were more than 1,000 coal businesses in Shanghai. Although not many have formally closed down, the number of those open but without goods is numerous. Among the more prominent ones, the North China Coal Company was originally the leading distributor for various mines in North China.  It closed down when the enemy occupied the concessions and has remained closed ever since.  Many of its employees are living on meager sustenance.  Yuan Tai also closed down at the same time and has not yet resumed operations. It is said that Da Chang and Yi Tai Xing were previously associated with the "Greater Central United Association," and have therefore also not resumed operations. Secondary coal businesses, such as Yong Cheng, Zheng Da, Min Sheng, and Jin Chang, have returned to the market, but without reliable sources of goods or stable prices, they lack vitality.  Shanghai was originally an industrial center.  We can observe the rise and fall of the coal industry to gauge the extent of factory resumption.

### Shanghai Gas Company Announces: Status of Gas Supply, Monthly Production of 80 Million Cubic Feet

Gas should be the most affordable fuel in this city. According to Shanghai Gas Company personnel, the gas production in the city has been 70 million cubic feet per month in the summer, and can increase by 10 million cubic feet in the winter. The monthly coal consumption is about 3,000 to 4,000 tons.  Each ton of raw coal can produce eight to ten gallons of crude tar oil after being gasified. The byproduct is coke, which has recently reached 2,000 to 3,000 tons per month. The company was occupied by the enemy for several years, and all byproducts were used for military purposes. After reorganization, it has not yet been able to return to its original state. The price of gas per degree was 9.5 yuan in August, 14.5 yuan from September to November, and 100 yuan in December. Exceeding the limit, residents are fined 800 yuan per degree, and businesses are fined 1,500 yuan.

### Cotton Mills Order American Cotton

Textile mills have placed a large order for American cotton, at a price of 22 American cents per pound of middling cotton, 500 pounds per bale, which translates to over 40,000 yuan in legal tender. The deadline for delivery is January of next year. The cost of freight, handling, and insurance is included, amounting to about 50,000 yuan. This translates to 72,000 yuan at the Greater Shanghai market price.

### China Orders Ten American Cargo Ships, $3.42 Million

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th, United Press] The U.S. Maritime Commission announced that it has agreed to sell ten American cargo ships to the Chinese Supply Commission for $3.42 million. The Chinese government will use these ships to navigate the Chinese coast.

### Market News in Brief

Merchants are collecting health shirts for export, driving the price up to 20,000 yuan.

The cigarette market is strong, but some are taking profits at high prices, leading to a firm but slightly soft market.

### Foreign Merchants Are No Longer Allowed to Handle Land Registration and Certification

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Due to the concession system in Shanghai, when foreigners purchased or leased land, in addition to the perpetual lease or "Tao Deed" issued by the Chinese government, they also registered with their consulates. The purpose of this procedure by the consulates was to collect property taxes from their nationals in Shanghai, the so-called land tax. Because of treaty relations, China could not collect any land taxes or other land taxes from them. As a result, many land merchants competed to transfer land to foreigners, who would pay for the title deeds as proof. After obtaining these certificates, they would no longer go through the procedures of transfer registration or tax collection with the Chinese government, and would evade all taxes and fees. Therefore, some foreign merchants specialized in this business, resulting in the abnormal phenomena of so-called "registration," "large transfers," and "small transfers." Now that the concessions have been recovered, the Land Administration Bureau has formulated measures for handling the registration of land with perpetual leases or Tao Deeds, stipulating that foreigners leasing land with perpetual leases or Tao Deeds must register the lease, and if the land belongs to Chinese, they must register the ownership. Foreign merchants who handled registration in the past no longer have the right to register transfers or issue land rights. Recently, fourteen companies, including British-owned Arnhold & Co., Tong Ho Yang Hsiang, Belgian-owned Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger, and American-owned China Trading Company, jointly published advertisements announcing the resumption of such business. The Land Administration Bureau considers this illegal and has requested the municipal government to instruct the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai to notify the consulates concerned to correct this. At the same time, the Social Bureau has instructed the foreign companies to stop this illegal business in order to protect national laws and tax revenue.

### Pre-Preparatory Class of Provisional University Holds Entrance Examination

Held Simultaneously in Shanghai and Yangzhou

[From our local correspondent] There has been a very enthusiastic response to the registration for students in the pre-preparatory class attached to the Provisional University Preparatory Class. It is said that more than 1,500 people have registered in Shanghai, and nearly 1,000 have registered at the Yangzhou registration office. Because there were too many applicants, the school building was not enough, and the students' documents were difficult to verify temporarily because the original school no longer existed. It was necessary to hold an entrance examination for screening. Recently, the Ministry of Education also advocated for an examination first. Therefore, the school decided to hold examinations at the Shanghai Jiaotong University in Xujiahui and the Yangzhou Imperial Palace Nantong Middle School on January 22nd and 23rd of the 35th year [1946]. The subjects of the examination are civics, Chinese, English, mathematics, and general knowledge. Most of the examiners are well-known university professors, and all procedures are very serious.

### National Zhejiang University Repairs Original Site in Hangzhou

Classes Scheduled to Begin on January 10th of Next Year

[Report from our Hangzhou correspondent] National Zhejiang University was originally scheduled to begin teaching at its original campus in Hangzhou on January 3rd of the 35th year [1946]. Therefore, it had notified students in the second grade and above at the Longquan branch school to report to Hangzhou before December 24th of the 34th year [1945]. Because the repair of the campus has not yet been completed, it will take another week to complete the project. Therefore, the start date has been postponed to January 10th of the 35th year [1946].

American Students Play the Roles of Fifty United Nations Representatives, Participating in a Mock World Peace Conference

New International Understanding

New Social Research

New Civic Training

Roosevelt High School in San Francisco, USA, stipulates that children in their teens participate in a "Mock World Peace Conference" as part of their social studies homework for students in a modern democratic country. Their interest was aroused by recent events. Because the United Nations Conference on International Organizations was held in San Francisco in the spring of 1945, these students developed a strong interest in international issues. They formed their own "Mock World Peace Conference," with fifty students playing the roles of fifty United Nations representatives. This has extremely valuable significance for their future activities as citizens. (Three photos attached) First photo: (At the opening of the Mock World Peace Conference, a female "representative" puts the day's agenda on the blackboard, handing it over to the "representatives" of the fifty United Nations students for joint discussion. Second photo: A student, playing the role of the "British representative" at this mock World Peace Conference, with a small model of a city destroyed by war in front of him, and a model of a rebuilt house next to him, expresses his opinion, stating that post-war reconstruction is an urgent need. This particularly attracted the attention of the "Chinese representative." Third photo: Students playing the roles of fifty United Nations "representatives" listen attentively to the suggestions and counter-suggestions of the "representatives" of various countries during the meeting. On the walls of the meeting place (classroom) are displayed the words of the late American President Roosevelt: "If we wish civilization to endure, we must cultivate the science of human relations -- the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work together, in peace."

### President Song Attaches Great Importance to the Warehouse Theft Case: China Textile Company May Return to Private Hands

[Report from this newspaper] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, flew from Chongqing to Shanghai at 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday. That evening, he held the first Christmas Eve reception after the victory of the War of Resistance at the Paramount Ballroom for senior Allied generals in Shanghai, accompanied by General Dai Li, director of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, and others.

### Stopping Stations to be Built on Roads in this City; Central Line Delineated on Zhongzheng Road

(This newspaper report) In order to facilitate traffic, the road facilities in this city have been gradually improved. It is reported that the Bureau of Public Works will first build more than one hundred and thirty tricycle stopping stations and eighty rickshaw stations on various roads in the city and plans to continue to increase them. In addition, Zhongzheng Road has now begun to delineate a center line, dividing the middle into a fast lane, which is 8.56 feet wide for cars and other vehicles, and slow lanes on both sides, which are 3.35 meters wide for tricycles, rickshaws, bicycles, etc. It is said that this center line will be drawn directly to the end of Daxilu Road.

Strict Prohibition on Buying Manhole Covers

Manhole covers on the roads in this city are often stolen by petty thieves. Because the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has difficulty in manufacturing and purchasing them, and it is especially harmful to night travel, the Bureau has sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau for assistance, ordering all iron factories and hardware stores in the city that if they are greedy for petty profits and receive stolen goods in the future, they will be severely punished once discovered.

### Handling Enemy and Puppet Assets; The Reverse Assets Group Actively Investigates; Court to Decide if Seizure is Mistaken

After the victory of the War of Resistance, the seizure of reverse assets in Shanghai was chaotic due to the lack of detailed planning in advance, and there were many complaints from all sides. Later, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Third Front Army, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, and other units organized the Shanghai Reverse Assets Clearing Committee to unify the city's reverse assets seizure work and be responsible for the custody and clearing. Subsequently, the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau was established. According to the order of the Executive Yuan, all enemy and reverse assets in the district were to be handled by the bureau. On the tenth of this month, the bureau established a Reverse Assets Group, which is specifically responsible for handling reverse assets matters.

Seized Reverse Assets Taken Over Separately

According to the person in charge of the group, the group is now taking over all unfinished matters of the Shanghai Reverse Assets Clearing Committee and continuing to carry out the reverse assets investigation in the district, and encouraging confidential reports, in order to ensure that the property of all puppet personnel cannot be enjoyed by the reverse puppets and can be used appropriately. The reverse assets are mostly real estate, furniture, coins, securities, and precious jewelry. Real estate and furniture will be taken over by the group in conjunction with the Central Trust Bureau and immediately allocated to the Central Trust Bureau for custody and use. Coins, securities, and precious jewelry will be taken over by the group in conjunction with the Central Bank and immediately allocated to the Central Bank for custody and use. The group itself does not take over the physical objects of reverse assets, but is responsible for the investigation, registration, and statistics of reverse assets, and allocates them to various statutory institutions for taking over and use according to their different properties. As for the reverse assets that have been seized, if there are disputes, and the parties concerned provide evidence, pointing out that there may have been errors at the time of seizure, then the case will be transferred to the court for investigation and adjudicated by the court.

### Entertainment Tax for Public Venues; Allied Forces Still Subject to Tax

(This newspaper report) The Municipal Finance Bureau stipulates that all bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues self-established by the Allied forces, and venues attached to hotels that are exclusively for the reception of the Allied forces, or places where personnel designated by the Allied forces enter and exit, are exempt from tax. As for other commercial public restaurants or entertainment venues, taxes will be levied as usual.

Regarding the US military, they recently requested the Municipal Government to allow them to be exempt from tax in public venues. It is reported that the Municipal Government cannot agree to this, because food and entertainment taxes are stipulated by the Finance Bureau and implemented uniformly throughout the country. Changing or exempting tax amounts is not something that this city can decide.

They were subjected to various tortures. Especially Zhang Yongchun and Du Tianwen, two comrades, died of injuries not long after they were released from prison, which is truly sad and indignant. They have jointly submitted a request to the authorities to interrogate the main culprits of the Enemy Military Police, such as Kawagoe Kawano and other nine criminals, and sentence them to death to warn others. A public trial is scheduled to take place, and they hope that comrades who have been victimized over the years will come to court to testify to avoid evasion.

He was loyal, brave, talented, and hardworking. He is awarded a certificate to honor his achievements and encourage future generations. This certificate. President Chiang Kai-shek."

### Mayor Qian Broadcast Last Night: The Meaning of the New Life

Mayor Qian Dajun of Shanghai City broadcast to the citizens of the city at 6:30 PM yesterday (the 25th). The topic was "The Meaning of the New Life Movement." The original text stated: The Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to follow President Chiang's instructions to implement the New Life, especially, in accordance with the central government's regulations, joined the party, government, military organs, and social figures of this city to form a "New Life Movement Promotion Association," with myself as the director. He is preparing to implement the New Life Movement effectively and universally in Shanghai. This movement has now begun. Therefore, I am broadcasting to the compatriots from all walks of life in this city today to explain the meaning of the New Life Movement and attract everyone's attention.

Changing the Atmosphere

The New Life Movement is a movement to "change the atmosphere." During the three-plus months that I have been in Shanghai, I have repeatedly spoken about the importance of changing the atmosphere. I have cited two major categories of construction, explaining that the importance of spiritual construction surpasses material construction. The meaning of spiritual construction is not much different from the so-called changing the atmosphere.

Now we must ask what kind of era we are in, and what kind of atmosphere is needed to suit it? Everyone knows that we are now in a great era of national construction. Looking around the world, we can see that we are inferior to others in many aspects today. Whether it is in the economy, military, politics, or science education, we are far behind others. We must work hard to catch up. This awareness, of course, does not start today. Now our country has been unified, the strong enemy has been defeated, and the friendship between the Allied countries is increasing, and international cooperation is growing. This situation is the golden age for us to work hard to build the country. The greatness of our goals, the breadth of our scope, and the arduousness of our work are naturally obvious. To complete the task, we must have a good atmosphere that adapts to this requirement. If the thoughts, behaviors, and living habits of the people of the whole country can adapt to this requirement, then the completion of our national construction will definitely be twice the result with half the effort.

Eliminating Morbidity

It pointed out the new path that the people should follow. This new path is to "promote a regulated life of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and practice the virtues of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame in daily life - in the four things of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation." Therefore, President Chiang instructed us to "understand etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, be responsible, and obey discipline." For our general life, he also gave six major principles, which are "neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, speed, and certainty." At the same time, he requires three "izations" in life, which are "militarization," "productionization," and "rationalization." These are the most important principles of the New Life Movement. I hope that the people of the whole country can remember them, examine them, and implement them. If the people of the whole country can do it, I think we should first promote four movements in Shanghai now.

Four Movements

First: is to vigorously implement cleaning and hygiene. Shanghai is really not clean enough now, which is not only harmful to health, but also harmful to the appearance. We have already held a cleaning week once, and now we are holding a major cleaning. We must continue to work hard.

Second: is to abide by rules and order. Shanghai has a large population and traffic congestion. Especially from January 1 next year, all horses will have to drive on the right. Special attention should be paid to traffic rules. At the same time, we also ask the citizens of the city to abide by order, whether it is getting on the train at the station, buying tickets at the theater, or in other public places, they must follow the order and not scramble.

Third: is to promote simplicity and frugality. Shanghai is a commercial port, and citizens are accustomed to extravagance and complexity. This custom is not only easy to lead to evil, but also wasteful of resources. From now on, we should correct the prevailing customs and promote simplicity and frugality. In clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, we must be frugal. All weddings, funerals, celebrations, social gatherings, and gifts must follow the principles of simplicity and frugality. During the national construction period, we must especially save resources to meet the needs of construction.

Fourth: is to promote healthy entertainment. In the past, the lives of many citizens in Shanghai were too decadent and corrupt, so that smoking and gambling were rampant throughout the city. Everyone rushed to it, weakening the people's physique and creating a national decline. In addition to strictly banning these bad entertainments, we must also promote healthy entertainment to replace them. For example, engaging in sports, recreational parks, and reading books are all healthy entertainments that benefit the body and mind. We must do our best to find ways for citizens to increase equipment and convenience. At the same time, we require citizens of the city to abandon bad habits, develop new habits, and actively participate in and engage in this kind of healthy entertainment.

The above is only a part of the work to be promoted in the New Life Movement. We are prepared to promote them first, and then the rest. What I hope everyone pays attention to is first, to recognize the importance of the New Life Movement, and second, to know that the New Life Movement is a social movement, and the tasks of implementation and publicity also require the self-awareness and automation of the citizens of the whole city. At the same time, we must also widely persuade relatives and friends to implement it, encourage each other, and supervise each other. In this way, one person transmits to ten, and ten people transmit to one hundred. The New Life Movement can be effectively and universally promoted in Shanghai. Although there are many conditions for creating a new Shanghai, the main condition is that the citizens of Shanghai can implement the New Life. The implementation of the New Life is a necessary foundation for the construction of the new China and a reliable guarantee for the success of the new China. I hope that all citizens will earnestly implement it and strive to persuade them to complete this important mission.

### The First Verdict by the District Court: Ticket Scalpers Detained

(This newspaper report) The ticket scalpers, known for disrupting the order of ticket purchases for train passengers, were rampant before the victory, and normal travelers suffered from it. Since the Ministry of Transportation took over the "Central China Railway Company," it has spared no effort in cracking down on ticket scalpers. In October of this year, the Railway Police Department was established, and it began to arrest ticket scalpers on a large scale. It sent out many plainclothes detectives, disguised as passengers, and took the opportunity to arrest them. In the early part of last month, it successively detained a group of party members, including Wang Xiaolin, Gao Hongquan, Li Longwen, Chen Caiyuan, and other fourteen people (including four women), and sent them to the District Court. After questioning, a verdict was rendered at 10:00 AM yesterday, the train tickets were confiscated, and the detention period ranged from 25 to 50 days, and no bail was allowed. According to this case, this is the first verdict against ticket scalpers in this city. It is said that the Railway Police Department of the North Station has many more ticket scalpers in custody, who have not yet been sent to the court.

### Regulations on the Display of Flags by Foreign Nationals; Chinese and Foreign National Flags to be Displayed Simultaneously

(This newspaper report) Regarding the regulations on the display of foreign national flags, the Municipal Government has now received a message from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has been forwarded to the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai for their information. The methods are recorded as follows:

According to international practice, the government agencies of various foreign countries may display their own national flags every day, but foreign residents, shops, and ordinary agencies are only allowed to display national flags on their national day or other commemorative days to show their celebration. At the same time, the national flag of the country where they reside must be displayed.

If the national flags of the two countries are hung diagonally, the Chinese national flag should be hung on the right. If the national flags of the two countries are hung up and down, the Chinese national flag should be hung on top.

Furthermore, according to international practice, all concessions in this city have now been recovered, and foreign nationals enjoy the right to protection from this Municipal Government. Therefore, they must display the Chinese national flag and their own national flag simultaneously.

### Jùlù Road Robbery Case: Another Bandit Captured

Confession Ties Him to Yu Yuan Road Robbery

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning's Jùlù Road robbery case, which involved a fierce gun battle between bandits and police on Carter Road, resulted in two bandits being shot dead on the spot, and three male and female bandits being captured alive. Guns were seized and stolen goods recovered. Detailed reports were published in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to the confession of Yang Genfa (local), one of the bandits captured by the Xin Cheng Police Bureau, there were other accomplices in the case, hiding at No. 11 Chahar Road, Chi Bang Bridge. Consequently, Zhang Rou, the chief of the judicial section, led police to the address and arrested Wang Lizhong, a notorious bandit from Wenzhou, aged forty-two. Wang confessed that on the evening of the 12th of this month, at 7:00 PM, they drove a truck to No. 34, Lane 875, Yu Yuan Road, Shanghai West, the residence of Chen Ningquan's family, and committed the major robbery of a large number of gold bars from the safe. This gang was responsible for that crime as well.

All Members of the Tong Taichang Robbery Gang Apprehended

[Our Newspaper Report] At 9:30 PM on the 30th of last month, Gao Shanjian, a patrol officer from the North Station Police Bureau, led police officers and plainclothes detectives to the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Hai Ning Road. They spotted Ren Chuanru, who appeared to be in a great hurry and was carrying a large package. They took him to the station for questioning. He claimed that he had stolen it from a passenger at the station. However, upon inspecting the package, the clothes inside were in disarray, so it was determined that he could not have stolen them. While interrogating him, Guo, the owner of the Tong Taichang cigarette and paper shop at No. 114 Huaxing Road, came to the bureau to report a theft. Guo was asked to examine the package closely, and he confirmed that it contained the stolen goods. Ren, knowing he could not deny it, confessed to conspiring with accomplices Zhang Lisheng, Jiang Zhengchao, and others to commit the robbery. Based on his confession, accomplices were successively arrested at their addresses. The case has now been fully investigated, and yesterday, the perpetrators were sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for legal punishment.

### Foreign Oil Company Equipment Recovered in Part; 40 Gas Stations Being Restored

The oil storage depots, small oil tanks, pumps, and other equipment belonging to Mobil, Texaco, Asiatic Petroleum, and other oil companies were dismantled and hidden, or destroyed by the Japanese during the war, resulting in significant losses. Asiatic Petroleum suffered the most, while Texaco's losses were relatively smaller. Currently, apart from the oil storage depots of each company, which can still be used, other equipment such as pumps and small oil tanks, which were hidden by the Japanese, have been largely recovered by our Municipal Administration after extensive searching and returned to the respective companies for reinstallation and use. The remainder is still stored in warehouses, but some of it has been damaged or scattered and is no longer usable.

Small Oil Tanks

To meet the normal needs of the Shanghai market, Mobil and the other two companies are working hard to reinstall small 500- to 1,000-gallon oil tanks and new automatic calculating pumps at their original gas stations to supply gasoline, kerosene, and machine oil. The companies have restored approximately 40 gas stations throughout the city, with Texaco being the first to restore and having the largest number. All types of oil come from places like Texaco, Texas in the United States, and are owned by Mobil and Texaco. Asiatic Petroleum's supply in Shanghai is borrowed from the above two companies, and each company has sent one Chinese and one American staff member to assist with the work at Asiatic Petroleum.

Gas Pumps

The gas pumps currently in use at gas stations in the city are not the latest models, and their number is too small to meet the current demand, let alone the large demand of the future. In light of this, Mobil and Texaco have ordered a large number of pumps and other equipment from the United States to meet the needs. This equipment is expected to arrive in China around January or February of next year, along with a large quantity of various types of oil, which will undoubtedly lead to a more abundant supply of liquid fuel in the market.

### Gambling Bust in Caojiadu: One Fatality from Gunshot Wound

[Our Newspaper Report] At No. 49 Kangfu Lane, Extraordinarily Beautiful Road Branch, Caojiadu, Shanghai West, there is a gambling den with gambling equipment such as shaking stands, dominoes, and roulette wheels, operating on a large scale, so gamblers in the vicinity flock to it in droves. Yesterday night at approximately 10:00 PM, the Changning Police Bureau received a report and dispatched more than ten police officers in police vehicles to the address. They forced their way in and arrested thirty to forty gamblers, along with the gambling equipment, and put them all on the police vehicles. However, one gambler, named Xu Aru, jumped out of the vehicle in an attempt to escape. Officer Xu Xianzong spotted him and fired a shot, hitting him in the right arm and penetrating his lower abdomen. He collapsed to the ground, his condition extremely grave. He was taken to Tongren Second Hospital for treatment, but to no avail, and he died soon after.

### Relief for Unemployed Workers: Flour Distribution to Begin Next Month; Adult Workers Receive 1.5 Bags per Month, Child Workers One Bag

Since the Shanghai Municipal Unemployed Workers Temporary Relief Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs began providing relief to unemployed workers in the city, as of the 15th of this month, a total of 404 factories had applied for relief, with 105,469 unemployed workers. Of these, 51 factories and 8,564 workers were deemed ineligible according to regulations, and 24 factories and 4,871 workers are still under review. A total of 329 factories and 92,034 workers have already received relief. The original relief period for unemployed workers in the city was limited to three months, and this period has now expired. However, the number of factories that have resumed operations is still limited. At its 12th meeting, the committee decided that the application for relief registration should be announced as closed immediately. All registered unemployed workers, except those who have returned to work, will continue to receive relief for three months. The relief method has been agreed upon by the committee and the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief Administration, which will allocate flour for relief, and distribution will begin in January 1946. The distribution dates will be announced separately.

The quantity of flour to be distributed is specified as follows:

Distribution Method Has Been Specified

(1) Adult workers will receive 66 city catties (1.5 bags) per month, (2) child workers will receive 44 city catties (1 bag) per month. Adult workers will receive one bag every twenty days, and child workers will receive one bag per month, all for a period of three months. (2) The flour distribution locations are: (1) Pudong District: 1 Huishan Road, No. 4 District Cigarette Workers' Union, Huacheng Branch. 2 Shanghai Laundry Factory at the intersection of Jilin Road, Hongkou.

If it is discovered that someone has returned to work or is fraudulently claiming flour, the distribution of flour to the entire group will be suspended as a form of punishment.

Flour Price Stabilization to be Further Reduced

The second phase of affordable flour will be sold on the 28th. The Relief Administration is entrusting the Fufeng and Fuxin flour companies' joint office to handle the registration. The quantity for sale this time has been greatly increased, with a maximum purchase of 50 bags. Noodle shops and pancake/steamed bun stalls can also participate in the purchase starting this round. It is said that those going to register to purchase the affordable flour are very enthusiastic, and the number is beyond expectations. Due to the sale of this affordable flour, the ordinary market price has been affected and is trending lower. A spokesperson for the Relief Administration said: "There are inevitably some people who intend to hoard the flour. To completely eliminate this kind of attempt, in addition to continuing to sell it continuously, the selling price will also be gradually reduced to make it unprofitable for those who attempt to hoard it. Furthermore, if this kind of situation is discovered, the administration will revoke their right to purchase in the next round."

### Mayor Qian Personally Officiates Marriage of 42 Newlywed Couples; Ties of Victorious Union

— Our Newspaper Reporter Xingwu

The Victory Memorial Group Wedding Ceremony, sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, was held yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Pudong Building on Zhongzheng Middle Road. More than 2,000 guests attended. Mayor Qian personally officiated the wedding. The ceremony was simple, solemn, and grand. A total of forty-two couples participated in the wedding. During the ceremony, Ge Kexin (representing He Ti'an), the acting director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, read out the certificates. Mayor Qian distributed the marriage certificates separately and gave each couple a copy of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny" as a souvenir. In addition to Mayor Qian's impromptu wedding speech, guests Yuan Xiluo, Ding Fubao, and others gave insightful speeches. The ceremony concluded at 11:30 AM.

Red Candles Burned High

Almost all of the staff of the Bureau of Social Affairs were dispatched, wearing red satin ribbons that said "Officer," "Master of Ceremonies," etc., busily arranging and directing. A red carpet was laid in the center of the hall, dividing into two paths to the left and right of the door. Large and tall candlesticks with red candles were placed on the sides. The rows of guest seats and family seats were packed. As the time drew near, the forty-two brides and grooms had spent most of the morning dressing and putting on makeup, and everything was ready.

Overflowing with Joy

At 10:15 AM, the wedding ceremony began. The grooms in blue suits and black vests, and the brides in white dresses and pink veils, were overflowing with joy as they lined up in two rows. They slowly entered the venue to the wedding march, long and orderly, and all eyes were drawn to them. The four little pioneers who scattered flowers and carried lanterns were lively and cute, especially attracting the attention of the whole audience.

Mayor Officiates

The wedding officiant, Mayor Qian, arrived early. When the emcee announced that the wedding officiant should enter, he steadily stepped onto the stage and read out the marriage certificate. After the wedding ceremony of bowing three times, he gave a speech, saying: "Marriage is not only a major event in life, but also a major event for the country and society. We should attach importance to the wedding ceremony, but we do not necessarily have to make the wedding ceremony complicated and extravagant. Holding a wedding ceremony should be solemn, but the ceremony should be simple and the expenses should be economical. The system of group weddings can meet this requirement and it is necessary to promote it. From this moment on, each of you newlyweds, who were previously two unrelated individuals, will now become an inseparable family. With a spirit of mutual assistance and responsibility, you should each build a happy family, and together build a prosperous Shanghai and a strong China."

Two Elders Speak

Next, Mr. Yuan Xiluo and Mr. Ding Fubao gave congratulatory speeches. Mr. Yuan humorously congratulated the new couple using the first initials of the words "America, England, Soviet, France." Mr. Ding explained the way to maintain good health in the local dialect of Wuxi, winning applause from the audience. After the speeches, marriage certificates were issued. One pair after another, the distribution continued for almost half an hour, leaving the twenty ushers covered in sweat.

Continuous Bows

Mayor Qian bowed in return forty-two times, standing for more than an hour, but he still stood there vigorously. His neat new suit and newly shaved flat-top haircut shone under the red light of the neon "囍" (double happiness) character, making him look particularly young. Mayor Qian also gave each couple a copy of "China's Destiny," and the wedding ceremony did not end until 12:00.

No Room for Further Savings

This was the first time that the Bureau of Social Affairs has organized a group wedding, and it will continue to do so in the future. In order to be as economical as possible, no refreshments were provided. Each couple only paid 3,500 yuan, including everything for the hall, photos, flowers, etc. Therefore, it was said that it only cost the price of a pair of socks to get married. It is said that the Bureau of Social Affairs subsidized more than 100,000 yuan.

A Statistic

The Bureau of Social Affairs has compiled statistics on the hometown and age of the eighty-four newlyweds, which are recorded as follows: 11 from Shanghai, 39 from Jiangsu Province, 26 from Zhejiang Province, 6 from Guangdong Province, and 2 from other provinces. 18 are between the ages of 17 and 20, 37 are between the ages of 21 and 25, 21 are between the ages of 26 and 30, 6 are between the ages of 31 and 35, and 2 are between the ages of 36 and 39.

Spring and Autumn

### Local Love

— Moyu

Tonight, the moon in Fuzhou,
She watches it alone in her chamber;
Far away, she pities her little children,
Who do not yet understand longing for Chang'an.

Fragrant mist and clouds dampen her hair,
Clear moonlight chills her jade arms;
When will she lean against the gauzy curtains,
The moon shining on both, drying our tear-stained faces!

— Du Fu

The autumn night sky is quiet and desolate, a bleak breeze carrying distant dreams gently sweeps under the eaves. I raise my heavy head and gaze out the window in dismay. The midnight full moon is hanging high in the blue sky, like the face of an anemic person, with a terrible pale color, smiling sadly at weary travelers.

It is excessive fatigue that brings the traveler to this strange, lonely courtyard. Loneliness gnaws at my heart, and I feel a pressure in my chest. Ah, the destruction of the countryside, the displacement of my family—this picture woven with blood, tears, and cruelty stretches my reverie long and far. Shaking my broken heart, locking my heavy eyes, I recite this poem by the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu, and I cannot help but remember that familiar, beloved land.

The baptism of artillery fire, the shouts of the devil's henchmen, and then a poisonous fire destroyed my homeland. Filled with hatred and nostalgia, I embarked on the road of exile, stumbling in the wind and sand. In the past hundreds of days, whenever the full moon hung high in the sky, I would recite Du Fu's verses, once, ten times, twenty times... These few lines quietly paint a thick layer of black rust on my heart, filled with dismay and depression.

Now, after hundreds of days, a string of reveries deepens my memory, shadows and despair climb into my heart, and I have still not been able to rebuild my farm!

After a long period of exile, when the news of victory spread to every corner, everyone felt indescribable joy and comfort, struggling out of the dark abyss, rescued from the stormy waves. The joyful mood and expression almost made people crazy! Because what followed was no longer displacement and sorrow, but the joyful tears of reunion, even embraces! Along with the songs of triumph, many men and women embarked on their return journey to relive their old dreams. But now, I have not been able to prepare to return. I do not have the tough soles of my shoes to step on the thorns of that blood- and tear-stained gray earth, the rubble of the broken countryside. Nor do I want to take a step closer to my homeland before the devil's henchmen are dead!... Moreover, the story of being eaten by worms is still being played out on that grassland!...

So, let the fire of memory burn, let reverie break free from depression, and offer sincere silent prayers and blessings to the people in the distant sky. Under the deep blue night sky, in the pale moonlight, I repeatedly recited Du Fu's verses. Although I do not have the delicate illusions of this old poet when he was in Chang'an, hoping that one day I can "lean against the gauzy curtains" and "the moon shining on both, drying our tear-stained faces," my grief and indignation exceed the imagined realm of his poetry. In particular, I feel that the two lines "Everyone has a home to return to, yet victory finds me still a wandering man" is simply a hot irony for me!

Tonight, my eyes are a little wet, and my heart is beating very hard. A strand of bitterness invades my emotions, and I think of the millions of people on that familiar land being sucked of their blood by poisonous scorpions, millions of eyes still hanging with tears, looking up to the clouds. For the first time, I shed tears for the destruction of my home and the desolation of my homeland!

After a long night comes dawn, and there will be no more haze after a heavy rain. The pain of those who have hope is temporary. But when can all the poison be cleared? When can the wanderer throw himself into the embrace of his homeland and get a chance to breathe? I look up at the stars and the sky.

I believe their doomsday will surely come. Tonight, I angrily tear up Du Fu's poem and throw the white paper strips into the night sky in place of a long sword, and shout out to the people in the distant sky to live bravely!

### Random Thoughts on Ideas

— Lu Danlin

In a society of extreme progress and extreme conservatism in thought, people think of the Doctrine of the Mean. Some think that "The Doctrine of the Mean" is synonymous with being slick, ambiguous, and lacking a sense of right and wrong, which is incorrect. Take a circle as an example; the center is only one point. This point is the middle, without any flexibility. Although the universe is constantly evolving, the most suitable center varies with time and space. However, no matter what, at every moment, it has its "target."

Some people who are not thorough only do five-tenths of a task and then call it quits. They say things like "know when to stop," "don't go too far," and "rather be a failed attempt at carving a swan than a successful attempt at drawing a tiger that resembles a dog." Their calculation is to please both sides, a tofu knife with both sides shining, a crystal ball with all sides smooth. In reality, this is a dragged-out, incomplete performance. "Not seeking merit, only seeking no fault" is a mediocre act of not daring to do anything. Some people, poisoned by these fallacies, are unaware and develop a lack of creative and adventurous spirit, burying their independent and enterprising ambition.

Those who distort the Doctrine of the Mean think that doing things shouldn't be too thorough because being thorough is not the Doctrine of the Mean and even violates Confucian doctrines, which is also misleading. Confucius hated hypocrites the most, saying, "Hypocrites are the thieves of virtue." What is the archetype of a hypocrite? Mencius and Zeng Zi answered: "They are not criticized, nor are they reproached. They conform to the vulgar customs and blend in with the corrupt world. They appear to be loyal and trustworthy and act with integrity, pleasing everyone, thinking they are right, but cannot be included among Yao and Shun. Therefore, it is said: They are the thieves of virtue." The so-called hypocrites of that time are somewhat similar to the "good people" or "nice guys" of today. Feng Youlan said that these people dare not do great evil, nor can they do great good. Because they dare not do great evil, they "appear to be loyal and trustworthy and act with integrity." Because they cannot do great good, they "conform to the vulgar customs and blend in with the corrupt world." They parrot others and are ambiguous, so "everyone is pleased with them." Because everyone is pleased with them, everyone calls them "good people" or "nice guys." These people are precisely what Confucianism calls "thieves of virtue." Discussing human affairs, exposing traitors, and uncovering the hidden is truly insightful.

So what is the true Doctrine of the Mean? Excess and deficiency are both biased. For example, when walking, you cannot stray too far to the left or too far to the right; otherwise, it is not in the middle and easily leads to detours.

Aristotle, although a great disciple of Plato, had doctrines drastically different from Plato's. Plato's doctrine is based on subjective ideas; Aristotle, on the other hand, bases his on objective facts. The reason is that Aristotle was born almost half a century later than Plato. The era in which Aristotle lived was more advanced than Plato's. The relationships of social affairs became more complex, so his research materials became richer, and his research objects became wider. This is a commonality between ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Therefore, later generations have agreed that Plato is the philosophical ancestor of Western cultural history, and Aristotle is the scientific pioneer of Western cultural history. Although Aristotle studied under Plato, he was not a follower who imitated every step without changing a bit; he was a pioneer who carried on the past and opened up the future, not a conservative who rigidly adhered to the rules. Therefore, Aristotle once openly stated, "I love my teacher, but I love truth more." From these two sentences of Aristotle, we know that Aristotle was not a conservative but a creator. Therefore, we should also recognize our times and environment and be people who adapt to the needs of the times and environment, instead of being complacent and content in a corner, just being conservatives, and suffering the natural abandonment of the times and environment.

Kang Youwei's early thinking was sharp and very promising. He enthusiastically engaged in the Reform Movement. Around the time of the Wuxu Coup, he could be said to be a reformer. However, before long, he failed to grasp the times practically and was instead eliminated by the times and environment. In the end, he and Zhang Xun colluded to support the restoration of the puppet Puyi, completing a life's final, pathetic farce, only earning the agreed opinion of being old and stubborn, ending his life that way. Sun Yat-sen, however, was different. He clearly recognized his responsibilities. Throughout his life, regardless of success or failure, he never had any pessimism or timidity. His principles remained the same, and he struggled tirelessly. This fearless spirit of bravely moving forward and sincerely saving the country, and his noble and great character, remained that of a leading figure ahead of the times until he died in Beijing. Therefore, analyzing and summarizing, Kang Youwei was a failure, and Sun Yat-sen was a success. A tiny difference can lead to a vast divide.

The attitude of "getting by" and the mentality of "not caring" are both held by cynical and reckless people. They hold onto an ancient poem that says, "People beg for leftover sacrifices to flaunt their wives and concubines; scholars would rather burn to death than serve an unjust ruler; who knows who is wise or foolish after a thousand years? The entire field is covered in wormwood." They compare Jie Zhitui, who refused to accept office, and the shameless "Qi man" mentioned by Mencius, and offer an explanation of "good and evil are just dreams, wisdom and foolishness are all the same." The so-called "Yao and Shun are just a pile of bones, Jie and Zhou are just a pile of bones." Life is only a few decades. As for wealth, glory, longevity, poverty, and success, once the breath stops, it becomes a rotting corpse. Therefore, they are careless and slack in everything, not serious and not energetic. "When it's time to drink, drink; when it's time to sing loudly, sing loudly." Life is for enjoyment; if the sky falls, use a cotton quilt to cover it; who cares about anything? (The most obvious example is a certain haiku: "Shuffle the mahjong tiles, national affairs, to hell with them.") These people ignore their responsibilities, eat and drink their fill, and only offer satire and contempt for national affairs, without making any contributions; they only offer empty talk and lack concrete suggestions. When the country and society are stable, they spout nonsense, as if the great principles of governing the country and pacifying the world are all in their full-fledged plans. However, when an incident suddenly occurs, they have no plan in their minds, panicking and blaming others. At worst, they take advantage of the chaos to achieve their own goals of profit and fame.

Historically, some have rewarded hermits. The so-called "the wise avoid the world, the next avoid the land..." is the best example. In fact, these are just tumors of the country and nation, living corpses. As the wheel of the great era advances relentlessly, how can it allow such selfish and self-serving people to exist? Natural selection is inevitable; it's just a matter of time.

If everyone can hold the mentality of "If not me, then who?" and refuse to shirk responsibility, then all undertakings in the country and society will have a way, and not only will the War of Resistance be won, but nation-building will also surely succeed.

Some people think that in a volatile and unpredictable society, one can never escape the preconceived notions of being either master or slave, right or wrong, and that there is no real right and wrong in the world. They hear and witness those lucky nouveau riches and temporarily patched-up corrupt characters: their living and eating, their unrestrained spending, their luxurious clothes and utensils, their arrogant gestures; while others devote themselves to academics, bury themselves in writing, or work hard in the office all day long, or work in the rain and wind with calloused hands and feet, and the rewards they receive, the food, clothing, housing, transportation, education, and recreation they enjoy, and the support they give to their families are vastly different. They then rush to the conclusion that there is a lack of true right and wrong and no good and evil in the universe. When a person is living in bad conditions, mentally distressed, and environmentally oppressed, it is easy to stir up such resentment. However, if we take a step back or look further, we can see that these lucky or corrupt figures are like ephemeral flowers, coming in unjustly and going out unjustly, with no way to continue for long. Moreover, their mental anguish of scheming and working hard cannot be compared to that of people who are "content with what they have and are always happy." Jesus once said about his own life: "Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." Yan Hui lived in a humble alley, eating one basket of food and drinking one ladle of water, using his arm as a pillow, and was still happy. Being content in poverty and finding joy in the Tao is enjoying one's own happiness. Being obsessed with luxury is not only chronic suicide but is actually like drinking poison to quench thirst. "Borrowing money from usurers" is the behavior of prodigal sons and enchanting women, and anyone with a little self-esteem, self-love, self-respect, and self-reliance would not bother to do it. Especially in times of national crisis, when nation-building has not yet been completed, we should automatically cultivate a style and habit of thrift and frugality. As the saying goes, "Only by enduring the greatest hardships can one become a great man." Wang Xinmin also said, "If people often eat vegetable roots, then everything can be done." Although life is not absolutely about valuing hardship, those who cannot be content with simplicity for the sake of the times and environment will not be able to have unwavering integrity and will easily be tempted by material desires and change their will. Generally, those who lose their reputation and integrity are definitely those corrupt elements who are deeply addicted to desires. If you don't believe it, you can review the spineless invertebrates and maggots of the pseudo-organizations in various places before the war, which is a real proof.

Doing things should have a resolute and decisive spirit, and one should not have an ambiguous and wavering attitude. Huang Yuanyong once pointed out that the public poison of the Chinese people is "vagueness." Everything is often vague and not thoroughly correct. Yes, as in the past, the sentences in official documents of the authorities, such as "there is a reason for the incident, but no evidence can be found," have already been passed down as jokes in official documents. And some people talk about things with a set of irresponsible and empty words like "it seems," "maybe," "apparently," "roughly," "perhaps," "not without," and "allowing" to show that they understand the art of conversation and will not let the other party grasp their central point. This slickness and glibness really affects people's minds in society, with utmost importance and magnitude. Now that everything requires a scientific and practical approach, how should we thoroughly eliminate these empty, unconfirmed, movable, and indecisive words that lack decisiveness? At the very least, one should be responsible for what one says to others and be truthful and clear. Otherwise, if one speaks evasively and insincerely, it is difficult for the other party to observe some real phenomena, like looking at flowers in the fog after talking with you for a night.

Jia Yi's "Peng Bird Ode": "Heaven and earth are iron, and creation is the craftsman; yin and yang are charcoal, and all things are copper." Some compare it to society being a furnace, the leaders of society (the country) being the craftsmen, their actions being the charcoal, and the general masses being the steel. When an individual enters society, they are mostly melted by society. This explanation is extremely appropriate. We know that the leaders of society (the country) lead their masses, and their masses support their leaders. In this way, mutual encouragement and close association can produce a kind of internally substantial action, which is not easily shaken.

### Feeling After Staying in Chongqing for a Long Time

— Chen Sanshou

Aimlessly staying as a guest for several springs, the past heroic sentiments have all turned into dust; long illness makes me afraid to hear the cicadas chirping, and prolonged leisure makes me miss the sound of the ocean tides; the big river surrounds the city, and I know the fish are delicious; the young child clings to me, and I feel genuine love. Where is my home in the east? White clouds drift and stir my longing to return!

Pen-tip Commentary on History

### A Bright Light in the Darkness

— Wu Renzhi

In Shanghai, there are many asphalt roads that look flat and very smooth. However, in reality, it just looks that way.

When you walk along these roads on a rainy day, and mud splashes on your body, or your feet step on a few puddles, then you will feel that these roads still have many bumps.

These bumps on the roads are certainly invisible in the dark, but they are not necessarily obvious in the daytime. Only in the dark, when the two lights of a car are shining brightly toward you, will you immediately see that these very flat and very smooth asphalt roads are full of bumps.

Then I suddenly realized. People will not feel the unevenness of the world until they encounter difficulties.

And the place where this unevenness of the world is located, you cannot see it clearly in the dark, and you may not be able to distinguish it clearly after the so-called dawn. Only under a bright light in the darkness will you be able to see clearly.

Isn't it? A bright light in the darkness is the true light. Under the so-called bright daylight, it may become a bright light to whitewash peace.

### Warrior, When Will You Return?

— Chen Gange

Warrior: Since we parted in Qingdao in September 1941, for the past four years, I have been living in an environment of blood and tears, just like you relying on the 14-inch guns on the battleships in the ocean. During this time, I had endless words to tell you, but in the end, I couldn't overcome the environment, and I am still being controlled by it. So, I can only wait, wait for you and your comrades to return triumphantly! However, your comrades have now returned in glory, receiving people's welcome and admiration, but what about you?

You left behind sixty US dollars when you left, and also left behind my old mother, two younger brothers, one younger sister, and me and my son, five people in total; we need to live through the long days. In the most difficult times, we reduced from three meals a day to two meals, and then to one meal. We changed from snow-white rice to thin porridge, and then to sweet potatoes, and pearl rice noodles; sometimes we even starved like Boyi and Shuqi. At that time, in the midst of extreme hardship, we still did not dare to complain or curse. I firmly believed that you would return one day and restore our original life. So, with no other choice, we sold your furniture, piece by piece, to survive!

It was on such a day, February 9, 1943, that the entire Nanjing Road was blockaded by the Japanese army, for one day, two days... We were starving, starving, and on the morning of the third day, we finally couldn't stand the attack of hunger, so your beloved son Ming, risking danger, tried to sneak out of this death circle. I, looking out from the window, was as desperate as he was, blessing his success in escaping.

He stepped out of the gate and was about to cross the barbed wire fence, "Bang! Bang! Bang!" Watching him fall down, I seemed to scream and then fainted.

When I woke up, two Japanese soldiers and an interpreter were standing in front of me, emphasizing that the child had committed a crime and was shot, and had been sent to the local naval hospital.

For seven weeks, the pressure of life and the worries of the matter added a lot of white hair to my head. Fortunately, Ming had hope of survival, otherwise, I would be reduced to bones by now! In the tenth week, he was finally released from prison, both sick and guilty, with his sentence expired.

Listen to this! Your old mother fell ill, and was sick for forty-nine days. What could I do to ask a doctor to treat her? Every day she groaned, and every day we starved. We sold everything. On the forty-ninth day, she returned to the Western Paradise, jumping out of our life circle. Again, with no other choice, we sold many clothes to give her a hasty burial, finally fulfilling a daughter-in-law's responsibility, under difficult conditions!

Following that, your second younger brother also died young. I don't know where he died, but he left home sick and has not been seen since!

I condensed blood and tears into black handwriting. When people were singing and dancing, I sobbed and picked up my pen, looking at my family all wearily sleeping on the ground. How can I face you? — With this broken family! But in my contradictory heart, I always miss you, the warrior who is bringing honor to the country!

### Four Tragedies of *Dream of the Red Chamber*

— Zhao Qingge

(General Preface to the *Dream of the Red Chamber* Script)

This play is adapted based on the original *Dream of the Red Chamber*, with a research attitude. Each episode is independent; the theme is independent; only the plot and time have connections. For example, I arranged "Soul of Poetry, Cold Moon," which mainly focuses on Bao and Dai, as the first episode; "Snow Sword, Mandarin Ducks," which mainly focuses on the Second You, as the second episode; "Flowing Water, Flying Flowers," which mainly focuses on the Three Springs, as the third episode; and "Zen Forest, Returning Birds," which mainly focuses on Granny Jia and Jia Zheng, as the fourth episode; this development process is exactly the development process of the original *Dream of the Red Chamber*.

I have attached detailed prefaces to the first, second, and third episodes, respectively, at the beginning of the book, explaining the writing process and the analysis of the theme. Only the fourth episode has no preface, so now I will add a few words.

*Dream of the Red Chamber* experts have made many "indexes" of the *Dream of the Red Chamber*, and everyone speculates differently about the allusive objects of this masterpiece. Some say: "It is the biography of the author Cao Xueqin himself"; others say: "It is a portrayal of the politics of the Manchu Qing Dynasty"; I feel that these statements all make sense. If Cao Xueqin did not have the life experience of those customs, habits, human relationships, and worldly affairs written in the *Dream of the Red Chamber*, then he would never have been able to describe them so realistically. Similarly, because Cao Xueqin observed the era in which he lived too thoroughly, he could not help but feel a myriad of emotions, so he used his wise pen to depict all the evil forms of that era. The literary value of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* lies in the depth of these philosophies of life and society. If "it is the biography of Cao Xueqin himself," it is not just the biography of Cao Xueqin but of everyone in his era. At the same time, Cao Xueqin not only "portrays" the politics of the Manchu Qing Dynasty; he simply portrays the politics of all dynasties. When reading the *Dream of the Red Chamber*, one should not only focus on the story but also strive to understand the philosophy it reveals. When studying the *Dream of the Red Chamber*, one should especially not make a narrow index but should look into the distance and at the big picture. In this way, you can see its far-reaching reflection.

The first episode of the *Red* play, "Soul of Poetry, Cold Moon," can be called: a personal tragedy; the second episode, "Snow Sword, Mandarin Ducks," can be called: a family tragedy; the third episode, "Flowing Water, Flying Flowers," can be called: a social tragedy; the fourth episode, "Zen Forest, Returning Birds," can be called: a political tragedy. Although such a distinction is not without some forced interpretation, it is indeed following these four stages of deep advancement. I hope that this adaptation method of mine can help readers of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* in their understanding.

These are all due to the corruption of the times, which has caused various types of tragedies. The remaining poison of this corruption of the times is still lurking with some forces and has not been thoroughly eliminated and eradicated; therefore, the world is still not peaceful, and humanity will never have peace and happiness!

Isn't the collapse of the Jia family in the *Dream of the Red Chamber* a microcosm of the collapse of a country? Why did the Jia family reach this point? The reason is the poor family governance; the disunity of family members; everyone having selfish motives; everyone holding their own opinions, leading to collapse. Similarly, a country can collapse because of poor national governance; the disunity of the people; everyone fighting for power; everyone seizing benefits. As Cao Xueqin described at the time, the wind of corruption and bribery is still visible today; this proves the accuracy of Cao Xueqin's "perspective." In the fourth episode of the *Red* play, "Zen Forest, Returning Birds," I specifically presented this reflection of reality from the front; at the same time, I emphasized Cao Xueqin's transcendent worldview from the side; I hope this can promote an awakening of the times!

These casual words may inevitably have some errors; please provide corrections.

Qingge, late at night on December 6, 1945, at the Ji family garden in Shanghai.

### On Quitting Smoking Without Worry (Part 1)

— Hu Qipeng

This newspaper previously published a letter from Mr. Xi Lian'an, requesting the selection and publication of "Knowledge of Opium Smoking" for the reference of countless blacklisted compatriots, with good intentions. Since the publication of this letter, this office has received dozens of letters and submissions from various readers, among which one gentleman said: "Statistically, among thousands of readers, there are countless parents, brothers, sisters, and relatives who are trapped by opium addiction. They are also our compatriots. If we can provide them with knowledge of quitting opium addiction and save them from the sea of suffering, it would be a work of immeasurable merit." In view of this, this office has specially selected a recent article by Dr. Hu, which emphasizes both theory and practice and is concise and well-prepared in content, and can serve as a mirror for opium addicts. This article contains 2,400 words and will be published in four installments. Please cut and paste it after reading it for later viewing.—Editor

The harm of opium addiction, harming the country and harming the people, is known to everyone and need not be repeated. What I want to talk about here is the knowledge of opium smoking, in order to make smokers understand that there is no incurable opium addiction, and to encourage the courage to succeed and strengthen their will.

I. Types of Opium Addiction

Various kinds of opium drugs were originally a kind of medicine used to treat diseases in medicine. Because they have the functions of relieving pain, calming, and anesthetizing in treatment, they are called narcotic drugs. Among them, the most commonly used as opium drugs are opium. To this day, morphine, heroin, codeine, cocaine, etc., are all addictive to use. There are also a few people who take other non-narcotic drugs, such as arsenic and strychnine, and become addicted. I once treated a case where a person became addicted to smoking the white smoke that occurred after a match was extinguished.

### A Helpful Landlord

There is a letter for Zou Shizhen from his family.

Please come quickly to collect it and celebrate the reunion.

A letter from a reader of our newspaper, Mr. Ming Jun, states: "Respectfully, there is a letter from Singapore from Mr. Zou Yuxian, with the envelope addressed to 'Zou Shizhen, son, for receipt.' We have checked our home, and there is no such person. We presume they are relatives of a former tenant. We have lived here for three years, and since Mr. Zou does not know his son's current address, it is possible that they have not communicated since the outbreak of the Pacific War, and their whereabouts have been unknown for a long time. Now that there is a letter, we should immediately find a way to notify 'Mr. Zou Shizhen' to collect it. Because we do not know where the former tenant moved, nor whether Mr. Zou Shizhen is a relative of the former tenant, and because we have long admired your newspaper's dedication to serving society, we dare to request that you publish this in your newspaper to notify Mr. Zou Shizhen or his family to pay attention and come to the Yu residence at 604 Rue Laborie to collect it so that Mr. Zou's family can celebrate their reunion, which would also be a meritorious deed."

### Investigating the Truth of an Air Force Accident

A letter from our Nantong reader, Mr. Zheng Songyun, states: "Respectfully, there is the martyr Zheng Changgeng, a native of Nantong, who graduated from the second class of the Central Aviation School before the war. Later, he moved inland with the government. In November of the thirty-first year of the Republic [1942], he died in an accident in Lanzhou. His elderly parents are still in his hometown. We earnestly request that any Air Force officers in Shanghai who know the circumstances of his accident please inform us in detail. We would be extremely grateful! Please publish this article in the social service section of your newspaper." (Mailing address: Zheng Songyun, Tangzha, Fangong Bridge, Nantong)
