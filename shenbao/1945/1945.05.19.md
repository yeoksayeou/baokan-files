### Establishing the Foundation of Sino-Japanese Friendship and Bearing the Grave Responsibility of Defending East Asia: Remarks by Commander-in-Chief Fukuda

Central News Agency Dispatch: Vice Admiral Ryozo Fukuda, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with representatives of the Shanghai press corps for the first time on the 18th. He declared that, in order to cope with the changing situation, the Japanese fleet in China would, with unwavering determination, shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending Greater East Asia and contribute to the establishment of close Sino-Japanese relations. The original text of his remarks is recorded below:

"I have been suddenly appointed to the important task of commanding the Japanese Fleet in China, and on the 15th of this month, I succeeded the distinguished General Kondo in Shanghai to take up this post. At a time when the war situation is tense, it is gratifying to see that the officials and people of China, Japan, and friendly countries are overcoming all difficulties and striving forward under the mission of building Greater East Asia. The seriousness of the war situation goes without saying. The intensification of the decisive battle in the Pacific, centered on Okinawa, and the rapid changes in the European situation will have a complex impact on the situation in the mainland from now on, making me keenly aware that the responsibility of the Japanese Fleet in China is even greater. I deeply hope that with the warm assistance and cooperation of all officials and civilians, the army and navy will unite as one to enhance our decisive battle strength, advance to complete the war, and thereby establish the eternal well-being of the Greater East Asian peoples. There is an ancient Chinese saying, 'Where there is a will, there is a way.' According to the nature of war, the occurrence of difficulties is inevitable. I am convinced that by maintaining a strong fighting spirit and combat power to the end, we will surely win the crown of victory. I deeply hope for everyone's efforts. Finally, I would like to say to you all that I served in the navy in China during the first revolutionary war in the 44th and 45th years of the Meiji era [1911-1912]. At that time, the trust and friendship between China and Japan left behind beautiful and close memories. Later, due to the work of the United Kingdom and the United States, Sino-Japanese relations gradually drifted apart, leading to the Sino-Japanese Incident and the current situation. Recalling this, I cannot help but feel regret. At this time, we can only establish the foundation of Sino-Japanese kinship and advance the construction of Greater East Asia with firm determination."

### Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party Seek to Expand Their Own Military Strength

Central News Agency Based on intelligence from Yan'an: At the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party held in Yan'an in late April, Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteenth Group Army of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a military report speech after Mao Zedong's political report. Mao Zedong insisted on advocating the establishment of a coalition government, while Zhu De demanded the immediate establishment of a joint command in his speech. Zhu De first stated, "The Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, the Kuomintang army, local armies, and all forces must be closely united and cooperate with the Allied forces to carry out the war of resistance. To complete this task, a joint command must be established to replace the one-party dictatorship's command." Then he heavily attacked the Kuomintang army, saying that the Kuomintang army maintained the old system, old habits, and old tactics, rejected all necessary reforms for the war of resistance, placed its hopes for victory on the Pacific War and the Soviet-Japanese War, while it itself was passively preserving its strength in preparation for civil war. In his military report, Zhu De strongly asserted that the Chinese Communist army contributed the most to the war against Japan. However, analyzing its content, the Chinese Communist Party is less concerned with resisting Japan than with developing its own sphere of influence. The fact that both sides are now seeking to expand their influence, disregarding the suffering of the people, is extremely clear.

### Editorial

### Improving Prison Administration

Minister of Justice and Administration Wu Songgao and Mr. Li Sihao held a tea party yesterday to improve prison hygiene, earnestly requesting leaders from all walks of life to donate funds to reduce the suffering of ordinary criminals from disease. This is a humane undertaking that should be supported, and people from all walks of life should rise up to assist.

The establishment of prisons was originally a political tool adopted out of necessity, originally intended only to restrain a small number of villains and criminals, so as not to harm the group, and to have the same meaning as the compulsory admission of people with infectious diseases into isolation hospitals. Therefore, the highest ideal of sages and virtuous men in governing the government is the four words "simplified litigation and lenient punishment". Only during times of war, or during economic panic, is there an inevitable phenomenon of "prisons overflowing with prisoners." But in any case, criminals should not suffer extra-legal suffering beyond the punishment prescribed by law.

However, although this is the theory, in reality, judicial funding is tight, and most prison buildings are simple and crude, and do not meet the sanitary principles for prisoners. For thousands of years, I don't know how many people have died from punishments outside the law!

In recent years, judicial power has gradually become independent; on the other hand, due to the efforts of judicial authorities to rectify and improve governance, such as the former Minister of Justice and Administration Luo Junqiang, and the late Zhang Yunbo, especially Zhang Yunbo, who sacrificed his life to improve the lives of prisoners. Today, Minister Wu Songgao is governing as an expert, striving to improve prison administration, starting with improving medical and health care, being practical and realistic, and gradually achieving results. However, at this time when the government's finances are tight, the completion of improving prison administration depends on the donations and assistance of talents from all walks of life.

We believe that on the one hand, we must devote ourselves to improving the material lives of prisoners, supplementing and improving medical and health facilities, so as to avoid prisoners suffering extra-legal suffering. On the other hand, it is also unreasonable for thousands of criminals to sit around wasting national treasury funds and doing nothing. We recommend using adult prisoners for national construction and other possible undertakings. Although there are those who employ prisoners in prisons, either management is poor, or rewards and punishments are unclear, or the work chosen is not suitable for individual prisoners, resulting in twice the effort and half the results. In the future, there should be a complete plan to operate them in a timely and appropriate manner. Those whose work is authentic and whose achievements are excellent should be given special rewards, such as exemption from punishment, reduction of punishment, and other rights.

Among prisoners, we especially attach importance to the treatment of political prisoners. Regardless of how absurd their thoughts are or how illegal their actions are, their motives for committing crimes are not for the benefit of themselves or their families, so there are grounds for forgiveness. Moreover, all groups in the world generally give political prisoners special treatment, allowing them to enjoy different treatment from ordinary prisoners, giving them an opportunity to repent and reform. In particular, most of the political prisoners in the peaceful areas have more reasons to be pardoned than ordinary political prisoners. We should do our best to educate them to make them self-aware and renewed. We feel that it is not easy to cultivate talented young people, and we hope that the relevant authorities on both sides of China and Japan will pay special attention to this.

While discussing improving prison administration, we especially feel that the redress of wrongful imprisonments and the protection of released persons are even more important. We hope that relevant authorities and enthusiastic people will come forward to provide guidance. The maintenance of social order and the protection of human rights are deeply reliant on this.

### A Visit to Shanghai Prison

— Rain Forest

Shanghai Prison, located at 147 Changyang Road, commonly known as Tilanqiao West Prison, is the largest in scale and most well-equipped among the three prisons in Shanghai—including the former Special Second District Masnan Road Prison and Caohejing Prison. Five years ago, the highest record of inmates it housed reached over eight thousand five hundred. Although the number of current inmates has decreased to around two thousand, the words "foreign prison" still maintain an indescribable color of fear and mystery, at least in a certain social stratum.

The Book of Documents says, "Be clear about the five punishments to assist the five teachings"; Lao Tzu also said, "If the people do not fear death, how can you use death to intimidate them?" Originally, the greatest function of a prison, besides punishing crimes, is none other than to liberate a criminal from evil, using methods of influence to make them repent and reform, and restore them to being a person beneficial to society and the nation. Therefore, the prison's facilities and the spirit of governing criminals should all adopt active measures. Cruel torture and inhumane treatment are, needless to say, unnecessary, and under the principle of "the people do not fear death," what good can they do?

Apartment-Style Buildings

Under the reception and guidance of Warden Shen and Deputy Warden Li, the reporter yesterday, in the limited time available, visited this large-scale abode of criminals. The architecture of Shanghai Prison involves concentrating several five-story steel-reinforced concrete buildings on an open space of approximately ten acres. Because the roofs are high and the buildings are magnificent, from a distance, they somewhat resemble a group of "apartments." Its layout is as follows: upon entering, a building serves as the warden's office, with the reformatory, hospital, and Loyalty and Filial Piety wards arranged on the left and right. Further inside, the center is the factory, with the Trustworthiness, Righteousness, Harmony, and Peace wards on the left, and the Kindness and Love wards on the right, between which is the kitchen.

Inside these five large Western-style buildings, besides the officiating officials and guards, there are currently about two thousand male and female inmates, but in reality, about one-third of them have been transferred elsewhere to work, so the threat of "overcrowding," as it was five years ago, is no longer felt. According to Warden Shen, he pays close attention to issues such as the distribution of prison rations, the management of work, and hygiene. Of course, there are still many areas that need to be supplemented and improved, but in fact, it depends on whether the factors of economy and manpower make it possible to resolve these difficulties. Especially economic difficulties, which are the most difficult to resolve at present.

The Inmates' Diet

Turning the most undisciplined people into the most mechanical actions—this is the first chapter of prison life. Currently, they get up before 7:00 AM, have breakfast at 8:30 AM, and then begin work. They eat lunch between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM. Work stops around 4:00 PM. If they do night work, they have another meal, around 7:00 or 8:00 PM. Because the time of the visit happened to be during the inmates' "eating enjoyment," all one saw was them very systematically placing cans of rice and vegetable dishes into food carriers and sending them to their companions to eat. The rice was white rice, topped with broad beans and vegetables. Inmates who worked and were not being punished all received a nearly full can of lunch. Sick and female inmates also had porridge and soy milk to eat. Is this enough to maintain a person's necessary nutrition? One certainly cannot be dogmatic, but for the inmates themselves, it might not be something to be grateful for. Moreover, it is said that the prison authorities went to great lengths to maintain the practice of eating vegetables four times a month, that is, fish twice and meat twice.

Group Living

There are over two hundred female inmates in the women's ward, mostly convicted of smuggling, theft, kidnapping, and other crimes. Before mealtime, they are all busy working, knitting gloves, weaving, making shoes, and so on. Their wages are quite low, but in reality, female inmates who have work to do are much happier than their companions who sit idly in the corners of their cells, their faces filled with sorrow and grief. At least they gain the pleasure of living and working together, the pleasure of group living.

Regardless of male or female inmates, the cells they live in are square and wide, just enough to "accommodate" them, but they are kept quite clean. Female inmates have beds because they are weaker. Inmates sweep the floor at all times. In fact, because things are too simple, in other words, possessions have been reduced to the irreducible minimum. On the plank bed, there is only a blanket and a mat; in the corner of the room, a bucket; mud walls and iron windows—that is all. In terms of hygiene, the simpler things are, the easier it is to keep them clean; in terms of life philosophy, the fewer possessions one has, the fewer worries one has. This environment for inmates is truly the best "land of pleasure" for repentance and self-reflection.

Clothes and bedding are washed and changed once a week, using sophisticated washing machines instead of manual labor, ensuring cleanliness and speed. There are also inmates specifically assigned to mend torn clothes. Regarding work, we might as well discuss it in more detail.

Well-Equipped Workshops

Having inmates work is the most important thing in terms of prison management. First, production can be utilized; second, inmates can rely on it to survive after serving their sentences; third, it can reduce inmates' loneliness, laziness, and dependency, and moreover, it can foster their self-esteem. The workshop facilities in Shanghai Prison are quite complete. In terms of work, there are: printing, bookbinding, painting, metalwork, sewing, shoemaking, weaving straw mats, and so on. They accept orders from the outside world and undertake all kinds of work for the public sector. For example, things that we come into daily contact with, or at least things that are related to every citizen, such as household survey forms and receipts for donations to various public institutions, are mostly printed by inmates in this Shanghai Prison.

In the metal workshop, a large batch of rice buckets and food containers are being repaired. These items are made of lead sheet metal, and once they are damaged, they must be repaired by soldering. Because there are thousands of inmates, the number of food containers alone is countless. Apart from the printing workshop, which is the largest in scale, the size of the other workshops and the number of inmates doing work are determined by the needs of all parties and the simplicity of the work. Recently, there have been approximately nine hundred to a thousand inmates actually working. Everyone has work to do, everyone has food to eat—if it could be further improved, wouldn't it be even more ideal?

Walking into the printing workshop, the smell of ink, lead type, and a "metallic" odor assaults the nostrils. The sounds of small and large pedal presses, proofing presses, paper cutters, and other machinery continuously pierce the ears. Those who have made a living from "ink" seem to be reunited with old friends and cannot help but pay extra attention. The workshop is divided into two parts: the typesetting room and the printing room. The former is equipped like a medium-sized printing shop, while the latter can be rightly called a relatively large-scale printing factory. Just look at a blackboard hanging on the wall, on which is written "Printing Workshop Work Limit Schedule." There are a total of seventeen printing machines, including pedal presses, "British" machines, and paper cutters. The types of items being printed include household survey forms, fire report summaries, notepads, cooperative economic distribution lists, stationery, IOUs, business cards, and so on. Apart from invitations to weddings and funerals, it seems that the public sector has everything it needs. Stapling is also a specialized job, and several inmates are responsible for it.

Managing the workshop is not an easy task. Each section is assigned a foreman. Apart from a few skilled workers who are not criminals, the rest are inmates who are selected for their talents and taught various skills and techniques. What is most interesting is that in the sewing workshop, I saw two inmates making two very fashionable women's cheongsams: low-necked, short-sleeved, with narrow waists and light hems, and the styles are very novel. One of them is even made of silk. Of course, these are commissioned by people from outside, and this inmate used to hold scissors before.

The Incarceration Trilogy—Shaving, Bathing, Changing Clothes

In the reformatory, I saw several inmates reading books—the Old and New Testaments and various books of virtue—and some young inmates who had attended classes were studying on their own. Even more, a "new" inmate was having his head shaved—this is the first step in the incarceration trilogy, which is shaving, bathing, changing clothes and getting an ID number—very particular indeed. They use an electric "razor"—a young inmate uses a hand-cranked generator to generate electricity, and an "old" inmate moves the shaver very freely and casually over the inmate's head. It turns out that inmates can only have short, flat haircuts and are not allowed to have high or low shapes, let alone apply pomade or grease. Therefore, the complicated haircutting techniques that we consider important are treated as trivial here.

After being shaved, this new inmate goes to a very large bathroom to take a bath, and at the same time, the clothes he brought from another world outside, regardless of whether they are Western or Chinese, long or short, new or old, wool or cotton, are stripped off and replaced with a numbered prison uniform. Currently, they mostly wear white cloth shirts and trousers, with a gray-brown vest or short jacket on the outside. In the prison, these two colors, white and gray-brown, are seen everywhere. The inmates' clothes are, needless to say, white on the upper part of the walls and gray-brown on the lower part, and the mats and quilts are also in these colors. Even the tin food containers and the terrazzo floor, and the dangerous looks of the inmates, all carry this melancholy and somber color. This is probably what makes a prison a prison.

Finally, we visited the hospital and the office. One is the most painful and at the same time the most blessed place for people. The other is the headquarters that is able to manage a large institution like Shanghai Prison in such an orderly and methodical way.

To give inmates happiness and to retain useful people for the country and society, improving prison facilities is worthy of attention, but due to economic difficulties, many good plans cannot be implemented, especially sanitation work, which requires funds everywhere and cannot be started. At this time, when summer epidemics are prevalent, it is really impossible to ignore. It is deeply hoped that people in society can consider the future of public security and humanity and provide strong assistance.

However, the selection of these six countries should be determined by the size of their contribution to maintaining international security and their possession of considerable land area. According to the vote, the amendments proposed by the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing were followed. At the meeting on Wednesday, the organization conference also voted to decide that France will also be a permanent member of the Council after its nation-building is completed.

### Opposition Between Two Camps on Trusteeship Issue

Central News Agency Dispatch from San Francisco: New Zealand Prime Minister and Chairman of the International Trusteeship Committee of the San Francisco Conference, Fraser, recently met with the press and issued a statement explaining the issue of international trusteeship in detail. The content roughly states that the opinions of various countries on this issue are quite disparate. So far, Australia, the Philippines, France, the Netherlands, China, South Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union have all submitted their views to the Committee. The meeting has been held three times, and general discussions are nearing completion. However, major issues, such as whether the territory of the international trusteeship system should be divided into strategic, non-strategic, and welfare areas; whether security areas should be placed under the Security Council; whether strategic areas should be placed under the Security Council; and whether welfare areas should be placed under the Security Committee, remain unresolved. Fraser also described the work of the committee, stating that the committee's work was greatly hindered by the lack of provisions on the international trusteeship system in the Dumbarton Oaks proposals. Currently, it is only based on the Yalta Agreement, which divides the territory of international trusteeship into old League of Nations mandates, territories seized from the enemy in this war, and colonies that are hoped to be incorporated into the international trusteeship system. Apart from relying on the Yalta Agreement, the committee has almost nothing to follow, and has only received many proposals from relevant countries.

Sub-Committee Draft Plan

The committee has established a sub-committee, chaired by Colonel Stauss, a representative of the U.S. delegation. It is currently drafting a plan based on the proposals of various countries. Fraser also stated that various countries only hope to adopt recommendations on international governance institutions, without discussing specific territorial issues, which has greatly hampered the work of the committee. He also stated that another difficulty for the committee is the current opposition between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, and the camp of colonial countries such as the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. According to past meetings, there are three points of conflict between the countries: Regarding the goals of international governance, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing oppose the independence of the people of the governed territories, believing that doing so would put their own economies at a disadvantage, create an invisible barrier, and give great disadvantages to their domestic industries and workers. Regarding the economic issues of the governed territories, the United States advocates protecting the industries of the colonial countries themselves, while the International Trusteeship Committee advocates investigating the actual conditions of the governed areas, but colonial countries have expressed their opposition.

U.S. Proposes Compromise Plan

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco: The issue of regional agreements advocated by Central and South American representatives has become a stumbling block to the future of the San Francisco Conference, and the conference has been stalled due to Soviet opposition. In order to break this deadlock, interim Chairman Stettinius convened a five-nation meeting on the night of the 15th, but the Soviet representative refused to attend on the grounds that he had not received instructions from Moscow. Therefore, it was in fact a four-nation meeting. At the meeting, the United States proposed a compromise New American Mutual Defense Treaty, which is said to have been recognized by the United Kingdom, France, and Chongqing. Stettinius further decided that the compromise plan should be discussed by the full meeting, and convened a five-nation meeting on the 17th. If the Soviet instructions still have not arrived by that time, it can be seen that the Soviet Union opposes the U.S. compromise plan.

### Improving Prison Hygiene: Fundraising for Medical Funds, Minister Wu and Others Invite Various Sectors to Discuss Measures Yesterday

Regarding improving the hygiene facilities for prison inmates, the late Minister of Judicial Administration, Zhang Yunxia, had vigorously planned during his lifetime, but was unable to realize it due to limited funds. Minister Zhang unfortunately contracted an epidemic and died after inspecting a prison. Now, after Wu Songbi took over as Minister of Judicial Administration, he is even more determined to improve prison hygiene and strives for change. He has decided to carry on the late Minister's legacy and continue to work hard to improve the situation. Minister Wu then came to Shanghai a few days ago and decided to raise funds to improve the hygiene and medical fund for Shanghai prisons. Together with Li Sihao and Chen Binhe, he held a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 18th), inviting people from all walks of life to participate in the discussion. Minister Wu arrived at the meeting on time with his subordinates. Prominent figures from all walks of life attended enthusiastically, and everyone spontaneously pledged donations on the spot, showing great enthusiasm. Details are recorded as follows:

Next, Li Shiyu, the third section chief of the police bureau, reported on recent criminal cases in the city and the criminal motives of the criminals in each case, most of which were caused by the pressure of life. Following that, Yuan Junchang from the Health Bureau reported that improving the hygiene facilities for criminals is an urgent matter, otherwise it will have a significant impact on public health. Finally, Lin Kanghou proposed fundraising methods. The attendees all spontaneously donated. Minister Wu personally generously pledged 500,000 yuan. It was finally decided that the deadline for payment would be the end of this month, and the designated locations for collecting donations were: Continental Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Si Ming Bank, the "Xinwen Bao" newspaper, and the social service department of this newspaper.

### President Guo of the Central News Agency Arrives in Shanghai

### Future Work Direction of the Municipal Propaganda Office: Remarks by Director Gu at the Regular Press Conference

Since Director Gu of the Municipal Propaganda Office took office, the work and policy guidelines for propaganda have been set. Yesterday (the 18th) at 10:30 AM, the 17th regular press conference was held in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government. Director Gu announced the key points of the future plan to promote propaganda work as follows:

In order to strengthen the efficiency of wartime cultural propaganda and to communicate the feelings of various authors, it is planned to hold regular symposiums of cultural figures recently, so as to unify the direction of wartime cultural propaganda.

Strengthen the guidance of newspapers and magazines, regularly provide propaganda materials, and instruct propaganda guidelines. If there are any records or opinions that violate national policy, they will be corrected or banned at any time.

Unify drama censorship. All Peking operas, spoken dramas, operas, Yue operas, vaudeville, etc. performed in various theaters in the city must submit the script to the office for review before the performance. If necessary, a rehearsal will be ordered before deciding whether to allow the performance or not. Recently, dramas performed by foreigners have also been reviewed by the office according to the same rules.

Holding a city-wide box office registration is also related to the unified review of drama work. There are dozens of registered box offices in the city, but some are still intending to wait and see. The office will set a deadline, and those who are overdue will be banned.

Various coffee shops, restaurants, and dance halls in the city are found to have various singing, music, and dance performances. The content of many of them is not in line with wartime life. This kind of vulgar custom has an impact on wartime propaganda. In order to unify the review and rectification, the office has drafted the "Shanghai Special City Music, Singing, and Dance Review Rules" and submitted it to the former municipal government for approval. Once approved, the management and review of this item will be implemented.

The propaganda work of the counties and districts under its jurisdiction is also being assisted in formulating measures to promote and assess, etc. Other work is also proceeding as usual. Finally, Director Gu also talked about the fact that the newspapers in the city have made significant progress since the establishment of the Federation and the renovation of the content. However, there are still occasional traces of superficial words in one or two chapters. I hope that more attention will be paid to the selection of manuscripts in the future in order to achieve the mission of wartime reporting.

### Chen Riping to Broadcast Tonight

Chen Riping, Deputy Director of the News Department, will give a radio lecture at the Shanghai Radio Station at 8:00 PM tonight (the 19th) in his capacity as a member of the Baojia Propaganda Committee, with the theme "Strengthening Baojia Cooperation in Defense."

### Income Tax Revenue Increases by 200 Million Yuan Per Month

Since the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance ordered its district collection bureaus to earnestly implement account verification and collection on a household-by-household basis, tax revenue has been increasing sharply. Since the collection began on March 1 this year, the monthly tax revenue of Category I income tax in the 33rd year has increased by an average of more than 200 million yuan. In view of the high price increase this year, the tax revenue ratio should be increased. It is planned that the collection ratio will be adjusted again in each district from the second half of the year.

### Silver Dollars Decided to Loan to Purchase Spring Cocoons: Total Loan Amount is 600 Million Yuan

The Silk Industry Association of the Business Coordination Committee, based on the total amount of loan funds accumulated by the same industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to apply for the purchase of spring cocoons in the 34th year, has been in contact with the banking industry to negotiate loans. Yesterday afternoon, at 3:00 PM, they held a meeting with the leaders of the silver group at the Duchen Hotel on Jiangxi Road to exchange opinions on loan details, interest, and other matters. The situation was good. It is reported that the loan has been increased to 600 million yuan in accordance with the price increase of spring cocoons, and the silver group has recognized it. The interest rate is 1.6%, and the term is nine months, with one-third of the loan being repaid every three months. The loan silver groups are China Bank, Bank of Communications, Huaxing Bank, Guohua Bank, China Industry Bank, and 17 other banks. The loan method is handled by discounting bills. There are 37 silk industry manufacturers that borrow money, including Dali, Dingchang, and Longchang. The date of signing the borrowing contract is around the 20th of this month. The goal of purchasing spring cocoons is calculated at 105,000 yuan per load of fresh cocoons. It is estimated that 105,000 loads can be purchased, and the total amount required will be 600 million yuan. The loan amount is 5 times more than last year's 50 million yuan. Therefore, the Higher Court and the District Court of this city have been selected as legal appraisers to handle the matter carefully. All real estate cases are handled by the Association. Recently, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank sent a letter to the Association, stating that it would accept the Association's evaluation list in the future. The evaluation statistics of the Association this year are recorded as follows: 12 cases in February, totaling 14.300 mu, with an evaluation of 129,905,550 yuan; mu in March, with an evaluation of 262,084,850 yuan; 40 cases in April, totaling 70.323 mu, with an evaluation of 1,276,564,800 yuan; 33 cases in May to the 16th, totaling 47.347 mu, with an evaluation of 657,316,500 yuan. In addition, 280 copies of the Association's monthly reservation were sold last month, and 22 copies of the sales contract were sold.

### Shipping Authorities Crack Down on Illegal Shipping Merchants

Since the shipping industry in this city has been operating sailboats, the business has been very developed, but most of the shipping routes cannot reach the final docks, and travelers feel very painful. It is reported that the Shipping Bureau is now actively investigating. If there is any of the above-mentioned illegal situations, it will be severely cracked down on. In addition, anyone who sells black market medicine and raises ticket prices will be ordered to pay a fine and suspend business once it is verified.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Postal Remittances Increase Remittance Rate

Recently, the Postal Savings Bureau has increased the remittance rate of Shanghai to Ningbo due to the lack of chips in Ningbo, eastern Zhejiang. It is difficult to pay all the funds remitted from Shanghai to Ningbo. In order to meet the needs of the actual situation, in addition to increasing the remittance rate, the amount is also limited. If the local post office has insufficient funds to turn around, all remittances may be paid later, and the remitter shall not have any objections. It is also reported that the bureau is still taking care of the telegraphic transfers to various places, but the telegraphic transfer fees have been adjusted separately.

### Everyone Has a Heart of Compassion: Master Si Yong Pavilion Donates a Large Sum of Money Alone

Our office has been collecting donations for the fire relief in Yuyao Road. For three days, all sectors have been enthusiastically donating, which can be said to be in full swing. It can be seen that everyone has a heart of compassion. Yesterday, we received a letter from the master of Si Yong Pavilion, who donated 2 million yuan alone, setting a new record. He also suggested that these disaster victims are not only starving, but also have no house to shelter them from the wind and rain. They will be exposed to the sun and sleep in the open air for a long time, and they will become hungry. Can the original site of the Caohuo Jing drifter habit movement be used as a temporary resettlement place for the victims? In terms of relief, the issue of accommodation can be resolved first. If things are implemented, the only difficulty is food, but there are many rich and kind people in Shanghai, and it is not difficult to raise tens of millions of dollars in education funds. As for the donations received from all walks of life, I hope that they will be used to purchase food as soon as possible, and do not delay for a long time, so that the disaster victims will suffer more pain. According to the master of Si Yong Pavilion, he is currently recuperating in Suzhou, and was deeply sympathetic after seeing the tragic situation of the war and fire reported in the newspaper. He wrote a letter from afar, not only donating a large sum of money, but also earnestly providing valuable advice. Regarding the borrowing of the drifter habit movement, this office will discuss with the Restoration Committee. As for the donations received, we will put them into use as soon as possible, which is the same as our office's opinion. A few days ago, we discussed with Mr. Le Fenglin of the Restoration Committee, and Mr. Le also felt the same. However, the manufacturers in the Xuhui District are currently donating food to maintain the diet of the victims. In order to improve the method of delivering food, the Huashan Police Precinct has printed temporary disaster victim population certificates, and the Baojia chiefs are assisting in providing food with the certificates. For the donations from all walks of life, it is planned to construct simple houses for the victims in a short period of time to truly solve the problem of housing. In short, we will always take into account the principles of speed and properness when using the donations, and consult with the responsible personnel of the Restoration Committee at any time, so as to live up to the enthusiasm and expectations of the donors. We still hope that all sectors will continue to donate, so that we can thoroughly solve the disaster for our compatriots, which is very fortunate. Our office will collect donations for one week, from the 16th to the 22nd.

Sports

### Second Division Basketball League Decisive Match: Blue Team and Flying Horse Triumph

The Second Division League, Sections B6 and B3, held decisive matches for the top spot. Yesterday at 4:30 PM, the matches took place at the Sichuan Road YMCA gymnasium. First was the Section B6 match between Xinxie and the Blue Team. During halftime, Xinxie was trailing by five points, with a score of 14 to 9. In the second half, Xinxie's Qu Yongfu and Huang Fengzhu worked hard to counterattack, coming back from 19 to 14. However, when the score was 23 to 27, Xinxie's main player Huang Fengzhu was disqualified due to his fourth foul, significantly weakening their strength. The Blue Team seized the opportunity to counterattack and reverse the loss, defeating Xinxie with a score of 26 to 23. The second match was between Zhongxing and Flying Horse, competing for the top spot in Section B3. At halftime, Flying Horse led with four points, while Zhongxing had only two. After the break, with only 45 seconds left in the match and the score at 17 to 11, Zhongxing's Jing Xiwei, Jiang Xuexin, and Tong Pingxuan recklessly threw the ball at the referee. Chen Songliang deemed this an insult to the referee and declared Zhongxing the loser.

### Lessons from the Huxi Fire

— Jia Xi

The extent of the losses suffered by the shantytown residents in the recent Huxi fire was briefly reported in this newspaper the other day. The losses suffered by the residents inside the alleyways were also significant. These alleyway houses, including Jun'an Fang and Longxing Fang, totaled 290 households. Among them, at least 200 families were poor, totaling 1,900 people. Most of them worked in nearby factories. About 40 families were in the bean sprout business, while others were unemployed workers, now running stalls and selling rice to make a living. Their origins were Ning Shao, Subei, and local, making them more diverse than the shantytown residents. Their clothing was naturally more abundant than that of the shantytown residents, so their losses were naturally greater.

Let's talk about Longxing Fang. This alleyway had 42 house numbers. The construction of the houses was relatively solid. However, in order to accommodate more families in each house, the landlords built mezzanines out of wooden boards on each floor. A living room was also divided into three or four rooms with wooden boards. On the balconies, four-story buildings were built with plywood and foreign pine boards. The original brick and tile houses were transformed into mostly wooden structures.

The alleyway used a deep well for its water supply, with electricity used for pumping. The well was located at No. 21 in the alley. Since the first power restriction last January, the residents' daily water supply was stopped. However, in reality, the water was not truly cut off but was supplied by the landlord to the tiger stove (a public cooking stove) and bean sprout businesses on the black market. It is said that the black market water sold to the tiger stove (with a special pipe for access) cost 150,000 yuan per month, while the black market water sold to the bean sprout businesses ranged from 5,000 to 10,000 yuan per month, totaling 500,000 yuan. After the fire broke out, the well was locked inside the house and could not be used, so the fire trucks could not get water when they arrived.

Some people also said that a certain house number in this alleyway was hoarding a large amount of kerosene, soap, wooden cores (a raw material for making spools), paint, and coking coal (with a calorific value of 3,000 degrees, used exclusively for melting furnaces in foundries). These items were all highly flammable and heat-resistant. The fire was so intense that when the reporter went to inspect the site on the afternoon of the fourth day, smoke was still coming out of the brick seams of the collapsed walls, indicating that they were still burning inside.

The congestion of residents, the perpetual lack of resources, and the hoarding of dangerous goods were the main reasons why the Yuyao Road fire spread so widely. Every corner of Shanghai has alleyways like Longxing Fang. In today's era of indiscriminate enemy bombing, the danger is unimaginable if something happens. Therefore, the voluntary evacuation of citizens in this city is a matter of utmost urgency. Everyone should remember the tragic lessons of this great disaster.

Walls of constant ruins, destroyed furniture and instruments, and piles of burnt brick and cement floors... Most noticeable were dozens of broken large jars, which were used for bean sprout production. Some of the remaining tattered shacks were less damaged. They cleared the broken bricks and tiles and used straw to build a temporary bed. They were homeless and had to guard these ruins, hoping to rebuild a new home on the ruins.

Life after the disaster was extremely miserable. Take the workers, for example. They were mostly workers from factories such as Sanpin, Wanzan, and Jiuchang. The factories had been burned down, so where could they find work? Some factories issued relief funds of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, but sitting and eating would not solve the problem. Thus, they had to run around looking for relatives and friends, raising money, or seeking new ways out. They had almost completely become unemployed.

The disaster victims in these alleyways are now also relying on the porridge and rice distributed to survive. Their lives are even harder than those of the shantytown residents who worked as laborers, because they cannot sell their labor empty-handed.

Since this newspaper began collecting donations for the Yuyao Road fire, people from all walks of life have responded enthusiastically with unparalleled zeal. Within three days, the amount of donations received has reached more than 10 million yuan. This figure is enough to illustrate the greatness of the spirit of mutual assistance among the residents of this city.

### Special Attack Team Before Launch in Shen Bao Weekly

The Last Meal

Three seaweed rice balls wrapped in nori, plus three pickled radishes - this was the "bento" for the Zhenwu Special Attack Team's last meal. The rice was made of pearly white grains. When split open, the center was a truly fine preserved plum, red and adorable. The warriors ate this last meal on the plane before setting off to fight the enemy. Rice, seaweed, preserved plum, and pickled radish, though not precious treasures, deeply expressed the heart of the motherland. Using these rice balls as the final bento for special attack team members carrying the destiny of the motherland as they plunged into the sea off Okinawa was truly appropriate.

The special attack team members were wearing full flight suits, the area above their knees bulging like lanterns, wolfing down their rations. This scene truly moved the reporter deeply. Three days had passed since the second special attack general offensive began, and today a large number of Zhenwu Special Attack Teams were also departing from this base.

Using spiritual strength to shatter the enemy's material strength is a unique Japanese tactic. The effects of this general offensive will become apparent on the surface of the battlefield. The special attack spirit runs through three thousand years of Japanese history and is deeply rooted in the hearts of the nation. In this autumn of national crisis, using one's life to salvage the glory of the motherland is not at all unreasonable. Only this can express the unique Japanese special attack spirit. Because this is the prosperity of the nation's history and life, special attack team members have long disregarded life and death in order to protect the motherland and defend justice. Even their parents and the entire nation do not feel anything unnatural about this honorable act of sacrificing one's life for righteousness.

Words of Farewell

Zhongyuan, the platoon leader of the 00th Zhenwu Team (a graduate of the Army Officer School), was the eldest of seven brothers. The night before his departure, he told the reporter, "Right now, I'm not thinking about anything, and I feel like I'm returning to childhood!" Valley Glory Junior Lieutenant (a graduate of Nihon University) and others in the same team also expressed that this statement "deeply resonated with their hearts." They all said in unison:

"The feelings right now are indescribable. Special attack is not just for us; everyone will become a special attack team!"

Awatsu, the lieutenant who departed on the first day of the second general offensive (a graduate of Kyoto Imperial University), left behind the following words:

"Our stepping out from behind this curtain has been natural from the very beginning."

Indeed, for every Japanese person, completing the mission entrusted by the nation means living in the history and life of the motherland. This principle is difficult to explain in words, just like the feeling of gratitude for the rations - it can only be understood implicitly and cannot be conveyed verbally. Therefore, the only way to make the enemy understand this special attack spirit is to completely destroy the enemy's material strength on the battlefield. After the enemy troops tasted the Japanese special attack tactics in the Philippines, they began to cry out in misery. In the decisive battle of Okinawa, their terror of the Japanese special attacks was even more pronounced. As an example, in order to defend against Japanese special attack team attacks, they used Grumman aircraft to conduct intensive patrols, setting up the area near Tanegashima as the first line, Amami Oshima as the second line, and the perimeter of Okinawa Island as the third line. Around their mobile units, they constantly deployed half of their entire air force to serve as escorts and guards. The enemy is currently using most of its forces to defend against Japanese special attack attacks, but they still inevitably suffer heavy losses. To this day, the enemy no longer dares to say that the Japanese special attack tactics are suicide tactics.

Sure-Kill Tactics

Ouchi, the team leader of the 0th Subduing Demon Team, on the day before his departure, strongly argued with the operations staff at the base about the amount of bombs loaded onto the special attack aircraft. The staff said that only 0 kilograms could be loaded, but he insisted that it could be doubled, to 00 kilograms. The staff argued that the special attack aircraft had auxiliary fuel tanks, and if the 00 kilograms of bombs that Ouchi proposed were loaded, it would be difficult to take off.

"In that case, let me experiment myself."

So he immediately requested permission from his superiors to conduct a daring test flight in front of the staff and the entire team. The result was a success. The special attack aircraft, carrying 00 kilograms of bombs, actually took off safely. If this experiment had failed, Ouchi, who was going to lead his subordinates to attack enemy ships the next day, might have lost his precious life. Why did Ouchi risk this dangerous experiment to increase the bomb load? Was it because he had given up his life after being selected as a special attack team member? No. First, Ouchi believed that no matter how heavy it was, as long as it could fly, then there would be no problem afterward, because the departure of a special attack aircraft was always one-way, with no intention of returning. The state of mind of the special attack team members, preparing for death, was fully revealed here. Second, he believed that the more bombs, the better, because this would make the battle results more certain when engaging in a desperate fight.

Completing the Mission

However, although the special attack team members were determined to die, the primary element was still completing the assigned mission. Therefore, it was not enough to just crash into something; it was essential to inflict a decisive blow on the enemy. This is the true essence of the special attack spirit.

On the night before departure, a solemn and tragic send-off meeting was held at the base. Everyone drank cold sake and prayed solemnly. Sergeant Kazama (born as a boy soldier), who had drunk a few cups of cold sake, said generously and gratefully, "Our team leader is so great!" He expressed his great gratitude for Ouchi's successful experiment. His expression is still vivid in my mind and will never be forgotten. In fact, the entire team of the special attack team was extremely happy about the success of increasing the bomb load.

At the base, some people called airplanes "heavenly machines." At least today, the Japanese special attack tactics are fully demonstrating their power through airplanes. The Japanese special attack spirit can only fully develop its essence when it has airplanes. Using the spirit of sacrifice passed down from generation to generation since the founding of the country as the warp and the most modern attack weapon, the airplane, as the weft, the greatest and most magnificent scene is woven. At this critical moment of national rise and fall, it would be too plain if there were no special attack teams competing with ten thousand cherry blossoms in bloom to embellish it.

### The Last Telegram

At the foot of a tall hill, a horizontal cave opened up. This cave was where the air defense communications office was located. The night was deep, and Captain Ichihashi and the communications soldiers under his command were wholeheartedly trying to pick up the final telegram sent by the special attack aircraft. They were constantly turning the dial of the receiver. Several aircraft of the Zhenwu Special Attack Team, with Sergeant Watanabe's aircraft as the leader, had departed together at a certain hour and minute on the 27th, under the pale light of the full moon. It had been 0 hours now. "They must have reached the airspace over their targets by now?" Although it was a foreign country, it was bone-chillingly cold at night. Would these divine eagles who departed from the base in the deep night succeed? No one in the cave was without deep anxiety, and no one was without sincere hope. The communications soldiers were wearing headphones, concentrating and holding their breath, not moving their bodies.

Captain Ichihashi looked at the time and suddenly said in a low voice:

"Today's dawn attack by special attack aircraft is a first for this base. From here to Okinawa Island, it is more than 600 kilometers, and they must skillfully avoid enemy night patrol aircraft and annoying night fighters. This is really difficult for army pilots who are not used to flying over the ocean!"

However, although Sergeant Watanabe only took a small number of aircraft, the team members were all born as boy soldiers, and all had more than 1,300 hours of flight experience. Their skills were very skilled, and they were full of confidence.

"Here it comes!" Suddenly, a communications soldier broke the silence in the cave and shouted. The clock's pointer was exactly at 0:00. Squeak... Squeak... Squeak! Once the insect-like radio waves finished flowing, the information sent by the special attack aircraft could be heard clearly.

"We have broken through!" This was the last telegram sent by Corporal Takeda of the fourth aircraft.

At this time, they must have been facing the enemy's fierce anti-aircraft fire, bravely holding the guaranteed-hit giant bomb and rushing toward the enemy ship, determined to perish together.

Corporal Takeda's telegram ended just like that. He was a 23-year-old young man. Before his departure, he wrote these words in the reporter's autograph book: "We sincerely pray for the eternal glory of the motherland, and we are departing with the determination to hit the target."

Before the scheduled time of departure, the team members were either concentrating on investigating weather charts or studying the route to the airspace above the target. Their attitudes were so calm and relaxed, as if they were test flying, without any excitement. Only this pure spirit of loyalty, transcending all interests and desires, solely aiming to protect the motherland and dedicating oneself entirely, could enable the young team members to reach the enlightened state of life and death as one, like an ancient monk. When the reporter thought that the young warriors who had been chatting and laughing freely a few hours ago were now in a different world, he felt the harsh reality of war even more deeply.

Captain Ichihashi and the communications soldiers under his command were also quietly reminiscing about the young warriors who had ascended to heaven.

Silence once again dominated the cave. After about twenty minutes, the receiver received the final report from Sergeant Hashimoto of the second aircraft. That tragic, spiritual cry, through the weak radio waves, reached here.

"Do it! Do it!" A communications soldier shouted involuntarily.

Sergeant Hashimoto could be said to be the incarnation of fighting spirit, full of energy. When he departed on the 22nd, he took off from this base with Captain Kataoka, but had to turn back halfway due to engine trouble. "What a pity, I was one step behind the team leader and comrades, I have nothing to say!" He always said that since that day. Today, he departed for the second time. He sang his self-composed lyrics "Man and machine advance together, must-die-attack, non-stop non-promise aircraft carrier sunk," bravely crashing into the enemy ship, transforming into a ghost to protect the country, fulfilling his lifelong wish.

The headphones were almost pressing on the communications soldiers' ears, but they were still focusing all their attention on waiting for the telegram from the special attack aircraft. However, the aircraft of Sergeant Watanabe and the two corporals who had departed from the base together never made contact.

On this day, the special attack aircraft piloted by Corporals Takeda and Hashimoto sank an enemy aircraft carrier and a destroyer-like enemy ship near Okinawa Island. (Oyamada Reporting Team Member, translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, May 2)

### Construction Administration in the Past Two Months

— Xu Jidun

The implementation of a wartime system requires nothing more than simplifying administration. The principles of administrative simplification are none other than economizing on manpower and material resources. In the past, the city's Public Utilities Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and branch offices overlapped. Although the institutions were different, their uses were actually similar. For example, repairing roads and dredging rivers and canals are matters for the Public Works Bureau, but they involve public utilities; laying road tracks and installing electrical wires are matters for the Public Utilities Bureau, but they involve public works. In essence, they all fall within the scope of construction. Therefore, it is difficult to separate tasks, and authority is easily confused. Duplication and conflict are unavoidable. Not only are manpower and material resources uneconomical, but they also restrain each other and hinder progress. This is why the city's Public Works Bureau and Public Utilities Bureau were merged into the Construction Bureau.

Since the establishment of the Construction Bureau, I, Jidun, though not talented, have taken on the important task of Director. Where I have been appointed, I am aware that Shanghai's important status and large population mean that the need for construction projects such as public works and public utilities is more urgent than elsewhere. For example, water and electricity supply, factory machinery, land and water transportation, road administration, flood control, construction, gardens, and inspection services are all closely related to the lives of residents. If various construction policies can be smoothly promoted, the citizens will surely benefit from them. Otherwise, the harm caused would be unimaginable. However, construction is not an easy task, especially now that the war is raging and materials and funds are extremely scarce, and motorized tools are particularly difficult to obtain. I, Jidun, respectfully adhere to the principle of "treating the symptoms in times of urgency," first focusing on current needs without exaggeration, seeking truth from facts, and doing everything possible to accomplish what we can. I hereby present a brief account of the various facilities implemented in the past two months, hoping that the esteemed figures of Shanghai will provide guidance.

Adjusting the Bureau's Offices: The Bureau's offices were established during the time of the former Public Works Bureau and are distributed in the four districts of Northern Shanghai, Southern Shanghai, the city center, and Pudong. At that time, the work of the offices was specialized in public works. This time, the Bureau, in line with the principle of administrative simplification, has merged the Northern Shanghai Vehicle Registration Office and the Northern Shanghai Ship Registration Office, which were established by the Public Utilities Bureau, into the Northern Shanghai Office; the Southern Shanghai Vehicle Registration Office and the Southern Shanghai Ship Registration Office into the Southern Shanghai Office; and the Pudong Vehicle Registration Office into the Pudong Office. The Xuhui Vehicle Registration Office was expanded into an office that also handles public works. The scope of jurisdiction of each district has been clearly defined and has been implemented since April 1st.

Adjusting the Pier Management Offices: The Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek in the city are connected from north to south. The shoreline is long, and there are many piers. In the past, only one management office was set up to be in charge of the management of the piers, which was difficult to be effective. After the establishment of the Bureau, based on the actual needs, the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek area was divided into six sections: Southern Shanghai, the Bund, Eastern Suzhou, Central Suzhou, and Western Suzhou. A pier management office was set up in each section to facilitate nearby management. Since then, pier affairs have gradually become more organized, and efforts are being made to rectify them.

Electricity and Water Supply: Water and electricity are essential for the daily lives of citizens. If management is not thorough, it will have a major impact on social safety and the health of citizens. From the moment I took office, I strictly enforced the registration of electrical material merchants and contractors, as well as the inspection and acceptance of new electrical and water supply projects. I also sent personnel to inform citizens about safety management at all times. Recently, due to the reduction in water supply and the need for air defense, citizens have been digging earth wells and air defense wells. In order to guide and assist them, and to facilitate supervision and management, the Bureau has also formulated registration methods and announced their implementation. Street lights are closely related to nighttime traffic, air defense, and crime prevention. Since the Bureau took over the street lights in the old district, it has gradually rectified them and paid attention to repairs and maintenance. In order to assist in air defense, it has tried to reduce the light and the number of unnecessary street lights, which can also save electricity. In addition, the methods for citizens to report street light damage have been effective since their implementation.

Managing Mechanical Factory Operations: Since the city's electricity supply has been reduced repeatedly, many factories and public places have installed engines to solve the problem of power. Whether the installation is qualified has a significant impact on public safety. In order to ensure industrial safety and improve production efficiency, the Bureau believes that it is necessary to strengthen supervision. It has formulated supervisory rules and submitted them to the municipal government for official promulgation and implementation. It also stipulates that factories employing more than ten workers or using power must register with the Economic Bureau and have their internal equipment inspected by the Bureau. They may only use it after inspection and issuance of a permit. In addition, the investigation of industrial disasters and the improvement of factory equipment are also actively planned and implemented.

In the era of the former Public Works Bureau, training classes for mechanical technicians and boiler firemen were held with remarkable results. The Bureau is currently planning to resume them. As soon as preparations are complete, enrollment will be announced. (To be continued)

### Schools Should Not Have Summer Vacations

— Ping Shi

After reading Mr. Jiang's article "On Early Completion of Classes" in the Municipal Weekly, I feel it is very correct. In the current turbulent situation, studying for one day means gaining one day's worth of knowledge. If the situation changes suddenly, one will lose the opportunity to study. If we end classes early now and implement a three-semester system, continuing classes during the summer vacation, then the precious two months will not be wasted. Holding classes during the summer vacation is a worthwhile method to promote at present.

Some people may say, isn't it the same to study in cram schools or review lessons at home during the summer vacation? However, I have already experienced this. Reviewing lessons on one's own or attending cram schools is never as focused as attending regular classes, and the benefits are also less. Moreover, studying is so difficult now. If a three-semester system is implemented, one can graduate from middle school in four years instead of the original six years. Under the wartime system, everything should be swift and economical, especially the economy of time, which should be paid more attention to. The faster students are trained, the more talents there will be in society. Moreover, after the war, talents will be needed for construction. Therefore, even for the sake of the country, the students, and the teachers, it is beneficial and harmless.

We students have a very urgent desire to serve society. In my capacity as a student, I earnestly request that the education authorities be able to understand the students' studies and the teachers' lives today, and to consider and study the method of continuing classes during the summer vacation.

### Establishing Free Middle and Higher Schools

— Yao

The establishment of compulsory education in our country has a considerable history; however, it is mostly elementary schools, and there are also some free places in middle schools or universities. The purpose of establishing elementary schools is to eradicate illiteracy, but the establishment of free places in middle schools, especially universities, only has a rewarding effect; therefore, it does not greatly benefit young students who are ambitious to study but have poor families. When people talk about the education problem in our country, they all think that compulsory public schools should be widely established to eliminate illiteracy; however, on the other hand, the lack of specialized talents in higher education in our country cannot be ignored. Because our country, especially in the peace zone, will need a large number of specialized talents who have received middle and higher education in politics, economics, and construction to be the backbone of revitalizing the family and building the peace zone; so as to chase and compete with the world's powers.

It cannot be denied that the tuition fees of university education in our country, except for a few national colleges that charge lower fees, have made universities the exclusive domain of a few wealthy classes. Most of the young people who are truly willing to work hard are from poor families. They are unable to continue to afford it and have no choice but to go into society to make a living. Furthermore, although national colleges charge relatively low fees, they are still not suitable for young people who have to work while studying because of the daytime courses. Therefore, the author proposes that, in order to promote the level of national knowledge, or attached to various schools, this type of free autumn school should be national, provincial, or public. If the regular expenses are not enough, they should be subsidized by social groups and individuals; the subjects should be science-based, and the curriculum should be credit-based, divided into compulsory and elective subjects; classes should be held after 4 pm and before 9 am to suit the spare time of out-of-school youths; the number of elective credits should be specified for each semester, and graduation should be granted upon completion.

As for the professors hired by each college, they should emphasize practicality and not rely on false reputations; because there are some professors who have false reputations such as doctoral degrees, but their knowledge is not as refined and practical as scholars who have specialized research on a certain subject. If the environment permits, a famous scholar or expert from outside the school should be specially invited to give a public academic lecture for one hour every week; at the same time, a library should be added for students to consult outside, so that students can get twice the result with half the effort.

After the establishment of this kind of free middle and higher schools, not only can it enable ambitious out-of-school youths to have a place to continue their studies in their spare time, but also enable older people to have the opportunity to learn some new scientific knowledge. In this way, it can truly achieve the effect of changing customs and habits, and make the entire society and country have a new atmosphere and embark on the road of revitalizing China.

### After Reading "Baojia and Public Security"

— Jiang Yu

After reading Mr. Chen Binhe's article "Baojia and Public Security" (see the Shanghai Shenbao's replacement discussion on May 13), I have some thoughts; as Mr. Chen said: "Shanghai's situation will inevitably become more tense in the future" and "the flames of war may approach Shanghai." In this increasingly tense situation, how to strengthen the "basic organization of people's self-help, self-governance, and self-defense - Baojia work" is the top priority.

In the past few years, Baojia work has achieved remarkable results under the painstaking efforts of the authorities and the vigorous assistance of enthusiastic people (such as the establishment of organizational scale and service in various aspects), but it is also obvious that "the Baojia organization has not fully exerted its role in assisting public security."

I believe that in order to make Baojia healthy and consolidate public security, in addition to Mr. Chen's proposal to follow the principle of "those with money contribute money," the city's citizens must also "contribute their strength" to actively respond to various tasks, and especially the city's outstanding citizens must participate in various services, so that Baojia and the citizens are integrated, and they can assist in maintaining public security. Among them, it is especially hoped that the authorities can absorb as many outstanding youths from various regions as possible to participate in various Baojia services, because young people are full of vigor, vitality, and enthusiasm and purity. If they are allowed to assist their local Baojia work nearby, it will not only benefit the work, but also train the talents of the youth, which is beneficial to both. For example, the current "model team" and "special self-defense country" organizations of each Baojia have a small number of participants and are small in scale. In order to meet the needs of the future situation, the young and strong men in each Baojia area should be universally organized and given short-term training.

Also, the organization of "fire brigades" and "first aid teams" should be expanded urgently. This work has achieved some success, such as the Huangpu Branch's active training of professional youths, which can be a model for other districts. In order to adapt to the frequent air raids in the future, each Baojia district, as well as various groups, and institutions and schools, should immediately follow the example to carry out this training.

### Summer Hygiene Issues

— (Duanmu Qing)

Summer has arrived. In this densely populated Shanghai, I would like to mention a few points on hygiene issues for reference.

Strengthen Cleaning Work: It has recently started to rise, and in some places, the authorities always pay attention to finding ways to clean it up.

Review Food Hygiene: Meat, milk, and eggs contain more bacteria in summer. If you are not careful to check it, it is easy to cause illness. Those who review must absolutely break away from affection and strictly carry out inspections.

Eliminate Mosquitoes and Flies: Mosquitoes and flies have a strong breeding ability. In this early summer, we should take precautions and work with the Baojia institutions to launch a mosquito and fly extermination campaign. Eliminate dirty stagnant water (such as those accumulated on the roadside and in air-raid shelters).

Strive for Epidemic Prevention: Cholera, diphtheria, and other epidemic prevention injections have already begun, but there are still a large number of people who have not been injected. It is urgent to conduct spot checks on epidemic prevention certificates on the main roads and stations in the urban area in order to promote epidemic prevention injections.

Promote Health Education: The people of our country lack hygiene knowledge. The Health Bureau can send experienced propagandists to broadcast all the necessary common sense of summer hygiene on the streets or on the radio. The Chinese film authorities also have a film made that is both educational and meaningful, in order to instill hygiene knowledge in the general public.

### Opinions on Evacuation

— Liu Guiyuan

As this war is entering a decisive stage, the daily necessities of citizens are blocked due to the source; prices are soaring, and even make people feel unable to breathe. If this continues to evolve, it will be unimaginable. The municipal authorities are aware of this; they have set up an "Evacuation Committee" to handle evacuation matters, which can be said to be the top priority. However, the author believes that there are still a few points that are hoped for by the Evacuation Committee:

The Evacuation Committee has designated: "All citizens who want to leave Shanghai can register with their respective hometown associations..." This article is naturally not a problem for those who have hometown associations and participate in the hometown association organization; but I believe that it depends on whether there are hometown associations and those who have never participated in the hometown association organization. For this type of citizen, my opinion is that they should apply directly to the Evacuation Committee, without having to organize hometown associations or join the hometown association.

Regarding car and boat tickets, the Evacuation Committee should liaise with the station, shipping company authorities, and various travel agencies. Those holding "Evacuation Travel Permits" must queue separately to purchase tickets in order; and must not deliberately delay or make things difficult.

In addition to the photo or fingerprint of the person, the "Citizen Evacuation Travel Permit" should also have a column for carrying items, recording the number and nature of the luggage carried, for the military and police along the way to check at any time, whether it is consistent with what is stated. If there is any profit-seeking or forbidden item, it should be immediately detained and dealt with according to law.

Solve the transportation tools for evacuated citizens: ships are not a problem, please ask the Evacuation Committee to forward to China Railway to ask whether it can attach a 40-ton iron fence car to the ordinary train to carry the evacuated citizens.

In addition to applying for a "Citizen Evacuation Travel Permit", the household registration transfer certificate should also be handled at the joint insurance office in the area where they live. The certificate should also detail the items carried; so that it can be mutually verified with the "Citizen Evacuation Travel Permit" issued by the Evacuation Committee.

The Evacuation Committee should order those who intend to return to their hometown but are unable to do so to provide a Baojia certificate; and within the possible scope, they should seek a guarantor to testify, so as to assist them according to the situation.

### Relax Restrictions on Tap Water

The Shanghai Shenbao published a short comment on May 13th, "Restrictions on Tap Water Should Be Relaxed", calling on the tap water company to establish a more reasonable restriction standard according to the minimum needs of public life. This is a matter of urgency.

The amount of water must be increased to be reasonable for the following reasons:

Due to the longer days and shorter nights, the power supply needs are less, and the water demand not only cannot be reduced, but also increases due to the hot weather.

There are substitutes for electricity, and the substitute for water—well water—contains many bacteria and is not suitable for consumption. If the amount of water is insufficient, it will inevitably have to be used, which will hinder the "epidemic prevention" of the health authorities.

If you have to exceed the water limit, it is difficult to bear the huge fine. The residents once called on the newspaper, "They live in a lane with a total of seventeen households. Recently, they used water according to the minimum demand, and were fined more than 5 million, about several thousand yuan per person, which is really unbearable." This is the effect of the low limit.

There are many disputes between the landlord and the second and third tenants due to fines.

It is fortunate that the relevant authorities can understand the people and relax the restrictions on tap water.

### Correction

In the article "The Problem of Civil Servants' Treatment" published in this issue on May 12, there was a point that the treatment of the municipal government and the Finance Bureau's staff was particularly preferential. According to the investigation, the treatment of the municipal government's agencies has always been the same, and there is no difference. We hereby correct this. Editor.

### Under Mother's Knee, Morning and Evening

— Lin Yisong

Eight years! A few nights before my eldest brother's wedding, in the living room when Mother wasn't home, Father said these words to my eldest brother: "You cannot choose your own mother, but this time, I hope you choose the mother of your children on behalf of them."

I later learned that Father was quoting someone else's words. I was twelve years old at the time and remember that after Father finished speaking, everyone fell into deep thought. I didn't fully understand the meaning of Father's words to my eldest brother. The fireplace in the room was blazing, but I felt a chill in my heart.

Father was a construction engineer. The aesthetic demands of his profession meant that he was often away from home, working on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines. Whenever he came home, he would still pick up his teenage daughter and hug her. All the furniture in the house was of his own unique design. The tables and chairs had no sharp corners because he was afraid we would bump into them. Only a triangular cabinet had three corners, but it was placed in the corner of the wall, so it wouldn't be touched and also saved space.

Father loved his children so much, but apart from material comforts, we lived a very quiet life. Mother loved playing mahjong. She spent five or six days a week at friends' and relatives' houses "clattering away," and even on the one or two days she was home, she was still "clattering away." Moreover, her guests were always numerous, and although we saw Mother's face, we had no opportunity to get close to her. Sometimes, Mother would bring back coffee candies and balloons, which we would find on our pillows the next morning. Mother returned late at night, and we were already asleep. We might dream of Mother kissing us, perhaps as her lips were actually pressing against our cheeks.

After the war broke out, Father, my eldest brother and sister-in-law, Mother, and I scattered to three different places. Mother's "mahjong partners" mostly dispersed. I seized the opportunity to re-enter the scene and regain a mother.

I have only two great aspirations in my life: one is to practice medicine and the other is to teach and nurture talent. When I was studying medicine at university, I came home to "educate" my mother.

My maternal grandfather held the idea that "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue." Therefore, Mother only attended school for a very short time. However, most Chinese characters are pictographic or ideographic, and she was very intelligent, so she could generally read newspapers and letters, but she couldn't write herself. She could read the letters Father and my eldest brother sent from afar, but my replies weren't intimate enough for her, and she couldn't write herself. It was impossible for an adult, especially a housewife, to practice calligraphy every day. Her goal was only to learn to write the characters she needed to use. How could one tailor this teaching?

After Mother finished reading a letter, she would always say a few words. Although it was to herself, it was always to answer the meaning in the letter. I tried my best to preserve her tone and wrote a draft for her to copy. At first, she could only copy exactly, but later she gradually learned to change it according to her own meaning. Mother had a strong competitive spirit. She didn't want to show people her childish calligraphy. She copied like this for more than half a year before sending a letter to Father for the first time.

The family letters that Father and I exchanged were called official letters, numbered by date. The ones I sent were designated "Shanghai, Year XX, Number XX." Mother numbered the letters she wrote herself as "Special Number XX," regardless of the year. I thought the word "Special" was very well chosen, showing that she could already understand implicitly, without needing to be told.

After that, I no longer drafted letters for her. She wrote letters only once or twice a month. Her interest in writing grew, and she felt she had too few opportunities to practice, so she learned to keep accounts and write a diary. At first, she also copied from drafts I wrote for her, just like with the letters. When I came home from school, I would hold a pen and listen to her describe the daily chores and financial transactions. Later, she could write herself, and I only corrected her diary and checked her accounts. To facilitate balancing the accounts, she also learned abacus calculation. She was simply better than me at calculating weights and measures. She was used to mental arithmetic in the market, so mental arithmetic plus the abacus was naturally better than just the abacus alone.

Mother only recorded one thing in her diary each day. A description of her method and results for drying broad beans was one entry. When her aunt came, she would put together related events to write an entry, seemingly compiling and recording the diary entries in her mind that she had not written down before. Each day, she could independently create an entry. I once revised a few entries for her and published them under her name in the food, clothing, housing section and family monthly of the Shen Bao newspaper. She was very happy to see them and cut them out to send to Father. Father's reply contained a great deal of joy in its words of encouragement, and even included me: "Such a home tutor, adapting to local conditions, is truly rare, truly rare!"

When Father was in Shanghai, we had four servants at home to serve us four people, the master, mistress, young master, and young miss. Later, my mother and I hired one "big sister" servant. Finally, Mother even let the big sister go, and although she took over the household duties herself, it became quite well organized. Mother would get up before dawn, first going to cultivate a corner of the terrace. It was her garden. She used soap boxes filled with soil to grow plants and also raised a few hens. Mother naturally had an interest in gardening. I remember that when I was little, the courtyard at home was full of all kinds of flowers and plants, and Mother often tended to them herself. Now, she probably felt that resources were scarce and that it wasn't easy to come by food, so she couldn't afford to grow flowers and only grew beans, melons, and vegetables, etc. She often laughed and said it was an experiment for future farming when they returned to their homeland. Fortunately, she watered and fertilized regularly, and she actually had quite a harvest. Half-a-kilogram pumpkins and handfuls of string beans were all part of the harvest. Even if she only harvested six beans from ten soybean plants, she felt it was a good harvest. Mother said, "The terrace doesn't have the earth's essence. It's good enough to see them grow!"

I was studying medicine, so I naturally read magazines on medical health. There were often relatively simple articles in them, and Mother could understand them and apply them in her daily life. She remembered the importance of Vitamins A, B, C, and D and the kinds of foods they could be found in. She often used pickled vegetables to accompany meals because she said they were "life-saving vegetables." Of course, she varied the cooking methods to avoid becoming bored. When tomatoes were in season, she ate them as fruit because tomatoes contain a large amount of Vitamin C, and cooking would destroy it, so they should be eaten raw…

Mother sometimes goes out to play mahjong now, but it is only once in a while and not the kind of day-and-night obsession she used to have. When the time comes, she naturally comes home. She remembers she has household duties to attend to, and that household duties can maintain her sense of responsibility, and that is enough.

In the past, we had a flower room and three reception rooms, but I was very afraid of friends or classmates coming to visit because the person most closely related to the family seemed to be my mother, but where was my mother? She wasn't home! The house was cold and desolate. When I returned from school, I either didn't see her or went to look for her. When she was home, it was all "clatter clatter." When my classmates heard it, they would spread their hands on the table and ask me if I knew how to play. I was extremely embarrassed. It wasn't a home, it was either a wasteland or a club. How could it be considered a home? Now it's different. Come on over! In our bedroom, which also serves as a living room, Mother sits on the bed making clothes. I sit on a small stool by the bed, knitting wool. We chat and laugh. When you come, I'll help Mother make some snacks for you to eat!

When I spend my mornings and evenings at my mother's knee, I am truly a very childish adult. I don't pretend at all. It is completely natural. I have only received true maternal love for five or six years. Isn't it normal for five- or six-year-old children, especially girls, to cling to their mothers' clothes and sit on their laps?

### Memories of Bygone Days

— Qiu Ping

Time passes like lightning; in the blink of an eye, when pomegranate flowers are red, it is the middle of summer. This summer is not as hot as in the past. The sunlight does not scorch the skin as much, so this summer is like the Spring Festival of old, and everywhere in the universe is full of vitality and excitement. In this season of lush green foliage, fragrant grasses, and singing birds, there is an even greater sense of vigor. The times are constantly changing, and life is also constantly changing, drifting like floating clouds, changing unpredictably. In this universe, a small me has also changed from a student to someone who sits at a desk and lives a salaried life. Every day I do the same monotonous, meaningless work, and sometimes when I think about it alone, I feel an indescribable sense of melancholy and annoyance, as if ants are crawling in my heart. Memories of the past, when all my classmates gathered together, laughing and joking, indelible images are often imprinted in my mind. Now we have all parted ways, and I am all alone. Whenever I think of this, sadness and loneliness fill my heart.

One morning, in the faint light of dawn, I suddenly remembered that yesterday at school, everyone had agreed to meet at seven o'clock this morning and go to the park together. I immediately jumped out of bed. After settling myself, I hurriedly put the things I had prepared yesterday – bread, fruit, a small knife, a ball, etc. – into my bag. I hurriedly ran to the designated meeting place. Several classmates were already there. As it neared seven o'clock, all the classmates had arrived. Everyone rode their bicycles. The breeze was blowing, and I felt very cool and comfortable. Everyone felt very happy along the way. Before long, we arrived. Because it was a holiday, many students were already there enjoying themselves. We were just like birds out of their cages, monkeys freed from their chains, jumping and running, all delighted. Two or three close friends and I lay back on the natural green carpet, listening to the singing of the birds. The fragrance of flowers was carried into our nostrils by the breeze. By then, the sun was almost directly overhead. Patches of purple and red floating clouds dotted the blue sky, drifting like duckweed in flowing water, their changes unpredictable. For a while, it looked like a beautiful painting. For a while, it looked like a flock of sheep. For a while, it looked like celestial maidens scattering flowers, leisurely. The beauty of nature could never be created by human power. We enjoyed this magnificent scenery while eating the snacks and fruit we had brought. Everyone was free and carefree, as if we were in paradise. After everyone finished eating, one classmate suggested climbing the hill, and everyone agreed. Talking and laughing, our sweat soaked our skin. The scorching sunlight was constantly drawing moisture from every part of our bodies. Our skin reacted to the sunlight by emitting heat. We hid under a group of trees. It was very quiet and cool there. Next to the woods was a small pond. The azure sky and the clear water reflected each other, and the reflections in the water included small mountains, trees, and natural colors, all arranged very evenly. The water was as clear as glass, and you could see all the way to the bottom, where many fish were swimming leisurely. Time seemed to pass too quickly. The sun was gradually sinking towards the horizon. We continued to climb the hill, and the clouds in the sky, like human emotions, changed from pure white to light yellow, golden, and even fiery red. The azure sky gradually turned dark blue. Dusk had enveloped the earth. Twilight was approaching. Slender stars peeked out from the clouds, twinkling. The sky was gradually darkening, but the beauty of nature revealed its enchanting magic even more, making people reluctant to leave. But that was when we had to leave together. We left the park, and everyone said goodbye and went their separate ways. The lamplight illuminated our shadows as we walked home.

Recalling this, everything around me seems strangely silent and lonely. I really don't know how to settle down.

### Accusation

— Huang Sha

In this era, our emotions are too complicated. It is this surging tide that is reflected in the fervor of our responses. It is this changing human condition that stimulates our pure hearts. There are several changes in one day, and a different feeling every minute.

Perhaps I am too sensitive, or perhaps my life has been marked by hardship, or perhaps I take everything too seriously, or perhaps my demands on the environment are too harsh, or perhaps my life is too focused on mental labor, with the spiritual far exceeding the material. Because of all these reasons, my emotions are trapped in a constant and fierce struggle.

This fierce struggle arises from this complicated era, with its complex contradictions. These contradictions are not simply emotional issues, nor are they simply rational issues. Many think that reason is good and can be used to restrain emotions, while many think that emotions can be developed freely. But the reality is not so simple.

What I long for and praise is what I am separated from and say goodbye to, and you don't even utter a half-sentence of comfort in my dreams. What I admire and revere is limited by reality, and I cannot possibly allow you to express your feelings and attachments. I miss old friends, and I miss the past I struggled through. Old friends are gone without a word, and the past has turned to ashes, falling into emptiness and sadness.

Facing reality, I must summon the courage to live, for food, for coping, for survival. Just for the sake of such small individual material needs, I have consumed my youth and my time.

A job is meant to solve the problem of living. Now, I am in a position that is quite interesting and in line with my aspirations. I once vowed to dedicate myself to this career. To this day, this vow remains unchanged. I seem to have gained some technical skills over time, but it is still so far from what I originally wanted!

The most tragic thing is being restricted by reality. The way I look at all problems should be black, but now it must be white. Something that is actually good is smeared with the stain of evil. For someone who is worldly, this is nothing. But for someone with a full heart of passion, even if they try to control themselves with "calm reason," and reluctantly write what they dare not believe, this contradictory psychology is constantly destroying that originally pure heart and replacing it with "an empty, indifferent ghost lacking a sense of justice"?

How can this be willingly accepted?

The truth is most correct. The official must require you to do so, and you must not reveal your worries. Too much doubt and confusion is detrimental. – This is also a theory, a realistic view that is the final conclusion.

But the problem does not end there. In addition to a good job, there are many other trivial life problems. Solving the issues of food, clothing, housing, and transportation is enough to add countless worries to a salaried worker. The seasons in the city are constantly changing, and the material desires of the city are also terrible. Living in the city, one must spend all of their energy trying to seize material pleasures.

Will the passion of childhood and the beautiful dreams grow old along with the wrinkles on my forehead?

Am I sinking into the mud of personal gain, just to kneel before the old society for such narrow interests?

How can this be willingly accepted?

Love, hate, new, old, truth, heresy, career, future…

All kinds of inseparable contradictions are intertwined to form the emotions of young people in this era. Young people struggling in these contradictions are in an extremely sharp struggle every day, every hour. Therefore, excitement, frustration, joy, sorrow, hope, despair, confusion, hesitation, wandering… there are dozens of changes in a day, and the mood is different every minute?

If the bowstring of emotion is stretched too tight, it will break one day. The torrent of contradictions buried in the heart will burst one day.

At that time, perhaps it will be the day this era is destroyed.

### Dust

— Shi Ting

Huimin lazily went to play chess, stopping at the doorway. He unintentionally glanced at the portrait of Jiang Shang pasted on the door, covered in dust, and couldn't help but shudder. That wizened face coldly stared at him in the dim light. Having lived here for so many years, he suddenly realized the gloominess and loneliness of this house. A beam of sunlight poured in through the dusty skylight, dust sparkling, rising and falling. In the corner, a white-haired cat curled up, twitching its whiskers, squinting at him, as if questioning, "Why do you disturb my afternoon nap?" The air was filled with a heavy incense smoke. Huimin thought:

"The old man is smoking!" So, he gently knocked on the door, subconsciously holding his ears to listen.

An old cough answered him.

"Father..." He opened the door and hesitantly walked towards the antique rattan couch.

"Father..."

"Speak your mind!" His father replied in a沉着 voice. The pale yellow lamplight reflected on his ashen face, appearing gloomy and imposing.

Huimin shuddered again, stammering:

"I was thinking of leaving for Suzhou tomorrow or the day after..."

"Hmm..."

"There's a job opportunity there!" Hesitating, the son took a letter from his pocket and presented it to his father, adding, "Sent by an old classmate."

The old man stared blankly at the letter, seemingly looking but not seeing. After a long silence, he suddenly shouted sternly, "Your appearance doesn't look like you can handle official affairs! Wearing a collar, a sleeping cap, and slippers, loafing around all day, lazy, greedy, and addicted to gambling! What can you do if you go there!"

Huimin stood as straight as a soldier on parade. He secretly took off his sleeping cap.

"Is there someone there named Li?" the old man asked slowly.

"He's an old classmate," the son bowed and said, "How would I dare deceive you, old man?"

"You wouldn't dare deceive me? You think I don't understand your thoughts! These past few days, your heart has been restless again, thinking about going outside for good things! A father knows his son best, how could I not see through you? If you want to go, then go!"

"Father..." He rubbed his hands, not knowing what to say. The old man closed his eyes, indicating, "Anything you say after this is in vain!"

Silence! The bamboo mat was heavy, the room gloomy, and the smoke lamp flickered with dim light.

"I was thinking..." Huimin tried to pick up the thread of the conversation.

"You're thinking, you're thinking of asking me for money, aren't you?" The old man's eyes were like two headlights on a car.

Huimin was stunned and knelt before the couch:

"Father! Please, give me another chance! This time I go out, I will definitely work hard. After waiting at home for so long, I have completely realized my past mistakes..."

He didn't know what tone to use to express what he wanted to say next. In this kind of situation, how difficult is it to confess your heart? If you treat it indifferently, he'll say you don't take repentance seriously; if you cry and wail, looking very sad, he'll think you're being hypocritical. Huimin sobbed for a while and then lowered his head—silence is golden, he understood his father's psychology.

Huimin walked lightly downstairs. A novelist might describe his mood like this: like the earth caressed by the warm morning sun. He stopped halfway at the corner.

"Amin, buy the ticket and come back!" the old man instructed.

"Don't worry, old man!" He pursed his lips at the mottled black door and stepped into his bedroom.

His wife excitedly greeted him, asking:

"Did Father agree?"

"Yes!" Huimin patted the banknotes in his pocket; "I'll go buy the ticket right away."

"I say... I say that this time you go out, you must be single-minded in your work..." His wife put on his leather shoes for him, nagging him.

"Why do you have to nag so much? Don't you trust me?"

"It's not that I don't trust you," his wife sighed, "You know the suffering that you, I, and the children have endured these past few years..."

Huimin silently walked towards the mirror, buttoning his collar.

"Suffering and humiliation torment us!" his wife continued, "You and I have lost that passionate vitality we had when we first got married..."

Two pairs of eyes stared at the wedding photo hanging next to the mirror.

"The children have also suffered innocently, and shadows have gripped their young and weak hearts!" She began to sob: "I remember when we first came out of college..."

Two pairs of eyes then shifted to the academic photo hanging on the other side.

"We imagined our married life to be so bright!" She collapsed into Huimin's arms.

"A bright life is about to begin!" He stroked his wife's soft hair: "You know I'm not a fool! Foolishness only occupied my mind for a moment, at that time, delusions tempted me, and lust boiled in my blood! But once that moment passed, wasn't I still the same as I was ten years ago? I love you, I love our children! The pain almost made me wish I was dead!"

"Huimin! It's better if you don't go!" His wife hugged him tightly: "When you are by my side, I feel a kind of strength that makes me trust you. But don't get angry; when you leave me, I feel afraid, I'm afraid that moment will come again, that delusions will tempt you!"

"Don't doubt it, I will definitely do a good job this time!" Huimin said, "I want to rescue you and the children from suffering and leave this gloomy and lonely house!"

The following dialogue involves trivial matters, such as luggage, hats, etc. I will not record them word for word.

At four o'clock, Huimin went out fully dressed. He went out the back door and then turned back. He listened for a while at the bottom of the stairs and then secretly went to the kitchen. He took a bowl from the cupboard, wiped it with the hem of his clothes, and threw down two dice—to test his luck.

"Damn it, why did I have to do that?" He left angrily.

Just as Huimin threw the two dice, his wife collapsed on the bed. She sobbed, muttering to herself excitedly. She thought about how to encourage him again when Huimin returned.

Soon, she gradually fell asleep. When she woke up, the clock pointed to half-past seven. Darkness was already peeking through the window, and she couldn't help but shiver—he hadn't returned yet.

After dinner, the old man called her in. He asked her if Huimin had come back.

She replied, appearing very calm:

"He has already come back, and the ticket has been bought. He went to see a friend just now, probably to discuss work matters."

The old man looked at her suspiciously, cursed a few times, and told her to have Huimin come to see him immediately when he returned.

Then she returned to the bedroom and looked out the window, as if waking up from a nightmare. Huimin was wearing only a thin undershirt, barefoot, walking slowly outside the door. He reached out his hand—that hand that had repeatedly exchanged delusions for disillusionment—knocking on the back door.

"Forgive me one more time!" Seeing his wife stick her head out, he pleaded. The cold chilled him to the bone, and he shivered incessantly.

Now, delusions are exchanged for disillusionment; hope only blossoms in dreams. A moment of destruction; two people, one still waiting! This day is like dust: rising from darkness, and sinking back into darkness. And this life is like this day: hope and disillusionment...

Huimin cannot escape this gloomy and lonely house. His wife secretly let him in, and he tiptoed to the bedroom and fell on the bed.

"Is this a trap you created, in order to deceive the old man?" his wife asked crying, shaking his body. He didn't say a word, just...

Naturally, he didn't need to answer; he had woven a trap for himself and then put it on his own head, imprisoning himself in this gloomy and lonely house!

### Roundtable Ping Pong, an Interesting Sport Worth Promoting

— Qian Xucang

Mr. Xucang is an educator, but his contributions to the sports world are also considerable. Like the introduction of the center ball and the invention of the round door ball, he has added a noteworthy page to sports history. Recently, he has been studying "roundtable ping pong." This sport is quite novel and very interesting. Below are his writings on roundtable ping pong, which will surely be welcomed by enthusiasts. - Editor

It happened two years ago. I happened to see a foreign scientific magazine at a friend's place and unintentionally discovered a somewhat blurry photograph of roundtable ping pong. Under the photograph, a short article was printed, which aroused my interest at the time. However, the explanation was too simple, and no rules were attached, which was regrettable. After some time, this interesting matter was completely forgotten. In recent months, Shanghai's economy has been declining, and some amateur leisure spots seem to be gradually withering due to malnutrition. Ping pong rooms or billiard rooms have replaced them. Especially ping pong, which is popular everywhere and at its peak. This made me recall roundtable ping pong. One day, I talked with senior figures in the sports world, Mr. Zhou Jiaqi, Mr. Zhang Baokui, and pioneers in the ping pong world, Chen Linsheng and Gusheng, about introducing roundtable ping pong to sports enthusiasts in Shanghai. They all expressed their full support, so I increased my determination to introduce and design it. In fact, I am not qualified for the job of designing this item. Because I have never met this roundtable ping pong before, nor do I know its family history. I only vaguely recognized its face in a photograph, and I only knew that a new toy had been produced in that part of the world. Now that I'm seriously introducing it, I can only rely on my own imagination to create new content for it and set temporary rules. Although there is bound to be the saying that "oranges become trifoliate oranges when transplanted north of the Huai River," it is no small matter to give sports enthusiasts in Shanghai another fun tool for recreation in their spare time. Fortunately, this is just a sports anecdote, and there is no lack of precedent for revising the rules in the future, so I took some time to roughly define the scale. If someone can put it into practice and revise any inconsistencies at any time, that would be my greatest hope.

### I. Equipment Installation

Among ball sports, the equipment for ping pong can be considered simple. Just prepare a table, net, racket, net frame, and ball, and you can play ping pong enthusiastically. Then the equipment and installation of roundtable ping pong are not complicated either.

(A) Round Ping Pong Table

The surface can be made of any material, but it must be smooth and elastic. The standard of elasticity is that a standard ball dropped from a height of 30.5 cm from the surface should have an average elasticity of 20.3 cm to 22.9 cm. The radius of the round surface is 1.3725 meters. The height of the surface from the ground is 0.762 meters. The installation of the surface must be level. All of the table legs should be painted in non-reflective black. The periphery of the round table surface should be painted with a white border line 1.9 cm wide from the edge. For three-person roundtable ping pong, the round table should be divided into three equal fan shapes, each fan shape having an arc of 120 degrees, each central angle also being 120 degrees, and three equal radii also being painted with 1.9 cm wide white lines. If it is four-person roundtable ping pong, then the round table is divided into four equal fan shapes, each fan shape having an arc length and central angle of 90 degrees, and the original three radii are of course changed to two, mutually perpendicular diameters.

(B) Ping Pong Columns

The columns are not limited by material. Three-person roundtable ping pong uses four columns, one installed in the center of the round area, and three installed on the circumference at equal distances. The top of the column is 17.1 cm above the table surface, and the column should be at right angles to the surface. The diameter of the cross-section of the column is 1.9 cm. The column feet cannot extend horizontally beyond the table surface. Four-person ping pong uses a total of five columns, one installed in the center of the circle, and the remaining four installed at four equal points on the circumference. The height and thickness of the columns are the same as the three-person system.

(C) Ping Pong Net

The three-person net has a total of three strips, each extending from the central ping pong column to the ping pong column on the circumference, diagonally dividing the round table surface into three equal sections. The four-person net has a total of four strips, and the installation method is the same as the three-person system, vertically dividing the round table surface into four equal sections. The width of the net is 17.2 cm. The color of the net should be white. The mesh should be 1.9 cm square. The upper edge of the net should be sewn with a 1.9 cm wide colored net edge. The two ends of the net should be tightly attached to the top of the ping pong columns so that the upper edge of the net is level.

(D) Ball and Racket

The ball and racket are exactly the same as those described in the ordinary ping pong rules, so I will not repeat them.

### II. Rules

Roundtable ping pong is derived from the original ordinary ping pong, and the rules it uses are of course largely similar to the original rules, but due to the different shapes, positions, equipment installations, and number of people, some places cannot be exactly the same. Now, the different places are listed below.

(A) Three-Person Elimination System

This is a game that provides for three people to play at the same time. Below are a few points that differ from ordinary ping pong:

1. (Position) The positions where the three people should stand are determined by drawing lots. The first place can choose a good position and the right to serve. The second place can choose the second-best position, and the remaining position belongs to the third place.

2. (Scoring) Ordinary ping pong rules use a scoring system. Three-person roundtable ping pong should change to a point-loss system due to the triangular league relationship. The first of the three to lose 11 points is considered to have lost a game. If two people or two people lose 10 points each at the same time, then the person who loses two more points should be the first to lose a game.

3. (Serve) The person who wins the right to serve is the server, and the remaining two are the receivers. The server first throws the ball up and hits it with the racket, so that the ball bounces up within his area and then crosses the net and falls into any of the left and right areas, which is called a serve. The right to serve next time is won by the person who loses points each time.

4. (Receive) The person receiving the ball can return the ball to any of the left and right two areas, but cannot send it to the same area three or more times in a row. By way of example: the first time A gives to B, B can also return it to A the first time, the second time A can give it to B again, B can also return it to A the second time, the third time A cannot give it to B again, he must give it to C, otherwise A and B will play until dawn, and C will wait until dawn, wouldn't that be a joke.

5. (Elimination) The three, A, who first loses 11 points, is eliminated and counts as third place. The remaining two, because they cannot play roundtable ping pong, determine the level of the name based on the number of points lost. The one with fewer points lost is first place, and the one with the next fewest is second place. If, when the first person is eliminated, the remaining two people have exactly the same points, then calculate the last point lost by the two people. Whoever loses this point last is first.

(B) Four-Person Elimination System

Regarding the rules of the four-person elimination system, such as position, scoring, serve, and elimination, they are the same as the three-person elimination system, only slightly changing the scope of the ball. The four-person system cannot send to the same area two or more times in a row. Because the number of people increases by one, the opportunity to send the ball also increases by one area, and the scope of attack expands. It is very beneficial to the attacking side. From the perspective of defending, the larger the area, the more difficult it is to defend, and there is an uneasy psychology of everyone being in danger. Naturally, the number of times to send to the same area cannot exceed two or more times. According to an example: the first time A gives to B, B can also return it to A the first time, the second time A cannot give it to B again, it must be given to C or D.

(C) Four-Person Doubles System

Doubles is a game of confrontation between two people as a group. The positions and the right to serve chosen by both sides are determined by drawing lots. If the group that wins the draw is willing to be the server or receiver, then the other side has the right to choose the position. If the winner of the draw is willing to choose the position, then the other side has the right to decide whether to be the server or receiver first. However, when the winner of the draw is willing, he can still give the priority of choice to his opponent. The standing positions of the remaining two people form a straight line facing each other. The serving rules are the same as before, and the target of the shot is of course to attack the two enemies on the left and right, but when necessary, it can also be shot into the area of the teammate on the opposite side, in order to rest and wait for an opportunity to enter directly. However, it is not allowed to shoot twice or more in a row into the area of the same team. The scoring method adopts a scoring system, which is the opposite of the previous section. Whoever scores 11 points first wins a game. Two wins determine the outcome. The right to serve adopts a rotating system, which is the same as the ordinary ping pong rules, so I will not repeat it.

### III. Advantages

The rules of roundtable ping pong are different from ordinary ping pong, so it naturally has its advantages and disadvantages. Now, I will list a few points below:

1. Roundtable ping pong is a game that three or four people play together, which can indirectly cultivate keen intelligence, because when facing enemies on two or three sides, you must be careful to defend at all times. The attacker must always peek at the enemy's gap and launch a surprise attack, while the defender must also always peek at the direction of the attack and implement the defense. Both sides seek survival in this tense environment, and the habit of wit is cultivated invisibly.

2. In all sports or games, both sides rely on strength, wit, and opportunity to compete. Often, if the strength of the three is very different, they will not be interested, and at the same time, the weaker party rarely has a chance to win. Like chess games, everything depends on strength and wit. A person whose strength and wit are not as good as the opponent's can almost be said to have no possibility of victory. The strength of roundtable ping pong is not like ordinary games. Even a person who has no experience can barely cope with it. The use of opportunities is more than in ordinary ping pong, and the use of opportunities is equal. When the strength of the two sides is very different, they can often use the luck of "bumping into a corner" to catch the opponent off guard. Therefore, I believe that roundtable ping pong has a more mass-oriented performance than ordinary ping pong.

3. Roundtable ping pong is quite common in Chinese families, because there are few families in China with large western-style tables, but round table surfaces are very common. In large families, if you need to add a round table surface, you may as well add a two-sided round table ping pong table (painted for three people on the front and painted for four people on the back), and have fun after dinner.

The so-called learning mahjong is more beneficial. As for the number of participants, it is more than ordinary ping pong, which is naturally also a good thing.

### IV. Disadvantages

1. Because roundtable ping pong is limited by the narrow area, it is often impossible to make a powerful long shot when hitting the ball, so you cannot use the wonderful hitting methods unique to ordinary ping pong. Ordinary ping pong focuses on long straight shots, while roundtable ping pong uses left and right arc shots. Long shots are enjoyable, but arc shots lack strength.

2. Because roundtable ping pong is narrow in many positions, the chances of touching the net and committing suicide and going off-road are more than in ordinary ping pong. Three or five rounds, that is, broken, lack of interesting continuity, which will reduce the interest of the players.

3. The attacking and defending area of both sides is fan-shaped, with the front sharp and the back closed. Many attacking and defending stunts, such as forehand and backhand shots, emergency rescues at the bottom, and chops, cannot be applied. Therefore, the skills of the players become boring and simplified.

The above only uses my knowledge of a little experience in ordinary ping pong to give roundtable ping pong new content, and design it at will, which is naturally inevitable with the drawback of building a car behind closed doors. As for the rules, I can only list the main points here, and the details will be printed in another book. I hope that ping pong, seniors, and those who have special interest in roundtable ping pong, can correct them at any time in the experiment. At the same time, I hope that schools, youth associations, and ping pong rooms can take the lead in promoting it. If there are any questions, you can discuss them.

### Basketball League B Group Branch Champions Produced A Bird's-Eye View of the Strength of Each Team

— (Skinny Reporter)

There are a total of forty-nine heroic divisions participating in this year's Basketball League B Group, divided into seven parts, each with seven teams. After the branch champions are produced first, the B Group champions will then adopt an elimination system to hold the finals to determine who will be the B Group overall champion. However, the Sixth Strong Division of B Group withdrew temporarily the day before the opening, so only forty-eight teams participated in the competition, resulting in the branch schedule. Since the curtain was opened on March 21, after two months of competition, the champions of each group have been produced by yesterday afternoon. The bureau will soon convene the teams to draw lots to hold the overall finals. Now I will introduce the strength of each branch champion.

### First Group Feidui (Flying Team)

Feidui is mostly composed of the Zhao brothers, and the Liu generals of the Yijia Ban (Suitable Family Team) are comparable to the Hua Nan brothers. The team has a ball rack in their private house, so they practice day and night, and their cooperation skills are excellent. However, because they are all young, their strength may not be enough. However, with the guidance of Xu Zhitai, a veteran of basketball, they will definitely continue to work hard and give full play to their abilities at that time.

### Second Group Longhua

Longhua has been established for a considerable amount of time, and its record is above the standard. Many of the team members are alumni of the former Guoguang Middle School, so their foundation is very good. Zhang Jin and Ma Canxi have been guided by them successively, which makes them even more outstanding. Chen and Chen Zhengmiao are especially outstanding, and they have ambitions for the overall championship.

### Third Group Feima (Flying Horse)

The members of Feima team are very progressive and work hard, so they were able to win the championship of this group, which is by no means accidental. The team's forward Wu Junkui shoots very well, and the guard has unique features. The team's overall skills seem to be slightly inferior, but with their hard-working spirit, they may achieve unexpected results.

### Fourth Team, Youlu

Youlu team members, such as Lin Hongci and Wang Yuguang, are already quite renowned in the basketball world and naturally possess a superior level of experience. Their future prospects depend on this experience, which is more valuable than their skills alone. However, basketball games also heavily rely on experience; therefore, this team holds great promise.

### Fifth Team, Chengfu

The Chengfu team is organized by employees of the Chengfu Company. They participate in every league match and have never forfeited. Therefore, their previous records were mediocre. Lately, through repeated competitions, they have made significant progress. This time, winning the division championship truly rewards their hard work. The author greatly admires the team's commendable spirit. Although they may not have high hopes for the overall championship, this achievement is already a source of pride.

### Sixth Team, Blue Team

The Blue Team luckily defeated the Xinxie team yesterday, winning the sixth division championship. Certain members like Shi Qiaokui and Zhu Zhonglin are indeed respected figures in the banking sector. Others like Xu Kun and Wu Han are emerging talents. Combining new and experienced players in one team allowed them to achieve this result. After participating in the finals, they should give a superior performance.

### Seventh Team, Zhenyuan

The Zhenyuan team is organized by colleagues from the Zhenyuan Pawnshop, led by Weng Wen. They consistently practice in their spare time, so their skills improve rapidly. Within the second division groups, they can already be considered outstanding. Whether it's individual technique or teamwork, they are remarkable and are undoubtedly a promising team.

Looking at all seven teams, many are up and comers, that if they meet later, and each put forth their best effort, their performance will be fresh and attention grabbing.

### Guest Team Performance During the Finals

It is recently learned that during the second division finals, the Basketball League veteran referees team will participate as guest performers. It is also heard that the Ligang basketball team will participate in a three-way exhibition. The Ligang team is organized by staff of the *Li Bao* sports section. Team members such as Dongfeng, Lü Cheng, Hongchen, Shi, Qiu Shigong, Huang Di, Ma Ye, and Mei Jie are all veteran players. The Ligang team has now been established and is actively training, so there will definitely be many highlights at that time.

### Volleyball League Registration Deadline – Hope for Enthusiastic Participation from All Teams

This year's volleyball league, due to venue issues, will move from indoors to outdoors. The author has always felt that as long as there's no wind, outdoors is far better than indoors, because development is easier, especially when saving the ball. Therefore, I predict that this year's competition will be much more intense and the standard will certainly improve significantly. However, to date, the number of teams registering is not very high. For the A teams, there are Zhongbei, White Team, and Sanxing, etc. It is uncertain whether the Russian community team and the Soviet team can be formed. Regarding the women's teams, the Yuan team and the Zhi team both have issues. Sanxing and Huayan have already registered. Today is the last day for registration, and it is hoped that all volleyball teams will enthusiastically participate, so that this year's volleyball league will achieve even better results due to being held outdoors.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (20)

— Liang Zhao'an

The positional attack method is a relatively slow tactic, hence it is also generally known as a slow attack method. It is the second type of tactic adopted when a fast break is not possible. Its advantage lies in short-distance passing, which is strong and healthy, able to lure opponents, wait for opportunities to advance, and can be repeated. Therefore, it is most suitable for teams with lower skill levels, older players, teams experiencing fatigue, and for breaking the five-man zone defense. However, its weakness lies in initiating the attack. For example, when using a central breakthrough, the ball is bounced off the ground, rebounding near the opponent's center's feet and passed to a teammate running diagonally forward, allowing them to catch the ball ahead of the opponent on the free-throw line, then turn around and pass it to a teammate running forward along the sidelines for a shot, or dribble up themselves to score. If all three methods fail, the ball is passed back to the guard, who then seeks another opportunity to attack.

If using a sidelong sneak attack method, the ball is passed to a teammate running along the sideline, allowing them to turn their back to block the opponent while passing the ball back to the guard, leaving an open path for the guard to dribble forward and shoot, or pass to two teammates running forward toward the center and the corner for a shot. If this method is also blocked by the opponent, the ball is passed back to the guard again, the position is shifted, and a third attack is launched.

At this time, it may be changed to an outside attack and inside response tactic. The center moves to the basket, and the two forwards line up with them on the baseline. The two guards pass the ball to each other outside. When the opponent is not paying attention, the two forwards lead the defenders forward and try to block them, leaving the center open under the basket. The guard then uses an overhead pass to pass the ball to the center, who jumps up to score, ideally tipping it in mid-air.

If the opposing defense is strong and there is no room to maneuver, and we have a higher score, then we can stop attacking and use a stalling tactic, using an outside mutual passing method to preserve our lead.

In fact, the positional attack method is not unable to defeat the "man-to-man" defense, but the battle situation has fewer changes and is not as popular with the audience as other tactics. Especially when using the stalling tactic, commonly known as "short on mahjong". Therefore, in this situation, the audience often shouts "open a soda," disliking the boring lack of excitement.

Positional attack tactics do not often involve rapid attacks. Usually, after the team gains possession of the ball, it is given to the two guards to dribble forward, or one person dribbles while the other follows to protect, or two people use short-distance mutual passing to cross the center line, waiting for an opportunity to attack. The two forwards quickly run to the corners on the side, drawing the opponent to disperse the defensive line, while the center moves to the free-throw line or near the sideline and free-throw line extension, in order to arrange the formation and indicate who will start the attack.

Once the positional attack is set up, the task of luring the enemy can begin. The two guards constantly pass the ball back and forth in front of the formation, or rotate, or nudge each other, or feign attacks, passing the ball to the center and then passing it out, disrupting the opponent's vision, making it impossible to figure out when and from where to attack. The two forwards can run back and forth along the sidelines and end lines, or switch positions with the center, diagonally running across the free-throw area, then walking along the sidelines to the corner in a figure-eight pattern or a turntable pattern, drawing the opponent away from their positions in order to take advantage of openings.

The two guards both pass the ball back and forth, and simultaneously look for opportunities to attack. If there is an opening, they will not let it go. Such simple, varied formations are difficult to explain without diagrams and cannot be used without proper training. This is just one example.

### C. Blocking Offensive Method

The blocking offensive method, in English is "Blocking System," also known as Screening, is a modern tactic used to break through the enemy's formation. It is most effective against the "man-to-man" defense and out-of-bounds plays. It has many names, including "Play Key-man Screening," single-knife and scissor-shaped blocking, sideline blocking, and central zone blocking. The method of blocking can involve one, two, or three people blocking, depending on the game situation and the coach's experience. However, the most commonly used is the main enemy blocking method. The so-called main enemy blocking method is to block one of the main opponents, in order to create an open path so that the teammate with the ball can attack along this path without being marked by the enemy. This method is relatively simple and easy to implement and can be used in conjunction with various other offensive methods without changing the original overall strategy, so coaches often prefer to use it. However, this tactic is not without weaknesses. The most obvious is that it is easily countered by the five-man zone defense, and when it is not implemented flexibly, it is often detected by the opponent, who can adjust positions in time to defend against it, rendering it a futile effort.

Overall, skilled players must use a sort of deception, such as a smokescreen-like technique, before implementing a blocking tactic, so the enemy doesn't know they are being blocked. For example, feigning going forward to catch the ball, or following the enemy running toward the basket to steal the ball, or standing still shouting and gesturing, asking teammates to pass the ball, or indicating the direction of the teammate's attack, deceiving the enemy and secretly blocking the nearest enemy, isolating them on the sideline, or trapping them in a certain location, preventing them from running out in time to steal the teammate's ball, so the teammate with the ball can boldly attack. Therefore, the most important thing about blocking is to prevent the enemy from anticipating being blocked; the position when blocking the enemy must be such that it is difficult for the enemy to come out in time to block the teammate with the ball; and every effort should be made to avoid touching the enemy's body and committing a foul. According to the rules, all defensive prohibitions that do not involve physical contact have now been removed. In other words, as long as there is no physical contact, any blocking method is permissible. This is even more advantageous for adopting the blocking offensive method.

When using the blocking method to break the "man-to-man" defense, the commonly used formations can be roughly divided into the following three types:

The first type belongs to the full-court cooperative method. Suppose that after the opponent scores, our team starts attacking from the end line with an out-of-bounds play. The method of formation is to have the left guard inbound the ball on the end line, the right guard stand on the left side of the opposing team's free-throw area, the two forwards stand on the side of the court near the center line, and the center stand in the middle of the court in front of our free-throw line to disperse the enemy.

At the start of the attack, the right guard first walks toward the left forward's side of the court, pretending to be looking for a path. In fact, the player going forward will block the defender guarding the forward, so that the left forward is not marked, runs forward, and catches the ball inbounded by the left guard from out of bounds. At this time, the center walks toward the right side of the court and secretly blocks the defender guarding the right forward, allowing the forward to run out and catch the pass from the left forward. After throwing the ball inbounds, the left guard immediately rushes straight to the basket from the left side of the court, catches the long pass from the right forward in front of the basket, and then shoots it in. This method can be used in combination with fast breaks, no center jump, or out-of-bounds play offensive methods, and can also be called sideline blocking, diagonal attack method.

The second type of formation is assumed to be used during positional attack. The formation method is to have the center and the left and right forwards stand in a row in front of the end line in the front court, and the two guards stand on the left and right sides of the court near the center line, forming a situation of two people attacking from the outside and three people responding from the inside. There are many ways to use this formation to attack. Here is an example to illustrate the general idea.

At the start of the attack, the normal positional attack method is still used, with the two guards passing the ball back and forth and passing it over the center line. The other three people quickly run forward to the front court end line to set up the formation. When the ball is passed over the center line and is in the hands of the left guard, the forward on the right corner of the court starts running forward along the sideline, and when the ball is passed to the right guard, the player suddenly grabs the right guard pass in front of the enemy following up. At this time, the center runs forward one or two steps from under the basket and blocks the enemy marking the forward at the left corner, allowing the forward to escape, walk to the front of the basket, catch the pass from the right forward, and then shoot in. This method is one type of key enemy blocking (Key-man Screening). It can also be called a two-attack three-response main enemy blocking offensive method.

The third type is a three-attack blocking positional attack method. Its formation is the opposite of the previous one, with three people attacking from the outside and two people responding from the inside. Except for the center standing in the middle of the two guards outside the formation, the positions of the rest of the players are the same as in the previous formation. There are countless ways to use this formation to attack. Here, one of the simpler ways will be explained briefly.

When launching an attack, it should be after the two guards have passed the ball to each other over the center line. At this time, any guard can pass the ball to the center. As soon as the ball reaches the center's hands, the forward on the right corner of the court begins running forward along the sideline. When the player reaches the intersection of the free-throw line and the sideline, the player will be in front of the enemy marking themselves in order to receive the ball. Seeing that the forward has gone forward, the center will pass the ball to the right guard. After receiving the ball, the right guard rotates toward the sideline and passes the ball to the forward. After passing the ball to the right guard, the center turns around, bypasses the center blocking the enemy, walks to the free-throw area, catches the pass back from the right forward, and dribbles forward, jumps, and shoots. This is a three-attack two-response, sideline main enemy blocking offensive method.

If the strategy changes the formation to a central breakthrough blocking offensive method, then after the center catches the ball, the right guard runs to the right side of the enemy marking the center, using a feint, pretending to have other intentions, and secretly blocks the enemy, allowing the center to bypass the right guard and, with a solo attack, dribble into the central area and jump up to score near the basket. This method is very simple to describe, but in practice, the entire team must cooperate, lead the enemy to disperse, and make them not pay attention. Without the close cooperation of the right guard and the center, it is difficult to get results. (Note) The section from "In summary" to "countering its unpredictable blocking methods" in the previous article is a conclusion on modern defensive methods.
