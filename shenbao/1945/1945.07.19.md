Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from Okinawa reports: Rear Admiral Oz, commander of the Third Air Force of the U.S. Navy at the Okinawa base, stated the following when meeting with reporters on the 16th: "I have completed my mission as commander of tactical aviation in Okinawa. After the reorganization of the Okinawa Air Force, all army air force units at the Ryukyu base have been incorporated into the Far East Air Forces commanded by General Kenney.

During the reorganization of the Okinawa base, the Second Air Force of the Navy and Marines will be directly commanded by General Stilwell, while all other air force units in Okinawa will be under the jurisdiction of the Far East Air Forces. However, if the Eighth Air Force is stationed at the Okinawa base, it will be directly under the Pacific Strategic Air Command. General Spaatz's Pacific Strategic Air Command will operate independently, while General Kenney's units will only be tactical air forces."

### Chongqing Political Council to Close the Day After Tomorrow

General Assemblies to be Held Today and Tomorrow

Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast from Chongqing, the Chongqing Political Council continued to discuss proposals from various groups on the 17th. At the fourteenth meeting held at 3:00 PM, about 90 motions were passed, all related to international and domestic affairs. The fifteenth meeting will be held at 9:00 AM on the 18th, and various review committees will convene in the afternoon to review cases related to the National Assembly. General assemblies will be held in the morning and afternoon of the 19th and 20th, and the session is expected to close as scheduled on the 21st.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The British newspaper *The Observer* strongly criticized the Kuomintang regime in Chongqing on the 15th, stating that "a more profound issue than the CCP-KMT conflict is the constitutional implementation of the National Political Council. Progressive politicians and intellectuals, not to mention the business community, have criticized the National Political Council. The problem is whether the Kuomintang will continue its one-party rule. The representatives attending the National Assembly to draft the constitution were appointed by the Kuomintang seven years ago, so it is inappropriate to entrust such a special group to decide on the constitution. Therefore, democrats advocate postponing the National Assembly until peace is established and reconvening it after the representatives to the assembly are elected. Furthermore, the reason why Yan'an and the democrats do not attend the National Political Council is to avoid the Kuomintang unanimously passing politics that are nominally representative but far removed from the will of the people."

### Song Ziwen Returns to Chongqing

### Large-Scale Underground Factories in Japan: Soldiers and Workers Diligently Producing Munitions

A certain base in Japan, 18th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy began their air offensive, their material warfare against the mainland has begun. The elite forces of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force have completed all preparations to deal with enemy incursions into the mainland, concentrating all combat power, and fortifying various locations throughout the mainland. With special permission, a reporter had the opportunity to visit an underground factory built in a certain mountain range and was amazed by the rows of underground factories nestled in the valleys. At the foot of the mountains, rice paddies were just planted. The truck in which the reporter was riding passed through a dimly lit valley. According to Second Lieutenant E, who was guiding the way, excavation work was also underway underground at the locations the truck was passing through. Some factories had already begun operations, with a large number of soldiers and workers diligently producing munitions, including some female workers. Construction of a certain underground factory, which began in × month, is of a grand scale and progressing at an unbelievable speed. A large number of machines are being brought in day and night, and abundant hydroelectric power is being supplied even before operations begin. Skilled workers from coal mines, tunnel engineers from the National Railway Company, and university geologists are all working diligently, along with the enthusiastic labor of local residents. The large munitions factory is largely complete. Ten thousand soldiers and workers are pouring their efforts into producing new weapons. The entrance to the underground factory is only large enough for two people, to prevent the force of explosions. After going ×× meters deep, there are ×× large machines installed, lit by lights as bright as day. There are ×× such caves in the mountain range, as well as subcontracting factories and privately-run factories. When the reporter entered with Second Lieutenant E, young production soldiers and female students all saluted Second Lieutenant E, full of vigor, which greatly excited the reporter. In the future, no matter how the enemy launches new operations and deploys thousands of bombers to destroy Japanese production capacity, the underground munitions factories will continue to produce for the victory of the nation.

Travel Correspondence

### Observations in Western Zhejiang

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Tang Yi

The new head of the Zhejiang provincial government is eager to thoroughly understand the actual situation in the areas under his jurisdiction in order to decide on his policy guidelines. Thus, a Western Zhejiang inspection group was dispatched. The core of this inspection group was Chief of Staff Zhang Heng of the Pacification Headquarters, representing the Pacification Headquarters; Director Zhang Juansheng of the Civil Affairs Bureau, representing the provincial government; and also included Director Watanabe of the Liaison Department, Section Chief Pan Dingyuan of the Provincial Propaganda Section, and others. As Western Zhejiang has suffered repeated destruction and transportation has been cut off for a long time, this reporter felt that the true situation there was a matter of concern for readers, and therefore wished to accompany the group. I am grateful for the permission granted by the inspection group and for the care provided by Section Chief Pan along the way.

The destination of this inspection was Wuxing (Huzhou), formerly known throughout the country for its silk wealth, but now ravaged and with some people even eating grass roots. The New Fourth Army cut off transportation from Hangzhou to Wuxing long ago. Since the National Army troops under Xiang Zhizhuang were transferred to Zhejiang, the strength of the Zhejiang province has been greatly enhanced. Furthermore, the conflict between the CCP troops from Chongqing and the communist forces in Zhejiang was quite intense. Recently, the National Army, with the assistance of Allied forces, launched a large-scale mopping-up operation, recovering several towns and cities. The transportation between Hangzhou and Wuxing, which had been cut off for one or two years, has now been restored. At present, waterways have been reopened, though with fewer departures than before the war. Roads, however, have been severely damaged, with all the bridges destroyed. Minor damage has been repaired and can be used gradually, but the major bridges are still awaiting the efforts of the construction authorities due to material shortages.

### Tangqi

Traveling along the canal from Hangzhou for two hours brings one to Tangqi. The town has a population of over 14,000 and produces fruit. The annual rice production only supplies the local area for three months of consumption. Currently, the price is over 500,000 yuan per picul. Half of the people rely on miscellaneous grains and corn for sustenance. Rice and grain are transported from Jiaxing and Wuxi. There are only over 300 stores in the local area, belonging to 30 trade associations. The market situation is extremely depressed. Since Governor Ding Mocun ordered the abolition of checkpoints, villagers have been returning in an endless stream, and prosperity can be expected in the future. In terms of education, there is one junior high school with 100 students, one central primary school, and seven or eight private primary schools, with a total of over 700 students. Chen Wen, the commander of the 36th Division stationed in the local area, is very enthusiastic about education, subsidizing each school teacher and staff member with three pecks of rice per month. Recently, because the troops themselves did not have enough rice, each person has been changed to a subsidy of one and a half pecks of rice and the remainder in corn flour.

### Deqing

After Tangqi, comes Deqing County, which was occupied by the New Fourth Army as recently as this spring. The city was captured by the 36th Division on June 16 with the assistance of Allied forces. After the war, the scene was bleak, with a population of only over 20,000. Currently, it is being reorganized and restored. Schools are also being established. There is only a temporary school now, with dozens of students. They produce fruit, and most residents are farmers. There are only about 100 stores, mostly grain and grocery stores. That night, the inspection group stayed in Luoshe, a town north of Deqing.

### Linghu

Linghu belongs to Wuxing County. There are 1,000 households on the street, with a population of 7,000 to 8,000. Most people make a living by raising fish and silkworms. After the Allied forces withdrew in 1943, it was under the control of guerrillas for a long time, and has been restored for less than two months. There is now a regiment of the 34th Division stationed there, requiring the town to supply the troops with seven or eight piculs of rice per month. There are over 200 stores in the town, with over 30 trade associations. There is regular boat transportation. Because the area is wealthy, even during the lean season after the war, only 20% of the population eats miscellaneous grains, while the rest still eat rice. The price of rice is over 500,000 yuan per picul, wheat 260,000 yuan per dan, salt 360 yuan per jin, flour 140,000 yuan per bag, white sugar 14,000 yuan per jin, soybean oil 6,400 yuan per jin, firewood 6,000 yuan per dan, candles 3,000 yuan each, and British brand cigarettes 1,000 yuan per ten. This is a rough estimate of the prices in Linghu.

### Wuxing

Wuxing was very wealthy before the war, with a well-developed culture. The destruction after the war was extremely severe, and the New Fourth Army also stationed there for a time. Currently, the National Army's First Division, Thirty-Fourth Division, and security forces are stationed there, with 300 policemen, three water police detachments of over 100 men, and Allied forces stationed there. The defense is very strict.

The county is divided into ten districts. The county seat is the tenth district, with a population of 70,000. The east, south, west, and north gates are the first, second, eighth, and ninth districts, with a total population of 90,000. The third district, Nanxun, has 16,000 people. The fifth district, Linghu, and the sixth district, Shuanglin, were captured recently, so official population statistics are not yet available.

The area used to produce silk, but recently, due to transportation blockages, a shortage of seed sources, sluggish sales, and high costs, the economic capacity of the families involved is very weak, and most have stopped raising silkworms, leading to a sharp decline in the industry. Most of the silk weaving factories have been closed for the past two years, with only one-tenth of the pre-war factories still operating, greatly affecting people's livelihood. Currently, the operating factories are rice mills, ironworks, and flour mills. There are 1,700 stores.

Although the price of rice in Wuxing is also over 500,000 yuan per picul, it seems that because transportation is inconvenient and purchasing is difficult, the small people suffer unspeakable hardships. In the countryside, some people are using grass roots as food. The county originally had 1.57 million mu of farmland, but much of it is currently barren. The county's revenue is mainly from land tax, which only amounted to over 2 million yuan last year, resulting in a tight budget for the county government. This year, the system has been changed to collect in kind, and the situation is expected to improve.

Educational institutions: There is one provincial high school with 400 students, one private high school with 300 students, nine public primary schools, nine district primary schools, and four private primary schools, with over 7,000 students. In terms of student numbers, this is only one-tenth of the pre-war level. Before the war, there were twelve high schools. Teachers' salaries are very low, and most of them are women. The provincial government has drafted a new expansion plan to increase the number of classes to accommodate school-aged children who have dropped out of school.

In terms of health, there is one Gospel Hospital and one county hospital. Public organizations include the Chamber of Commerce, trade associations, the Cultural Association, and the Anqing Association.

Zhejiang is located on the front lines, and the environment is particularly complex. The suffering of the people is therefore particularly great. Their hope for governance is like waiting for rain clouds. Having seen the war-torn Western Zhejiang, I cannot help but pin endless hopes on Ding Mocun, who has resolutely taken on the task of reorganizing Zhejiang.

### U.S. Unemployment Problem Ultimately Cannot Be Solved

A Major Economic Contradiction

Moscow, 18th (Central News Agency) - Soviet economist Rubinstein recently published an article in "War and the Working Class," discussing the labor problem in the United States: "Before the outbreak of this great war in 1940, the number of unemployed people in the United States had already reached over 9 million. The number of unemployed people after the war will be even larger. The unemployment problem in the United States is very serious even during the current war, and the number is increasing daily. Various military factories, shipyards, and automobile factories have already laid off countless employees. On the one hand, discharged soldiers seem to have no hope of finding employment in their own country. In fact, discharged soldiers should continue their previous occupations, but during their time in the military, others have already filled those positions, making it very difficult to return to work. This phenomenon can be described as a major contradiction in the U.S. economy."

### Fears of Food Shortages Said to Be Improving

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to information received here, after taking office, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson gave his first broadcast speech yesterday, stating that "the U.S. food shortage situation is unlikely to improve much throughout 1945. The amount of food that the American people can obtain will be 5% less than last year, and there is a danger of a significant shortage of essential foods in the coming months, such as meat, oil, sugar, milk, vegetables, etc."

### Belgian Parliament Resolves That the King Has No Executive Power

Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Brussels, the Belgian House of Representatives voted last night by an overwhelming majority of 98 votes to 3 that King Leopold III cannot continue to perform constitutional duties unless both houses formally declare that his executive position has been restored. Prime Minister Achille Van Acker submitted the motion to the House of Representatives for resolution yesterday afternoon. After Acker read out the contents of King Leopold's letter to Prince Regent Charles and criticized it, the House of Representatives referred the motion to the Legislative Committee for review. It was then brought back to the House of Representatives and voted on. Before the formal discussion of the motion, most of the staff of the House of Representatives gathered in the reception room outside the chamber, waiting for Prime Minister Acker to announce the new cabinet lineup after the resignation of six Catholic ministers. Acker distributed the six vacant key positions among ten members of the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and Liberal Party. At that time, the Catholic Party members strongly opposed it. Then Acker began the parliamentary session by reading out the contents of Leopold's letter to Prince Charles and later criticizing it severely, stating that "the will of Leopold III as stated in the letter does not conform to the will of the people."

### Imposition of Rice as Tuition Fees Strictly Prohibited by the Ministry of Education to Avoid Affecting the Future of Education

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - With the second semester of the 34th academic year about to begin, schools at all levels in Nanjing are actively handling enrollment matters. According to the recent methods for collecting tuition and miscellaneous fees, schools will be collecting rice or rice substitutes based on the current rice price. Recently, the price of rice has reached a peak of over 400,000 yuan, and the general public is already finding it impossible to maintain their livelihood. If tuition fees are changed to rice, the number of students dropping out will inevitably increase sharply, greatly affecting the future of education. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically inquired with the Ministry of Education about this, and received the following reply: "The matter of changing tuition fees to rice has occurred in some areas, and the Ministry has issued a general ban on it. The Ministry has not received any reports on whether schools in Nanjing and other places have such plans at present. However, according to the previous order, not only will such a phenomenon be absolutely unacceptable in all national schools under the Ministry's jurisdiction, but also local schools will not be allowed to openly use the collection of rice or rice substitutes as tuition fees. Once discovered, the Ministry will immediately prohibit it."

As a result, a new agreement was signed in Moscow on the 11th of this month, changing the regulations for the management of Polish railways stipulated during the war. All issues discussed between the two countries were agreed upon in a spirit of mutual understanding and friendship. The new agreement was signed by Soviet People's Commissar for Transport Kovalev and Polish Minister of Transport Rabanowski, representing their respective sides.

### Stalin Arrives in Berlin; Three-Power Conference Begins; Truman Presumed to be Chairman

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin via TASS: Soviet People's Commissar and Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov arrived in Berlin on July 16th.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin via TASS: The conference of the leaders of the British, American, and Soviet governments began at noon on the afternoon of the 17th. President Truman of the United States has been invited by Stalin and Churchill to serve as chairman of the conference. A preliminary exchange of views on the various issues requiring a decision by the leaders of the three governments has been conducted. It has been decided that the foreign ministers of the three countries will meet frequently to prepare for the conference.

Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 18th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, Chairman Stalin, after arriving in Berlin on the 16th, visited U.S. President Truman at the "temporary White House" outside Berlin on the 17th, accompanied by Foreign Commissar Molotov, and began the first talks, and had lunch together. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Churchill also had lunch with U.S. Secretary of War Stimson. On Monday evening, Prime Minister Churchill hosted a banquet for U.S. Chief of Staff General Marshall, and after the banquet, he held talks with him for a long time.

### German Financier Proposes German Reorganization Plan

Central News Agency Dispatch from London via TASS: According to a special correspondent for the "Daily Herald" of the British Military Headquarters in Germany, Alfred Hagenburg, a German financier who provided funds to Hitler before 1933, has now submitted a plan to the British military government for reorganizing the German economy. The special correspondent said that it is widely believed that this plan was drafted by Hagenburg at the request of the British authorities, and its content includes the reorganization of the entire German economy, which also warns the German people that if the standard of living is too low, Germany will inevitably become a communist country. Moreover, this plan also involves Germany's "bad fate" and expresses great regret for the current lack of "leaders" to guide the country's reorganization. An editorial commenting on the emergence of Hagenburg's plan in the newspaper stated: Hagenburg's name is not unfamiliar. At one time, he was the most prominent financier in Germany. He even subsidized Hitler with money before Hitler came to power. He also served as a minister in Hitler's first super cabinet. Although there is no evidence to prove that he reduced his enthusiasm for Nazi ideals before the German militarists were destroyed, Hagenburg has long been recognized as the sole symbol of Germany's worst forces. He professed to be a German industrialist, creating his latent power, and can be described as the engine behind the German militarists. Unexpectedly, today, not only are Hagenburg's opinions sought, but he is also openly allowed to speak freely, and can freely express his expert knowledge of financial and industrial issues without any restrictions, and to warn of the "red danger," as if Goebbels is still the Minister of Propaganda. It also discusses Germany's need for "leaders," believing that nothing is more necessary than a successor to the head of state. At the same time, when Hagenburg is allowed to speak, for some reason, trade unions are not allowed to speak. Although we are said to be too politically inclined in the new trade unions, Hagenburg can rant and rave about the threat of communism. Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, and Nazi Germany is our mortal enemy, so we must have a clear plan for Hagenburg and everything he represents, so that we can completely eliminate it.

### Soviets Use Aircraft to Provide Emergency Medical Aid

Using aircraft for emergency medical aid is extremely common in the Smolensk region, and it is heard that new surgical hospitals and clinics are being built in the villages of the Smolensk region.

Editorial

### Emergency Countermeasures for Enemy Air Raids

In the past two days, some areas of this city have been bombed by enemy planes, and the residents have suffered greatly. Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper put forward several points on this matter, arousing the attention of the authorities and citizens. However, in view of the seriousness of the situation, we will further provide concrete suggestions as follows:

First of all, organized and unified rescue work for air raid refugees should be launched immediately. The Municipal Citizens' Welfare Association has an unshirkable responsibility to take the lead in civil society and assist the government and relevant authorities to promote it urgently. On the one hand, it should contact the public opinion circles and appeal to all sectors to donate and sing to relieve disasters. On the other hand, it should immediately promote practical relief work, such as: 　Establishing air raid refugee shelters;　Opening air raid emergency medical clinics;　Establishing air raid injury rescue teams;　Establishing public cemeteries for unclaimed and poor bombing victims;　Universally establishing air raid protection, communication, liaison and patrol teams to help the public maintain law and order. All such urgent matters should be based on the principle that the government supervises and cooperates, and the people's organizations manage themselves. Baojia and medical and pharmaceutical industries should automatically assist. The most important thing is:

First, the organization should be simple, in order to be realistic.

Second, the action should be agile, in order to go to work quickly.

Third, government and people should cooperate closely, and both sides should have absolute mutual trust for all air raid emergency needs.

Secondly, the evacuation work in this city must be accelerated. In the past, the evacuation committee has been slow in progress due to the difficulties encountered in transportation. Recently, considerable measures have been taken for transportation, and all sectors of the city urgently need to seize the opportunity to evacuate as soon as possible. In particular, the general charity organizations that have recently decided to implement forced evacuation have still not taken any action. In fact, the evacuation of charity organizations is not a problem at all. It is nothing more than some staff members who are nostalgic for Shanghai and are taking a wait-and-see attitude. I hope to launch a unified evacuation as soon as possible. Other schools, factories, etc., that can and must leave Shanghai, should leave Shanghai as soon as possible. At this emergency moment, the authorities should especially consider taking compulsory evacuation measures. Strict restrictions must be adopted as soon as possible for residents from other places who come to Shanghai. If everyone waits and hesitates again in this situation, in addition to the losses suffered by the relevant associations, manufacturers and individuals, it will also be a loss to the country and society. I sincerely hope that people with good intentions from all walks of life will come out and advocate and achieve the goal of thoroughly evacuating the population of this city as soon as possible.

In addition, this newspaper has pointed out in the past that during the air raids, there are no shortage of city merchants, profiteers and speculators who hoard essential living supplies and take advantage of the war to seek exorbitant profits. This kind of behavior, from the perspective of personal morality, is no different from "taking advantage of a fire to rob"; from the perspective of wartime law, it is even more of an act that disrupts the social economy and undermines wartime order. We hope that all sectors will take out the inherent moral concepts of the Chinese people in this critical moment. Even if everyone does not have to see righteousness and abandon profit, they should not take advantage of danger to make profits. The more difficult the situation, the more calm and law-abiding we are. On the other hand, we still hope that the relevant authorities will immediately implement strict monitoring of the market. Anyone who spreads rumors, manipulates the market, and takes the opportunity to raise prices should be severely punished. In fact, the prices of the past two days, due to the frenzy in the gold and stock markets, and the general public's tendency to speculate, have already contained the sharp momentum of fluctuations. Therefore, to prevent soaring prices, it is not only necessary to strictly guard against merchants hoarding and hoarding, but also to pay close attention to speculative activities in the gold and stock trading markets.

### Relief for the Unemployed and Relief for Those Out of School

— Floating Cloud

The current situation in Shanghai, where life is oppressive and the people are struggling to survive, can be said to have reached an extreme. In terms of education, because tuition fees are expensive, most parents cannot afford it, and most poor children have dropped out of school. It is expected that the number of students in each school will decrease sharply in the autumn term compared to the previous semester. This serious problem is currently being paid exceptional attention by people with a passion for education. The cry of "rescuing those out of school" is constantly being sung in all aspects. This newspaper's scholarship movement is sparing no effort to appeal and expand the fundraising target. Most enthusiastic people are working together to help, and the results are expected to be satisfactory. Unemployed youths have received great support, but on the other side of society, there is an even more pitiful group than those out of school, and that is the unemployed masses. They are struggling on the line of life, waiting for people in society who sympathize with them to provide relief.

This newspaper's twelfth issue of the Shanghai Municipal Administration once raised the issue of the recent surge in the number of unemployed in Shanghai. According to the latest statistics released by the Employment Guidance Office of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau on the number of job seekers and job openings, the number of job seekers in April increased daily compared with the index in February and March. On the contrary, the number of recruitment positions in April decreased day by day. This trend can reflect the surge in the number of unemployed in Shanghai. If the problem becomes more serious, social order will be greatly affected. We cannot ignore what will happen in the future.

During the war, the formation of unemployment panic is unavoidable. The reasons are nothing more than the high cost of living, the abnormal social environment, the control of wartime policies, the slow transportation of materials, and the severity of the economic crisis, etc., which make industrial, commercial and various industries gradually decline, or even limit to stagnation. The number of unemployed is also increasing accordingly. Analyzing the constituent members of the unemployed group, in general, they do not go beyond the following two sources: 　Employees abandoned by society: That is to say, personnel who have been laid off from various companies, firms or organizations. They originally had jobs, but were forced to become unemployed due to social depression or other special reasons. 　Young people looking for a way out in society: They are either graduates who have completed their school studies, or young people who have dropped out of school due to economic oppression. Most of them are eager to find a way out to solve the difficulties of life. However, the social environment created by the war, based on the above reasons, is still too much for the original workers, so how can there be room to accommodate these young people who have just come out of the thatched hut? Therefore, the slogan of "no way out" can be heard everywhere in the mouths of modern young people. In today's Chinese society, "talent" simply has no place to stand. The continuation of this phenomenon may sow a major crisis!

Examining the facts in all aspects of society, we can see the suffering and struggle of the unemployed. However, the road allowed by the environment is definitely not a bright future, but an extremely dangerous and distorted path. For example, speculation in the stock market, hoarding of goods, and single-gang brokerage fees. These difficult speculative and violent acts, because of their small capital and high profits, and easy trickery, have become the only way out in the hearts and eyes of the unemployed. The laid-off unemployed get a severance pay after being laid off, and then use it to engage in the above-mentioned business, trying to be lucky. Some unemployed youths even sell and borrow money, raise small amounts of money, and unite with other unemployed people to travel to various ports, specializing in single-fine transactions. The number of people is very large. Once they encounter unforeseen events and speculation fails, not only will their livelihood be cut off, but they will even be ruined. Taking risks, the consequences are even more unimaginable.

Although the unemployment problem is not yet serious, the crisis is latent and cannot be ignored by us. In order to be prepared, the authorities and people from all walks of life should pay attention to and study this unemployment problem, and coordinate countermeasures and relief methods to reduce the unemployment crisis. The group tries to put forward the following points based on its limited views, for the sake of discussion:

Implement evacuation work: The unemployed should register with the authorities. After investigation, the evacuation committee or the unemployment relief agency should immediately refer to the differences in the unemployed's origin, age, ability and family situation, and force them to evacuate to their original hometown or a suitable evacuation destination. In this way, the unemployed can get a proper home.

Promote rural construction: Under the wartime system, increasing production is the current urgent task. Improving agricultural production is an urgent matter, and it is even more of a prerequisite for solving the people's livelihood. This kind of rural construction requires a large number of strong and capable members to participate in the work and advocate vigorously. Among the unemployed, there are no shortage of intellectuals. The authorities may use them to train and organize them in a short period of time. Assign them to various parts of the inland to engage in practical rural construction work, such as the establishment of rural cooperatives, the improvement of agricultural technology, the adjustment of the rural economy, and the establishment of farmers' welfare undertakings, etc.; in addition, the promotion of rural sideline industries, wasteland reclamation, and product development, etc., can also select talents from the unemployed in society and give them the opportunity to serve the country. The benefits to the entire social organization are not small.

Support the proper development of industry and commerce; the cause of unemployment stems from the decline of industry and commerce. A part of the industrial and commercial employees are unfortunately laid off, mostly due to the economic downturn. Those who are laid off due to weak working ability account for a small number. In the future, the government should urgently ban improper organizations such as speculative profits, and give the greatest strength and maximum support to legitimate industrial and commercial gold industries with productive capacity, such as facilitating the provision of funds, materials, transportation, and motive power, so that individual economic organizations can restore stability, and the market will gradually return to the right track. The trend of layoffs will not grow, and useful talents will get proper protection and way out. In addition, the government should also vigorously promote and assist small industries, handicrafts and family industries, so that the unemployed can embark on the path of proper production, which not only meets the wartime production increase policy, but can also reduce the panic of unemployment to a considerable extent.

Government agencies should strive to implement talent politics: In the past, government agencies hired private individuals due to the leaders' use of private individuals, and improper use of personnel often affected administrative efficiency. Those who are aware of the situation believe that politics is not on the right track, which is not without reason. In the future, the government should give priority to talent in the use of personnel, and should give them considerable protection, so that they can work with peace of mind. Except for those with weak ability and poor performance, they should be laid off. No layoffs should be made without reason. At the same time, we must try our best to adopt a public examination system, select true talents, give them priority in employment, and assign them to various departments to take on work. Within the possible scope, special assistance should be given to unemployed young people who have ability or knowledge, so that they can do their best for the country and society, and reduce some unnecessary waste in society.

Promote national compulsory education: National education is the foundation of the country. My country's education has always been very backward. During the war, prices were high and the people's livelihood was declining. More and more poor children were dropping out of school. The way to remedy this is compulsory education. It is the most important measure. I think that at this critical moment for the country, national compulsory education should be promoted universally. If we can gather social forces to set up compulsory schools in Shanghai and other places, implement universal national education. In addition to the funding provided by the state and social donations, in terms of human resources, we may as well make full use of unemployed intellectuals to take on teaching positions. On the one hand, we can rescue children from school, and at the same time, we can solve the way out for a part of the unemployed.

Launch an unemployment relief movement. Most of the unemployed are wage earners. They are extremely poor on weekdays and have no savings at all. Once they suddenly lose their jobs, their lives become more threatened. It is even more difficult to find another job. It is inevitable to wait to die. Therefore, the relief of the unemployed depends on the enthusiastic support of powerful people in society, such as small-scale loans, hidden poverty relief funds, industrial and commercial loans, and poor disease loans, etc., to raise funds so that the unemployed can receive economic relief, which can solve the current difficulties, and even use it to make a living on their own. In addition, awards for academic research, collection and funding of industrial and commercial plans, and job placement, etc., can also be led by the government and social leaders to actively promote them. If an unemployment relief agency can be organized separately to integrate them, and to cooperate with all parties in society at any time, the effect will be considerable.

Finally, the borrower believes that the unemployment problem is of great and far-reaching importance to social security. How to prevent and relieve unemployment panic, I hope that powerful people in society will pay close attention to it, and I hope to take responsibility and advocate the suggestion of an unemployment relief movement. If the government authorities can unite enthusiastic people from all walks of life to organize an unemployment relief office or an unemployment relief committee, etc., specializing in the registration, investigation, research, design and implementation of relief work for the unemployed. To carry out planned and organized unemployment relief activities with the broad social forces, at least in the sense of social assistance, it is very contributory and exemplary.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Shanghai Again, Three Shot Down; Secretary-General Luo Inspects Disaster Area in Eastern Shanghai

Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Anti-Aircraft Command announced at 2:00 PM on the 18th: Approximately 80 enemy B24 heavy bombers and P38/P51 fighter planes invaded the Shanghai area at noon on the 18th, bombing airfields around Shanghai. The results were three enemy aircraft shot down (one unconfirmed) and one destroyed. Our side suffered minor damage.

(Further News) Yesterday at noon, enemy American planes again raided Shanghai, causing hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries. Civilian houses were destroyed in a tragic scene. Local Baojia authorities dispatched personnel to assist military police and the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters in rescue efforts and convened emergency meetings to discuss relief measures.

### Civilian Casualties Urgently Need to be Claimed

The Civil Air Defense Headquarters has gathered the bodies of those killed in the bombing the day before yesterday (the 17th) at the mortuary on Maohai Road. Families are required to claim the bodies by 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 19th). If unclaimed after the deadline, they will be placed in coffins and sent to Pushan Villa for burial. Regarding the injured, rescue team members dispatched by the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters on the scene transported them to various hospitals for emergency treatment. However, due to the limited bed capacity of each hospital, the hospital to which each injured person was sent could not be determined definitively on the spot, and their families could not be immediately notified. Therefore, families can call 12410 and transfer to extension 299 at the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters Rescue Department the next day to inquire, providing the location of the injury and the injured person's name, place of origin, and gender for verification.

### Secretary-General Luo Inspects Disaster Area

The day before yesterday (the 17th), enemy American aircraft attacked Shanghai, indiscriminately bombing densely populated civilian areas in the northeastern district, resulting in over a thousand innocent civilian deaths and injuries. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo of this city were deeply concerned about these victims. Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, along with Police Chief Kobayashi, Director Noguchi of the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters, and Section Chief Ikeda, personally visited the disaster area at 5:00 PM yesterday (the 18th). They first went to the Tilanqiao Police Sub-Bureau to hear reports from Sub-Bureau Chief Matsushita and Deputy Sub-Bureau Chief Zhang Yuanjing regarding the damage and detailed circumstances in the disaster area. They reported that the area is a civilian district with 150,000 residents, including 20,000 foreigners and 1,400 Jews. Enemy aircraft dropped bombs in 16 locations, with bomb weights ranging from 20 kg to 150 kg. The civilian death toll was 360 Chinese, with 703 injured. Only two Japanese were killed or injured, and 31 foreigners were killed or injured. Afterwards, Chief Kobayashi led the 4th Company of the Police Headquarters and the Tsukazaki Fire Department, gathering fire brigades from Yangshupu, Tilanqiao, and Hongkou to provide rescue and firefighting assistance. However, it was regrettable that the local naval garrison area Baojia self-defense corps did not respond as quickly as desired in the rescue efforts. The Jewish air defense team made every effort to mobilize. They hoped that officers number 1 and 2 who were injured or killed in the line of duty would be commended by the authorities. At that time, Japanese veterans organized defense groups to maintain local order, and the Japanese naval marine corps fire brigade also dispatched personnel to assist in firefighting. Secretary-General Luo and his party then proceeded to inspect various locations in the disaster area. Along the way, the scene of broken walls and homeless victims was extremely tragic, and Secretary-General Luo was deeply moved, extending his condolences. The inspection was completed at around 7:00 PM. It was also learned that local philanthropists were organizing donations for coffins to bury the dead and providing porridge and tea to maintain the temporary livelihood of the victims.

### Director Zhou Sends Personnel to Express Condolences

Zhou, the concurrent director of the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, was extremely concerned about the civilians affected by the enemy air raid on Shanghai. In addition to ordering all sub-bureaus to work with various agency personnel to bravely rescue and provide post-disaster relief, he also dispatched Deputy Director Man Qiwei at around 2:00 PM yesterday (the 18th), leading police captain Kobayashi Minesaburo and others as representatives, to visit the Police Hospital, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Clinic, and other hospitals and the disaster area to express condolences to the affected civilians, returning to the bureau at around 4:00 PM.

### Japanese Army Donates Relief Supplies

The highest commander of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, in view of the inhumane indiscriminate bombing of civilian residential areas by enemy aircraft the day before yesterday (the 17th), which resulted in hundreds of innocent civilians being injured, and recognizing the current shortage of relief supplies, specially donated military relief supplies, including 450 watts of Mercurochrome, 100 rolls of gauze, 200 rolls of bandage No. 2, 100 rolls of bandage No. 3, 11,000 grams of cotton wool, 100 bottles of camphor liquid, and other large quantities of medical supplies, to the city government for distribution to relief agencies. At 4:00 PM yesterday, the commander dispatched personnel to the city government to present the supplies. Deputy Secretary-General Hu Zewu accepted the supplies on behalf of Mayor Zhou and expressed his deep gratitude.

### Police Bureau Strengthens Inspection Work

### Police Officer Forcibly Extorts Civilian Property, Sentenced to 15 Years in Prison; Shanghai Branch of Special Court Renders Verdict Yesterday

The Shanghai Branch of the Special Court of the National Government rendered a verdict yesterday (the 18th) on the case of Zheng Weide and others forcibly extorting civilian property. Zheng Weide was the director of the Second Section of the Yimiao Sub-Bureau of the City Police Bureau. On the night of March 18th of this year, a peddler named Ye Gengsheng invited seven friends, including Liu Jinmei, to gamble in the home of Dong Zhu at No. 20 Sipailou, Xiaodongmen, and draw commissions. This was discovered by Wang Jingchuan (at large), a patrol officer at the Fuyou Road Outpost of the sub-bureau, who saw it as an opportunity to seek illegal profits. He immediately telephoned Zheng Weide, who led police sergeant Geng Shuzhen, Chen Wenfu, police officers Yu Desheng, Chen Weimin, and Gao Ganru to Dong Zhu's home. Zheng Weide called out and opened the door, and everyone rushed in, ordering silence and using ropes to tie up the gamblers. They then seized gambling funds of 40,120 yuan and a deck of cards from the table and the gamblers. Subsequently, Wang Jingchuan extorted 50,000 yuan from each gambler as a condition for release. After the gamblers requested a settlement of 180,000 yuan, Zheng Weide ordered Zong Mao to take the police officers, gambling funds, and gambling paraphernalia back to the bureau first. Wang Jingchuan stayed behind to collect the money. On the 20th, Zheng Weide distributed 6,000 yuan each to Geng Shuzhen and Chen Wenfu, and 4,000 yuan each to Yu Desheng, Chen Weimin, and Gao Ganru. Ye Gengsheng reported the incident to the police bureau, which then requested the mayor of this city to submit an order to the National Government for trial by the court. The main text of the judgment is excerpted as follows:

### Main Text of the Judgment

Zheng Weide, in a joint conspiracy to obtain illegal profits, used his authority to forcibly extort property from the people, is sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, a fine of 100,000 yuan, and deprivation of civil rights for life. If he is unable to pay the fine, the fine amount will be converted into a term of labor service based on the ratio of the total fine amount to the number of days in six months. Geng Shuzhen, Chen Wenfu, Yu Desheng, Chen Weimin, and Gao Ganru, in a joint conspiracy to obtain illegal profits, used their authority to forcibly extort property from the people, are each sentenced to one year of imprisonment, a fine of 30,000 yuan, and deprivation of civil rights for life. If they are unable to pay the fine, the fine amount will be converted into a term of labor service based on the ratio of the total fine amount to the number of days in six months. The illegal profits of 220,120 yuan are to be confiscated.

### Illegal Entertainment Venues Strictly Banned

The City Police Bureau, in view of the fact that entertainment venues operating in the guise of special industries often operate without licenses, has formulated inspection measures, ordering all sub-bureaus to thoroughly inspect and strictly ban unlicensed illegal venues, and report them to the general bureau for punishment. As for those with licenses whose business operations exceed the scope of the license or do not comply with the license regulations, they will also be punished uniformly.

### Magistrate of Jiading County Takes Office

Shen Jinghua, Administrative Inspector of the Second District of this city, has been transferred to Director of County Administration.

### Silver and Money Industry Requests Central Reserve Bank to Release More Cash to Meet Legitimate Business Needs

The banks and money houses in the silver and money industries in this city previously requested the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank to increase the issuance of cash by 20% based on the cash figures required for current accounts, special current accounts, other general deposit rights, and the expenses of the banks and money houses, as compiled by the two industry associations according to the interbank current account of June 19th, due to the urgent need for cash in business. After the Central Reserve Bank allowed the issuance, the cash position immediately became more relaxed, and some banks and money houses voluntarily relaxed the restrictions on cash withdrawals to more than 30%. It is now learned that the two industries, in view of the fact that the cash position should be further relaxed to allow banks and money houses to prudently develop further, avoid credit expansion, and eliminate the bad practice of discounting, have recently actively compiled and submitted to the Central Reserve Bank a request for further issuance of cash based on the figures for cash expenditures and storage expenditures of each bank and money house on June 14th, so as to fully meet the needs of business and normalcy. Those banks and money houses that have not reported will be granted the right to allocate cash when the time comes. It is heard that if the Central Reserve Bank approves the request, the cash position will become even more relaxed.

### Chamber of Commerce Suggests Prohibiting Discounting

The Shanghai West Office of the City Chamber of Commerce has submitted a document to the City Chamber of Commerce for submission to the city government, requesting that the illegal practice of discounting in this city be strictly prohibited, and at the same time, it has proposed five measures: (1) Notify all merchants to use parallel-line banknotes for cash purchases as stipulated. (2) Each bank should issue a number of banknotes each day to be used as collateral for cash deposited in the clearing house on the same day to avoid forgery. (3) Citizens should use banknotes for all purchases of daily necessities, except for cash payments. (4) All general merchandise merchants should be strictly prohibited from refusing to accept banknotes under the pretext of requiring cash. (5) Merchants should require users of banknotes to show their residence permits with detailed numbers and addresses.

### Street Scene

— Xiong Huanguang

The sky is like a wildfire set by naughty children. As the sun sets, the vendor stalls lining the asphalt road resemble those just salvaged from a fire, scattered and adorning this noisy street scene.

Almost all of them have been scattered from the City God Temple, Xuanmiao Temple, and Grand View Garden. Several streets of food stalls are operating without business licenses. Regardless of whether the food is cold or hot, they are like children who have lost their nannies, tears streaming down their faces, failing to arouse any appetite, wandering everywhere. Their customers are often sturdy men with large appetites. When a few long benches are full, the area in front of the food stall is already crowded with people and horses, with steam rising from the pot and heads jostling together. Three large bowls down the hatch! Two legs are ready to follow the hawkers in a big circle: Food stalls are where we exchange hard work, and they are the closest confidants on the food line of life.

Salty and sweet, coarse and fine, rice-cooked, noodle-beaten, in water, in oil; most are economical purchases, the cheapest prices. The bowls are rough, and the grease on the table is where the mud and sand kicked up by cars rest. This stained rag also has to take on a lot of chores, finally having to let diners wipe their greasy mouths and sweaty hands accustomed to pulling rickshaws.

Tense, noisy; familiar, lively, realistic: But this scene is ultimately too mundane. Hairy thighs and half-naked faces are too difficult to describe one by one. They spend all day in the heart of the sun; cars and electric buses, two legs weaving like shuttles; you can't tell their fatigue. You know they're sweating, but you don't know the surge of bitterness and hot tears in their hearts. Food stalls, you can't finish writing about them; scattered, scattered; even stalls selling used goods, small rice stalls; carrying on their backs, carrying on poles, shouting with baskets... There is no such great lens that can paste all these living beings into the minds of leisurely people.

Life has become tense! In addition to the empty spaces used to perform "tricks," even the alleyways for urinating and defecating have been turned into camps for survival. As long as the ground is covered with paper, dotted with a few long-unseen banknotes, it's another row, allowing any single passerby to trade with a few silver coins in their hands. On one side are fortune-telling and character-testing stalls, and on the other side, a vagabond's mouth and a declining pen are forever doomed!

At the corner of the road, under the green shade of the trees, are stored the spiritual food of the people—magazines and newspapers—but there are a few lazy young people, like exiled soldiers driven out of their occupations, mixing tens of thousands of black characters arranged by typesetters, exchanging a few thin rewards.

For many people, "clothing," "food," and "housing" have already contracted with "death," and the problem of "travel" is becoming increasingly difficult. The "sidewalk" has become a "Huarong Road" for survival, almost entirely occupied by vendors. Added to this are the air-raid shelters along the way, and the faces of the people coming and going are so strained. Then, the vendors of the "future" can be used as "fortresses," and this "street life fire line" can slightly alleviate the "fire" of the petty bourgeoisie?

### Floating Life Like a Dream

— Mu Qun

Night has descended upon the earth, and I wander alone in this desolate wilderness, filled with endless sorrow; a thread of melancholy; I hold a heart of autumn.

Is that the murmuring stream by Maple Forest Bridge, or the chirping of insects in the depths of the Black Forest? My friend, do you know? The bright moon has already hung on the willow tips, and sweet dreams are permeating people's hearts! Yet, I have not returned!

The moon's light is gentle, is bright, allowing me to find my way in the darkness, it allows me to see the past life -- those desolate green tombstones.

Let us chant the poems of the medieval ages! This environment is intoxicating enough for a wanderer at the edge of the world. I meditate, I stand on a pile of rubble.

The surroundings are frighteningly desolate, the broken walls are quite striking, is it a sheer cliff? Is it a standing screen? Or is it a dilapidated fortress! And so I fantasize:

"Many years ago, this was once a paradise!

"Many years ago, this pile of tiles once held a tall building! Inside lived a group of noble people, and at this time, it must have been brightly lit, with music like a spring! Then, a trace of piano music floated from the balcony, matching the hushed whispers of pairs of lovers, weaving a web of happiness..."

However, time has passed, and this tall building has now become rubble, and the happy people are now drifting in foreign lands? Is this a dream of the Red Chamber? I am a little lost, and I fantasize even more!

"From a distant place, a steed gallops, carrying a hero of the medieval age, he jumps onto the pile of rubble, raises a torch, and shouts loudly, awakening all those who have died, they revel and sing loudly, turning this desolate wilderness into a paradise, countless happy people dance inside..."

This must be a very faint fantasy! Can't you see those haggard ghosts? This is a sadness! People will not understand me.

And so, I think even more about those decaying bones in the green grass, in the past they all had blood, flesh, and souls, perhaps a kind old man, perhaps an enthusiastic youth, perhaps a delicate young woman, perhaps an innocent child... My friend! You are not a pessimistic person, are you! But when you think of "floating life like a dream," will you not lose your ambition?

The night is deep! My heart is about to be shaken by the wind in this wilderness, and my body feels excessively tired, shouldn't I return yet?

### Favored

— Cen Jia

Although the tram has abolished the third class, treating everyone equally, those wearing suits and ties always rush to the original first-class carriages first; while a group of vendors and laborers in short jackets, although paying the same fare, mostly still know their place and step onto the original third-class carriages, not daring to overstep their bounds. They probably understand very well: in a crowd of well-dressed gentlemen and ladies, if there is a roughly dressed commoner squeezed in, causing this one to frown and that one to hold their nose, the atmosphere would be too discordant, it is better to squeeze into the third-class carriage they are used to. Even if they accidentally bump into someone and start a fight, it is still better than squeezing in front and hearing our young ladies and grandmothers say in a strange voice, "How can you be like that, bumping into something?"

Although I don't particularly value my long gown, the magic of the long gown always occupies an important position in my subconscious. So whenever I take a tram, I always squeeze into the first-class carriage.

However, on this day, when I rushed to the tram station, although there was a tram stopped there, I saw that there were already many passengers in the front carriage, and there were still many people waiting to get on the platform. The trailer was still empty, and I calculated that time would not allow me to wait for a second tram, so I had to jump onto the trailer.

After jumping onto the trailer, I stood in front of a worker-like man who was sitting. The person sitting was not sitting tightly, and adding another person would not be too crowded. But because the weather was hot, and because I cherished my spun silk gown, I didn't want to sit. However, the worker-like man thought I was approaching to sit, and immediately asked the person next to him to move over a bit, leaving a seat. I felt it would be impolite to refuse, so I sat down as he wished. But before my body touched the chair, the man suddenly said:

"Lift up your gown a bit, be careful not to wrinkle it!" As if speaking casually, not at all affected. So I carefully looked at him, he was wearing a set of black foreign cloth short jacket and trousers, which were already very old, and some places were a bit torn. His wrinkled, dark face and limbs showed that he had experienced many vicissitudes of life. He wiped the sweat from his forehead from time to time.

In gratitude, I really wanted to talk to him, but I couldn't find the right words to say for a moment. We are used to speaking in a literary style, which sounds very logical and pleasing to our own ears; however, if we want to express a meaning, we often have to go around several bends, and by the time the sound comes out, it is already covered with heavy curtains. Using this kind of language to strike up a conversation with them, they would definitely feel out of place and unable to understand.

Until the tram reached its destination, I couldn't think of a word to say.

I finally stood up with a sense of apology, glanced at the man, and then walked towards the door.

Near the door, a person had his right leg resting on his left leg, his foot protruding very far, if I walked straight, my long gown would definitely be stained with dirt and phlegm from the bottom of his foot, I was about to avoid that foot to go out, when a person sitting next to the person who raised his thigh—he was wearing a set of yellowed white short jacket and trousers—but rushed to say:

"—Hey, you!"

While saying, he also reached out and gently patted the person's thigh. Then that leg immediately went down.

"—This is truly unique!"

I jumped off the tram, muttering to myself.

Giving up a seat, telling me not to wrinkle my gown, telling someone to put their foot down—these are all ordinary things. However, precisely because they are ordinary, they seem more intimate. If this group of people were squeezed into the first-class carriage, the well-dressed people would be too busy holding their noses and frowning, not to mention inviting them to sit down or telling them to be careful of anything. However, in their own world, they are willing to give people who do not seem to be of their kind all kinds of conveniences, and also do so with a kind and natural attitude. —This kind of strong ordinary human touch is only what people wearing short jackets and trousers are willing to pay attention to, if they were to change into long gowns and suits, they would disdain to do it.

People who grow up in suffering and hardship can deeply understand the suffering and hardship of others, and people who have suffered insults and persecution can deeply understand the insults and persecution suffered by others. —Giving up a seat or the like is not worth mentioning in terms of understanding or not, only a long gown used as a pretext to win their slight concern is nothing great, however, their feelings are probably rooted in that kind of broad foundation, this is just a seed, a prototype, some superficial expression!

Thinking of this, I realized that the tram had disappeared from my sight.

I couldn't help but stand there blankly for a few minutes.

### The Wind Seeker

— Xia Ru

June, a season of tyranny. Burning, dogs drooling foam. I search, for the sound of the wind. × × × hastily, as if taking the mood of youth, fanning the promised winds, with a lingering measure. Carrying, the parched moans, twisting and turning, those are the buzzing wind seekers. × × Bats carry the evening, the leaves also dance lightly. Bathed in the pursued cool breeze, I sing: "On the stone steps, come! I have found the evening breeze, sit down: hardworking wind seeker." —Listen!
