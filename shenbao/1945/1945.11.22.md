### National Army Presses Xingcheng and Huludao; Arrives at Various Passes Inside the Great Wall; Martial Law in Tianjin and Beijing, Reinforcements Continue to Arrive

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 21st] The National Army advanced forward in three routes after crossing the pass, making rapid progress. They have not encountered resistance and have already penetrated 180 *li* into the nine eastern provinces, which is 400 *li* from the Shenyang Railway Station. Sources stated this morning that they are approaching Xingcheng on the Beining Railway line and are expected to reach Huludao, 51 *li* northeast of Xingcheng, within a day or two.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 21st] The weather in Tianjin is turning cold, and winter defense has begun. Military and police deployments have been strengthened in the urban and suburban areas. Patrol teams have been formed in the city, combined with police security, and traffic is restricted at night, ensuring the safety of Tianjin.

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 21st] Government military observers announced today that the railway from Shanhaiguan to Shenyang is a total of 750 *li*, of which 240 *li* have already been occupied by the National Army. The remaining 510 *li* should not be difficult to occupy soon, because the Beining Railway runs parallel to the Liao River, with no defenses in between. It is claimed that if the National Army reaches Shenyang, it will be unprecedented in Chinese military history. There have been no previous reports of troops from inside the pass fighting their way outside the pass. The Communist army is continuing to concentrate troops in the Northeast and recruit new soldiers, some of whom are workers and Japanese soldiers.

[Another Dispatch] Military authorities reported that the invading forces of the Communist 16th Military Region are still attempting to obstruct the National Army's landing. It is possible that a fierce war will break out in the Jinzhou area, with the Communist army's goal clearly being to defend the seaport of Shenyang. As for inside the Great Wall, the National Army's 92nd and 94th Armies are using Tianjin and Beijing as bases to advance north, with the goal of passing through the Communist-occupied areas of northeastern Hebei to reach the other passes of the Great Wall.

[Another Dispatch] A portion of the National Army has advanced to Gubeikou (70 *li* north of Beiping) and will soon establish contact with Beiping. However, the railway from Beiping to Gubeikou was recently damaged by the Communist army. National Army troops in Tianjin and Tangshan are also advancing north, heading directly for Xifengkou.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 21st] The 11th War Area announced that the National Army will continue to deploy to North China to reinforce the 92nd and 94th Armies.

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, November 21st] Strict inspections of people entering and leaving Beiping's fifteen city gates have begun to prevent armed Communist elements from infiltrating the city. The two airports in the western and southern suburbs of Beiping have also been placed under strict guard. Few aircraft are kept at the airports overnight, as the Communist army is currently very close to the western suburban airport, only about one *li* away.

### Communist Army Actively Implements Conscription

[Central News Agency Yulin Dispatch, 20th] After returning to Yan'an, Communist leader Mao Zedong is actively implementing a conscription policy in various places, using the pretext of the "liberated area" expanding.

[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch, 20th] Commander-in-Chief of the Second War Area, Yan Xishan, flew back to Taiyuan from Chongqing at 4:00 PM on the 20th.

### Farewell Changchun

— Our Correspondent Xi Hong

At noon on November 17th, ten large transport planes, which had just landed at Changchun Airport five minutes earlier, suddenly took off again, carrying 190 provincial chairmen, mayors, and special commissioners from the Northeast, who were all in a somber mood, back to Beiping. They were all officials dispatched by the National Government to take over the Northeast. They had been arriving from Chongqing since October 8th, but due to the complex internal and external situation in the Northeast, the takeover work encountered major difficulties, and they were ordered by the government to temporarily move to Beiping. This was the first group to move to Beiping. In the next two or three days, if there were no new major developments, more than 200 personnel from the Northeast Headquarters would be transferred to Beiping. Representing the Northeast Headquarters to remain were a military delegation of six people, led by Deputy Chief of Staff Dong Yanping, who will follow the Soviet headquarters. The decision to move to Beiping was reportedly notified to Soviet Ambassador Petrov by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 14th, and the Northeast Headquarters was ordered to notify the Changchun Soviet Headquarters on the 15th.

The issue of the National Army taking over the Northeast is the core of all difficulties. The military authorities initially planned to have the National Army land in Dalian, but due to the Soviet explanation that the commercial port could not be used for military purposes, the government planned for the National Army to land in Yingkou, Huludao, and Dadonggou, and agreed with the Soviet side to begin on November 10th. On the 6th, they received a notice from the Soviet Headquarters that the Eighth Route Army had arrived in the above-mentioned areas, making the landing unsafe. The originally prepared airlift plan was also difficult to implement because only one usable airfield remained near Changchun.

Administratively: the Soviet side had recently asked the provincial mayors to go to various places for the takeover after the 12th, but the takeover of the Changchun municipal government was not included. With the National Army unable to arrive quickly and in large numbers, and the situation in various places not simple, the takeover personnel felt unable to go.

Economically: It is worth noting the establishment of the Changchun Railway Council and the start of postal and telecommunications takeover. As for the major industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast, after a war, even if they were not destroyed by artillery fire, the equipment would still need to be rebuilt. Of the remaining machines, due to the lack of a consistent interpretation of the definition of "war booty," who will take over in the future? How will they be used and managed? This may also become a difficult problem.

Because there is no prospect of overcoming so many difficulties in the short term, the takeover personnel cannot complete their mission, and the significance of residing in Changchun disappears. Therefore, the Chang Headquarters decided to leave a military delegation to reside with the Soviet Headquarters, and the rest of the personnel would be transferred to Beiping. After the Northeast Headquarters notified the Soviet Headquarters of this decision by the government on the 16th, the other party welcomed the dispatch of the military delegation, did not express any opinion on the move to Beiping, and only notified the Third Army to assist.

"This is the government's great decisiveness, great wisdom, and great courage!" At 10:00 AM on the 16th, Director Zhang Jia'ao, replacing Director Xiong Tianyi, who was in Chongqing, announced this major order in the auditorium of the Headquarters, and finally exhorted: "You all came happily, and you must leave happily." However, the heads of the people below the stage were lowered. The atmosphere around the Headquarters was tense for a while that afternoon, but later, with the help of the Soviet army, everything calmed down.

On the morning of the 17th, everyone jumped into the twelve trucks prepared by the Soviet army without eating breakfast. The people nearby who got the news felt like they had fallen from the clouds into a deep valley, wondering if they had been dreaming not long ago. An old woman grasped a stack of full bills, asking someone to bring it to her son far away in Chongqing. Two women, with their children, raised their last hope and asked someone to send a letter to their husband who had been separated for fourteen years. At the airport, when we went to buy breakfast, "You just got off the plane! You must be tired!" The old man selling snacks still thought everyone had just come from Chongqing! After buying some things, the old man quietly asked,

"Japan has surrendered, why is there still no peace?"

"Why haven't our troops come yet?"

"Goodbye, Changchun!" At 12:10 PM, the plane slowly took off. Everyone saw the Northeast mountains and rivers, which had been lost for only about a month, and had been occupied for fourteen years, slowly fading and disappearing. But there was no sense of emptiness in my heart, but a heavier mood. In front of the silver wings was a vast expanse of clouds, rolling up thousands of piles of snow. Some towering peaks showed their faces on this sea of clouds, but some invisible crags were buried beneath this sea of clouds that separated the clear sky from the earth. Any plane flying over this would be lost, or rashly crash into the reefs in the sea of clouds. Human wisdom can create atomic bombs, missiles, wireless X-rays, why can't it produce a gust of wise wind to blow away these clouds? At this time, I once again thought of a conversation with a far-sighted politician a week ago: "The development of relations between the Allied countries in the Northeast will affect the fate of countries along the Pacific coast and even all of humanity." Now, no matter which ship of fate, it has just emerged from the bloody sea of a cruel war. Everyone should be so careful not to row into another bloody sea! (Sent from Beiping on November 19th)

(2) The buildings at Fengledi Station, north of Anyang, were completely destroyed by mobs incited by the Communist army. (3) The Communist army is still collecting public grain, cotton, coarse cloth, and bullets in various districts and villages in Anyang, and collecting stretchers, attempting to invade our National Army. (B) Southern Henan: On the evening of the 16th, more than 3,000 Communist troops captured Panxindian in Luoshan South Township. Chen Zhongqing, deputy regimental commander of the local garrison, is missing. (C) Eastern Henan: (1) On the afternoon of the 16th, more than 6,000 Communist troops were discovered in the Wuyue Liukou area of Minquan, with the intention of invading Shangqiu.

More than 1,000 Communist troops in Huangzhuang, forty *li* east of the county seat, are attempting to invade Dongming.

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 21st] Sources in transportation circles report that incidents of sabotage of transportation in the north continue to occur frequently. According to observations from various telegrams, the Communist army's sabotage of transportation appears to be a concentrated effort to destroy important railway bridges. According to a recent statistic, the number of railway bridges destroyed in the north has reached as many as sixteen, including two on the Jinpu Railway, four on the Pinghan Railway, five on the Beining Railway, two on the Jiaoji Railway, and one each on the Zhengtai, Longhai, and Pinggu Railways.

[Central News Agency Tianjin Dispatch, 20th] Military sources report that the railway between Tuozitou Leizhuang, east of Tangshan, and between Guye and Wuli was sabotaged by bandits on the night of the 14th. In addition, the Lihao railway bridge between Lutai and Tangfang, west of Tangshan, and the Jinxi River to Chadian railway bridge were also sabotaged by bandits on the night of the 14th.

### Regarding the Matter of Saving the Northeast Crisis, It is Reported that We Have Submitted a Proposal to the Soviet Union

Most Northeast Headquarters Personnel Withdrawn

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, November 21st] According to reliable sources, regarding the Sino-Soviet agreement to improve the situation in the Northeast, the Chinese authorities have submitted a proposal to Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, for transmission to Moscow. The Soviet Union has agreed to allow the Chinese government to use the airfields in northern Manchuria. This concession, however, has no practical value because technical limitations make it impossible for our airlift to proceed smoothly.

[Reuters Chongqing Dispatch, 21st] The main point of contention in the current military conflict between the Nationalists and Communists is the control of political power in the Northeast. The Soviet authorities are closely monitoring the armed conflict between the two sides. According to unconfirmed reports from Chongqing, Sino-Soviet negotiations will begin in the near future to discuss and resolve the Northeast dispute. Last month, on the 13th, Northeast Headquarters Director Xiong Shihui and a certain Soviet official held negotiations in Changchun to discuss the issue of the National Army entering the Northeast in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. It is reported that the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely harmonious, but by October 25th, the Soviet attitude suddenly became stronger, and the Communist army simultaneously began to invade the Northeast. This reporter had the opportunity to see a secret military map of the Communist army this past June, which showed the strength and distribution of the Communist army. According to that map, the Communist party clearly had no intention of occupying the Northeast in June. However, today, Yan'an has announced that Chahar, Rehe, and most of Liaoning are Communist-liberated areas and will be defended by the Communist army, preventing the National Army from entering. Initially, the areas occupied by the Communist army were Yingkou and Huludao, which later expanded to Qinhuangdao to Fanyang along the Beining Railway line, and finally expanded to the vicinity of Shenyang and Changchun, and the situation is deteriorating. The officials sent by Chairman Chiang to Changchun had to withdraw from the Northeast.

### U.S. Congressman Judd Asks Congress to Continue Aiding Our Government; Abandoning China is Equivalent to Abandoning Victory; China, the United States, and Australia Form Committee on Economic Policy Toward Japan

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 21st] U.S. Congressman Judd recently asked Congress to continue to aid the central government of China, stating that we went to war with Japan because we finally realized that we must never allow Japan to rule China. Japan's rule over China is equivalent to ruling all of Asia. How can we abandon China and let the victory we have paid such a great price for go to waste? Chairman Chiang would have had countless opportunities to obtain peace if he had been willing to leave the United Nations earlier. The war is not completely over, and there are still about two million Japanese troops in China waiting to surrender and be sent back to their country. We cannot abandon Chairman Chiang in order to seek peace. He also stated that so far, all we have done is defeat Germany and Japan. As for whether we will obtain victory in the war, it depends entirely on what we do in the future. Whatever force or ideology can dominate the reconstruction of Europe and the development of Asia will be victorious.

### Xu Kan Talks in Nanjing: No Worries About Military or Civilian Food

### Editorial: Meeting Readers Again

Today, with the re-publication of the Shen Bao, our feelings are mixed, as if old friends are reuniting with our cherished readers. Ten thousand words and a thousand phrases cannot express how we feel.

The Shen Bao is Shanghai's newspaper, the newspaper of the Shanghai citizens, and the old newspaper that originated in Shanghai and spread throughout the country. It is linked to Shanghai's development with seventy-three years of history. Today, we resume publication, bearing feelings of grief and joy, to meet our readers again.

In the past, the Shen Bao has made some humble contributions to China's journalism, culture, and even society in general. Except for a brief suspension of publication in the 26th year (1937) of the Republic due to the National Army's westward retreat, there had never been an interruption in its publication record. However, since the start of the Pacific War, the Shen Bao was seized by the enemy and puppets, losing its freedom of action. Although the Shen Bao continued to be published thereafter, it no longer represented the free will of the Shen Bao and was legally and logically invalid. Therefore, with the newspaper's republication today, its numbering continues from December 8, the 30th year (1941) of the Republic of China. In these four years, the world has undergone significant changes, and China has also undergone significant changes. Our long-term resistance, under the leadership of the wise Chairman Chiang, finally achieved ultimate victory. However, because the Shen Bao lost its freedom of will, it failed to provide a faithful record of the changes in the world. This is something we feel guilty about and is the most painful.

During the early stage of the War of Resistance, when the National Army retreated westward and the Shanghai concessions still existed, we not only relied on American merchants who refused to succumb to the enemy, but also published in Hankou and Hong Kong successively. During this period, Shen Bao reporter Jin Jinhua Ting was assassinated by the enemy and puppets, while other colleagues were either intimidated or refused to surrender, enduring hardships while maintaining their integrity. All of this is sufficient for our Shen Bao to forever maintain its upright spirit. However, no matter what, although the Shen Bao has regained its innocence today, it is meeting readers again with four years of wounds. Our feelings are similar to those of the thousands of Shanghai citizens who were stranded and suffered under the tyranny of the enemy and puppets. The suffering of the Shanghai citizens and the suffering of the people in the recovered areas should be the Shen Bao's suffering. Today, old friends meet, and we all harbor heavy hearts, and only we can truly understand each other's feelings.

Without grief, one cannot feel the true joy. Today, the arduous War of Resistance has achieved its expected goal. The enemy, who claimed they could make us submit within three months, is now kneeling before us and our allies. The suffering endured by our compatriots during these eight years of resistance is truly indescribable. After hardship comes sweetness. Now that the enemy has surrendered, we are stepping into the historical stage of national reconstruction with joyful hearts. At this moment, the Shen Bao is meeting readers again, and readers should not find it difficult to imagine our joy.

Indeed, what lies before us should not make us overly joyful. Although the enemy has surrendered, domestic transportation and order still need to be restored, and the international situation is not yet fully clear. Even the various measures in the so-called recovered areas may not be entirely as we expected. However, the fact that the War of Resistance was able to end victoriously is enough to make us joyful. This War of Resistance is unprecedented in the history of the Chinese nation. Today, with the republication of the Shen Bao, we would first like to express our infinite condolences and respect to the countless soldiers and civilians who died in the War of Resistance. If not for their sacrifice, where would we be today? Although Shanghai was occupied by the enemy for a long time, it also had a history of heroic martyrs in the early stage of the War of Resistance, and the successive sacrifices of journalists have allowed the national spirit to forever remain in the Whangpoo. Now, facing the stage of national reconstruction, Shanghai, as the premier city in the country, will surely demonstrate even more in this arduous work, so as to complement the heroic and martyred historical events of the early stage of the War of Resistance.

Today, with the republication of the Shen Bao, we must first explain that it is a privately run newspaper. The Shen Bao, as the name suggests, is not only Shanghai's newspaper, but it also intends to report the people's hidden troubles and report the people's sentiments. Today, if the people have any hidden grievances, we will publicize them. Today, if the people have any opinions on the future of national reconstruction, we are willing to express them. The Shen Bao is a public tool for the Shanghai citizens, and by extension, it is also a public tool for the people of the entire country. We will continue to serve as a mouthpiece for the people, in accordance with our past intentions of serving the people.

In the past, the Shen Bao has made some efforts in academics and culture. It has successively published the China Grand Map, provincial maps, the Shen Bao Yearbook, and the Shen Bao Monthly. It has also established supplementary schools and scholarships. After years of trauma, our current capabilities may not be the same as in the past, but our desire to strive for academics and culture is no different from the past. Academics and culture are the foundation of national reconstruction. If we do not make fundamental efforts in academics and culture, we will inevitably rely on foreign countries for everything, which is contrary to the grand plan of national reconstruction. In the future, the Shen Bao's efforts in this area, although there are no specific plans to speak of at present, we are still willing to maintain our original intentions and make a small contribution.

In addition, there is something else we must mention, which is that the establishment of a democratic country should be based on just public opinion. In the past, newspapers often used "recording everything that is heard" as a slogan, resulting in a vast and complex content, which only confused readers and even invisibly increased social disturbances, requiring the country to cause chaos. The Shen Bao's republication does not have any lofty ideals, but only hopes to serve readers as a faithful news broadcaster and to be a pioneer of just public opinion for the country. Under the banner of freedom of the press, it will do its best to discern and select, so as not to allow the dissemination of news to have the effect of reversing right and wrong. When publishing an event or making a statement, it must be carefully considered whether it is beneficial to the people and the masses, and whether it is helpful to the overall situation of the country and the world. Therefore, the report of faithful news and the promotion of fair public opinion are another aspect that we should strive for in the future.

The world is changing rapidly, and the country is experiencing many difficulties. There are many things that need to be discussed. From now on, the Shen Bao will meet with readers every day, and it will also contribute its humble views to readers every day. The republication is rushed, so let us stop here for now. We hope that readers will give us guidance at any time, correct our shortcomings, so that the Shen Bao can be renewed every day. This is what my colleagues and I wish for.

[This Newspaper] Yesterday, it was rumored in the city that General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the U.S. Pacific Forces, will come to Shanghai for an informal visit within the next few days. The reporter inquired with the U.S. military authorities in Shanghai about MacArthur's whereabouts. It was said that, as of last night, the Shanghai base headquarters had not received any news of MacArthur's arrival in Shanghai. Yesterday, a Western newspaper in Shanghai had a record of this, and said that MacArthur would meet with his nephew, who is currently serving as a lieutenant in the U.S. Military Police Corps, when he comes to Shanghai.

According to a senior official at General Wedemeyer's headquarters, they were unaware of the news that General MacArthur would fly to Shanghai from Japan. As for whether Mr. MacArthur will visit Shanghai in the future, this is possible, but at present, it cannot be confirmed that there is such a plan. According to Lieutenant Colonel Ke Aidai, according to recent reports, Mr. MacArthur has decided to go to the United States within a few days to report to the Washington authorities.

The repatriation of Japanese soldiers to their country began in Qingdao and Tanggu in the middle of last month, with approximately 3,000 people per day being supplied with ships by the Seventh Fleet. However, technical personnel are still allowed to stay in China. 70,000 Japanese soldiers in the Beiping area have not yet been disarmed and are also being repatriated. In addition, the Eleventh War Zone, which governs Hebei and Shandong provinces, is now under the order of Chairman Chiang to compile a statistical report on the military and property losses suffered by China during the Sino-Japanese War for submission to Pauley.

[United Press Agency, Beiping, 21st] The new Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Barber, stated that the rumor that the U.S. 1st Marine Division will begin to withdraw from North China is "not true at all." It is still impossible to answer how long the U.S. military will remain stationed here.

### Nuremberg International Tribunal Continues Trial of Nazi War Criminals; Twenty Defendants Plead Not Guilty

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 21st] When twenty Nazi leaders were publicly tried today, Göring and the other defendants' lawyers appealed against the legal basis of the war crimes trial, believing that if the trial could be based on international law and not create laws without authorization, it would be able to make a greater contribution to the progress of the world. The presiding judge, Lawrence, rejected the appeal and ordered the defendants to present their defense on the main points of the indictment. At the beginning of the court session, U.S. Chief Prosecutor Jackson stated the reasons for the indictment. The full text was 61 pages, detailing the history of the development of Nazism and its leaders, stating that the main plaintiff in this case is actually the culture of the world. The twenty people sitting in the defendant's seat today represent the darkest and most heinous forces in society. No matter how difficult the state of the country is, no matter how dissatisfied it is with the current situation, it must never be improved through illegal aggression. The crimes of the defendants are innumerable, mainly including consolidating Nazi power, launching aggression, colluding with Japan, and establishing political police. After the presiding judge announced a 15-minute recess, the lawyers talked with the defendants. The court was reopened at 11:00 a.m., and the presiding judge ordered the defendants to begin their defense. Göring first stepped to the microphone and pleaded not guilty. Hess only said the word "no", causing laughter from the audience. The presiding judge said that this meant pleading not guilty. Göring said, "As far as the meaning of the indictment is concerned, I do not recognize that I have committed a crime." Rosenberg, Frank, and Flick said the same as Ribbentrop. Former German financier Schacht only said the words "not guilty". General Dotel said, "I plead not guilty, because God also believes that what I have done is just a responsibility of my job." At that time, Göring stood up to speak, but the court stopped him, saying that only his defense lawyer was allowed to speak. At 12:26, the court announced an adjournment for continuation. All twenty defendants who appeared in court today pleaded not guilty.

### Morning Friends Cup Game Yesterday: Liangxi Barely Wins Over Green Forest, V Team Narrowly Escapes Flying Horse's Clutches

The Morning Friends Cup Group A games last night did not attract a very large audience because the teams' appeal was not very strong, but the two games were both tense. In the end, both were decided by a single point.

In the first game, V Team played Flying Horse. At the beginning of the game, V Team seemed to be doing well, taking the lead step by step, and Shi Mingxing was very active, arguably the best player. However, after 11 to 5, Flying Horse suddenly gained momentum, with Yuan Danan scoring every shot. V Team seemed to be hindered and fell into a slump. In the first half, Flying Horse led 20 to 17. After the start of the second half, the competition between the two sides was fierce, and when they were tied at 23 points each, Flying Horse scored eight points in a row, forcing V Team to call a timeout. After discussing strategy, they really managed to close the gap, with Xia Li and Bian Chui both scoring, gradually overtaking them. Until the final buzzer, V Team finally beat Flying Horse 36 to 34.

The second game was Liangxi versus Green Forest. The former had famous players such as Zhuo Guorong, Chen Xuesong, Yang Yuanlong, and Zhang Jinxuan, while the latter was a group of young players, but under the guidance of Qian Xuchang, they were methodical in terms of tactics and attitude. After the start of the game, Zhang Jinxuan of Liangxi scored two points first with a free throw, but Green Forest responded calmly and immediately took the lead. Chen Guozhen and Lin Shaohua scored repeatedly. On the other hand, Liangxi seemed out of sync, Yang Yuanlong was unusually rusty, and Chen Xuesong seemed to be fighting alone. However, because they were more experienced, their score was not far behind. Green Forest, on the other hand, was a little inexperienced, inevitably committing too many fouls, but their shots were still accurate, and they kept up the chase, even surpassing them at times. The scores fluctuated, with only a point or two separating them. By the end of the first half, Green Forest narrowly won 15 to 14. After the start of the second half, the situation remained the same, with Green Forest always leading by three or four points. Although Liangxi wanted to rally, they had no chance. With one minute and thirty seconds left, Chen Xuesong and Zhang Jin scored brilliant shots, and before long the time ran out. Liangxi barely won 23 to 21, and Green Forest suffered a bitter defeat.

### Introducing the National Kindergarten Normal School

— Chen Heqin

The National Kindergarten Normal School is the first national kindergarten normal school in the country, established in October 1940, located in Taihe, Jiangxi. Students are recommended by provinces, cities, and counties. In the past two years, 189 graduates have been eagerly recruited by various parties to serve as directors or teachers in kindergartens and lower grades. The vigorous development of kindergarten education in various provinces in recent years can be said to be due to the cultivation of kindergarten teachers over the years!

When the kindergarten normal school was first founded, it suffered many hardships. I recall that when teachers and students came to the school from all over, they saw that the school site was a barren mountain. So all the teachers and students invigorated their spirits, ran up the mountain, cleared the thorns, cut down trees, carried stones, and engaged in the construction of ideal school buildings and the organization of transportation. As a result, they built one office building, one classroom building, nine dormitory buildings, and two studio buildings. At this time, the joy of living in peace that the teachers and students gained far outweighed the labor of their hands and feet. After class, walking around, one could see the four mountains surrounding them, the pine forests dense, the evening wind blowing, the pine waves rushing, and the ancient pagoda in the setting sun, which was extremely charming.

In the common beliefs of teachers and students, we have established three creeds, which can be seen in the school's educational propositions and material: (1) Be a person, be a Chinese, be a modern Chinese. (2) Do middle school, do Chinese education, do Chinese seeking progress. (3) Big nature, big society, are living teaching materials.

Recently, in view of the importance of kindergarten education, the central government intends to move the kindergarten normal school's attached kindergarten normal college to Shanghai for continued operation in order to actively promote it. It is said that it will be realized soon.

Because I am currently serving as a supervisor of the Municipal Education Bureau in Shanghai, assisting Director to handle the post-war educational rehabilitation work in Shanghai, and intend to use new educational methods to guide the city's education staff and build a new education in Shanghai. If the kindergarten college can move to Shanghai, I will have another opportunity to experiment with kindergarten education, and I sincerely hope that it will be realized soon.

### Du Yuesheng Convenes All Sectors to Discuss Ways to Stabilize Prices; Opinions Have Been Drafted and Telegraphed to Chairman Chiang

Du Yuesheng, President of the Shanghai Local Association, leads Chairman Chiang's telegram, expressing great concern about the prices in Shanghai.

It is said that unscrupulous merchants from Chongqing are rushing to purchase and hoard goods, trying to make huge profits, which has led to a chain reaction, stimulating the market and causing prices to rise. The local government should strictly investigate and crack down on this matter, and it is their unshirkable responsibility, but it also depends on exerting the power of social justice so that unscrupulous merchants know to restrain themselves. I hope that you, brother, who are highly respected and familiar with the situation in Shanghai, will express your opinions, contact upright people from all walks of life, and find ways to assist the government in stabilizing prices and lowering them. I am deeply hopeful. Chiang Kai-shek, Military Seal."

After the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of Shanghai, the comrades of the Lone Army who remained here received the care of Commander Tang, Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor Wu, and people from all walks of life.

### Production and Sales Affect Yarn and Cloth: Different Performance of Coarse and Fine Cloth

As the production of yarn and cloth increases daily, and with the widespread sale of inexpensive cloth, the market is gradually stabilizing. If transportation resumes normally and supplies meet the needs of various places, all receiving yarn factories should quickly resume work so that supply and demand can be balanced.

Yesterday, bleached cloth was 　　, and prices remained firm due to weak inventories. The sales of fine cloth were sluggish, and the upstream goods of 　factories were still in good demand because 　 Gang and other Gangs continued to absorb colored cloth, and prices also turned from weak to firm. If transportation is smooth, yarn and cloth should be promising in the end.

Recently, American cotton has not arrived, and distant water cannot quench the present thirst. There is demand for 42-count thread from cotton weaving factories and traders, and the price is very firm. Coarse yarn is flat and sluggish, but 20-count yarn from famous brands continues to be purchased by traders, and its price is uniquely popular. Sales of white cloth are sluggish, but the demand from dyeing factories is still there.

Only Zhuzhi and Yuanhong varieties of dried lychee have been sporadically transported by sailing ships this year. Jingshan lychee produced in Guangdong has not yet arrived due to obstructed transportation. According to recent telegrams, it was planned to be transported by a certain ship, but it has not been loaded due to some reason. Currently, only a small number of cold-stored goods are available on the market, so the price is more expensive. Yuanzhi is 120,000 yuan, Bianzhi is 140,000 to 150,000 yuan, Xin Yuanhongzhi is 100,000 yuan, and Jian Lanzhuzhi is 80,000 to 75,000 yuan.

### Market Conditions

Gold, Silver, and Currency

Yesterday (the 21st), the market was extremely calm, and industry insiders' interest was also weak, as buyers were even more lazy. The situation of the KMT-CPC issue improved, and it was difficult for speculators to make waves, and the trend was also sluggish, so the result was slightly lower than the previous day.

The US dollar tended to weaken with the price of gold, but there was quite a bit of arbitrage. There were repeated ups and downs along the way. The Hong Kong dollar, because the Guangdong gang received telegrams from Hong Kong and Macau that the old currency was worth about one-third of the old currency there and circulated in the market, worth about 90 yuan in Shanghai, the buying trend was revived. The "1" header in 1936 once rose to 78 yuan, and the "2" header and 1937 rose to 76 yuan. There were buyers. The last slight return was small. The result was half a percent better than the previous day.

There were quite a few retail buyers of silver dollars, which were extremely stable. Throughout the day, it struggled between 450 yuan and 470 yuan. The underground gold and certificate businesses continued to loosen due to the complete lack of prospects, but the external demand for funds was urgent, with some offering more than two corners, but the average still stood at between 1.5 and 1.8 corners.

Securities and government bonds: After turning stable the day before yesterday, the initial opening was still flat. Midway, after the North Gang divested from gold, floating funds returned to their embrace, and large investors bought in large quantities on behalf of the North Gang, and the market price suddenly jumped. At noon, many floats made profits and closed out, and there was a small pullback after the rise. The result was still 10% to 15% better than the previous day. The reason why there was a sudden activity was that after the Municipal Government prohibited the trading of Chinese stocks, there were no transactions yesterday. As a result, general retail investors suddenly shifted their purpose to government bonds that no one cared about. However, the public place is still closed for business. Because Guang Gang favored it, and yarn factories turned from weak to firm, the floating funds in the hands of retail investors came to absorb them 　at low prices. As a result, the various 　　stocks returned to about 10% better than the previous day. In the dark market, the turnover was 300 yuan for Meiya, 400 yuan for yarn factory, 23 yuan for Jingfu, 27 yuan for Xinguang, and 21 yuan for Qinxing.

Fuels: In the coal market, high-grade goods such as white coal blocks and top-grade bituminous coal blocks are exhausted, and those who hold goods are unwilling to let go easily because they can live in them. The price followed the previous trend and rose steadily. Top-grade bituminous coal is in high demand by Jiangnei riverboats, and is also quite firm. Charcoal and charcoal from various roads are surging, and appetite is also healthy, so bidding prices are high, but they are still cheaper than coal prices.

Woolen cloth: The woolen cloth transaction was deserted, because customers from various places were mostly watching, and the street was also stagnant. In addition, the silver roots were still tight, resulting in a slight decline in market prices compared to the previous day.

Tinplate: Recently, tinplate transactions have been mostly retail and less wholesale, because most factories have not yet resumed work, so actual sales are sluggish, but customer transactions are still lively, but mostly for kerosene tank blanks, because the inventory of Asia Petroleum and Socony was invaded by the Japanese in the past, but now they are flowing out one after another and filling the market.

Tung oil: Yesterday, only Jiangbei gang absorbed Hongjiang oil, and the sales of other full-degree white oil, etc., were very narrow. In this situation, the market sentiment also continued to settle, and the selling prices of each item were on the original route, with white oil at 350 yuan per catty and Hongjiang oil at 400 yuan.

Tea: The trend is still popular, because 　demand buyers' appetite is still happy, so those who need cash flow in the middle are still plugging out, but there is no great stimulus. The quotations for red and green tea are each showing their colors, and by the time the market closes, the results are all much higher than the previous day's grinding price.

Rayon: With the gold market weak, it followed the trend and softened. It is estimated that 120 denier Tianqiao, the current buying price is 620,000, the selling price is 640,000, the warehouse receipt buying price is 475,000 yuan, the selling price is 50,000 yuan, and there are few other transactions, it is said.

Pharmaceuticals: The market is 　 falling, with saccharin at 26,500 yuan, quinine at 33,000 yuan, Bagua Dan at 1,650 yuan, and Wan Jin Oil at 1,800 yuan.

Free Talk

Short Talk

### A Chat About Free Talk

— Huang Jiayin

After Free Talk could not be free, the editor went far away to Chongqing, to breathe the free air of the free zone. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and Shanghai has seen the light of day again, Shen Bao has resumed publication, and Free Talk has regained its freedom. The editor would like to take this opportunity to chat freely with all the old readers.

Today, newspapers have become an indispensable spiritual food for the people. I remember when I was in Chongqing, the editor went out for a walk one morning and saw a housewife who had just returned from the vegetable market. She was holding a full vegetable basket in one hand, and on top of the vegetables was a copy of the day's newspaper. Elevating the newspaper to the same level as daily food made a deep impression on the editor, who felt that in the past eight years of the War of Resistance, some places in China had indeed made progress.

The supplement is a supplementary reading material to the newspaper's news section, with the important mission of supplementing news reports, expanding readers' knowledge, and educating the public. Therefore, the editor feels that his responsibility is really not small. For the sake of the mission that a Mahayana supplement should have, I hope that all authors and readers will help a lot.

I think that a good spiritual food, like our daily food, must be hygienic, delicious, and at the same time nutritious. In other words, the writing in the supplement must have a clear and correct point of view in order to give readers a good influence. The writing in the supplement must be popular and interesting in order to arouse readers' interest in reading. But popular is by no means vulgar, and interesting does not necessarily have to be low-level. In addition, the writing in the supplement must be factual, so that readers can come into contact with reality, absorb its essence, and increase their knowledge.

In the future, Free Talk hopes to be based on the above simple principles. The editor hopes to provide the readers of Shen Bao with a hygienic, delicious, and nutritious spiritual food every day, and hopes that all writer friends will provide a lot of material.

Correspondence

### The Hearts of the People of the Northeast Have Not Died

— Tian Mu

——Correspondence from Changchun

At 5:00 p.m. the day before Double Ten Day, the first plane carrying the personnel of the Northeast Headquarters of the Central Government arrived in Changchun, the land that had been occupied for fourteen years. The person who went to the airport to pick up the plane was General Garlov, the Soviet garrison commander of Changchun.

After the news of Japan's surrender was officially announced, the people of Northeast, who had endured it for fourteen years, exploded all at once. The people of Northeast, who were unwilling to be slaves to a conquered country, and the puppet Manchukuo army, had conflicts with the Japanese army that were not small. The incidents of ordinary people fighting the Japanese were also happening anytime and anywhere. It was not until August 18, when the Soviet army entered Changchun, that the conflict stopped. The officials of the puppet Manchukuo were arrested or fled. With the consent of the Soviet army, under the leadership of the Northeast Party Affairs Joint Office, a celebration victory conference and a temporary Changchun Special Municipal Government were established. The work of welcoming the National Army and maintaining local security had a destination at this time.

The roads in Changchun City are wide and flat. No matter whether they are Chinese or Japanese shops, they are not open for business. Therefore, the situation in the city is quite desolate.

The enthusiasm of the people of Changchun for welcoming the National Army is certainly at its extreme, and the Japanese also have great expectations for the National Army. The Japanese Residents Association also set up many wooden signs at important intersections, with slogans such as "Welcome the meritorious Central Army" and "Long live President Chiang."

There are not many Soviet troops seen on the streets, because they have been leaving one after another. However, there are still Soviet guards at important traffic intersections. The traffic command in the city is also handled by Soviet women's auxiliary teams. American-made Jeep cars and General Motors' ten-wheeled trucks are very common on the streets of Changchun, but the paint on the body is not the American white five-pointed star, but the Soviet red star. The traffic regulations in Changchun were originally on the left, but since the Soviet army moved in, they have been changed to the right. Datong Road has been renamed Stalin Road, and Datong Square has become Stalin Square. A monument to Soviet soldiers who died in battle is being rushed to completion in the square, with a deadline of the end of October. According to the Soviet side, they sacrificed more than 8,000 officers and soldiers in the war against Japan.

The Japanese, who used to consider themselves as emperors, are now drooping their heads and are in a mess. Since Japan surrendered and the puppet Manchukuo collapsed, the rations that were usually better than those of the Chinese have been stopped at the same time. At first, they could only eat a little food that they had hoarded, but then they had to set up street stalls and sell some of the things they could sell, and then exchange them for food from the Chinese. Now, some embarrassed Japanese people are already selling twists and fritters in Chinese fritter shops to maintain their lives.

Although the general Chinese people have suffered for fourteen years, when they go to the streets, everyone is very excited. When the Jilin Provincial Party Department invited the reception personnel to visit the party department at Sanmalu, the people surrounded the air force personnel so tightly that no water could leak through. Everyone shouted slogans such as "Long Live the Republic of China" and "Welcome the Central 　".

Because the formal reception has not yet begun, the currency in circulation in the city is still the banknotes of the puppet Manchukuo and the military tickets issued by the Soviet army. What I saw earlier were ten yuan and one hundred yuan, and the military tickets were only ten yuan. The general prices in Changchun are very low. A brand of cigarettes called Danggui, which is better than Huafu brand in Beiping, sells for only seven or eight yuan per pack. It is said that a woolen suit can be bought for about 2,000 yuan. However, because the reception personnel are not allowed to bring legal tender, and there is no legal tender circulating in the market at all, the exchange rate between legal tender and the current currency system has not yet been determined, so it is difficult to say whether things are expensive or cheap.

Many people may think that young people in the Northeast under the age of twenty will definitely not speak Chinese anymore, but that is not the case. I once talked with a sixteen-year-old young man for an hour or two. It is said that in the elementary school curriculum, the time spent on Japanese and Manchu (i.e., Mandarin) accounted for a ratio of three to one. The teachers were also three Japanese and one Chinese. Although you must speak Japanese at school, you still speak Mandarin and write Chinese characters when you go home. Although he is a sixteen-year-old child, his national and ethnic ideas are not lower than those of general primary and secondary school students in the rear. "China will not perish" is not just a casual remark. The people of the Northeast, who have been occupied for fourteen years, can serve as iron proof that "the hearts of the people have not died." It is said that after Japan surrendered, an old lady in her seventies said: "I am willing to die even if I see the flag of the blue sky and white sun hanging all over the street again!"

Because the Northeast, which has been occupied for fourteen years, can no longer find a national flag, the reception personnel specially brought a lot of national flags from Chongqing. When I was in Beiping, I saw that the streets were full of old flags from eight years ago, but when I arrived in Changchun, they were all brand new party and national flags. Even the doors of the Japanese are hung with a national flag and a Soviet flag.

### New Hope

— Zhang Mengzhao

——Congratulations on the Re-publication of Shen Bao——

If it is said that: "Ideal is the mother of fact," then, "Hope is the collection of success!" With the new situation of "Glorious Victory," there is a new hope of "Glorious Victory!" Since I received the good news of the re-publication of Shen Bao, I have been so happy that I cannot sleep! I think: the old Shen Bao, which was founded in the Tongzhi period, has a long and glorious history and has always held the authority of the journalistic world. Ask the women and children on the street, no one does not know the "old Shen Bao." Even hawkers and coolies all know the genuine and old-fashioned "old Shen Bao." Before the war, it was well-known, and after the war, it fell into the hands of the enemy and puppets, and readers did not sigh and regret it! Is it said that Shen Bao has no future? Is there no hope? But victory has come, and the demons have disappeared! Shen Bao has been re-published! Shen Bao has washed away the stale dregs and gained the new hope of new life! This new hope is full of vigor! This new hope contains the seeds for irrigating the new China! From brilliant and glorious, from radiant and colorful! The rejuvenated, brand-new, lively, vigorous old Shen Bao is meeting readers again in a new posture! I am full of ardent new hope for Shen Bao, and I will more enthusiastically support and wish Shen Bao eternal life with the spirit of loving to read and love to write as before the war!

### New Weapons of 1946

— Yu Fan

During this war, mostly older weapons were used on the battlefield. However, behind the scenes, new weapons were constantly being researched and invented, inevitably leading future wars to the fantastical stage of "a push of a button, killing people thousands of miles away."

Now that the war is over, the U.S. Air Force Technical Research Department, in order to prevent many accomplishments from being buried in obscurity, recently opened an "Air Force Exhibition." The scale is grand, and the exhibits are diverse and beautiful. Some featured new weapons are as follows:

"Azon" is a type of radio-controlled bomb without a stack. The bomber can control the tail fins of the bomb, making it go left or right. It has already been used on the battlefields of Burma and Italy.

"Razon" is a radio and television-controlled gliding bomb. It glides for a distance of twenty miles, and within this range, radio commands can be used to make it move up, down, left, and right at will. The bomber observes the trajectory of the bomb on a television screen and directly commands it until it hits the target.

An aircraft engine with 5,000 horsepower (the engine of a Superfortress is only 2,500 horsepower).

An American-style V2 rocket.

Aircraft propellers that can rotate in opposite directions, and a propeller with reverse torsion, allowing giant aircraft to land on extremely short runways.

The vertical takeoff glider is a combination of a helicopter and a glider, weighing only fifty pounds. It is very suitable for a single person to carry and deploy behind enemy lines.

A three-lens aerial camera. A single photograph can capture from one end of the horizon to the other. There is also a new type of powerful searchlight for aerial reconnaissance photography at night.

Science

### Scientific News

— Chen Yin

Astronomers have used a specially made refracting telescope to discover a gigantic red planet, millions of times larger than our sun in volume, but so small in density that it is almost like a ball of empty red light.

According to recent scientists' estimates, the atmospheric layer on the moon is only one-millionth the mass of the atmosphere on Earth.

Recently, scientists predicted that the next peak period of sunspot expansion will occur earlier, before May 1948.

Short Masterpiece

### The Enemy (Part One)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

Foreword

During World War II, Shanghai readers did not see many famous foreign works. In the future, we plan to introduce some of these works in the "Free Talk" section. This article is a short masterpiece by the famous American female writer Pearl S. Buck, which won the 1943 American O. Henry Memorial Award. Ms. Buck grew up in China and became famous for her book "The Good Earth." In 1938, she won the Nobel Prize in Literature. This article tells the story of a Japanese doctor who studied in the United States and an American prisoner of war. The full text will be published in ten days. — Editor

Dr. Sadao Hoki's house was built on the seacoast of Japan, where he used to play as a child. This low, square stone house was built on a rock rising beside a narrow beach, lined with many bowing pine trees. As a child, Sadao often climbed these pine trees like he saw people in the South Seas climbing trees to pick coconuts, using his bare feet to climb. His father used to take him to those islands in the South Seas, and his father never forgot to tell this serious little boy beside him: "These islands in front are the stepping stones of Japan's future."

Sadao asked seriously: "Where are we going from here?"

His father replied: "Who knows? Who can limit our future? Our future depends entirely on ourselves to create."

Sadao remembered these words in his heart, just as he remembered everything his father said. His father never joked with him, never played with him, and painstakingly taught his only son. Sadao knew that his education was his father's greatest concern. For this reason, he was sent to the United States at the age of twenty-two to study surgery and medicine. He returned to his country at the age of thirty, and before his death, his father not only saw Sadao become a famous surgeon, but also a famous scientist. Because he is now completing an invention that can completely clean wounds, he was not sent overseas with the army. He also knew that the reason he was still able to stay in Japan was because the old general's illness might require surgery, and this illness is currently being treated with drugs.

The mist is rising from the sea. The unexpectedly warm days a few days ago caused a thick fog to rise from the cold waves at night. Sadao watched the fog obscure the outline of a small island near the shore, then climbed up the beach below the house, enveloping the pine trees. In a few minutes, this fog will envelop the house, and he will go inside, where his wife Hana and their two children are waiting for him.
