### Enemy Warships Around Okinawa Island: Continuing to Sink and Destroy 22 Vessels; Japanese Forces Launch a Large-Scale Combined Land, Sea, and Air Attack

Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 16th: Enemy forces in the southern part of Okinawa Island have suffered severe blows due to Japanese counterattacks. However, they still appear to be actively preparing for an offensive. Japanese troops in the area continue to seize good opportunities, launching artillery strikes or conducting bold advances and charges to disrupt enemy attack preparations. From April 12th to 15th, enemy casualties in the area have been confirmed to be approximately 1,700. The fighting on the Motobu Peninsula is gradually intensifying. Subsequently, Japanese air units continued to fiercely attack enemy warships and mobile units around Okinawa Island. Confirmed results achieved by the Japanese side since April 11th are as follows: One aircraft carrier sunk, one cruiser sunk, one cruiser or transport ship sunk, one destroyer sunk, one transport ship sunk, one vessel of unknown type sunk, two battleships damaged, and thirteen vessels of unknown type damaged.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The battle between Japanese forces and enemy mobile fleet units off the coast of Okinawa Island is becoming increasingly fierce, now forming a seamless, large-scale combined land, sea, and air offensive. Especially from the 12th onwards, elite Japanese fighter squadrons have been moving south along the Ryukyu Islands to challenge enemy defensive air forces, coordinating their attacks with special attack units. The situation is rapidly intensifying. Currently, all Japanese special attack units are actively searching for and engaging enemy mobile fleet units, aiming to annihilate and destroy them. This rapid aerial warfare is characterized by all Japanese special attack unit members willingly sacrificing their lives, greatly boosting morale. The intensity of the fighting can be imagined.

Enemy Landing Forces on Okinawa Suffer Over 8,000 Casualties

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese forces in the southern part of Okinawa Island, with close cooperation between infantry and artillery, have inflicted significant damage on the enemy since the 12th. The enemy offensive has faltered and come to a standstill. However, relying on a large supply of resources, the enemy has been single-mindedly reinforcing their supplies, transporting military supplies under constant artillery fire, preparing for another counterattack. In response, enemy naval gunfire has concentrated around Shuri. Japanese troops stationed in the area are waiting for the enemy, seizing the opportunity to launch a large-scale ambush. The results of the land battle in the southern part of the island from April 12th to 15th, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 12th, are that enemy casualties have reached 1,700. Combined with the previous battles up to the 11th, total casualties for the entire island campaign have reached 6,700. Since landing, enemy personnel losses alone have reached over 8,000, while Japanese losses have been relatively light. Furthermore, the fighting on the Motobu Peninsula in the northern region is also gradually intensifying. Japanese troops stationed in the area continue to launch fierce offensives. On the other hand, enemy small aircraft are actively using the northern and central airfields. On the afternoon of the 15th, Japanese air units launched a strong attack on both airfields. It was confirmed that a major explosion occurred at the central airfield around 6:40 PM, and fires broke out at two locations on the northern airfield around 7:30 PM. Additionally, Japanese special attack units continued to fiercely attack enemy fleet units in the waters surrounding the island.

Japanese Special Attack Unit Valiant Warriors Embrace Death

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): According to a Japanese naval air base dispatch: Japanese naval air units are continuing to attack enemy mobile units around Okinawa Island. After dawn on the 13th, the weather cleared, and another large-scale attack was launched. The valiant warriors all embrace death, departing for the front lines daily, many making the ultimate sacrifice in battle and not returning. The attack units bravely bombed and strafed both the central and northern airfields, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, according to Japanese aerial reconnaissance in the morning, the enemy fleet around Okinawa was gradually decreasing. Reconnaissance revealed that there were still two to three enemy battleships, five to six cruisers, and seventy to eighty large and small transport ships patrolling the waters. Afternoon reconnaissance discovered an enemy mobile unit consisting of three groups, including a total of eight special aircraft carriers and other carriers, in the waters east of the northern tip of Okinawa Island. Dozens of Japanese aircraft attacked between intervals, including the newest fighter planes, and several Kamikaze special attack aircraft supported the operation. The attack unit launched an attack with heavy bombers in the evening and night. From around 11:00 PM until late into the night, they repeatedly attacked and penetrated enemy fleet formations, sinking two of their cruisers and setting fire to one battleship. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. At the same time, torpedo attack units fired hundreds of accurate torpedoes, immediately sinking two enemy special aircraft carriers and one vessel of unknown type, while five other enemy ships caught fire. Detailed results of the Kamikaze special attack unit during the day have not yet been confirmed, as Japanese aircraft dared to launch attacks under strong enemy air defense. It is expected that they will achieve brilliant results. Furthermore, according to enemy broadcasts received by the front-line headquarters, there are statements like, "If the powerful Japanese attacks continue for another week or two, the Pacific War will lead to the greatest tragedy," which shows the bravery of the Japanese attacks and the enemy's fear.

### Over 100 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Air Raids on Keihin; Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Battle Results Yesterday

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM on the 16th that, according to later investigations, the number of enemy aircraft shot down during the raids on the Keihin western city area on the night of April 15th has increased to 70.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 16th: From around 10:30 PM on April 15th, lasting approximately two hours and thirty minutes, approximately 200 enemy B-29 aircraft, mostly concentrating on the southwestern part of Keihin, indiscriminately bombed the area, causing considerable fires in urban areas. All fires were extinguished before 5:00 AM on the 16th. The battle results achieved by Japanese air defense units have been confirmed as follows: 55 aircraft shot down, and over 50 aircraft damaged.

Damage from Bombings Investigated

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Several enemy American B-29 aircraft conducted blind bombing of Tokyo from the night of the 15th to the dawn of the 16th. The targets of this enemy air raid were the southwestern districts of Keihin, which have been confirmed to have caused considerable damage to the districts of Kamata, Omori, and Shinagawa in the capital. Some other districts were also bombed. The Kamata and Uijisaka police stations, the Kamata ward office, and the Azabu post office were all destroyed. Furthermore, Ikegami Honmonji, the head temple of the Nichiren sect, was also completely destroyed. The Imperial Women's Medical College Hospital, Iwawa Women's English Academy, and several secondary and national schools were all hit by bombs and caught fire. The enemy Americans, disregarding humanitarian principles, blindly bombed cultural institutions, further exposing their bestiality. In Kanagawa Prefecture, Kawasaki City suffered the most damage, and part of Yokohama City also experienced major fires, causing the Kawasaki police station, the Nihon University preparatory hospital, Maruko Hospital, and Nakahara Hospital to catch fire. Japanese civilian air defense units and Japanese air defense units cooperated and bravely engaged the enemy. Especially the fire extinguishing and evacuation operations limited enemy actions, resulting in very few casualties in Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture.

Air Raids on Kyushu, Taiwan, and Other Places

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Approximately 100 enemy small carrier-based aircraft and several B-25 aircraft raided the southern Kyushu region again around 0:50 PM on the 16th, bombing and strafing Kagoshima and southern Miyazaki Prefecture, before fleeing at 1:40 PM.

Kagoshima, 16th (Central News Agency): Around 3:30 PM on the 15th, approximately 40 enemy small carrier-based aircraft raided the Osumi Peninsula from the waters off Tanegashima, strafing with machine guns before fleeing south at 4:20 PM.

Taipei, 16th (Central News Agency): Fifteen enemy bombers from the Philippine base raided Hsinchu and Taichung in Taiwan several times during the day on the 15th, indiscriminately bombing military facilities and civilian homes. The Japanese side has confirmed that four B-24 aircraft have been shot down so far. Damage on the ground is still under investigation.

### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Central-Burma Armored Units

Front-Line Base in Burma, 15th (Central News Agency): On the morning of the 12th, Japanese air units fiercely attacked enemy armored units that had invaded the vicinity of Yamethin in central Burma, scoring direct hits on enemy vehicle columns. Five vehicles, including tanks, and a supply depot caught fire, and over 55 vehicles were destroyed.

### Chongqing-US Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb; Laohekou Becomes Ruins; Japanese Forces in South China Complete Defensive Positions

Laohekou, 15th (Central News Agency): Laohekou finally fell on the 8th under the fierce attack of Japanese forces. However, the city center, airfield, wharves, etc., have all been subjected to indiscriminate bombing day and night by enemy American air forces. Almost the entire city has been reduced to ruins. Since the 8th, it has been enveloped in flames, and the Han River has been almost stained red. In the past, the US air force stationed in Chongqing has never launched active counterattacks on captured strongholds, but this operation has implemented a thorough scorched earth tactic, which deserves attention.

Mainland Base, 16th (Central News Agency): Recently, the attacks by the US air force from the Philippine base on the mainland have become increasingly fierce, adopting a strategic bombing approach. It is understood that the enemy American forces began organizing the Philippine base and launching attacks in mid-February. Until mid-March, enemy aircraft targeted coastal shipping, attempting to disrupt sea supply lines. Later, a few enemy aircraft repeatedly raided important locations in South China at night or dawn. After the weather improved this month, enemy aircraft began bombing during the day, presumably aiming to destroy warehouse areas, military facilities, harbors and docks, and Japanese supply equipment. At the same time, the American air force in inland China, mainly fighter planes or mixed with a few bombers, constantly raided Japanese rear bases in Guilin, Liuzhou, Danzhu, Wuzhou, Nanning, etc., attempting to hinder the use of these bases by Japanese forces, but without success. Therefore, the enemy is trying to establish bases closer to the peaceful areas, but Japanese air units have now completed defensive positions, preparing to annihilate the enemy.

Total Counteroffensive Attempt Has Become a Bubble

Front Line in Henan, 15th (Central News Agency): Since last autumn, Chongqing has been loudly calling for a total counteroffensive against Japan, actively making the Fifth War Zone Americanized. However, now that Laohekou has been lost, the enemy's attempt has become a bubble. Before the operation, the enemy deliberately made a lot of noise, but the true story of their so-called June counteroffensive against Japan is nothing more than the fact that Chongqing could no longer deceive or shirk responsibility to the United States due to repeated failures in the Hunan and Guangxi operations, which led to American intervention and the implementation of reforms to the "Anti-Japanese War Front Organization," such as the transfer of the Minister of Military Administration as an example. Chongqing, facing repeated defeats, was concerned about its reputation. On the one hand, it was forced by the United States, so it attempted a counteroffensive against Japan, mobilizing 100,000 students and selecting outstanding educated youth in Yunnan to be reorganized with American-equipped troops into American-style Chongqing troops. In order to strengthen the vanguard of the counteroffensive against Japan, Liu Zhi, a direct descendant of the central government, was transferred to replace Li Zongren as the commander of the Fifth War Zone. Furthermore, after the Stilwell Road was opened, approximately military supplies could be shipped from the United States and supplied to the Fifth War Zone by June, so the enemy dreamed of this June as the best opportunity for a total counteroffensive against Japan. However, Laohekou has been occupied by Japanese forces, and there is no doubt that the enemy's counteroffensive plan has failed.

### Japanese Government Discusses War Disaster Countermeasures

Presenting Damage to the Inner Court

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese government held a cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 5:30 PM on the 16th, discussing various countermeasures for the current war disaster.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese Interior Minister Abe entered the palace at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 16th to report to the Emperor on the situation of the air raid damage this morning.

### Enemy American Strategy Fails; Collapse Not Far Off; Military Experts Analyze the War Situation

Shanghai Report from Central News Agency: Recently, the world war situation, whether in the European or Asian theaters, has become tense, and its development deserves attention. A military expert has recently analyzed the war situation as follows:

Enemy Forces Make No Progress on Okinawa

Regarding the war situation in southern Okinawa, according to enemy reports, after occupying Naha, the enemy forces are stuck near Tsugwa, about five kilometers away, and according to enemy infantry officers' broadcasts, the American forces in that area have suffered the most intense Japanese artillery fire since the beginning of the Pacific War. Now enemy ships are reducing their activity, and even enemy naval gun fire and air support have not been able to achieve anything in the north. Although the enemy has an advantage in initiative and concentrated force, they still cannot make progress, which proves the success of the Japanese operation. It is believed that the enemy forces will soon be defeated. Japanese special attack units are continuously launching fierce attacks day and night on enemy ships and mobile units near Okinawa Island, causing heavy losses to enemy ships in that area. According to the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, over 300 enemy ships have been damaged or destroyed, and 60% of the ships in that area have been destroyed by Japanese forces. Most of the Japanese air forces concentrated in the western part of the Japanese mainland will soon become special attack units to destroy the enemy, and it is believed that the enemy's collapse is not far off. According to enemy statements, Nimitz has not failed in his strategies since the Solomon Islands campaign two years ago, but recently he has been trapped in a quagmire, showing various unfavorable situations. In particular, the sudden death of US President Roosevelt will undoubtedly cause many difficulties for the enemy in dealing with the current situation. According to enemy spokesmen's broadcasts, there are established policies for the US Army and Navy, and even though Roosevelt has died, they will continue to follow Roosevelt's established policies without hindrance. The US Army and Navy's adherence to established policies proves the incompetence of the US military. Operational strategies must have the ability to adapt to circumstances, so the rigid actions of the US military are extremely incompetent. Now the US military has suffered heavy losses at sea and cannot make progress on land, so the enemy American strategy will clearly collapse. Regarding the war situation in north-central Luzon, Japanese forces have launched a fierce annihilation campaign.

Japanese Forces Attack Zhijiang on Two Routes

Regarding the war situation on the mainland, the Japanese army occupied Laohekou a few days ago, and now there are only small battles in the area around Laohekou. According to enemy reports, in an attempt to recapture Ganzhou, the enemy launched a surprise attack, but it was repelled by the skillful advances of the Japanese army. At the same time, according to enemy reports, the Japanese army attacked Zhijiang on two routes. These two lines are both important bases for the US air force in Chongqing, and they are about to be occupied by the Japanese army, showing that the US air force in Chongqing is retreating step by step. The frequency and number of enemy American air raids on Shanghai have decreased, and the frequency and number of raids on the Tianjin-Hankou line and the Guangdong-Hankou line have been reduced and restricted, which is due to the serious impact of the aforementioned Japanese operations. However, in order to cover up the losses, on the one hand, and to decorate the mood and conceal the defeat of the operation due to Roosevelt's death, one plane has launched an air raid on Shanghai one after another. According to the enemy's announcement, the enemy aircraft that raided this time was a patrol plane, and its bombing method was completely blind bombing, with one bomb falling on the river and one bomb falling on civilian homes in northern Shanghai, massacring innocent Chinese civilians, with only three people injured. Therefore, the enemy's attack targets are clear to us. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai should rise up and make full preparations and self-defense measures for this inhumane blind bombing, and should never be shaken by this meaningless bombing.

Regarding the war situation in Burma, the enemy forces in Burma are advancing south from the north, and the Japanese army has bravely repelled them several times. The rainy season is coming soon, so the war situation there will come to an end.

German Army Can Still Fight for Two Years

Regarding the European war, on the Eastern Front, the Soviet offensive on the Oder River, 60 miles from Berlin, has stalled in the past, but has recently shown a tendency to advance again. In particular, the Soviets are launching a concerted attack on the 200 miles between Stettin and Breslau. As for the Vienna defense line in the southeastern part of the Eastern Front, will most of the Soviet troops move south or west? Or will they attack Czechoslovakia? People are doubtful, and it is highly questionable whether the Soviet army will achieve results in the future.

On the Western Front, the British and American troops who crossed the Rhine have launched a large-scale offensive, and there is a tendency to advance towards Hanover. British advance towards Germany. From our current observation of the war situation in Germany, we cannot be optimistic in objectively, and we should not be surprised. Even if the Eastern and Western Fronts unfortunately collapse, it will not have any impact on the Pacific Front. According to Eisenhower, the commander of the Western Front, who recently submitted a report to Roosevelt, the situation in the German fighting in the foothills of the western and central parts of the country may continue for two years. Looking back at the German army, which suffered defeat in the First World War, even if there are any difficulties today, it will be patient to the end. United and fighting. At the same time, the imperialist Britain and the United States and the socialist Soviet Union, although their opinions are consistent for the time being, and they are attacking Germany on the Eastern and Western Fronts, I am afraid that their good dreams will not last long. Different ideologies mean that the time of conflict is not far off. Regarding the British and American combat instructors, in order to end the front and suppress the people, they said that the European war was coming to an end, and they would transfer their forces to the Pacific for operations. Based on the facts, it is difficult to move to the Pacific for operations.

Death of US President Roosevelt Has Impact

Regarding the death of US President Roosevelt, in the future, in the world situation, there will be the greatest dispute. First, the US domestic policy, the most important one, is the issue of the command of the military. Judging from the situation two days ago, such as Marshall and Admiral King, the US Army and Navy generals broadcasted, there is deep doubt about the power of the new President Truman. Their disbelief has begun to sprout. The impact on the morale of the US military is significant, directly affecting operations. The US air raid on Shanghai two days ago was an action to obscure domestic disputes. Furthermore, the world situation will be affected, as well as the policies and strength adopted by the Allied forces. First, the San Francisco Conference on April 25 is expected to present a confusing situation. At the same time, the new Vice President Truman has made it clear that he will not attend the conference. From the perspective of President Truman, there is no need to attend, but the convener of the conference was the late President Roosevelt. This shows that the San Francisco Conference has lost its central figure. Reviewing the conference again, Stalin of the Soviet Union has not been interested in the past, and this time he sent People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov to participate. From our observation, what is the center of this conference? Whether the results can be what Roosevelt hoped for before his death, or whether they are completely contrary to Roosevelt's opinions to an extreme degree, so at this final key in the European war situation, the so-called three giants of Truman, Churchill, and Stalin over the issue of the settlement of the European war, the results will often be chaotic and unbearable. It is believed that the death of Roosevelt has caused them to stop eating, and their mood is quite tense. What we are now considering with Chiang Kai-shek is that he is probably worried about the transformation of a new relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union in the future, and the increasingly complex friction between the Chongqing and Communist parties. This is often quite worrying for Chiang himself.

Commentary

### Thoughts on Attending the Fourteenth Plenary Session of the Consultative Committee

— Chen Binhe

The Municipal Consultative Committee of this city held its fourteenth plenary session yesterday. Mayor Zhou personally attended and several important proposals were discussed and passed, which are of great importance to the wartime economy. Here are my observations from attending the meeting:

Regarding the proposal to establish the Shanghai Rural Loan Syndicate with a capital of 5 billion yuan to directly provide production funds to farmers in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, it was resolved to appoint a nine-member committee to be responsible for its implementation. During the discussion of this proposal, it was unanimously agreed that it was urgently needed. The editorial of this newspaper has repeatedly raised the issue of curbing speculation and guiding idle capital in recent issues, repeatedly emphasizing its necessity, all aimed at prompting attention from all sectors in light of the current environment. The greatest significance of agricultural loans lies directly in reducing the suffering of farmers from high-interest loans and the advance sale of unripe crops. Indirectly, it increases crop yields and is practical work, especially against communism. As the poem by Bai Juyi says, "Who knows that every grain on the plate is the result of hard labor?" We who live in the city, especially the propertied class in tall buildings, have never cared about the hardships of farmers. The average person only knows the pain of rising rice prices and the seriousness of the food problem, but does not care about the suffering and needs of farmers. In the past, this city still supplied daily necessities to the countryside, but now some of the daily necessities factories have suspended production, and some are hoarding finished products, rarely supplying them directly to farmers. This creates a disconnect between urban and rural areas, but in reality, cities and rural areas are absolutely interdependent. To promote this relationship, it is essential that the city provide what the countryside needs. Now that the Consultative Committee has approved the organization of a rural loan syndicate, raising funds, such as issuing rural loan bonds, will take a long time according to official procedures, but the spring plowing season in the countryside is imminent and requires urgent action. The committee should quickly promote fundraising first. In the future, specialists should be hired to implement technical matters related to rural loans. Mayor Zhou carefully reviewed this case and was extremely concerned. Secretary-General Luo is even more proactive in chairing the committee. He will definitely put in a lot of effort, and this is worth noting.

Regarding the proposal to encourage the industrial and commercial sectors to establish small daily necessities factories in various counties of Jiangsu, many factories in this city are stagnating due to power restrictions and difficulties in obtaining raw materials. The industrial sector should also seek other ways out for itself. However, on the one hand, some factory owners have already accumulated huge profits and are taking the opportunity to suspend production, disregarding the unemployment of workers. On the other hand, the rural areas of the interior are in dire need of daily necessities, and handicraft production cannot meet the demand. Establishing factories, however, lacks funding, technology, and skilled workers. Under these circumstances, Shanghai's daily necessities factories should set up factories in the interior, or bring capital and technology to develop handicraft industries in the interior. However, the purpose of setting up factories should be to supply daily necessities to the interior, provide relief to unemployed workers, seek a way out for themselves, and establish a future foundation. Factories should be established using local specialty raw materials, and should not only seek private interests, like the competitive establishment of small yarn factories in the past for profit. It is hoped that the municipal government will not only encourage the establishment of factories, but also promote it through mandatory means when necessary.

Regarding the proposal to manage public utilities in this city, recently, public utilities in this city, such as electricity, telephones, and tap water, have not only repeatedly increased prices, but also repeatedly increased security deposits, increasing the burden on citizens. Although public utilities are state-owned companies, the only principle should be to minimize the burden on citizens as much as possible. If it is necessary to increase fees, the permission of the local government should be obtained in advance, and the opinions of the competent authorities should be solicited to avoid taking actions independently. We have repeatedly pointed out that the current Sino-Japanese relationship has reached a point where there should be absolutely no estrangement. This should be the case between governments, and even more so between people. Any measures concerning the public must take into account China's inherent national conditions and popular sentiment, so as not to cause estrangement. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities of Allied state-owned companies will further understand and value this.

Mayor Zhou first reported that he was deeply disgusted with the rampant speculation and profiteering in this city recently, and immediately ordered the relevant agencies to investigate thoroughly and resolutely punish it, hoping that citizens would cooperate in reporting it. At that time, a certain Consultative Committee member pointed out that the "bian jiao" (spot trading) item in securities trading currently encourages speculation. The reason for adopting the "bian jiao" system in the past was to stimulate securities values to escape the depressed atmosphere. Now that securities prices are soaring and the reason for using the "bian jiao" system has disappeared, it should be temporarily suspended. Mayor Zhou immediately agreed to correct it and stop "bian jiao." At the same time, we further hope for two things: To crack down on securities speculation, not only to stop "bian jiao," but also to prohibit over-the-counter trading, and to thoroughly investigate and crack down on gold and public bond speculation; To strengthen the authority of the Securities Exchange Supervision Committee and the Financial Inspection Office, strictly enforce laws and regulations, and avoid being useless and existing in name only.

### Vice-Ministers' Conference to Decide on Specific Administrative Policies

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - In order to expedite the operation of state affairs, the Suzuki Cabinet of Japan has adopted the principle of top priority in the operation of national policies.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: The vanguard of the U.S. forces advancing eastward has reached the industrial region of Saxony. It appears that General Eisenhower's troops are closing in on the Soviet forces in eastern Saxony. German commanders are attempting to prevent or delay the realization of this plan.

The Third Bureau of the Municipal Police Department is preparing to establish a "Forced Smoking Cessation Center for Smokers" to assist in promoting the anti-smoking policy. It has ordered the Narcotics Investigation Section to actively carry out the work and has coordinated with relevant agencies. The work is generally ready, with the police hospital being used as the smoking cessation site. It will start with young smokers under the age of 30 and gradually expand to complete the anti-smoking policy. After the Forced Smoking Cessation Center is established, opium addicts arrested by the Narcotics Investigation Section will first be subjected to forced smoking cessation. After the addiction is eradicated, they will be released to the Procuratorate with a doctor's certificate, requesting the prosecutor to give them a non-prosecution decision to show leniency. However, the aforementioned former smokers who commit the same crime again will be severely punished, and those in particularly bad circumstances will be sent to the labor camp for forced labor. During the smoking cessation period, the Crime Prevention Section will send personnel from time to time to hold mental talks with the smokers. The aforementioned plan has been approved by Director Zhou, and will officially start work in mid-April.

Abolishing Institutions

In order to thoroughly refresh the internal structure of the police administration, the Municipal Police Department has abolished the Consulting Office and the Legal Research Office. However, Consultant Yao Huimo will retain his original position, and Gan Jingxian and Hu Jiashi, the staff of the Legal Research Office, will be dismissed.

### Authorities Considering Adjusting Current Cash Needs

In recent months, the cash positions of various industries and markets in this city have suddenly become tight. Large sums are mostly paid by checks and transfer orders, again presenting the state of cash shortage at the end of last year's lunar calendar. It is learned that recently, banks and money shops have imposed considerable restrictions on cash payments to depositors. For amounts exceeding the limit, they are given transfer orders. The limits on cash payments vary. Most of the receipts and payments of the Silver Union, the Money Shop Reserve, and various banks and shops are made by bills. The number of bills exchanged in the bill exchange market has also increased accordingly. Some speculators are even discounting various checks and transfer orders for profit. According to financial sources, the shortage of cash in the market is mainly because various industries are buying agricultural materials, which are gradually flowing into the countryside. The recent tightening of cash in the market is still better than the situation at the end of last year. Anyone holding a transfer order should use it in the suburbs and it is equivalent to cash. There is no need to discount it and invite losses. In addition, the authorities and the silver and money industries have paid attention to this matter and are actively considering resolving the lack of cash. It is expected that this difficulty will be resolved satisfactorily soon.

### Silver Union and Money Shop Reserve Increase Deposits from Colleagues

Due to price relations, the lending business of various industries and commercial sectors in this city is becoming increasingly sluggish. The cash positions of colleagues are exceptionally ample, and the number of overnight loans is decreasing daily. It is learned that recently, the Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry and the Joint Reserve Depository of the money shop industry have received increasing deposits from their member banks and money shops. The daily statistics have been increasing, about 70% more than last week. According to this situation, it is certainly not the trend of the development of the banking, money, industry, and commercial sectors. It is an inevitable phenomenon that the funds of various banks and shops lack channels for utilization. Therefore, the crazy boom in the speculative market recently is indeed a way for the financial industry to concentrate funds on speculative businesses. It is also learned that due to previous needs, there were preparations to increase the reserve assets of the two associations. Now that deposits from colleagues are increasing daily, it has been decided to postpone the implementation of this proposal.

### Naval Fleet Press Department Adds Monday Regular Meetings; Director Matsushima Attends and Reports

### Minister Zhou's Handwritten Order: Securities Exchange to Stop "Bian Jiao"; Stabilizing the Market to Be Implemented Today

Recently, various securities in this city have soared wildly, affecting the market significantly and hindering wartime economic policies. It is learned that Finance Minister Zhou Fohai, in view of this, in order to stabilize the securities market and suppress the rise, has ordered the Securities Exchange in his own handwriting to stop "bian jiao" (spot trading) from today (17th).

The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange has recently seen a surge in the stock market, especially in high-priced stocks, which have appreciated even more significantly. In order to prevent unexpected risks, the limits on stock price fluctuations have been revised as follows, starting yesterday (16th): 30% for stocks under 20 yuan, 25% for stocks from 20 to 100 yuan, 20% for stocks from 100 to 2000 yuan, and 15% for stocks over 2000 yuan.

### All Sectors Deeply Hope Authorities Will Ban Gold Trading to Avoid Affecting Social Tranquility

Gold trading has become the sole target of speculators, who are fabricating rumors in the market in an attempt to profit wildly and disrupt wartime finance. The market price has risen wildly over the past week, reaching 7.85 million yuan as of last Saturday. Compared with the market price in January, it has risen more than twice. Unexpectedly, it suddenly soared again yesterday (16th), initially to 8.1 million yuan, and then to 10.6 million yuan near noon. The closing market price in the afternoon soared to 13 million yuan, setting an unprecedented new high. It rose by an astonishing 5 million yuan in two days. As a result, the prices of general daily necessities have also been stimulated to rise, and people are panic-stricken and feel insecure. This is very unfavorable to social tranquility. All sectors hope that the wise authorities of China and Japan will impose strict sanctions and ban trading as soon as possible to ensure that the general price level can be stable for a long time.

### Hwa Hsing Bank's Agricultural Loan Work

— Liu Feng

Hwa Hsing Bank began handling agricultural loans at its inception, which has been four years, with gradual success. To understand the bank's handling of agricultural loans, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Shen Erchang, the managing director of the bank, who introduced him to the Shanghai office of the China Cooperative Society. He obtained a great deal of information, which is recorded separately as follows:

Organizational Scope

Hwa Hsing Bank's handling of agricultural loans is attached and does not establish a separate organization, and its fund management is the responsibility of the Shanghai office of the China Cooperative Society. The office accepts applications from county branches and grants loans to them. Under the county branches, there are sub-branches, mutual aid societies, and even farmers. Currently, there are 75 branches, 4,000 mutual aid societies that have been established, and 1,000 are being established this year. The average number of households included in a mutual aid society is 100, so the total number of farmers benefiting is 500,000. The area extends to Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nan, Yangzhou, Xia Pu, Anqing, Wuhu, Jinhua, Ningbo, and other places.

Business Policy

The pioneers of the cooperative movement in the Allied countries were Zi-pin, Mantsuji Lang, and Baron Hirata Tosuke, who jointly submitted the Credit Cooperative Society Law to the parliament in Meiji 24 (1891), which was passed and promulgated by the parliament in Meiji 33 (1900). The organization and work policy of the China Cooperative Society are based on the Credit Cooperative Society Law, and its business includes the following: Credit cooperation, providing loans to each member, or lending agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizers, and draft cattle to farmers, and collectively providing necessary equipment for production and economy to members, such as pumps and rice milling machines. Guidance cooperation, in addition to instructing farmers to improve agricultural technology, it also instills farmers with agricultural science knowledge. Purchasing cooperation, its business is to purchase large quantities of agricultural products such as rice, miscellaneous, cotton, silk, etc., or to wholesale them after processing. Distribution cooperation, its business is to jointly purchase cheap goods, such as cloth, soap, towels, socks, foreign candles, etc., and distribute them to each member, and produce necessary items.

Fund Distribution

The China Cooperative Society's spring plowing funds for this year were 100,000,000 yuan for agricultural tools and 10,000,000 yuan for each draft cattle. According to the situation of the Zhongjiang County Cooperative Society, the loan amount is 50,000 yuan for those with more than ten mu, 20,000 yuan for those with more than five mu, and 5,000 yuan for those with more than one mu. The cost of purchasing and repairing agricultural tools is a maximum of 10,000 yuan per year and a minimum of 2,000 yuan. The allocation price of draft cattle by the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee is 50,000 yuan per head, and irrigation costs are also included in the agricultural tool funds.

Farmers' lives are difficult, and they urgently need funds. Regardless of the price after harvest, they urgently seek to sell, and often mortgage the green seedlings to grain shops or grain dealers before harvesting, borrowing high-interest loans to alleviate urgent needs. To avoid this tragic phenomenon, it is also necessary to lend living expenses, etc. This autumn plowing fund is about 4,000 yuan per household, totaling 200,000,000 yuan for 500,000 households, 125,000,000 yuan for fertilizer funds, 60,000,000 yuan for ammonium sulfate funds, 10,900,000 yuan for the distribution of essential living materials, 10,000,000 yuan for warehouse construction funds, and 20,000,000 yuan for production business funds, totaling 481,900,000 yuan.

The organization structure, funding amount, and distribution of the China Cooperative Society's branches vary depending on the local conditions to suit the environment. Due to the large number of projects and complex affairs of the cooperative, and the simultaneous operation of commercial and purchasing work, it is difficult to concentrate its efforts on agricultural lending. The loan issued by the cooperative needs to be repaid in kind, and no cash is received, which is the biggest feature. Moreover, because the income from operating other businesses is still abundant, it does not haggle over the interest on agricultural loans, but farmers occasionally delay payment due to greed for small profits. Judging from the target and concentration of fund utilization, it is significantly different from the agricultural loans handled by the Bank of Communications.

Agricultural Loan Needs

At present, the vast majority of farmers rely on pawning, credit, drawing lots, pre-selling agricultural products, and borrowing from local wealthy households to finance their needs. All of these are desperate measures of drinking poison to quench thirst. Poor farmers suffer from the exploitation of heavy interest rates, becoming poorer by borrowing, and borrowing more as they become poorer, eventually becoming destitute. They go from being independent farmers to tenant farmers, from tenant farmers to coolies, and from coolies to beggars and bandits, which has a great impact on production and public security. All of this is due to the closure of rural financial institutions, so promoting agricultural loans is the best way to preserve vitality, revive rural areas, and increase production. It is hoped that all parties will respond enthusiastically to promote its success.
