### Drive the Enemy Away From East Asia: To Seize the Year of Victory; Japanese Prime Minister Broadcasts Exchanges with Various Countries

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The gist of Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's broadcast of exchanges with various countries in Greater East Asia is as follows: The Greater East Asia War has now entered its fourth new spring. The enemy forces... and now the entire island of the Philippines has become a decisive battleground. Japanese soldiers, sacrificing themselves to protect the country, led by special attack units, continue to fight with special attack spirit. At this time, Germany, our European ally, has undergone major changes in both political and strategic aspects in Europe. Therefore, we express our full respect to this ally and resolve to advance towards the path of completing the defense of East Asia under a common ideal. The national fortune of Manchukuo is becoming increasingly prosperous. As a logistics base for the Greater East Asia War, it has made significant contributions to military production and food supplies. Although the Republic of China suffered the passing of its great leader, Chairman Wang, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, unity has become more consolidated. The whole country is making all-out efforts to eliminate the influence of Britain and the United States and to build the country, thoroughly implementing the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and achieving results step by step. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand, under the Thai-Japanese Alliance Treaty, has undergone many hardships. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Abhaiwongse, it maintains an unwavering determination to fight for the defense of Greater East Asia and the construction of Greater East Asia's justice. Furthermore, Burma, due to the enemy's ravaging of its territory, has become the front line of defense in East Asia. All its people are unyielding and fighting for the glory of independence and for all the hardships of constructing Greater East Asia's justice. In addition, the Philippines, which has become the decisive battleground between Japanese and American forces, under the leadership of President Laurel, all 16 million Filipinos, with a tragic determination to achieve their long-cherished desire for autonomy and independence, are cooperating with the Japanese army to resist the enemy. I express my heartfelt respect to the people of all these fighting countries in Greater East Asia and hope that they will continue to do so. In order to follow the victory of our ally Germany, Greater East Asia must unite as one, fight for the defense of East Asia regardless of life or death. Internally, 100 million compatriots in the home front must continue to strengthen their war efforts and fight bravely to respond to the soldiers on the front lines. Our certainty of victory must not waver. This year, we will drive the enemy away from the lands of East Asia and seize the year of victory.

### Frontline Japanese Troops: Crushing Enemy Attempts

Burma, 1st (Central News Agency) – A certain unit of the Japanese army on the Burmese front, near 30 kilometers west of Kaduma, has been engaged in fierce battles since the 24th of last month against a unit of the Eastern Philippine Army's 15th Division, numbering several hundred, carrying several tanks, attempting to advance eastward in the Kalewa area, crushing the enemy's attempt. However, on the 28th, the enemy reinforced with dozens of tanks and 300 transport vehicles, a force of about 3,000, attempting to break through the Japanese line. After Japanese reinforcements arrived, the two sides are now engaged in fierce battles.

### Foreign Minister Chu Completes His Business: Returns to Nanjing from Japan

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Foreign Minister Chu, who accompanied Acting Chairman Chen on a visit to Japan in mid-December last year, was later ordered to go to Nagoya to thank the authorities of the hospital where the late Chairman Wang was treated, and to attend the memorial service held there. He has now completed his mission and returned to the capital on New Year's Eve of the 33rd year.

### Prospects for the Current Stage of the War (2): A Discussion Between the Heads of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Information Departments of Shanghai

Matsudaira: Summarizing the talks of both department heads, the current situation of the Greater East Asia War is roughly as follows: Since the year before last, the enemy has continued to counterattack, especially in the Pacific region. Our fleet, enduring and biding its time, is waiting for the opportune moment to launch an all-out offensive. At the same time, on the mainland, we have launched a new offensive to destroy the bases of the American air force, and it has been very successful. As for the air war between the two sides, as just mentioned, it has a great relationship with the supply war. The enemy's supply in the Pacific is presumably more difficult than crossing the Atlantic to supply Europe. Department Head Matsushima, would you agree? Is the enemy's supply not quite difficult?

Ineffective Material Resources: Enemy Difficult to Supply

Matsushima: Yes, the difference is significant. According to recent enemy reports, supply in the Pacific is roughly three times more difficult than in the Atlantic. Currently, the main base of operations in the Pacific is of course Hawaii. In addition, the Mariana Islands and Australia are also important bases. However, the main force driving the current offensive operations is still Hawaii, and its forward bases are in the Marshall Islands and Ulithi. The enemy originally intended to establish its forward bases in Palau and Halmahera, but due to setbacks, it failed to proceed according to plan. As a result, the supply of military supplies had to be based in Hawaii. In addition, related to supply is the repair of damaged ships, which must also be returned to Hawaii to be carried out. But in terms of distance, Hawaii to the Mariana Islands is 4,000 miles, and the Mariana Islands to the Philippines is 1,000 miles, so it is necessary to maintain a 5,000-mile maritime communication line. If using a transport ship traveling at 14 miles per hour, it would take more than two weeks, and a round trip could not be made in a month. Therefore, even if the United States boasts of having many merchant ships, it will still feel the difficulty. Before this operation, air supremacy was often in the hands of the enemy. Now, as soon as the enemy approaches the Philippines, it will immediately be attacked by our aircraft. The aircraft carriers on which its mobile units rely are also gradually decreasing due to the fierce attacks of our air force and naval special attack units, and have now been reduced to about ten. Therefore, they have to rely on intermediate bases, passing through Hollandia on the north coast of New Guinea to Biak Island, and then from Biak Island through the waters under their air supremacy in the Molotai Islands area to approach the Philippines, secretly transporting supplies to Leyte Island. The difficulty of the enemy's supply can be imagined. Due to this reason, there is a great lack of artillery shells required on the front line. A few days ago, the MacArthur headquarters, due to the large consumption of ammunition, ordered the front line to make every effort to save ammunition. Roosevelt, Marshall, King, and other enemy and American leaders also claimed that ammunition was lacking. For example, Roosevelt declared at the end of November that artillery shells on the front line are very lacking, due to the fact that workers engaged in military industry are unwilling to work hard. In the Leyte area, the amount of ammunition consumed in the second half of November was equal to the amount of artillery shells used by the American army since the counterattack from Guadalcanal in the past eighteen months. Since the consumption rate of ammunition on the front line is so high, it is naturally difficult to replenish it. As a result, the enemy's offensive operations are gradually becoming stagnant and declining. This is a counter-proof that even if material resources are abundant, it is still very difficult to win a modern war if the supply problem is not completely resolved. The enemy has repeatedly praised the success of the landing operation in Northern Europe, because there is a large supply base very close to the British headquarters. In the Pacific, the length of the distance is incomparable. From the point of view that modern warfare is completely a war of material resources and a war of attrition, the ease or difficulty of supply can ultimately determine the outcome of the war. We can expect that the American operation will run into a wall in terms of supply.

Matsudaira: Yes. Recently, the American military industry production volume... Washington was divided into five groups, visiting various military factories to encourage workers to increase the production of military supplies. Later, when Minister of Military Supply Somervell and others spoke in Boston on December 1, they claimed that it was simply impossible to realize what they had experienced in Europe in the Pacific. Therefore, all the weapons that had been ordered were canceled and new ones were being made. In short, American military production has generally decreased by 40%. Moreover, in order to supply these, 100,000 laborers are needed immediately, so they are in a very difficult supply situation. As a result, the military factories that wanted to switch to peaceful industries had to give up, and emergency measures had already been taken a few days ago. Does the enemy and American army's supply also rely on Hawaii? Is part of what the MacArthur side needs shipped from Australia?

Matsushima: That place is used as a relay point. In short, the American materials are first transported to Australia, and then shipped out from Australia; but in the end, they always pass through Hawaii.

Matsudaira: Recently, according to a certain minister in Australia, Australia is very short of coal, with less than two weeks' worth of coal for the railways, and not enough gas for a house period. In addition, there is very little ham. From this point of view, isn't a considerable amount of food being shipped out of Australia?

No Way to Rescue: Lack of Supplies

Matsushima: It is being shipped out. Australia is already quite poor, more so than imagined. Because what is shipped from the British headquarters is not enough, let alone shipping out civilian supplies.

Ide: They once used B29s to transport supplies to mainland China.

Matsudaira: Using them as transport planes.

Ide: It is said that the number of B29 sorties has decreased recently because of this. The largest transportation line on the mainland is the Ledo Road in Burma. The enemy is trying to open this line. If this road is open, presumably a considerable amount of supplies can be transported. Currently, they rely solely on air transport.

Matsudaira: How much is transported by air?

Ide: 20,000 tons per month.

Matsushima: But most of it is supplied to the American air force in Chongqing. Only 10% is given to the Chongqing army, which is generally not enough for the needs of seven divisions of the Chongqing army for one month of combat.

Matsudaira: Indeed, indeed. Supply is really difficult!

Matsushima: If 100 B29s fly to the vicinity of Kyushu, Japan, to bomb once, the materials required, if transported by conventional transport planes, would require thousands of planes. If using B29s, the number of transport planes can be reduced, and the period of sorties can also be accelerated. According to statistics to date, 100 planes bomb Japan once every two weeks. Recently, after Nelson and others went to Chongqing, they established a wartime production bureau there. But this, as Chongqing frankly announced, focuses on the post-war period and will definitely not be in time to meet the urgent needs at hand. According to Yan'an's broadcast, there are four conditions for increasing production, namely raw material resources, labor, production facilities, and transportation. Among them, Chongqing only possesses labor, and the rest are all in the hands of the Japanese army. Under these circumstances, no matter how many wartime production bureaus are set up, they cannot increase production. As a result, this is nothing more than a means by which the United States intends to dominate the mainland. Of course, it cannot save the Chongqing army from its current poverty of supplies.

Matsudaira: How is the air supply to Chongqing?

Matsushima: It has decreased in the past two or three months.

Matsudaira: Not enough gasoline, right?

Editorial

### How to Practice Political Competition

Yesterday, in our "New Year's Message," we put forward the slogan of "Political Competition." The goal of the competition is to use the four principles of innovative politics that we advocate—strong politics, expert politics, pro-people politics, and clean politics—as the basis. This is also our specific working direction for this year.

How should we start the competition?

We must compete from many aspects:

First, we must compete with our allies. The politics of our allies are much sounder than ours. The current decisive battle politics are countless times stronger than ours. However, the allied authorities are still seeking to strengthen and improve. Although we cannot yet compete with our allies side by side, we should quickly catch up, learn from our allies, absorb the advantages of their politics that are suitable for our national conditions, and actively work to do so. At the same time, we should also compete with other countries in Greater East Asia, and everyone should learn from our allies.

Second, we must compete with Chongqing. The reason why Chongqing can barely continue the war is that, in addition to relying on the support of the enemy, the United States, and Britain, it also has its political foundation. A part of the political and social forces in the country are still colluding with Chongqing, and a part of the people are still being anesthetized and exploited by Chongqing. Some political forces, such as small parties and social groups representing certain social classes, are certainly dissatisfied with Chongqing and are very saddened by Chongqing's politics. However, because our efforts in the peaceful areas are not enough and we still lack achievements, we cannot win them over. We must now do well in a practical and concrete way, so that they will wholeheartedly tend towards us, thereby disintegrating Chongqing. As for the people, as long as we can do better than Chongqing, they will naturally tend towards us. Therefore, we must compete with Chongqing to win political forces and win the people.

Third, we must compete with the communists. In many places adjacent to the peaceful areas, they are often occupied by communist forces, hindering overall peace. The communists often use clever propaganda and target our weaknesses to incite the masses and alienate them. The communists are also good at "pretending to please" the masses, but we have not even done a little of that. We must use "real goodness" to overwhelm the communists' "fake goodness." Especially in areas near communist-occupied areas that are easily invaded and operated on by communist elements, we must compete with the Chinese Communist Party to win over local masses. As long as we can win over the masses, the communists will find it difficult to gain a foothold.

Fourth, we must engage in work competition. Competing to see who does well and does better. The central and local governments should follow the overall political work program, with the central government setting a model example to lead the local governments, and the local governments repaying the central government with practical achievements. Local governments should also compete with each other. Provinces and counties should strive towards a common goal. Among various political organs, and between superiors and subordinates, and even between individuals, we must also compete with each other based on their respective work positions.

As for the competition, we should have a good competitive spirit. The competition of learning from our allies is mainly humility. Competing with the enemy requires a display of firm struggle. And the competition within ourselves should never involve suspicion, let alone infighting. Cooperation should be included in the competition. We must ensure that everyone does well, not just one unit or one person, which should be especially understood clearly.

After explaining the relationship of competition above, we must further study the specific work in the competition, which will be discussed in another article.

### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Convoy: Simultaneously Bombs Two Airfields on Leyte Island

Philippine Front, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force has been attacking the enemy transport convoy attempting to reinforce the enemy forces landing on Mindoro Island for days, achieving considerable results. At the same time, the San Jose enemy airfield has also been repeatedly bombed. According to the reconnaissance on the 31st, the San Jose enemy airfield once had 130 to 150 aircraft. However, today, the south airfield has been reduced to only one large aircraft, and the north airfield has only twelve small aircraft. About 20 aircraft were damaged. As for the enemy's ships, there is one large transport ship on fire and aground south of San Jose Bay. However, the two enemy transport ships in the bay that were still on fire on the 30th have now disappeared and sunk. Furthermore, there are no traces of enemy ships in the eastern sea.

Philippine Front, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force attacked the Tacloban and Dulag airfields on Leyte Island and their nearby facilities on the 30th. At the same time, it also conducted low-altitude strafing and bombing of enemy small boats on the sea. In addition, several enemy land facilities were also hit and exploded, catching fire.

### Manchukuo's Prime Minister's New Year's Greetings: Wishing to Closely Cooperate With Allies

Central News Agency: Manchukuo's Prime Minister Zhang, with the anniversary of our country's participation in the war approaching, specifically addressed the issue of "Willing to Cooperate Closely With Allied Countries to Destroy Britain and the United States" to express his determination as follows: Welcoming this decisive new year, Manchukuo's determination to cooperate with allied countries to defeat the United States and Britain is also renewed. Indeed, the Greater East Asia War is a just war to liberate all of East Asia. If we do not thoroughly crush the ambition of the enemy, Britain and the United States, to control the East, then it will never be possible to build an East Asia for East Asians. Moreover, since the beginning of history, those who have launched wars without a just cause have all suffered disastrous defeats. Therefore, victory is always held by those who uphold justice and humanity. This is what we firmly believe. Manchukuo has long known its mission to liberate East Asia. Therefore, since the beginning of the war, it has used all its strength to engage in the two major missions of enhancing its war capabilities and maintaining the northern borders. When the National Government declared war on the United States and Britain in January of the year before last, our country, both government and people, admired them very much. The participation of China coincided with the just purpose held by our country. Relying on their material resources, the enemy, the United States and Britain, did not hesitate to carry out their ambition to invade East Asia. It goes without saying that they forcibly carried out operations in the Philippines, and even after years of driving the Chongqing army to continue to resist Japan, they still felt it was not enough. They even planned to bring Chongqing under the command of the American army. The facts are clear. In order to defeat this stubborn enemy and build an East Asia for East Asians, it is necessary for our Greater East Asia's billion people to unite together with abundant resources and work together. Although the enemy's material resources cannot be dismissed, we have the spirit of justice and unity, and the world's most elite Japanese army, plus the vast human and material resources, which will surely be able to deal with the enemy, Britain and the United States. Moreover, in view of the situation of the war of material resources and supply, we should strengthen our comprehensive combat capabilities to respond to the brave battles of the Japanese army. This is our important duty. Fortunately, due to more than ten years of construction, the various production capacities of our Manchukuo have been significantly strengthened, especially in recent years. In addition to directly contributing to the current major decisive battles, the government has also decided to gradually implement the emergency production plan for the foreseeable second and third decisive battles. Thanks to the efforts of the government and the people, agricultural products have had bumper harvests in both last year and this year. The situation of the bumper harvest is also quite good. The huge target quantity had already reached more than 80% by early December, and it is about to be completed with full confidence. It can also comfort the expectations of both China and Japan, which is worthy of common celebration. Next year, we will decide to implement emergency farmland development and decide on various plans to achieve even greater production increases. Regarding the mining industry, such as iron, coal, light metals, artificial liquid fuels, and aircraft, there has been continued amazing progress in directly enhancing combat capabilities. The attempt by the American air force stationed in Chongqing to control the air has also failed to destroy the production spirit of our employees. Furthermore, we express our gratitude to China for its cooperation in our increased steel production. We have also set production increase goals for coal, light metals, and other important materials. Our people's belief in victory and the diligent national character will surely be able to achieve them. Moreover, today's production increase lies in strengthening the comprehensive combat capabilities of Greater East Asia to defeat Britain and the United States. China and Manchukuo are the hubs of the mainland. Therefore, there should be mutual understanding and progress towards enhancing combat capabilities. The national relations between China and Manchukuo are becoming closer every year, which is worthy of common celebration. In the future, we will work harder on goodwill under this major war situation, cooperate with our allies, and move towards defeating Britain and the United States.

### German Leader's New Year's Speech: Insisting on the Belief in Victory Until the Enemy Collapses

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – HTS News: German leader Hitler delivered a New Year's speech to the German people on the radio, stating: The world must know that Germany will never surrender. Today's Germany is no different from all the great powers of the past. It may encounter setbacks along the way, but it never deviates from its path. Since the beginning of history, the German people have been the most important factor in European and world history. This is the case today, and it will be even more so in the future. The German people know the exaggerations of enemy politicians and journalists. If the enemy fails, they will encounter what kind of fate. The Germans will not be defeated and are determined to achieve victory. The enemy's bombing of German cities not only wants to slaughter German women and children, but also wants to destroy Germany's culture of thousands of years, a culture that the enemy cannot produce. The enemy's destruction of German culture will continue to burn in our memories, but they will eventually know that it is worthless. The war in 1944 shows that the society of the financial system can no longer cope with the storms of today and the future. The era of freedom is over, and the revival of democracy has completely failed. Countries that have failed to find the true path of social transformation will inevitably descend into chaos. Europe is currently facing the threat of economic, national, and racial issues. Germany is the only one that can make such great sacrifices. Only a social system that abolishes all privileges can do this. All the people must not only shoulder equal responsibilities, but also bear equal rights. The meaning of this belief and the understanding of the purpose of the German people's struggle for survival enable them to increase their strength to continue fighting in this difficult period with the strongest confidence and unwavering belief. Regarding all-out mobilization, Hitler stated that it is being rebuilt with superhuman diligence and heroism by the enemy, and it will be the same in the future until the enemy collapses.

### French Government Demands Annexation of German Territory

Geneva, 1st - Central News Agency - German News: The Geneva Daily News discusses France's future Rhine River policy, revealing that France demands to participate in the management of organizations established to protect the Franco-German border. France also demands that German territories bordering France be placed under French direct administration for an extended period. All these issues have been discussed by Teague, Stalin, and Roosevelt.

### City Residents Enthusiastically Celebrate New Year, Filled with Joyous Festivities

Yesterday was the New Year's Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China. The city's five million residents, under the mission of defending the Greater East Asia War, celebrated the New Year together. All city agencies and organizations held group greeting ceremonies, and all shops and schools took a holiday, displaying flags in celebration. The national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth fluttered throughout the city, and the streets and alleys were filled with New Year's atmosphere.

### Naval Attaché Captain Minato Issues New Year's Address: Military and Civilians United to Crush Anglo-American Ambitions

Naval Attaché Captain Minato, stationed in Shanghai, issued a New Year's address, stating:

As we welcome the New Year of the 2605th year of the Imperial Era, my first thought is that this year will determine the survival and prosperity of our Imperial Nation. Therefore, we must exert every effort to open the path to victory, living up to the Imperial Will. Looking back at the past year, the enemy has gradually strengthened its forces, advancing from the Gilbert and New Guinea areas towards Saipan, Guam, and Rota. Currently, fierce battles are taking place in the central Philippines. In the three major naval and air battles off Saipan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, our naval, army, and air forces worked closely together, launching a decisive attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet, creating a favorable situation for our side. The enemy, on the other hand, gathered its remaining fleet and combined it with fleets from other countries, forming a makeshift force and anxiously challenging us, attempting to advance directly from the Philippines to China. Our side is luring the enemy's main force into close range, ready to capture them like turtles in a jar. This is why fierce battles are unfolding in the Philippines. Due to the strategic importance of the Philippines, the enemy has deployed the majority of its highly trained twenty divisions to attack Leyte and Mindoro. To defend the Imperial Nation and protect East Asia, we must defeat the arrogant enemy. As another year passes, I am deeply moved and filled with fervor when I think of the great spirit of countless warriors. I hope that the 1 billion people of East Asia can unite in upholding the great cause of sacrificing themselves for righteousness, crush the Anglo-American ambition to dominate East Asia, prepare for all-out combat, and strengthen both the front lines and the rear. To counter the enemy's material strength, we must step forward and establish ourselves in the battlefield, praying for the realization of victory in this year.

Starting today, in the 34th year, we should further develop the police administration, take on the responsibility of the police, and ensure local security. At this critical juncture of the European War and the Greater East Asia War, maintaining the security of the rear is the responsibility of our police. Therefore, we should unite, strengthen our forces, and fulfill our police mission. This is what I expect." Following this, they exchanged greetings and raised their glasses to wish each other progress in the New Year, the atmosphere was extremely warm, and the ceremony concluded at around 12:00 PM.
