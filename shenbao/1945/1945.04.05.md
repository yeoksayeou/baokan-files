Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 4th: Though suffering considerable damage near the coast, the enemy landing on Okinawa Island had advanced to the area south of Kitatani Island and Awase by April 3rd. Japanese forces in that area continue to engage the enemy in fierce combat. The damage inflicted on enemy ships around the island, as confirmed so far, is as follows: six transport ships sunk, one battleship sunk, four cruisers sunk, one destroyer damaged, and one ship of unknown type sunk.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – American forces on Okinawa Island are currently attempting to forcibly advance and cut off the island. At noon on the 3rd, an enemy force of approximately 6,000 men with 30 tanks and 20 trucks had reached Teruya (6 kilometers northeast of Kitatani). Furthermore, part of the enemy force is attempting to move south via Momobaru and Awase. Consequently, the Japanese garrison is luring the enemy to launch a counterattack from the south, and fierce battles are now underway. On the other hand, enemy ships around Okinawa Island are currently cruising in the waters west of Kita Airfield, the waters west of Naha, the waters west of Itoman, and south of Minato River. The enemy fleet consists of seven or eight aircraft carriers, four battleships, approximately one hundred other warships, and several hundred transport ships and minesweepers. On the 2nd, these enemy ships bombarded the island in a pacifying manner, while simultaneously using carrier-based aircraft to cover their landing forces. Today, special attack units of the Army and Navy are continuing their fierce attacks on these enemy ships. The results from the morning of the 2nd to the morning of the 3rd are as follows: one battleship bombed and sunk, one cruiser bombed and sunk, two cruisers sunk, one ship of unknown type burned, and one transport ship heavily damaged. In addition, one cruiser was set on fire.

### Fierce Battles Continue on the Luzon Front; Japanese Forces Launch Fierce Attacks; Right-Wing Unit Occupies San Isidro

Luzon Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – The enemy, who have been sweeping the Baguio area for days, recently advanced along mountain roads, using local bandits familiar with the terrain as vanguards. In that area, two brave Japanese soldiers, Sergeant Ishikawa and Private First Class Amahima, annihilated approximately 50 enemy soldiers with explosives on a road 5 kilometers east of Naguilian. Corporal Inazawa and his team annihilated about 10 enemy soldiers with explosives. The enemy continues to reinforce their forces, using tanks as vanguards. On the afternoon of the 29th, three tanks and 300 infantrymen attacked the Japanese position and shelled the vicinity. At that time, Japanese troops immediately advanced in hand-to-hand combat. By the morning of the 30th alone, Japanese assault troops had killed or wounded 15-16 enemy soldiers and scattered about 100. The enemy, building a road northeast from Aringay, advanced about 20 kilometers from that location on the afternoon of the 30th, reaching Gariabud. They are actively transporting military supplies by truck. The enemy in the Irubuc area in the south is also attempting to gradually invade northeast. Japanese units in the area launched a fierce attack on them on the 29th, annihilating enemy soldiers who had invaded Taroy and the highlands to its west. On the 30th, after a fierce bombing, the enemy attacked again with a force of four companies. Japanese troops immediately responded with accurate fire, inflicting heavy losses.

Japanese Troops Fight Bravely on the South Bank of Laguna de Bay

Luzon Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese right-wing unit’s offensive on the stronghold east of Manila is becoming increasingly fierce. After occupying San Mateo on the night of the 23rd, they further occupied San Isidro, south of Montalban, on the 25th. The assault unit in that area attacked the Marikina ammunition depot around 2:00 PM that afternoon, causing a large explosion. Japanese troops in Los Baños, on the south bank of Laguna de Bay, are fighting bravely against the enemy, who possess eight large cannons. On the 25th and 26th, they killed or wounded 369 enemy soldiers and 73 bandits, destroyed six tanks and one truck, and repelled the enemy. However, the stubborn enemy launched an offensive from Laguna de Bay with landing craft. Japanese troops sank three of them, and the enemy finally collapsed and retreated. At the same time, the Japanese counterattack north of Mount Laksasa, corresponding to the southern front, has become more fierce since the 23rd, completely repelling the enemy along the north-south line and are currently mopping up the remaining enemy. In addition, they are launching a head-on attack on the enemy attempting to invade north of Imugan, east of Malebang. At present, the enemy seems unable to counterattack, and the Japanese are on high alert. On the 26th, the enemy 7 kilometers south of Mount Balete in Urotakin gradually advanced under the cover of aircraft. Japanese troops deployed artillery and launched a fierce bombardment. In addition, a strike force dispatched by the Japanese Okayama unit attacked the enemy base northwest of Calanglang in that area, destroying five 15-cm howitzers, three mortars, one quick-firing gun, and four barracks, causing great confusion in the vicinity.

### Air Raids on Kanto and Shizuoka Yesterday; Battle Results Under Investigation

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Approximately ninety unidentified B-29 aircraft, with their main force, attacked the Kanto area in two waves, and another group attacked the Shizuoka area. The first unit invading the Kanto area, numbering about fifty aircraft, dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on military supply factory areas in the northern Kanto region and west of the Keihin region for three hours from 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM. However, there was almost no damage to important factories. The second unit, numbering about thirty aircraft, dropped a mixture of bombs and incendiary bombs over the city streets of the Keihin region between 3:00 AM and 4:20 AM, causing fires in several locations, but they were soon extinguished. In addition, ten aircraft dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on military supply areas in the Shizuoka area between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM. On this day, enemy aircraft, in groups of one or several, dispersed and invaded from low altitudes of 2-3,000 meters. In addition to immediate bombing, many time bombs were dropped in various locations. The results of the Japanese counterattacks are currently under investigation.

### Fifty Enemy Aircraft Attack Hong Kong Unsuccessfully

Hong Kong, 4th (Central News Agency) – Around noon on the 2nd, approximately fifty B-24 and P-38 aircraft of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked the Hong Kong area.

### Japanese Invent Aircraft Fuel Refined from Camphor

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Dr. Tomizo Yahagi, Director of the Central Research Institute of the Monopoly Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, has invented that camphor and camphor oil can be used as explosives and engine oil through careful research. Its importance as a strategic material is highly valued. As a result of further research by Dr. Yahagi, the experiment on extracting paracytic systems of oil from camphor has been successful and will soon be industrialized on a large scale. This paracytic oil is particularly rich in high octane and can increase the octane number when mixed with other aircraft fuels, making it ideal as aircraft fuel. The refining method involves simply extracting camphor in a special way, which can be produced in large quantities, and camphor is a specialty of Japan, so it makes a great contribution to securing aviation fuel.

Editorial

### Speculation and Floating Capital

Since the Incident, the abnormal knot of the economy in Shanghai and even the entire Central China region can be attributed to the mischief of floating capital. However, looking back at the actual situation in recent years, the extent of its rampant wrongdoing and the degree of harm it has caused to the social economy and even the government's policies has never been as chaotic and serious as it is now.

Shanghai has always been a concentration of floating capital, because Shanghai is the economic center of the country; various daily necessities needed in the interior are mostly supplied by Shanghai. At the beginning of the Incident, the security situation in various places was poor, and the bourgeoisie brought their funds to Shanghai to avoid the chaos, which further increased the amount of floating capital in Shanghai. According to the China Bank's business report in 1932, the funds concentrated in Shanghai accounted for more than half of the country's silver currency. There was no proper outlet, while the countryside was experiencing a shortage of funds and industrial depression. This is a clear proof of the economic deformity caused by the political disorder at that time. However, at that time, the total amount of silver currency in the country was only 2.2 billion yuan, and the circulating capital in Shanghai was only 600 million yuan, of which only about 400 million yuan could be identified as floating capital. At that time, various industries and businesses still had opportunities for normal development, so these floating capital did not have a malignant effect, and people with good intentions had already loudly called for the slogan of "funds returning to agriculture."

Until the eve of the Incident, the total deposits of Chinese banks in Shanghai were about 2 billion yuan, of which the amount of floating capital had remained at 5-600 million yuan for five or six years. However, it can be proved by looking at the proportion of long-term deposits of banks at more than 75% and current deposits at only 25% or less at that time. After the Incident, a large amount of funds once fled to Hong Kong, but after the Shanghai order was gradually restored, Hong Kong became insecure, and funds flowed back to Shanghai, forming a deformed prosperity for a time, and the wind of speculation gradually unfolded, and the problem of floating capital gradually became serious. However, because the environment in Shanghai at that time was not fundamentally different from that before the Incident, although there was a lot of floating capital, the ground for activities was still large, so it did not immediately form a major social problem. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the entire objective environment changed rapidly, and although some of the clear capital had been transferred to the interior, it flowed back to Shanghai again due to the lack of outlets in the interior. At the end of 1942, the floating capital in Shanghai reached a huge amount of about 7.4 billion yuan. The problem of the harm of capital became increasingly serious day by day.

In the two years from the end of 1942 to the present, the authorities have tried their best to prevent and control the activities of floating capital. In the beginning, measures such as the implementation of financial control and the ban on speculative markets (including foreign currency, foreign stocks, public bonds, raw silk, gauze, etc.), especially the purchase of gauze, created a temporary market quiet. After that, all measures, such as price countermeasures and the resumption of business of the stock exchange, failed to prevent the rampant floating capital, and the increase in circulating capital and the amount of floating capital reached an unprecedentedly large figure in the past two years. Since there was no proper outlet, they swarmed to the path of speculation and hoarding, using every change in the international situation, or even completely using rumors, to carry out unscrupulous speculation. However, the authorities only gave verbal warnings to these speculators. Although there were restrictive laws, they were like a dead letter, and there were no severe punishments to follow, which finally led to the chaotic and serious crisis today. The confusion in the market in the past few days has reached its peak. It goes without saying that the price of gold has soared. Taking the unified bonds as an example, the price was less than 30 yuan when the Central Reserve Bank notes were used in 1942. Later, because the National Government recognized the old debts, it rose to 100 yuan. At that time, the Northern Gang used the Joint Reserve Bank notes to purchase for arbitrage, which was only to break through the 100 yuan mark. Later, it gradually rose, and in the past few days, it has risen sharply and soared from thousands to tens of thousands of yuan! Looking at Chinese stocks again, from the beginning of the year to the recent few weeks, they have skyrocketed from several times to dozens of times. However, on the day the enemy planes came, the market situation in the morning and afternoon was very different. In the morning, some varieties even rose to the limit, but in the afternoon, they plummeted to the limit! For example, Wing On Textile Factory rose to 2,700 yuan, but suddenly fell to 1,840 yuan. Mei Ya Silk Factory rose to 2,820 yuan, but suddenly fell to 1,930 yuan. What are the losses suffered by the real investors during this period? What is the impact of the market being disrupted? It is enough to expose the wolfish hearts of the speculators! But what do speculators rely on to disrupt the market and destroy the social economy? Undoubtedly, it is relying on its huge floating capital?

Since the tool of speculation is such a huge amount of floating capital, in order to save the chaos in the market and the crisis of economic collapse, we should start with two things: curbing speculation as a temporary solution and guiding floating capital to the right track as a fundamental solution. Before we can strictly curb speculation, it is not easy to make the rampant floating capital comply. Therefore, first of all, we must thoroughly investigate the speculators who disrupt the market. In our editorial on March 31, we hoped that the municipal authorities would pay close attention to the criminal acts that endanger the wartime economy and immediately investigate and transfer them to the special court for decisive disposal in order to curb the chaos. As for the issue of guiding floating capital, we will discuss it further.

Nanjing Correspondence

### Capital Air Defense Work

— Ren Ping

Strengthen Air Defense

Wartime air defense work is an extremely important issue. The city of Nanjing is the capital city, making it particularly important. Coupled with the recent frequent air raids, air defense work has become even more urgent. The progress of air defense work in the capital will be described in two points:

On the active side, it is nothing more than building a large number of air raid shelters. Only because the capital area is vast and the population is large, most people are often at a loss when they encounter an air raid, and cannot find a suitable place to avoid it for a while. Some people even wander the streets, causing them to be killed or injured by stray bullets and fragments. The reason for this is that the original air raid shelters were too simple and the number was too small. Last year, all the city's police defense personnel, volunteer police, and Baojia personnel were mobilized to dig air raid shelters, but at most there were only a few thousand. With each accommodating ten people, at most tens of thousands of people could be accommodated. If public and private institutions built their own underground shelters, they could also accommodate tens of thousands of people, which is not enough for the 700,000 citizens to hide.

In the past, the air raid shelters automatically dug by shops and residents in the city were relatively satisfactory, but most of the public air raid shelters built in the open have been filled in and cannot be used. Although the authorities have encouraged citizens to dig on their own, it is difficult for the public to implement it due to economic strength.

Recently, the authorities have also taken measures to guide citizens to take appropriate shelter during air raids. They have selected open spaces or public places in each district as temporary shelters for citizens. They are also planning to build large air raid shelters and are organizing the existing air raid shelters.

On the passive side, in view of the fact that many victims of air raids in Pukou and Xiaguan in the past, the Nanjing Municipal Government established a "Nanjing Area Air Raid Disaster Countermeasures Committee" on February 14 to be solely responsible for air raid relief matters.

The relief methods are divided into two categories: damage to houses, with a maximum relief of 10,000 yuan, and 3,000 to 5,000 yuan for half-damaged or less. Deaths and injuries: 3,000 to 5,000 yuan for the dead, 1,000 to 3,000 yuan for the seriously injured, and 500 to 1,000 yuan for the slightly injured. The committee is jointly organized by the Chinese and Japanese sides. Part of the funding is borne by the Chinese and Japanese local authorities, and part is subsidized and raised by the central government. The relief targets are limited to the Chinese and Japanese people in the Nanjing area.

Blood Type Testing

Regarding air defense rescue and prevention work, the authorities have recently decided on new measures. In order to prevent problems before they occur, the Ministry of Health will launch a blood type testing program. The four drafts of the "National People's Blood Type Testing Program Outline," "Organization Regulations of the Blood Type Testing Committee of the Ministry of Health," "General Rules for the Organization of Blood Type Testing Committees of Provinces, Cities, and Counties," and "Implementation Measures for Blood Type Testing" drafted by the Ministry of Health have all been passed at the 245th Executive Yuan meeting on March 13.

The Blood Type Testing Committee was established on March 25. The director will be concurrently held by Director Lu, and other ministers and vice ministers of relevant departments and the heads of health agencies will serve as members.

The committee is the central highest advisory body for testing work, used to supervise and direct the testing work of provinces, cities, and counties. As for the materials needed, the committee will distribute them from the central government, and the provinces and cities will raise them themselves in addition to the allocation by the Ministry of Health.

Those who are tested are divided into two types, A and B. Type A are civil servants, military police, groups, companies, factories, etc. Type B are the general public. The local blood type testing committee will form several testing teams in conjunction with local public and private hospital medical associations to test in districts, and at the same time, it will work with police agencies and Baojia organizations to assist in the process.

After the people have been tested, the blood type category will be indicated in red on the right side of the photo on their residence permit or service permit, so that blood can be transfused immediately in case of excessive blood loss due to injury during an air raid. The testing fee is tentatively set at 50 yuan per person, and the poor can be reduced or exempted as appropriate.

### The United States is Experiencing Extreme Difficulties with Manpower and Resources

Byrnes Resigns as a Result

Central News Agency Report - According to foreign news reports, War Mobilization Director James F. Byrnes has resigned, and Federal Loan Administrator Vinson has been appointed as his successor. It is reported that Byrnes expressed his intention to resign to Roosevelt on March 24th, the day the Allied forces crossed the Rhine River. After resigning, he told reporters on the 29th, "I have decided to resign because I am aware of the nature of the work I am currently undertaking." The "work he is currently undertaking" refers to the mobilization plan for manpower and resources needed for the Pacific War.

Loss of Confidence in Maintaining Combat Power

From our observation, Byrnes seems to have lost confidence in the United States' ability to maintain combat power until "the day of victory," hence his resignation. The Washington authorities announced, three days after Byrnes submitted his resignation, his proposed reduction of the shipbuilding plan, stating that this plan was determined based on an investigation into the amount of human resources necessary for the overall military plan. Navy Secretary Forrestal further echoed that this plan was proposed by Byrnes and has been fully accepted by the regular board. Upon investigation, the content of the reduced shipbuilding plan changed the original plan to build 84 combat ships (636,860 tons) to building 12 escort aircraft carriers (151,000 tons). Whether this reduction plan can save the shipbuilding industry and manpower is not known in detail, but Byrnes, who accompanied the delegation from the Crimea Conference to Washington, said to people that he had made a combat plan that required more personnel than in the past, meaning that future combat plans would require more personnel and would be quite difficult.

Significant Increase in the Number of Female Workers Mobilized

Regarding the number of female workers mobilized in the United States, in April 1940, there were 11 million, which increased to 16 million by April 1944. The United States not only lacks human resources but also faces a shortage of iron, steel, ships, and food, which are the reasons for the current reduction in the shipbuilding plan. Commander of the United States Fleet, Admiral King, in his work report for the past year, said that the speed of our advance has created new production problems. The accelerated pace of our operations requires a large consumption of certain important materials. The production of these materials is generally in short supply. This "new production problem" and the large consumption of "certain materials" have proven that the United States' Pacific War has reached a critical point.

Panic over Supply of Materials

In the United States military production industry, only ammunition exceeded the planned amount in January. Other manufactured goods decreased by one percent compared to December, with the biggest reason being the reduction in iron and steel raw materials. The same situation exists for warships. Under Secretary of State Grew, in a speech to the Foreign Press Association on March 1, said, "During the first sixty days of the Luzon and Iwo Jima operations, the United States mobilized 3.8 million tons of ships." The ongoing Okinawa operation and other areas require even more ships. If this continues, the supply of military materials to the United States is almost limitless, and there will inevitably be a day when a material panic occurs. In fact, the United States' combat power has already reached its limit. From this, we can know that Byrnes's decision to resign was made with full knowledge of the reasons, which is beyond doubt.

### After Occupying Laohekou Airfield, the Japanese Army is in a Position to Both Attack and Defend

Department Head Izubuchi Discusses the War Situation at a Press Conference

The Army Press Department of Japan, an ally, held a regular press conference in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Department Head Izubuchi, Lieutenant Maehara, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Department Head Izubuchi spoke about the significant implications of the Japanese army's occupation of the Laohekou airfield and the trend of the fighting on Okinawa Island. The main points are as follows:

Mainland War Situation

The recent Japanese army's incursion into the Laohekou airfield is of great significance: Militarily, it can protect Wuhan on one hand and attack Chongqing on the other. Laohekou is a strategic point in the north, a must-grab for military strategists. From now on, the Japanese army can freely decide on both offensive and defensive actions. After the Japanese army destroyed the US Air Force bases in Guilin and Liuzhou, Laohekou became a forward base for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Since December of last year, the US Air Force has used this base to frequently disrupt transportation along the Pinghan, Longhai, and Yangtze River areas. After the Japanese army captured the Ganzhou and Suichuan airfields, the US Air Force in this area became even more active. With one stroke, the Japanese army destroyed the US Air Force, forcing them to retreat to Ankang. From now on, the Japanese army can take this route to attack Chongqing while also firmly defending Wuhan. Geographically, Laohekou is a key point in the west facing Chongqing and in the south facing Guizhou, so whether moving from south to north or from east to west, a path has been opened. Furthermore, since the Japanese army occupied Laohekou, the rear of the Chongqing 10th War Area has been completely cut off, forming an isolated situation.

Okinawa War Situation

Regarding the war situation on the Pacific Okinawa Islands, Department Head Izubuchi said that both the Japanese and American sides are fighting fiercely with all their might. The Japanese army has inflicted great losses on the American forces, and the Japanese army has achieved even greater results. The number of American ships sunk or damaged has reached more than 170. The US Navy's operations in the Okinawa area are far from their home country, so their supply situation is extremely difficult.

In addition to hosting a Children's Day celebration, the city's Education Bureau also held an awards ceremony for the 4th Annual Infant Health Competition. The event took place at the Paramount Theater on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday at 10:00 AM. Mayor Zhou was invited to attend and give a speech, but due to official business, he was unable to attend and sent Secretary-General Luo to represent him. All elementary and secondary schools were closed to celebrate, all city parks were open for free for the day, and all movie theaters and shops offered half-price discounts.

The atmosphere was enthusiastic. The bands from the Shanghai Poor Children's Home and the Poor Children's Craft Institute played music, and the Youth Corps maintained order.

Health Competition

The meeting started on time. The chairman reported on the progress of the infant health competition. Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, gave a speech, followed by a speech on common infant care practices by Dr. Gui Zhiliang of the Health Bureau. The results of the infant health competition were announced:

An awards ceremony was held, hosted by Mrs. Fan, wife of Director Dai. Photos were taken of the winning babies, followed by the screening of the film "The Little Orphan's Paradise." The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Dai, the director, delivered the opening speech: "Today is the Fourth of April Children's Day, and we are also holding the awards ceremony for the city's 4th Annual Infant Health Competition. We deeply feel that being a human is most magnificent, and children are even more magnificent. Therefore, on this Fourth of April Children's Day, our bureau has specially organized the infant health competition. The actual work is funded by the Municipal Experimental Public Education Center. Our association has been handling infant registration matters since March 20th. For the convenience of travel, the city is divided into five registration areas: east, west, north, south, and central. The participating infants are divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D, based on their date of birth. A total of 366 people participated. March 31st and April 1st were the dates for checking the infants' physical condition: 244 people participated. For the sake of caution, our association organized a judging committee to determine the rankings and distribute the prizes. Each group is required to select the top ten, for a total of forty in all four groups. The number of participants in this session is greater than in previous sessions, the results are better than in the past, and the prizes are more numerous, indicating that the people of our city are paying more attention to infant health than in the past, which is a fortunate thing. However, there are a few points that I would like to bring to everyone's attention: The results of this examination show that most of the children who are growing up fat are those who are breastfed by their mothers. Mothers who love cleanliness generally have clean children. Some children are still breastfeeding at the age of one and a half, which is wrong. Some children have not been vaccinated against smallpox at the age of two, which is also wrong. There were more boys (176) than girls (68) participating in this infant competition, and the physical condition of boys was also better than that of girls, which seems to indicate a preference for boys over girls, which is also wrong."

Secretary-General's Speech

Secretary-General Luo delivered a speech, stating briefly: "Today is the Fourth of April Children's Day, and we are also using today to hold the city's 4th Annual Infant Health Competition. I am deeply grateful to all the parents who have led their beloved and cherished children to participate enthusiastically. Standing in the position of the municipal government, I would like to express my deep gratitude. Today, I would like to offer three suggestions, and I sincerely hope that all parents will pay attention:

First, why pay attention to the issue of children's education and infant care? This point is of great significance. Ancient China paid attention to nurturing from an early age, paying close attention to it during pregnancy, what is called prenatal education. Everything about children when they grow up, especially the issue of education, must be given even more attention. Originally, teaching and learning are two separate things. In China, parents only focus on the 'nurturing' aspect and pay little attention to the 'teaching' aspect. For example, young children usually like to eat whatever they want, and parents allow them to eat whatever they like, which will inevitably turn them into wild children. Therefore, more attention must be paid to prenatal education in national education. Otherwise, neglecting infants will have a significant impact on society and the country in the future. I sincerely hope that all parents will pay attention to prenatal education in the future, properly educate and nurture their children, and pay attention to children's education and youth education, which will not only benefit the country and society but also make no small contribution to the revival of the nation.

Secondly, parents often neglect their educational obligations towards their children due to excessive love, allowing them to eat whatever they want, and even when they are infants, they only care about their own preferences and do not consider the infants' discomfort. In fact, this motivation is for parents to love their own children, but the result is to harm the children. Therefore, because love causes harm, it not only does not benefit children and infants but even harms them.

Thirdly, in today's extraordinary situation, the lives of the general public are deeply troubled. Parents still feel that life is not enough, so they do not care about their children. I sincerely hope that all parents in the city will try their best to avoid difficulties and make their best efforts to protect their children.

The last point to pay more attention to is what is usually called longevity and wealth. In fact, longevity is needed, but wealth is not necessary, because the longevity of every child is of great importance to the future of the country and the nation. I sincerely hope that parents will educate and nurture young children and be truly responsible for the country and society. I hope that at the next Children's Day, all the people of the city will participate enthusiastically, so that the infant competition can be held on a larger scale.

### Investigation of the Shanghai-Ningbo Route

— Jia Xi

The ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route include the "Wansheng" and "Haitong" of the China Shipping Company, and the "Xin Ningshao," "Zi Maru," and "Xingdong" of the East Asia Marine Transportation Company. Their operating schedules are not fixed. Details are provided below:

China Shipping Company

The address is 4 Beijing Road. First, second, and third-class tickets are sold there. Fourth-class tickets are sold by the agent, Lida Company, at the Jinliyuan Wharf on Xin Kaihe. The fares are 18,720 yuan for first class, 11,240 yuan for second class, 6,875 yuan for third class, and 3,850 yuan for fourth class. The "Wansheng" ship can carry 4,000 passengers, and the "Haitong" can also accommodate slightly less than 3,000. However, first, second, and third-class tickets are extremely difficult to purchase, and few fourth-class tickets are sold openly. The docking locations are wharves 6, 7, 13 and the old Taikoo Wharf on the Bund. The departure time is usually 2:00 PM, and ticket sales start at 10:00 AM on the morning of the sailing date.

East Asia Marine Transportation Company

The head office is at 5 The Bund, and there are two agents: Anda Company at 122 Guangdong Road and Wang Chunji at Room 317, 851 Beijing Road (intersection of Xizang Road). The fares are 19,800 yuan for first class, 12,300 yuan for second class, 7,840 yuan for third class, and 3,810 yuan for fourth class. Fourth-class passengers must pay an additional 500 yuan for food.

The sailing schedules of the "Xin Ningshao," "Zi Maru," and "Xingdong" ships fluctuate greatly and are not announced in advance. Changes are often made temporarily. In order to prevent passengers from running around in vain, the Wang Chunji agency implements a pre-registration method, where tickets are sent by someone when there is a ship. The intention is excellent, and a handling fee of 200 yuan is charged for each ticket, but there are occasional cases of not charging according to the rules.

Conditions at the Wharf and Onboard

For luggage transportation, there is the publicly operated Shanghai Bund Wharf Travel Service, which charges 400 yuan for large items and 200 yuan for small items. (Passengers' luggage must be transported by them. Small packages are also not allowed to be carried. The handling fee is as high as 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per item, which urgently needs to be improved.

After the ship departs, there are still sampans carrying passengers who climb aboard halfway. The hoisting fee is 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Passengers without tickets are secretly helped to buy tickets by the waiters. The market price for a berth for a fourth-class passenger is about 10,000 yuan, and food and other expenses are also quite expensive. Therefore, travelers on this route must bring more travel expenses to avoid being in a difficult situation.

### Enemy Aircraft Illegally Strafe Civilians, Five Dead or Injured

On the first of this month, several American P-51 fighter planes invaded the Shanghai area and dropped bombs in the suburbs, causing very little damage on the ground. However, the enemy's evil nature erupted, and they actually strafed Chinese civilians with machine guns, resulting in deaths and injuries. According to police investigation, eleven men were killed by gunfire, and two were seriously injured. In addition, one man and one woman were slightly injured. The enemy aircraft strafed innocent Chinese civilians, which is inhumane, and all who heard of it were filled with hatred.

### 19th Installment of Allotted Sugar: Handling Payment Procedures
