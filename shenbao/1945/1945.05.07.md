### Japan's Response to Rapidly Changing European Situation: Retaining Freedom of Action; Foreign Minister Togo Declares Germany Has Violated Agreements

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Togo met with newspaper reporters at his official residence at 11:00 AM on the 6th. In response to reporters' questions regarding the potential impact on Japan's diplomatic relations with Germany, in light of Commander-in-Chief of the German Home Army Himmler's plea for peace with Britain and the United States, and Grand Admiral Dönitz's declaration of continuing the war against the Soviet Union, the Minister replied as follows: Himmler's plea to Britain and the United States and Dönitz's assumption of power and broadcast clearly indicate Germany's intentions, which are to wage war against the Soviet Union, while seeking peace with Britain and the United States. This is not only entirely different from the Empire's policy of maintaining neutrality with the Soviet Union while fighting Britain and the United States, but also a serious violation of the tripartite agreement of not concluding a separate peace. Therefore, once the situation is confirmed, the Empire will retain the freedom to act based on a new perspective regarding the tripartite agreement and other political measures between Japan and Germany. The Empire's attitude toward the rapidly changing situation in Europe has already been made clear. The following is a record of the conversation:

Most of the information regarding the recent situation in Germany is provided by the enemy, and thus carries propaganda undertones and contains contradictions. However, regarding Commander-in-Chief of the Home Army Himmler's plea for surrender to Britain and the United States, and Grand Admiral Dönitz's broadcast upon assuming office, emphasizing the continuation of the war against the Soviet Union, and offering an armistice to Britain and the United States on the condition that it does not hinder Germany's war against the Soviet Union, the information is generally consistent. If Germany's attitude is indeed as such, then its intent is to prioritize the war against the Soviet Union and seek peace with Britain and the United States. This differs from the Japanese Empire's purpose of maintaining neutrality with the Soviet Union and advancing toward war with Britain and the United States. Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that Germany, after the death of Führer Hitler, is capable of taking actions suitable to the tripartite agreement to jointly complete the war. Therefore, once the situation is confirmed, the Empire will have the right to act freely based on a new perspective regarding the tripartite agreement and other political measures between Japan and Germany. Regardless of Germany's attitude, Japan's determination to carry out the war against Britain and the United States will not be shaken in the slightest, as already clarified in Prime Minister Suzuki's statement.

### Over Forty Enemy Ships Sunk or Destroyed Around Okinawa: Imperial General Headquarters Announces Fierce Attack Results

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 6th: Japanese air force units have continued to attack enemy air bases on Okinawa Island and enemy ships and mobile units surrounding the island. Since May 3rd, continuous fierce attacks have inflicted enormous damage on the enemy. From May 3rd to the present, the war results confirmed by the Japanese side are as follows: Sunk: one converted aircraft carrier, three battleships, one cruiser, four cruisers or destroyers, one destroyer, one minesweeper, four ships of unknown type (including one large ship), and one transport ship. Destroyed: three converted aircraft carriers, one cruiser, one destroyer, and one transport ship. Over twenty ships were hit and caught fire. Most of the air units participating in this attack were special attack units. Japanese submarines attacked enemy supply units heading north in the sea south of Okinawa Island from the night of May 1st to the morning of the 2nd, sinking one large transport ship, two destroyers, and two ships of unknown type.

Statement by Department Head Matsushima

Central News Agency Report - On May 6th, the Imperial General Headquarters announced that Japanese forces in the Okinawa area had sunk another twenty-seven enemy ships. The cumulative war results of the Japanese military's operations in that area total 498 enemy ships sunk or destroyed. Colonel Matsushima, the Naval Press Director stationed in China, issued a statement, asserting that the enemy's naval power has suffered a crushing blow, and the Japanese military has completely seized the initiative in the operation. Furthermore, he described the enemy's predicament as follows: The enemy mobile units off the Nansei Islands have suffered significant damage and are unable to operate. Japanese air force and submarine units have also inflicted damage on enemy ships supporting land operations around Okinawa. The enemy forces on Okinawa Island have faced fierce counterattacks from the Japanese army for several days. As a result, the U.S. Army's 77th Division and the 1st Marine Division on the northern front have been transferred to the south for reinforcement. The U.S. 96th Division in front of Shuri City, which the enemy had claimed to be 800 yards from the city a few days ago, now admits in its May 5th battle report that the U.S. forces have retreated to a location 2,600 yards from the city. According to enemy reports, Japanese forces landed on the enemy's rear on Okinawa Island by boat on the night of the 4th, causing great confusion in the U.S. rear. Thus, the enemy forces in the Okinawa area are under pressure from the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and are in a very difficult situation. Enemy sea lanes are about to be cut off, and rescue is impossible. The 100,000 U.S. troops on the island are about to face complete destruction. This proves that the situation in Europe has absolutely no impact on Japanese military operations. On the contrary, the Japanese army is advancing with greater strength to reduce British and American forces.

### Japan Determined Not To Be Influenced By Dönitz's Unilateral Actions

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the current situation in Germany after the death of Führer Hitler, news from various sources in Europe unanimously reports that Germany is conducting peace negotiations with Britain and the United States, the common enemies of Japan, Germany, and Italy, while continuing to resist the Soviet Union, with whom Japan maintains neutral relations. Foreign Minister Togo met with a group of reporters on the 6th and clarified Japan's independent stance on the rapidly changing situation in Europe, explaining that this new situation is actually a violation of the separate peace agreement concluded by Japan, Germany, and Italy after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. If this news is confirmed, Japan will hereafter act from a new perspective and obtain the freedom to act. At the same time, he stated that even though Germany has lost its capacity for joint warfare, it will have no influence on the Japanese government's determination to complete the Greater East Asia Defense War. The Japan-Germany-Italy separate peace treaty was signed in Berlin on December 11, 1941, not long after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Article 1 of the agreement stipulates that Japan, Germany, and Italy shall carry out the war forced upon them by Britain with all their might until victory. Article 2 stipulates that Japan, Germany, and Italy shall not cease hostilities or make peace with either Britain or the United States without complete mutual understanding. Article 3 stipulates that the three countries must also closely cooperate after the completion of the war to establish a just new order as stipulated in the Tripartite Pact of September 27, 1940. From the above, it can be seen that the agreement not only stipulated that a separate peace would not be concluded, but also pledged cooperation in building a new order in East Asia and Europe after the war. However, according to the European situation, Himmler, a core leader of the German National Socialist Party, commander-in-chief of the domestic army, and minister of the interior, who controls the national police power and is the most powerful figure in Germany after the death of Führer Hitler, has suggested unconditional surrender to Britain and the United States. This information has not only been acknowledged by British and American officials, but also confirmed by the neutral Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, Dönitz stated in his broadcast to the nation upon assuming the position of head of state: "My first task is to save the German people from Bolshevik destruction. To achieve this goal, we must continue to fight. If Britain and the United States hinder our efforts to achieve this goal, then we will also continue to fight Britain and the United States." He clearly indicated that the continuation of the war against Britain and the United States would only be implemented when the British and American forces hinder the war against the Soviet Union. Dönitz's statement is completely contrary to Japan's war aims of crushing Britain and the United States in order to achieve self-existence and self-defense in Greater East Asia. Furthermore, it is not consistent with Japan's policy of maintaining neutrality with the Soviet Union in order to maintain stability in East Asia. From this, it can be seen that the Dönitz government has completely abandoned the intention of cooperating with Japan to complete the joint war against Britain and the United States. Regarding Dönitz's statement, the following facts can be used as evidence:

1.  German Armaments Minister Speer, in a broadcast speech on the 3rd, asked the people to actively cooperate with the enemy British and Americans. He stated that the railway organization should be restored as soon as possible and, with the permission or order of the British and Americans, do its best to transport food to areas threatened by starvation.

2.  German troops in northwestern Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands under the command of Dönitz have successively requested surrender.

3.  The anti-resistance strongholds of Prague and Kiel have been declared undefended cities, especially Kiel, which is a naval port under the direct command of Dönitz.

4.  It is reported that the representatives of the Norwegian garrison have also requested unconditional surrender to Britain and the United States.

In summary, it can be seen that the domestic situation in Germany since the death of Hitler has been collapsing, and the process is very clear. Therefore, Japan must adopt its own policies to deal with the rapidly changing situation.

Japanese Troops Launch Attack on the Island

Nansei Islands, 6th (Central News Agency) - Enemy forces on Okinawa Island have launched general attacks several times, and each time they have been thwarted by the brave fighting of the Japanese defenders, but the enemy forces are still preparing for the next offensive.

The enemy's front lines have already been shaken, and the Japanese military's advance is very smooth.

Nansei Islands Base, 6th (Central News Agency) - From the afternoon to the evening of the 5th, Japanese air force units attacked the island's airport several times.

### Yamazaki Promoted to President of South Manchuria Railway

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - After President of the South Manchuria Railway, Koiso Naoto, assumed the post of Minister of Transportation and Communications, Vice President Yamazaki Motoki was promoted to President.

### Greater East Asia Weekly War Situation

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The weekly war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia is as follows:

Okinawa Area

Since the 26th, Japanese forces have repeatedly broken through enemy attacks in front of the lines and have launched strong counterattacks from all sides. Japanese special attack units and air units have also responded to the counterattacks of ground units, inflicting heavy blows on enemy fleets and enemy bases around the island, causing confusion in the enemy camp, and the bombardment and bombing of the enemy fleets have gradually decreased. This week, enemy mobile units continued to shell the archipelago line from Amami Oshima to Sakishima Islands, and their activities have become more passive. Most of the fleet and air force gathered by the enemy have been sunk or destroyed. In order to remedy the decline, the enemy is actively expanding the airfields on Kerama Islands, Kamiyama Island, Ie Island, and the northern and central airfields of the main island, and is eager to quickly use the air force to destroy Okinawa, but it has been subjected to Japanese night air raids, which have bombed and destroyed enemy materials, fuel, and supplies, causing fires. Therefore, the enemy's airbase operations are becoming increasingly difficult, and it is still attempting to increase supplies from the Calcutta area, but about 600 of the enemy's large aircraft are involved in tactical operations this week.

Philippine Sea Area

This week, the enemy strongly promoted the attack, targeting Ormoc, and fierce battles unfolded day and night in various places.

Southwest Pacific

On the 27th, an enemy fleet attacked the Tarakan area. From the night of the 30th to the morning of the 1st, enemy troops landed in Lingkas, and fierce battles unfolded in various places. Air raids continue on Balikpapan and the Celebes resource areas.

Burma Area

Between Mandalay and Rangoon, enemy armored units gradually advanced south. On April 28, the enemy on the right bank of the Irrawaddy River simultaneously invaded Akyab. In southern Burma, on May 1, the enemy landed airborne units near Rangoon, and at the same time, invaded the mouth of the Rangoon River with landing craft, appearing to be beginning landing operations.

Indian Ocean Area

On the morning of the 30th, a British mobile unit, including aircraft carriers, appeared off Car Nicobar Island. In the afternoon, a part of it attacked Port Blair, shelling the land. The next day, enemy mobile units attacked Car Nicobar again, shelling the land. On the 3rd, several destroyers attacked Taikoku in the east during the day.

China Area

The Japanese troops in the Laohekou area secured the surrounding key lines and destroyed the enemy forces in the 1st and 5th War Zones facing them. In addition, a part of the 55th Army's main force in the Xinyiye area, 50 kilometers south of Nanyang, was being annihilated. On April 14, Japanese troops began operations from Ningxiang, Yongfeng, Shaoqing, and Dong'an west of the Yuehan Line. The enemy's 13th and 74th Armies, totaling seven divisions, carried out annihilation warfare. Currently, they are fiercely attacking the troops stubbornly resisting on the rugged Xuefeng Mountains.

Editorial

### The Way to Stabilize People's Hearts

Recently, due to the rapid changes in the European situation, people's minds in various parts of East Asia have been slightly stimulated. However, in order to win the Greater East Asia War, both the government authorities and social leaders should do their best to induce public sentiment to become calm. Because those who are flustered and impatient in the face of events will inevitably fail. Only in calmness can one accurately judge the trend of events and plan appropriate countermeasures. Therefore, in today's environment, we hope that people from all walks of life will observe the rapidly changing situation with a calm mind. In other words, the more urgent and tense the situation becomes, the more stable and calm people's hearts should appear. The stability of people's hearts can be reflected in both the government and the people. At the same time, only through the joint efforts of the government and the people can people's hearts be stabilized. On the government side, we advocate strengthening its position and promoting strong politics. On the negative side, of course, it is to prevent rumors and speculation and eliminate all genes that could confuse people's hearts. The recent rapid changes in the German-Italian war situation did not cause as much fluctuation in people's minds in Shanghai and other places as expected. This is the result of the recent efforts of the party authorities to curb rumors and speculation. At the same time, accurate reports of the truth of the situation at any time prevent speculators and enemy propaganda from taking advantage of it and prevent them from using false and misleading information to incite people's hearts. This is the recent progress of the government in stabilizing people's hearts.

On the positive side, the main thing is to strengthen the government's position and create a strong government. Only by promoting strong politics can the government demonstrate that it has a real grasp of national affairs and public security and that it has the ability to fulfill its responsibilities. Then any enemy strategy will not be able to exert its skills, and people's hearts will naturally be stabilized. In order to achieve this, the government must enhance its political prestige, effectively protect all the legitimate rights of the people, and further improve the people's lives, such as stabilizing currency values, curbing prices, and fair rationing. More importantly, it is necessary to further promote production and construction.

On the people's side, as long as the government can do the above two things, we believe that not only will people's hearts not be shaken by any external stimulus, but they will definitely rise up and cooperate automatically. The recent changes in the international situation have not caused any major fluctuations in people's minds in various places. As the editorial of the Mainland News Agency on the 4th of this month pointed out, this is because the government has done quite a bit of the above two things. However, to stabilize people's hearts, the people and the government must be equally responsible. We certainly hope that the government can do the above two things first, but at the same time, the people must also show trust in the government and cooperation with government policies. For example, the recent construction of the Soochow-Shanghai Highway and rural loans initiated by the government are enough to show that the government has the ability, determination, and strength to do things. Our people should also do their best to assist, and at the same time, some powerful people in the private sector should initiate and undertake some production and construction projects without waiting for the government to start them. For example, the recent Zhejiang gentry initiated the construction of the Zhejiang seawall project, which is the best example.

In short, at a time of turbulent situations, people's hearts need to be stabilized. How to stabilize people's hearts requires the government and the people to strengthen themselves on the one hand and cooperate with each other on the other. Therefore, under this kind of need, there is absolutely no room for those who only know how to be selfish and disregard public interests, nor is there any room for those who stand by and watch or evade responsibility. Only by actively taking responsibility together and constantly adapting to the changes in the situation through continuous efforts can we fundamentally stabilize people's hearts.

Translated Commentary

### The European Situation and the Hearts of the Chinese People

Under the rule of the National Government, political opportunists still survive. In Shanghai and other commercial centers, there are also many who are addicted to speculation, and they even use the misfortune of their motherland as a means of profiteering. The atmosphere created by these elements is truly disheartening for the pursuit of war. However, this evil trend has recently shown signs of gradual correction, which is worth noting. Against the backdrop of the rapid changes in the European situation, such as the fall of Berlin and the death of Hitler, some people have worried that the hearts of the people in Shanghai and other places will be shaken and uneasy, but in fact, not only has this kind of worry now been dispelled, but the general trend is exactly the opposite of what was expected, which is very gratifying in friendly China.

When the news of the fall of Berlin and other news came, the Shanghai market was quite calm, which was contrary to expectations. The prices of raw cotton, customs gold, public bonds, and food, which were expected to soar, continued to maintain their original state. This is naturally due to the efforts of the authorities to crack down, but it mainly reflects the stability of the hearts of the Chinese people, so that the tricks of speculators and opportunists are also unable to succeed. Perhaps some people say that the situation in Europe has been a local event since the middle of last month, so no greater fluctuations will occur now, but comparing today's market situation with the situation after the 15th of last month, this statement is very inappropriate and needs no argument.

The second noteworthy fact is that the so-called 5 billion yuan rural loan, the evacuation of small factories, etc., are particularly important at this stage and are being put into practice, which can completely dispel the蠢动 of political opportunists. Putting this long-term and sustainable construction work into practice can be regarded as the people expressing that they do not have any worries about the changes in the situation and are willing to continue to cooperate in carrying out the war. In particular, such as the 5 billion yuan rural loan, which was completely initiated by the private sector and has the cooperation of all the citizens of Shanghai, we can find its great significance here.

In the past, the hearts of the people in various places have almost always been stable, and they have only sometimes been slightly changed by reflecting the dynamics of Shanghai, but today, the reasons for inducing this kind of change are being eliminated. Therefore, there is no doubt that stability can be sustained forever. The so-called psychological construction in wartime has gradually possessed the conditions to enter the active stage today.

We have always had an optimistic tendency about the stability of the hearts of the Chinese people, and now it has been confirmed against the backdrop of the changes in the European situation. The hearts of the Chinese people themselves originally desire stability, but because of the existence of various troublemakers, they have not been able to show their original appearance. Today, the trouble-making work will eventually fail. We must take this opportunity to launch an ideological offensive in order to complete the psychological construction of wartime. Moving from the passive strategy of eliminating troublemakers to an ideological offensive and invigorating the development of public opinion work is a major issue facing the leaders of China and Japan today.

### Chongqing Sixth National Congress Adjourned the Day Before Yesterday

Central News Agency report from Chongqing on the 5th: The Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang was held in Chongqing on the 5th. After Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech, a preparatory meeting was held to organize the proposal review committee and various other committees to formally deliberate on the central issues of the congress, including the implementation of constitutional government and concrete plans for the National Assembly. In the preparatory meeting on the 5th, the agenda items proposed by representatives from various regions caused disputes. Four of these items are as follows: Improve the people's livelihood and immediately realize the Principle of the People's Livelihood. Fundamentally review foreign relations, especially the final review of the Soviet issue. The Kuomintang's exclusive organs, such as the Youth Training Corps, should be transferred to the government's Propaganda Department. The strong stance of the representatives on the above proposals and how the Chongqing authorities will decide are noteworthy.

### Full Text of Molotov's Speech on the Polish and Argentine Participation Issues at the San Francisco Conference

At this San Francisco Conference, disputes have arisen one after another. The most noteworthy are the disputes between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, and the resistance of small countries to the domination of large countries. In the former case, it is manifested in the number of votes, the issue of Polish and Argentine participation, and the Soviet Union's request for three votes. Regarding the issue of Polish and Argentine participation, this newspaper has selected and translated the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the plenary session on April 30 for reference.

[Editor's note: The current Soviet foreign policy in Europe is to establish pro-Soviet regimes around it. The proposal to invite Poland to participate in the San Francisco Conference is a concrete manifestation of this policy. However, this proposal was rejected at the plenary session on the 30th due to opposition from the United Kingdom and the United States.]

Chairman! Gentlemen!

The Soviet delegation believes that the Argentine issue, that is, the issue of inviting Argentina to attend this conference, is an extraordinary issue. Regarding this issue, I would like to say a few words in Russian, which not everyone can understand. However, I know that it is very appropriate to discuss the issue of justice in Russian, and I hope that everyone will understand and believe what I say. The issue of inviting Argentina to attend this conference was only suddenly raised among the delegations today. In the past, until now, not a single word has been discussed on this issue among the representatives of the four inviting countries. Therefore, it is easy to know that the Soviet delegation itself hopes to first understand this issue and also hopes to give all the representatives participating in this conference the opportunity to understand this issue. Therefore, the Soviet delegation proposes to extend the review of this issue for a few days.

Everyone knows that Argentina has taken a special position in this war against our common enemy. Everyone knows that during this war, Argentina's foreign policy was not always approved by other Allied nations, and Argentina's internal affairs were always opposed by other Allied nations. To prove my words, let me temporarily quote a statement by former US Secretary of State Hull. It was announced on September 8, 1944, and said: "Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull condemned Argentina as the headquarters of the fascist movement in this hemisphere and as the den of evil fugitives from other American countries."

I will quote another statement that is most supported by the general public. It was said by US President Roosevelt on October 1, 1944, namely: "I am very concerned about the development of events in Argentina in recent months. The situation is extremely contradictory, that is, at a time when the forces of oppression and aggression in Europe and other parts of the world are increasingly approaching complete failure, this country in our hemisphere is developing Nazi and fascist influences and is also expanding the adoption of Nazi and fascist methods."

I believe that these two statements are by no means unfounded, but are completely true facts. However, the words are still in my ears, and only a few months have passed. Could it be said that the situation in Argentina has undergone a fundamental change since then? I heard representatives from several American countries insist on their opinions, believing that the situation in Argentina has improved. Now I can only ask you to give the Soviet delegation and other delegations a considerable period of time to understand this fact, so as to make them believe whether the situation in Argentina is really as said by representatives of certain American countries. To achieve this, some research time is needed, at least a few days.

Please calmly consider: If we carelessly and without thorough consideration hurriedly invite Argentina, which helped our enemy, the fascist Axis powers, during the war, to attend this conference, without inviting Poland, one of the United Nations, what impact will it have on the conference?

Everyone knows that Poland has a glorious position in the ranks of the United Nations during this war, because it has used all its strength to oppose our common enemy. The heroic Polish people have always fought side by side with us in the past and present. They have made great sacrifices in the past and present. We cannot forget all of this under any circumstances.

Inviting Argentina, which has helped our common enemy from beginning to end during this war, to attend the conference, without inviting the Polish Provisional Government, which now has the great prestige and love of the Polish people in the Polish liberated area, - if we continue to do this inhumanely and unreasonably, the prestige of this conference will plummet or even be completely swept away. No one can deny that the Polish government is a democratic regime. This Polish Provisional Government has received great support from the people and is fighting against our common enemy together with our Allied countries. We still remember that the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were determined to help Poland and relax the standards to reorganize this government.

I firmly believe that this lofty resolution fully reflects the wishes of the Polish people, and we should not hesitate, but should strive to implement this resolution as soon as possible with the greatest speed. We naturally also know that the issue of reorganizing the Polish government is not the work of this conference. This issue is the work of the above-mentioned three Allied governments, and especially the work of the Polish people themselves. We all hope that the Polish government will be established on a broader democratic basis, and we also hope that all Allied governments will establish diplomatic relations with it. That's right. However, if we say that a general decision on the Polish issue should not be made at this conference, then we should not ignore the fact that a conference without the participation of representatives of the Polish people is currently being held. No matter how strongly we argue, it is not permissible to give a position at this conference to the representative of Argentina, which not only did not help us but also helped our enemy in the war, without giving a position to the representative of our heroic fighting ally, the Polish people.

Others have the right to say to me that Argentina is guilty, but these sins can be ignored. The question may also be raised in this way: Argentina's sins may be ignored, but I want to ask in return: If we can forget certain sins of Argentina, then why must we forget Poland's war merits? And why must we forget the great battle contribution of the Polish people against our common enemy?

There is a delegation from India in our conference, but India is not an independent country. We all know that one day we will hear the voice of the independent Indian people. Therefore, we have always agreed with the British government's opinion on giving a seat to the current incomplete Indian representative under the current conditions.

There is a delegation from the Philippines in our conference, but the Philippines is also not an independent country. We know very clearly that we will always hear the voice of the independent Philippines one day. But we agreed with the US government to give the people of the Philippines the opportunity to speak at present. Many countries that have no diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union until now have participated in this conference. Nevertheless, the Soviet government accepted the proposal of the United Kingdom and the United States and did not oppose their participation in this conference because the country had no diplomatic relations with the inviting country. We believe that we should also accept the opinions of the United Kingdom and the United States on this issue. In all these issues, the Soviet government has shown its attitude towards the conference issue to the other inviting countries. The four major inviting countries, which stand in the same position at this conference, have always agreed on this kind of behavior of inviting other countries to join the conference. We believe that this is the best practice, and we oppose those who destroy this unity.

I believe that we should all respect and practice our unity, and we should all strive to give other countries an opportunity to carefully and seriously consider all new proposals. Some of us have never had the opportunity to consider the proposals just made. Therefore, I believe that the issue of Argentina should not be resolved in this way, that is, do not resolve it hastily.

To sum up, the Soviet delegation's proposal is to extend the opportunity to study the issue of inviting Argentina to join the conference for a few days for discussion.

The Soviet delegation's request is only this. (Translated from the Shanghai Russian New Life newspaper on May 3)

### The Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank Will Issue Gold Certificates Today, with a Publicly Set Selling Price of 780,000 Yuan per Taels

The Central Reserve Bank, with the special approval of the Ministry of Finance, will issue gold certificates in three denominations: one tael, five taels, and ten taels. It is scheduled to start issuing and selling them at its Shanghai branch at 23 The Bund within two days, today (7th), tomorrow (8th), and the day after tomorrow (9th). The selling price is publicly set at 780,000 yuan per tael based on the recent market situation. The gold certificates sold will be redeemed in gold (992 fineness or higher) starting from June 8th of this year. Merchants and citizens can redeem them with cash and checks or bank drafts payable by the bank. These gold certificates can be freely bought and sold in the market. Because the issuing place has sufficient gold reserves and is managed by a reserve management committee organized by influential officials and civilians, this measure is indeed a good strategy for tightening the currency and suppressing prices.

### The Seventeenth Air Defense Day to Implement Various Training Programs, Citizens Should Comply with the Training Methods

The day after tomorrow (9th) is the seventeenth Air Defense Day. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters will, as usual, expand the publicity of the significance of air defense and implement various air defense training programs. The time and methods of alarm training have been published in various newspapers yesterday. Citizens should pay attention to implementing various necessary measures in accordance with the specified time and the nature of the alarm. At the same time, in addition to the comprehensive training in local areas within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple, Jiangning Road, and Putuo Road third sub-bureaus, each district will still designate locations to hold various main training programs. The Huangpu and Laoza districts will jointly hold a large-scale exercise on Shanxi Road at 2:00 PM on that day. It is stipulated that each store will send three people to participate in the exercise. The police and Baojia air defense personnel will only stand in a guiding and assisting position, while ordinary citizens will be the main body. Other factories and buildings will also implement comprehensive training separately, with personnel from the Air Defense Headquarters and the respective sub-bureaus guiding them.

Training Time and Key Points

The key points that Baojia personnel and citizens should pay attention to are: Alarm messengers should pay attention to delivering alarms at the specified time. The use of alarm flags should be absolutely correct. Air defense equipment should be sorted out in advance. Air raid shelters should be properly maintained. Air defense lights should also be inspected and maintained at any time. Other matters related to air defense must be absolutely noted to avoid being caught off guard in an emergency.

Traffic Lights and Lights of Most Concern

It is also learned that the air defense authorities are particularly concerned about the control of lights and traffic, because this is the most important thing in air defense missions. Therefore, on this Air Defense Day, special attention is paid to the control of lights and traffic, and all the police and Baojia personnel are dispatched to strictly implement it. Citizens should strictly abide by and implement it. Those who violate it will be severely punished, and the regulations must be followed at ordinary times.

Today and Tomorrow's Broadcasting and Gong-Beating Methods

In order to make all citizens and Baojia air defense workers in this city clearly understand the sound of the gong alarm, the Municipal Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has specifically broadcast the gong-beating method on Shanghai Radio on the two days of today (7th) and tomorrow (8th). At that time, the chief of the Propaganda Section, Ikeda, and the deputy chief of the Air Defense Section, Li Zhenhuan, will preside over the gong-beating. The time will be from 7:20 PM to 8:00 PM, and all citizens can listen to it during this time.

### The Business Control Association Holds Regular Board Meetings

The National Business Control Association has reached its one-year anniversary since its reorganization last July. The various business situations of the various business committee-controlled organizations, including control implementation, payment collection, storage, and capital raising, should be reported to the government. A compilation committee was specially formed to prepare an overview of the control work over the past year and to ask the government for instructions on the implementation of control policies in the future. It is also learned that the association is scheduled to hold the eleventh joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the afternoon of the 9th of this month to discuss everything. The material purchase plans submitted by each control committee for this year will also be reviewed and discussed before being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### The Banking Industry Discusses the Development of Bill Issuance Methods

The two banking industry guilds have jointly agreed on a method to facilitate payments:

Starting from May 16th, customers of various banks and trading houses who issue payment bills from banks and trading houses will have the last digit of the bill amount rounded to the hundreds place. The remaining amount below the hundreds place will be paid by the customer in cash. If there are still amounts below the hundreds place, the paying bank or trading house will only pay the full amount above the hundreds place, and will not pay the remaining amount. The issuance of various bills by banking colleagues will also be handled in accordance with the prescribed methods.

Starting from May, the settlement of various deposit and debit interest by banks and trading houses will be rounded to the yuan place, and the amount below the yuan place will not be counted.

### A Glimpse of Jing'an Temple Over the Past Three Years

The important work of the temple in the past three years is roughly as follows:

Buddhist Lectures: Two years ago, in order to have academic discussions on Buddhist teachings and to spread the Buddhist spirit to all levels of society, the temple founded Buddhist lectures and invited Buddhist scholars such as Xingci, Chishi, Zhifeng, and Ji Zhushi to serve as lecturers. The third session continued to begin on the 15th of last month, and Venerable Yingci, a senior monk of the Avatamsaka School, was invited to lecture on the "Avatamsaka Dharma World Profound Mirror." In each session, there were professors, scholars, bankers, civil servants, students, etc., often reaching more than two or three hundred people. Some of them even traveled long distances through wind and rain to attend the lectures. This spirit of exploring Buddhism is admirable.

Buddhist Sunday Academic Lectures: In the summer of the 1931, the temple initiated Buddhist Sunday academic lectures. At that time, in view of the decline of academic research in Shanghai and the depression of young people's thoughts and emotions, the temple used Sundays and holidays to discuss the comparison between general academic disciplines and Buddhism. The speakers included Fubao's "Buddhism and Science," Fan Guji's "Buddhism and Life," Ma Gongyu's "Buddhism and Art," Chishi Dharma Master's "Buddhism and Philosophy," Yao Minghui's "Buddhism and Confucianism," Zhao Baixin's "Buddhism and Literature," Yuan Ying Dharma Master's "Buddhism and Being a Person," Zhao Gochu's "Mahayana Buddhism and Relief Work," and Chen Binhe's "Ming Dynasty Zhu Shunshui's Appreciation of Japanese Culture," etc. The number of lectures totaled more than 40 sessions, and more than 60,000 people from all walks of life attended the lectures. Later, due to environmental reasons, it was temporarily suspended.

Buddhist Scholarship Fund: After the war, the number of young people in Shanghai who lost their studies increased. Therefore, the temple held a Buddhist scholarship fund in the summer of the 1932. Initially, the beneficiaries included students from Fudan, Datong, St. John's, and the Comparative Law Institute, as well as Tongde Medical College. Later, the number of places increased, and middle school students who came to apply were also subsidized. At the same time, in the autumn of last year, the temple united with the mountains in the city to collect funds for scholarships and distributed them to students in various schools through Xin and Liang newspapers.

Buddhist Nanxiang Village Elementary School: The temple has more than 70 acres of lower courtyard land in the northwest of Nanxiang Town. Children in nearby villages lost their studies because they were too far from the money. Therefore, the temple used the anti-vacant land in the lower courtyard in the autumn of last year to establish the "Buddhist Nanxiang Village Elementary School." With the enthusiastic support of the temple's Dharma protectors and local people, preparations were soon completed. In the first semester, there were 60-70 students at the school. The number of students has increased this semester, reaching more than 100.

Translation of Buddhist Masterpieces: In recent years, the academic research of general cultural figures has been stagnant due to various reasons. In order to promote Buddhist culture and study noble academics, the temple initiated the translation of Buddhist masterpieces. Scholars such as Zhifeng Dharma Master, Huang Miaowu, Lin Ziqing, and Chen Xiaoxian often contribute manuscripts, which can be printed and compiled into a series of books after the war.

Reorganizing Internal Temple Affairs: Repairing halls, building corridors in the back hall, rebuilding new halls, etc.; sorting out temple properties, recovering leased land, repairing contracts, etc.; correcting legal affairs, eliminating bad customs in legal affairs, such as breaking blood lakes and breaking hells, etc.; decorating the courtyard, banning generations and gambling, etc.

Current Plan

The current important plan of the temple is to rebuild the mountain gate and erect the ancient monument Yongquan Fantang. The temple's halls and houses are usually very wide. In the past, due to the leasing of the base, the construction was abnormal, so that the western mountain gate, located near the Bank of Communications, was located in a corner, which was inconvenient to open and close, while the eastern mountain gate was rented out to city houses, which was unsightly. Last year, in order to recover the property rights of the city houses on both sides of the temple gate in advance, after several negotiations, it took half a year. Later, with the strong mediation of Dharma protectors Li Sihao, Chen Binhe, and Sun Chunsheng, and especially with the intention of the sub-lessee Huang Yufu of the Huizhong Bank to protect the ancient temple, it was finally resolved satisfactorily. The temple plans to rebuild the mountain gate after recovering it and erect the Buddhist banner beside the Yongquan well in front of the gate to highlight the ancient monuments.

Future Hope

The following are the hopes of the temple in the future:

Establish a Buddhist seminary to cultivate Buddhist Dharma propagation talents.

Establish a Dharma Treasure Hall to collect ancient and modern Chinese and foreign Buddhist classics and Buddhist art objects for public reading and perception.

Establish a public school to assist social education.

Establish a free clinic for the poor to relieve the poor and sick compatriots.

Establish a farm to lay the foundation for the production business.

Set up a Buddhist cafeteria to facilitate the meals of civil servants and low-income people in the western part of Shanghai.

### The Financial Situation in Shanghai This Week Has Been Stable, but General Prices Are Still Rising

In the financial situation of this city, although it is in the midst of the European situation, due to the imposition of various pressures by the authorities, speculators have been unable to manipulate it. Therefore, the rise and fall have not been as large as in the past. Although it rose sharply on Thursday, it fell in time. By the close of the market on Saturday morning, the market price had risen very slightly compared with the closing price on the previous Saturday, and it had generally tended to hover. The public price has been weak all the time, and the stock market has seen a gradual rise in the first half of the week and a slight hover in the second half of the week. People's hearts are still strong. Although there has been a large amount of loosening of funds released by the Central Reserve Bank, the prices have been strictly checked and cracked down by the financial authorities. Therefore, no one dares to indulge arbitrarily. The bulls are waiting and watching, and retail investors have slightly spit out sporadic funds. Therefore, by the close of the market on Saturday, the stock market has generally fallen slightly. The market news is that the issuance of gold certificates by the Central Reserve Bank will suppress prices, which will inevitably affect the stock market. As for the industrial and commercial sectors, they are still considered stable. The market prices of rice and miscellaneous grains are calm, but the general prices of cotton textiles and other daily necessities are rising steadily. Especially from May 1st, various public utilities such as vehicle electricity, electricity, and tap water have increased by two to three times. The cost of transporting various materials has increased, stimulating price increases, and the situation is even more worrying. It is learned that the relevant economic authorities in this city are actively trying to restore factory power, increase production, and improve transportation and logistics to dredge the source of goods in order to relieve the current difficulties in the lives of Shanghai citizens, in addition to continuing to strictly crack down on hoarding and speculation.

### City Economic Bureau Abolishes Seventh Section

The Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau, in order to enhance administrative efficiency, has specially abolished the Seventh Section. All investigation affairs of the Seventh Section will be handled by the Inspection Office, and statistical affairs will be handled by the First Section.

### Five Dance Halls in Changning District Close Down

Since Yao Benyuan was transferred to the position of director of the Changning Road Police Sub-Bureau, he has adopted a strict approach towards dance halls within the district. Recently, after the relaxation of closing times, inspections have become even more rigorous. Any violation of the stipulated time limits, without any regard for personal connections, results in immediate summons and punishment by the bureau, leaving no room for compromise. Consequently, the Luck West Dance Hall, the Foolish Country Cafe, and the Man Nong Weituo Bar, among others, have all voluntarily ceased operations one after another. The Argentine Foreign General Assembly is also in a state of virtual suspension. Last night, the Countryside Hotel was found to have violated regulations by exceeding the time limit for the third time. The sub-bureau reported this to the general bureau, which ordered a ten-day suspension as a warning. It is reported that there are six dance halls in the Changning district, and five have already closed down, which demonstrates the strict enforcement of the police sub-bureau.

### Director Gu of the Baojia Office to Broadcast Today

Gu Jiwu, the Director of the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, will broadcast at 9:30 PM this evening (the 7th) on the Shanghai Radio Station, speaking on the topic of "My Views on Handling Baojia Work." All citizens are welcome to listen at that time.

### Fourth Class Students of Naval Academy Scheduled to Hold Graduation Ceremony

The fourth class of officer students at the Central Naval Academy have completed their studies and are scheduled to hold a graduation ceremony at the school on Longhua Road at 9:00 AM on the 11th of this month (May). The Minister of the Navy, Ling Xiao, and the President of the Academy, Jiang Xiyuan, will personally preside over the ceremony.

### Yesterday's Discussion on Fundraising Methods for Rebuilding Jing'an Temple's Mountain Gate

More than sixty people attended, including Wen Lantin, Wu Yunqi, Pan Sanxing, Huang Zenshi, and Shen Changguang. During the meeting, they jointly discussed plans for fundraising, selecting a contractor, and architectural plans, and immediately began to solicit donations.

### This Office and Huisheng Hospital Jointly Organize Report on Assistance for Poor Women in Childbirth

The Kangnaotuo Road Obstetrics Hospital in this city has always been very enthusiastic about providing services to the poor and sick. Through special arrangements by this office, free childbirth assistance is provided. For each parturient in April, the hospital stay is limited to a maximum of seven days, including delivery fees and meals, at a cost of only 3,000 yuan. At a time when prices of goods and medicines are soaring, the hospital is subsidizing a considerable amount, benefiting poor parturients, which is highly commendable. A total of ten women were hospitalized for delivery in April, and all of them had good outcomes. A total of 30,000 yuan was directly paid to the hospital by this office, and the parturients did not have to pay any expenses. The names of the assisted parturients are recorded as follows: Cao Chen gave birth to a daughter, Xie Li gave birth to a daughter, Huang Zhaoqiong gave birth to a son, Jin Xiufang gave birth to a daughter, Lu Zhao gave birth to a daughter, Wu Wang gave birth to a son, Sun Zhujun gave birth to a daughter, Huang Zhao gave birth to a son, Qian Ge gave birth to a daughter, Chen Zheng gave birth to a daughter.

### Shanghai Traffic Company

— Jiaxi

— An Analysis of Shanghai Public Utilities (Part Two) —

Forty Years of Evolution

The current Shanghai Metropolitan Transportation Co., Ltd. evolved from the British-owned Tramway Company before the war. The British Tramway Company was founded in 1906. Initially, it was a Sino-British joint venture, but due to sluggish business and gradual losses, Chinese shareholders such as Zhu Lanfen proposed withdrawing their shares. Later, the company's former Taipan, Tao Lun, returned to London to appeal to the British financial community. With the loan assistance of the Participation Bank, all the shares owned by Chinese were bought back, and shares with a face value of ten yuan only returned one yuan. From then on, it was entirely operated by the British. At that time, the public was not enlightened, and citizens were superstitious and reluctant to ride the trams. After the British took over independent operation, they hired a group of unemployed vagrants, giving each person a set of blue short shirts and pants. They sat on the trams all day, with a daily meal allowance of three corners, and gifts such as cologne, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soaps were given to passengers. Only then did the public's doubts begin to subside, and the number of passengers increased daily. The first trams were the tracks of Route Eight and Route Seven, and then Route One and Route Two were added. Each route had six or seven trams running daily. Thereafter, business became increasingly prosperous, and more vehicles were purchased. By then, there were a total of 128 trams. In addition, 20 German Siemens trams were sold to Tianjin. Currently, less than 100 trams are in operation. There are two hundred trackless trams, but only about thirty are currently in operation. However, the daily operating income is higher than before, and the profit rate has exceeded pre-war levels by eight or nine thousand times.

The Tramway Company Under British Management

At that time, the main assets of the British Tramway Company were the aforementioned trams and trolleybuses. The old station at 80 Hed Road served as its base, and later a new station was established at the Huishan Wharf on Yangshupu Road. After the Second Battle of Shanghai, it was temporarily merged into the old station, but the management procedures remained independent. There was a tram repair shop on Baikai Road. Its internal organization was divided into the Vehicle Department, with drivers and ticket sellers as the backbone, occupying an extremely important position in terms of numbers and work. The second was the Engine Department. The common copper artisans were the most organized and powerful part of the tram company. This was entirely due to the greater opportunities for contact in terms of work relationships and working hours, unlike the dispersed organization of the Vehicle Department, where they could not see each other in the morning and evening, and there were frequent frictions between drivers and ticket sellers. At that time, the British supporters often used this contradiction to carry out provocative and divisive tactics, to achieve their goal of enslaving Chinese workers.

The administrative management system of the British Tramway Company, the highest position was the Taipan, or general manager. In the past, occupations in the tram company were generally considered to be a lucrative profession, and many sought opportunities, even paying a considerable price as a stepping stone to enter the company. Workers who were fired could also get their jobs back by paying money. Secondly, some old workers or staff members who had served in the company for many years should be given retirement benefits when they retired according to regulations. However, the British in charge of the company at that time often dismissed them on purpose, so that they would not receive half of their retirement benefits. However, according to insiders, it was still recorded as "retirement" in the company's reports, and the retirement benefits were paid in full. If these numbers were carefully calculated, they would be quite considerable, which shows the corruption of the British.

Analysis of the Cargo Nationality and Age of Employees

At present, the company has a total of nearly three thousand employees (excluding 120 foreigners in senior positions). The employees of the Vehicle Department account for the vast majority, followed by the Engine Department. In terms of job function, there are 1,200 ticket sellers, 600 drivers, 500 ticket inspectors, and more than 400 workers (including: wire pullers, road priers, coppersmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, electricians, sleeve adders, and wire repairers), and more than 200 laborers.

Most of these employees were differentiated from the countryside. In terms of origin, the Vehicle Department is mostly from northern Jiangsu, especially Yancheng. The next most common origins are Wuxi, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang. The Engine Department is mostly from Ningbo, accounting for about six-tenths, followed by local, Yangzhou, Wuxi, and Anhui, accounting for two-tenths, and the northern Jiangsu group accounting for two-tenths, mostly blacksmiths and laborers.

The most common age of workers is between thirty and forty, followed by those between twenty and thirty. There are more drivers over forty than ticket sellers. The age of employees in the Engine Department is also relatively old, which is entirely due to the need for skilled techniques in the above two types of work, making the turnover relatively small.

In terms of gender, the tram company has not yet found any female workers or staff members. However, in foreign countries, it is very common for women to work in transportation agencies. In Japan and the Soviet Union, women are very common in transportation agencies, and even drivers and coppersmiths also employ women.

Current Employee Treatment

Employee wages are calculated in three ways: hourly, daily, and monthly. Staff members are mostly paid monthly, drivers and ticket sellers are paid daily, and coppersmiths and laborers in the Engine Department are paid hourly. At the same time, wages vary, and even the wages for the same position vary depending on the length of service. Recently, the highest salary for ticket inspectors is 44,000 yuan. Ticket sellers and drivers can earn about 35,000 yuan per month, and ordinary workers only receive a little over 30,000 yuan per month. The last time fares increased by more than two times, wages also increased by 30%. After the tram fare increased by two borrows on May 1st, the rate of wage increase has not yet been announced. According to past practice, wage increases are not announced in advance, and one can only know when the salary is paid. The salary is paid twice a month, once on the 13th and once on the 27th. Each month, three dou of rice can be allocated, but there are more or less, and each dou costs more than 1,300 yuan.

The promotion of workers varies from department to department, and the same is not true for drivers and ticket sellers. Ticket sellers who work for 26 days in a month can get four days of promotion, and drivers who work for 26 days in a month can get three days of promotion. In reality, the so-called promotion means Sunday work. Most foreign enterprises take Sundays off, but tram workers cannot take holidays on Sundays, only in rotation. In principle, one day's wages should be given for each Sunday, but if drivers and ticket sellers only work 25 days or 25 and a half days in a month, there is no promotion, so workers completely lose their due rest days and wages every week. Sometimes, even if they have worked for 25 and a half days, the dispatcher stops the last half day of work, and promotion is naturally out of the question.

Workers do not receive wages for sick leave, and staff members used to receive their full salaries during sick leave, but this has now been cancelled. If a worker is injured on duty, wages can be paid as usual, but in the event of death, a small amount of compensation is given based on the number of years of service and the usual diligence of service. Those who die on duty can get one-twelfth of the compensation for their entire working time.

Retirement benefits are only paid to those who have served loyally and diligently for 15 years and are over 55 years of age, and who have been certified by a doctor as being old. The amount is one twenty-fourth of the entire working period, for example, those who have worked for 15 years can get seven and a half months of retirement benefits. Those who have worked for 20 years can get one-twelfth of the retirement benefits. However, there are often many employees who have served for more than 20 years who stop working due to various reasons, and receive no pension at all.
