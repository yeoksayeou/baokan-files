### The House of Peers Held a Plenary Session Yesterday: The Japanese Prime Minister Elaborated on His Determination; The Army and Navy Ministers Reported on the War Situation, Confident of Victory

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:10 AM on the 11th. First, Speaker Tokugawa introduced the newly appointed members chosen by Imperial Order and reported on the circumstances of the Imperial Palace being defiled by an air raid and the request for the Emperor's well-being. Then, Prime Minister Koiso took the stage and emphatically stated that should the enemy dare to invade the homeland, they would be completely annihilated before landing. The government is determined to ensure thorough preparation (the gist of the speech is in another article). Next, Army Minister Sugiyama reported on the war situation in Luzon and Iwo Jima, expressing full confidence, stating that the enemy's invasion of the homeland is the best opportunity for a decisive land battle, something they have been seeking since the retreat from Guadalcanal. The government has the confidence to resolutely destroy the enemy. Subsequently, Navy Minister Yonai explained the war situation regarding the enemy's mobile fleet attacking the homeland, stating that the opportune moment to eradicate the arrogant enemy on the ocean is imminent. After the presentation, he stepped down amidst thunderous applause. Afterwards, members raised questions, with Mr. Akachi questioning the government's financial policies for approximately one hour. This was followed by a closed session, where Mr. Matsumura, Mr. Kawai, and Mr. Ohara questioned the government's beliefs. The closed session adjourned at noon, and the meeting was then adjourned.

Army Minister's Report Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - During the plenary session of the Japanese House of Peers, Army Minister Sugiyama reported on the war situation, the gist of which is as follows: In Luzon, General Yamashita's entire force, along with naval units, are defending three major strongholds: the mountainous areas northeast of the central Luzon plain, the mountains west of the Clark area, and the highlands east of Manila. Together with the garrison forces in Manila, they are fighting fiercely, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy through skillful offensive and defensive operations, aiming for a favorable overall Japanese war effort. To date, the enemy has committed fourteen or fifteen divisions, approximately 200,000 troops, to Luzon. Over one hundred enemy ships have been sunk or destroyed, and 70,000 enemy soldiers have been killed, annihilating one-third of the landed enemy forces. General Yamashita's outstanding leadership and the bravery of the Japanese soldiers are gradually achieving the operational objectives. Meanwhile, the fierce battle on Iwo Jima is intensifying. Due to the enemy's intense artillery fire day and night, the entire island has been turned into scorched earth, becoming a desolate battlefield. The Japanese army and navy soldiers defending the island are united as one and continue to fight valiantly. On this isolated island, seven and a half kilometers long and four kilometers wide, the enemy has deployed three divisions, over 40,000 troops, and their losses have exceeded 20,000. The army and navy are also cooperating closely, diligently preparing for battle. If the enemy advances to the homeland, they will be met with special attack aircraft and various new weapons targeting their ships. Even if the enemy manages to land, a land battle will be waged, with firm confidence in decisively annihilating the enemy. Now, the enemy is eager to end the war quickly and is resorting to any means, with increasingly fierce air raids. The indiscriminate bombing of the capital on the evening of the 9th is particularly intolerable to both humans and gods. Victory must be achieved at all costs; this is the unwavering principle shared by the entire nation. Under the Emperor's authority, the 100 million citizens and the military must respond with strategies for certain victory. By displaying patriotic fervor and overcoming any air raid and hardship, and by uniting as one, we can be certain that the Empire will be victorious.

Navy Minister's Report Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Navy Minister Yonai stated his navy's determination at the plenary session of both houses of the Diet on the 11th. He briefly stated that the Japanese Imperial Navy and the Army are united as one and that everyone in the military is certain that when the right opportunity arises, they will strike. The main points are as follows: Enemy B-29 aircraft have been frequently attacking. Furthermore, enemy mobile forces have attacked the homeland three times since mid-February. Each time, the enemy has suffered considerable damage, but it is regrettable that our forces have not been able to inflict fatal blows on enemy ships. At that time, considering various circumstances, we have endured what was difficult to endure. However, the Imperial Navy, emphasizing its close cooperation with the Imperial Army, is confident that when the opportunity arises, it will be able to capture and annihilate the arrogant enemy at every attempt. The Imperial Navy has this confidence, and the morale of the entire force is high and heroic.

### Key Points of Prime Minister Koiso's Speech

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The key points of Prime Minister Koiso's speech are as follows:

The Vietnamese Authorities Lack Sincerity

First, I will explain the measures taken by the Japanese government regarding French Indochina. Indochina's geographical location is of great importance to the peace of East Asia and the safety of Japan. The Japanese and French governments had military cooperation for the joint defense of Indochina. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation in East Asia changed dramatically. The Japanese government respected the agreement concluded with the Vichy government and continued to cooperate with the French authorities and military in Indochina to jointly defend the region, even when the military and political situation in France became critical in August of last year. However, the Vietnamese authorities changed their attitude according to the changing situation. Although they superficially claimed friendship and cooperation with Japan, they secretly adopted an increasingly uncooperative attitude. What is even more infuriating is that they dared to pray for the early return of American forces to suppress East Asia and actively attempted to secretly connect with anti-Axis elements in their country. On the other hand, considering the war situation in East Asia, the enemy Americans have repeatedly attacked Indochina, and it is difficult to predict when they will formally invade the region. In this urgent situation, Japan instructed its representative in Vietnam to repeatedly negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities to implement effective measures for joint defense. However, the Vietnamese authorities showed no sincerity and tried to resist passively. Therefore, the Japanese government confirmed that the situation could not be delayed any longer and instructed Ambassador Matsumoto in Vietnam on March 9 to urge Governor-General Decoux to reconsider.

Full Support for the Indigenous People

At the same time, Japan requested concrete measures to strengthen cooperation in the joint defense of Indochina, but the Vietnamese authorities refused with excuses. At this point, Japan had no choice but to independently defend Indochina against the current powerful enemy. The Japanese military took the minimum necessary military measures to remove officials hostile to the Japanese military. However, Japan, in addition to absolutely respecting the inherent systems of Annam, Tonkin, and Laos, is willing to provide all possible assistance to the indigenous people who want to eliminate American and British aggression in East Asia and defend their homeland. Through such mutual cooperation, we aim to complete the defense of Indochina against attacks from the US and Britain. Japan has no territorial ambitions in Indochina and intends to implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration in Indochina while taking the aforementioned provisional measures. When the forces invading Indochina are eliminated, the oppressed peoples of Annam and other nations will inevitably raise their voices for national independence, and Japan is willing to provide full support for these demands. Furthermore, the Guangzhou Bay, which France had always ruled as part of Indochina, has been cleansed of its invasive forces and restored to its original state. The Japanese government is prepared to agree when the National Government recovers this territory and exercises its autonomous administration.

Japanese Soldiers Firmly Defending Strongholds

Next, the current war situation is extremely critical, and the attacks are becoming increasingly fierce. On Luzon and Iwo Jima, the enemy forces, disregarding losses and relying on their overwhelming material strength, are launching fierce attacks. Japanese soldiers are firmly defending their strongholds under difficult conditions, displaying great determination and launching fierce counterattacks, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. The enemy on the Mariana Islands is gradually strengthening its air power, intensifying air raids on the Japanese homeland. In addition, enemy mobile forces are frequently appearing in Japanese waters, attacking the homeland with carrier-based aircraft, which cannot be ignored. The tyrannical and insatiable enemy has repeatedly injured and killed innocent civilians, destroying homes, schools, hospitals, and temples. The future of the war situation cannot be lightly predicted. However, considering the enemy's previous operational guidance, which relies on overwhelming material superiority and continuous relentless attacks, we must be aware that the enemy may be eager to end the war quickly. In the near future, a situation may arise where the enemy rushes towards our homeland with the aim of attacking. If our Imperial soil becomes a battlefield, it will be a great opportunity to make the enemy stumble. The Americans have already experienced the difficulties of landing operations on Pacific islands, even with superior forces. Furthermore, if the enemy invades our homeland, no matter how hard they try to transport troops and supplies, the preparation for the decisive battle on our homeland is so thorough and complete that the enemy Americans will not be able to covet it.

Advantageous Terrain and Harmony; The Enemy Will Surely Be Annihilated Upon Arrival

However, if the enemy comes near our waters, we must strike them at sea. If the enemy attempts to land, we must shoot them down into the sea at the water's edge. If the enemy eventually lands, we must thoroughly crush them with our hammers. In short, the battlefields for intercepting the enemy are all in our homeland, giving us the advantage of terrain. And all of our 100 million compatriots are engaged in defense in cooperation with the military, giving us the harmony of people. Our 100 million compatriots, based on the national policy of integrating the military and agriculture, can exert the benefits of total war against the enemy. Furthermore, considering the traditional leadership skills of the Imperial Army and the determination of Japanese soldiers to protect the Imperial nation, we are confident that we will be able to annihilate the enemy in the upcoming operations around the homeland, preventing them from setting foot on our soil. From the perspective of operations and tactics, the integrated land and sea operations can unleash imaginative tactics at this time. We are confident that the Japanese military will be able to seize the divine opportunity for a decisive battle. The government is taking this extraordinary situation as a premise, and in order to correspond with the operations, the interception and decisive battle measures that completely match the command are being taken. Now, I further state that we will condense the nation's total strength on the point of victory, and with swift and resolute determination, we will vigorously promote various policies. In this emergency, our 100 million compatriots must also re-awaken, solidify their belief in certain victory, and not fear hardship. I hope everyone will consistently strive to protect the national polity and territory. The countries and peoples of the Greater East Asia must also firmly cooperate with Japan to protect and revive East Asia, and stand up to destroy the tyrannical enemy. We express our heartfelt respect for the dedicated efforts of the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia.

### Realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Legacy: Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death

Today is the 20th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. Twenty years ago today, Dr. Sun Yat-sen suddenly passed away, leaving the heavy responsibility of building and saving the nation on the shoulders of comrades across the country. Recalling the sudden loss of our leader on that day, there was truly endless sorrow.

At the end of November 1924, five months before his death, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in a speech to five groups in Kobe, pointed out that the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan would surely unite in the future, saying, "The largest ethnic groups in East Asia are China and Japan. China and Japan have not yet had major contacts, but the trend of the future is that the ethnic groups in East Asia must unite." At the welcoming party on the same day, he also hoped that the Japanese would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties, saying, "Japan is now the strongest country in East Asia. It is impossible for an independent country to be friendly with a colony. If Japan is sincere in being friendly with China, it should first help China abolish the unequal treaties and regain its master status, allowing the Chinese people to obtain free status." Twenty years after Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, our allied nation Japan has indeed lived up to expectations, assisting us in recovering the concessions and abolishing the unequal treaties. China and Japan can indeed unite and work together for the glory and freedom of East Asia.

Twenty years ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out the inevitability of a war, saying, "To ask the Europeans to peacefully return our rights is like seeking skin from a tiger. It is impossible. To recover our rights, we must resort to force." He also rebuked the general pessimists, saying that they mistakenly believed that "European culture, science, and industry are advanced, and that Asia can never resist Europe, can never escape European oppression, and will forever be slaves to Europe." He pointed out that the East Asian ethnic groups would surely win in this war, saying, "Japan has long had complete military strength. Although our China has a population of 400 million and has always loved peace, it will certainly fight at the critical moment of life and death. If all the Asian ethnic groups unite and speak of military force with the Europeans, they will surely win without defeat."

Under the premise of launching a war to eliminate European oppression, Dr. Sun Yat-sen proposed "Pan-Asianism." Regarding this doctrine, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "What should we use as the foundation of our Pan-Asianism? We should use our inherent culture as the foundation, and we must advocate morality, benevolence, and righteousness." He also said, "Eastern culture is the way of kings, and Western culture is the way of hegemons. The way of kings advocates benevolence, righteousness, and morality, and uses justice and reason to influence people. The way of hegemons advocates utilitarianism, power, and uses guns and cannons to oppress people."

Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, we can only realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and follow the path pointed out by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Now, the struggle to liberate the ethnic groups of East Asia is nearing its final stage. The people of China and Japan must understand the true meaning of the Pan-Asianism advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and work together.

Today is also Arbor Day. The choice of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death anniversary as Arbor Day has profound significance. At present, China is still in practice mainly an agricultural country. The farmer population accounts for the largest percentage of the total population, and afforestation, forest protection, and water conservancy construction are necessary work to assist agricultural production. Therefore, on this holiday, we feel very urgently the promotion of agricultural production from the tree planting movement. However, in recent years, due to the obstruction of transportation, the timber production areas have a surplus and allow it to be ruined. In non-timber production areas, because the trees are taken for fuel, the garden and tomb trees are all cut down. This phenomenon is indeed an obstacle to promoting the tree planting movement. It is hoped that the competent authorities of the Ministry of Construction will first issue an order to protect the forest and prohibit cutting, and at the same time, encourage tree planting. If only Arbor Day is commemorated and advocated, but the actual protection of forests and encouragement of cultivation are not carried out, then not only will the effect of increasing tree production not be achieved, but the number of trees will inevitably decrease day by day, which is definitely not Dr. Sun Yat-sen's expectation of emphasizing afforestation and increasing agricultural production. I hope the authorities pay attention to this.

### Japan Takes Appropriate Measures for Legal Entities in North China

Beiping, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After Japan took emergency measures against Vietnam this time, the Japanese authorities also took appropriate measures on the 10th for the remaining agencies of legal entities in North China. Minister Kusunoki also issued a statement saying that the French residents in North China had not engaged in enemy-benefiting activities, so he decided to respect their lives and property.

### Indigenous People of Vietnam Welcome Japanese Military Measures; Decoux and French Military Commanders Detained

Saigon, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The moment the Matsumoto-Decoux talks broke down, the Japanese military authorities immediately took the necessary measures, detaining Governor-General Decoux and the commanders of the army, navy, and air force. Although there was a small amount of resistance here, the Japanese army in the northern, central, and southern regions completed the necessary measures within one to several hours. From the morning of the 10th, Indochina took the first step towards new life in extreme tranquility. At this point, the Japanese Empire will jointly strengthen the defense system of Indochina with the indigenous government. Because of this action by the Japanese army, the indigenous people, who had been under harsh rule in Vietnam for many years, suddenly burst into tears and smiles, and the dawn of singing praises to Indochina is near. The Japanese Empire has already declared that it will spare no effort to support their independence movement. Therefore, they are extremely grateful, and the voices of swearing to stand up and cooperate with Japan are filling the streets, especially the indigenous soldiers belonging to the former Vietnamese army, who are eager to be commanded by the Japanese army commander.

### Enemy Advances Suffer Casualties in Northeastern Luzon

Luzon Front, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On Luzon Island, while the enemy army was directing its main force towards the Japanese army's stronghold east of Manila, one division was attempting to attack the Japanese army's fortified line connecting northeastern Luzon to the highlands east of San Nicolas and San Jose. Its main force is gradually gathering around Shaokalanglang, about ten kilometers northeast of San Jose. The enemy, which has repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's position northeast of San Nicolas, moved about two companies of artillery to the line about seven kilometers northeast of San Nicolas on the 7th. The Japanese army in the north is fighting fiercely everywhere, concentrating artillery fire or using blitz tactics to make the enemy pay a heavy price. On the San Jose Banban Road alone, the damage inflicted on the enemy on the 6th and 7th of this month was killing or wounding 300 enemy soldiers. In the battle in the San Nicolas area, the comprehensive results of the Japanese army's harvest up to the end of February included killing or wounding more than 500 enemy soldiers, destroying two 10-mm anti-tank guns, two infantry guns, two rapid-fire guns, six heavy machine guns, and two vehicles, and capturing four mortars, six light machine guns, nine automatic rifles, and two communication machines.

Commemoration: To Commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death is to Inherit His Legacy and Realize Pan-Asianism!

### Today is the Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death; Central Authorities Pay Respects at Mausoleum; National Tree Planting Movement Unfolds

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Today (12th) is the 20th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. In order to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great personality and his great achievements, in addition to the central authorities respectfully visiting the mausoleum this morning, a national tree planting movement will be launched throughout the country to commemorate him. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the founder of the Chinese Kuomintang and the creator of the Republic of China. His Three Principles of the People is the only indicator of the Kuomintang and the highest principle of our country's nation-building. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the late Chairman Wang inherited his legacy and worked hard to implement it. On the 20th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death today, unfortunately, Chairman Wang has also passed away. In these 20 years, we have lost these two great leaders, which is a great loss to the party and the country. Fortunately, acting Chairman Chen, with his years of experience in struggling for the party and the country, and with the center of adhering to the legacy, has risen to lead the country, engaging in the great cause of saving the country and building the party. This is something that we can be slightly comforted by in addition to commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen and mourning the late Chairman Wang. At this time when the ethnic groups of East Asia are uniting as one and the Greater East Asia War has laid the foundation for victory and the dawn of China's revival has appeared, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, we feel even more the difficulty of the situation and the importance of responsibility. The abolition of unequal treaties shown by Dr. Sun Yat-sen has been achieved, and the international status has also been improved, but the national economy is still in decline. Facing the difficulties of the times, we should abide by the legacy and, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, be of one mind and one heart, dedicate ourselves to the construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood, increase production, stabilize people's livelihood, eliminate the remaining forces of British and American colonial economic aggression, enrich national strength and people's strength, and achieve the realm of autonomous economy, in order to comfort Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven.

### Promoting Peaceful Unification and Fulfilling the Mission of the Era: Director Zhao Xuan Broadcasts to the Public

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Director Zhao of the Propaganda Department, considering the profound significance of the 20th anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation on the 12th, coinciding with the critical phase of the Greater East Asia War, delivered a broadcast to the nation on the 11th from the Central Broadcasting Station, titled "Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of the Death of the Father of the Nation," addressing all compatriots. The text of his speech is recorded as follows:

Recalling the Past Twenty Years with Grief: Fellow Compatriots, today marks the exact 20th anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation. Over these two decades, China has suffered from the disturbances of British and American imperialism. The peaceful years and unified situation were merely fleeting moments. In our experiences over these twenty years, we have reached a conclusion: unless we break free from the shackles of imperialism, the nation will not achieve independence and freedom; unless we eliminate the disturbances of the Chinese Communist Party, the nation will not achieve peaceful unification. In other words, the nation has not escaped danger, and the people have not escaped crisis. This experience and understanding are shared by all compatriots who care about the nation and the people. The reason we have this experience and understanding is because the Father of the Nation left us the great Three Principles of the People and the National Construction Program, which inspire us to seek strong external freedom and internal peaceful unification.

Five Years of Endeavor, Achievements Gained: This movement is the peaceful anti-communist national construction movement that we have been striving for over the past five years. The peace movement is advancing forward in accordance with the tasks indicated to us by the Father of the Nation's teachings. Therefore, the Father of the Nation's teachings are the highest ideals of the peace movement, and the peace movement is the starting point of the National Revolutionary Movement, the mainstream of striving for external independence and freedom, and internal peaceful unification. Under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, we have struggled for five years and achieved great accomplishments that the Father of the Nation dedicated his entire life to but did not complete. The Father of the Nation's instructions that "China and Japan should only be friends, not enemies" and "abolish unequal treaties" have been gradually realized. These are all great achievements gradually attained by following the Father of the Nation's teachings. As long as we quickly achieve peaceful unification internally, external independence and freedom will not be a problem. However, as I speak here, I feel a deep sorrow. We have witnessed the Father of the Nation's teachings being gradually realized. Unfortunately, the late Chairman also departed from the Party and the nation, unable to see China's complete independence, freedom, and peaceful unification.

Fundamental Policies Remain Unchanged: Acting Chairman Chen, with his many years of experience following the Father of the Nation in the Party and the nation's struggle, inherits the late Chairman's aspirations and leads the Party and the nation. With the unanimous support of the entire nation, we are advancing towards the great goal of "seeking internal peaceful unification and external independence and freedom." Today, as we commemorate the Father of the Nation, we must understand that "seeking internal peaceful unification and external independence and freedom" is the consistent spirit of the Father of the Nation and the late Chairman's lifelong revolutionary struggle. It is also the fundamental policy of China under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen in the future. Moreover, we must first complete peaceful unification before we can achieve independence and freedom. We can see this from the Father of the Nation's Northern Expedition. "Seeking internal peaceful unification" is a prerequisite for "seeking external independence and freedom." In order to address this issue and continue our efforts, the late Chairman Wang led the peace movement, and Acting Chairman Chen is strictly adhering to the late Chairman Wang's legacy, which is to implement this issue thoroughly.

Hope for the United Effort of Compatriots: When we see the current international situation and the progress of the Greater East Asia War, we will feel that this issue is much more serious than during the Father of the Nation's Northern Expedition, because at that time, the effects of the war could only hinder the nation's construction and deplete the nation's vitality. However, at this current juncture, it is related to the survival of the nation and the rise and fall of the people, which cannot be ignored in the slightest. Therefore, Acting Chairman Chen once instructed us emphatically at the beginning of this year: "China is now surrounded by crises. If we do not work hard, we may become a battlefield for the decisive battle, or we may become completely communist, or we may become a colony of Britain and the United States." This shows that the issue of peaceful unification is the urgent task at hand. I hope that all compatriots across the country will recognize that promoting peaceful unification is the mission of the era and immediately rise up and work together. (To be continued)

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Capital's Various Industries Guilds New Life Movement Practice Groups held a joint establishment conference at the China Youth Association at 3:00 PM today.

After the memorial service, a tree-planting ceremony will be held at the Bund Park, with security provided by the police and self-defense forces along the route.

The Propaganda Department also sent letters to the Municipal Education Bureau instructing all schools and youth organizations to organize speech teams to give speeches to citizens on the streets and in public places today to commemorate the death of the Father of the Nation and promote the afforestation movement. It compiled a brief history of the Father of the Nation's life and the true meaning of afforestation and asked the China Picture and Drama Association to create various color illustrations for display in the windows of major stores for public viewing. It also sent letters to the China Film Company requesting them to create slides for distribution to major cinemas for screening to mark the occasion.

Regarding the county governments and district offices under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, the Municipal Propaganda Department previously distributed propaganda guidelines issued by the department and sent letters to the County Administration Department instructing them to comply. It is reported that all county governments and district offices have followed the propaganda guidelines and, in addition to holding memorial ceremonies, have expanded publicity.

### Shortwave Radios Should Be Handed Over Immediately: Violators Will Be Severely Punished

Recently, a small number of citizens in the city have been using shortwave radios to listen to enemy news, which is then spread around, leading to various rumors spreading through the streets. Much of this involves misunderstanding enemy propaganda broadcasts, leading to distortions of the facts. It is understood that the municipal authorities, in view of this, are reiterating the strict prohibition of high-end radios with seven or more tubes and shortwave radios. Violators will be severely punished. Therefore, citizens who possess such radios should immediately and voluntarily surrender them to the authorities.

### Various Industry Guilds Await Reorganization

The organization of the city's various industry guilds has long been based on the "Industry and Commerce Guild Law," under which guilds are established after the initiation by seven or more firms in the same industry and approval by the competent authorities, with a total of more than 200 units. Later, the authorities promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Guilds," and the establishment of all industry guilds must follow these regulations. Recently, the Municipal Economic Bureau is planning to thoroughly adjust the organizational structure of various industry guilds, abolishing or merging those with similar characteristics, which is currently being actively carried out.

The Municipal Economic Bureau instructed the various industry guilds, saying: "Upon investigation, the handling of affairs by the city's various industry guilds is quite inconsistent. While many have sound organizations, there are also quite a few that have neglected their duties and exist in name only. The Bureau Director is determined to rectify the city's economic structure. For all guilds with similar business characteristics, poor management, and lax affairs, they will be merged and reorganized in order to strengthen the organization of various industries and facilitate the achievement of the mission of assisting the government in implementing economic policies." It also limited three days for the submission of survey forms. As for companies and firms in various industries, regardless of their business nature, they should join the respective industry guilds as members, pay membership fees, and comply with the guild's articles of association for buying and selling. Those who dare to deliberately wait and see and refuse to join the guild will be reported to the competent authorities by the guild once discovered, and will be punished in accordance with the law or have their business licenses revoked. It is understood that the Party and the authorities have repeatedly emphasized the requirement for companies and firms to join guilds, aiming to eliminate illegal buying and selling and strengthen the wartime economic system.

### Summary of Recent Work of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee: Continued Borrowing of Preservation Funds

In July of last year, the committee established a loan of 600,000,000 yuan with Chinese and Japanese banking groups, with 300,000,000 yuan for purchasing funds and 300,000,000 yuan for preservation funds. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to guarantee this loan. The purchasing funds were used to pre-pay for wheat purchases, lent to designated purchasing merchants through the discount of promissory notes to banks. The preservation funds were used for expenses related to transportation, distribution, and the necessary preservation materials after the purchased wheat was processed into flour. Since the new wheat season began, the purchasing work has been launched, and the aforementioned funds have been gradually exhausted. In addition, the subsequent price fluctuations have been very severe, requiring purchases to be made primarily with cash. However, flour production by entrusted factories has been limited by transportation and electricity, resulting in delayed returns of funds. Therefore, negotiations were held with relevant parties, and an additional 300,000,000 yuan of preservation funds was borrowed from Chinese and Japanese banking groups in November, with each side responsible for half. This was also reported to the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Ministry of Finance to provide additional guarantees, using the same method as the previous loan of 600,000,000 yuan.

Pilot Administrative Purchase

At the beginning of the current wheat purchase season, the committee made great efforts to suppress the purchase price, and fortunately, with the assistance of relevant authorities, the process proceeded smoothly. However, subsequently, prices of agricultural products rose in various places, and wheat prices increased significantly as a result. If purchases were made at market prices, there was concern that this would affect the prices of rice and other agricultural products. In order to ensure the food supply for civilians and the military, and to seek separate remedial measures, the committee referred to the administrative purchase method for rice and temporarily implemented it in the Jiangsu province area. With the assistance of relevant administrative agencies, wheat and rice were kept in contact and purchased together. The committee designated purchasing merchants, provided them with purchasing certificates, and allowed them to carry out direct purchasing work in wheat-producing areas, isolating them from the market and avoiding speculation and manipulation. This was also approved by the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to comply and assist in the process.

Adjust Distribution Prices

The wheat purchased in the current season was purchased at newly determined prices, and the cost of flour production naturally had to be increased. The distribution prices of flour and bran in various places have been re-approved. However, after autumn, the purchase price of wheat and various expenses such as transportation, manufacturing, and packaging have continued to increase, rendering the previously set prices for flour and bran inapplicable. After detailed consultation with various parties, it was generally believed that a re-adjustment was necessary in order to maintain a balance between income and expenditure and allow production to continue. Therefore, starting in December of last year, the distribution prices of flour and bran in various regions were uniformly handled in accordance with the new plan. Cost calculation tables were prepared and reported to the Commerce and Trade Commission and the Executive Yuan for record.

Purchase of Stored Flour from the Former Food Ministry

After the former Food Ministry was abolished and merged, the General Management Office for Rice and Grain Sales, which belonged to the ministry, established a liquidation committee and was taken over by the Ministry of Industry. The committee negotiated with the Food Ministry to purchase the flour stored by the former Food Ministry in various locations in Nanjing and Suzhou at official prices. A total of 14,580 bags of flour were stored in Nanjing, and 2,477 bags of flour were stored in Suzhou and Wuxi. The committee instructed its offices to transfer the flour in the custody of the original custodians to the liquidation committee, and the quantities were checked and cleared. All payments due were cleared in January of this year.

Serving as a Director of the Unified Distribution Office

The Shanghai District Flour and Bran Unified Distribution Office was established on December 1, 1943, and its one-year term expired at the end of November of last year. The committee believed that the office's unified distribution work over the past year had been satisfactory and that the chairman, vice-chairman, and directors and supervisors had been competent. Therefore, it sent letters to the office's chairman, Yang Jingcheng, vice-chairman, Osaka Koichi, director Shang Yousheng, and Fujita Ichiro, etc., asking them to continue to serve in their positions, hoping to achieve familiar and skilled results.

Drafting Transportation Management Regulations

The committee was ordered to handle the unified control of flour and wheat and had previously drafted provisional measures for purchase, manufacturing, processing, distribution, movement, and prohibition, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and compliance. However, since the implementation of the previous measures, the purchase and movement items were still somewhat incomplete. In order to further strengthen the control work and strictly prevent hoarding and leakage, the committee drafted detailed rules for the implementation of the flour and wheat transportation and sales management regulations, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, and they have been submitted by the Yuan to the 241st meeting for amendment and passed. They have been submitted by the Yuan to the 65th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council and passed, and the Yuan has ordered their promulgation and implementation.

### This City's Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Last Week: Prices and Hawala Showed Weakness

The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai City have become more stable recently, and the people are very excited. Transactions have returned to normal, prices have continued to fall, and the fluctuations in Hawala have been mixed, eventually hovering around the 50 mark, with purchases still dominating. Silver has remained unchanged, public debt has fluctuated slightly, and although the Hua shares showed a strong downward trend in the first half of the week, the buying trend suddenly rose in the second half of the week due to positive news, and the stock market regained its peak. Most of the speculative funds are inclined to Hawala and Hua shares activities, which is a good sign of financial prosperity if they can be traded normally. It is difficult to expect the industrial and commercial sectors to flourish temporarily. If transportation can be restored to a considerable period of time and the production materials and fuel can be fully supplied, it will be the time for the revival of industry and commerce. Fortunately, the relevant authorities have recently been actively seeking to restore transportation, and a large amount of essential people's livelihood materials will soon be transported to Shanghai. Moreover, the weather is gradually becoming warmer, and the production of local products is increasing, so the source can continue uninterrupted. The people's daily necessities can be fully adjusted. Therefore, the people are at peace, and holders are selling off their goods, so prices continue to fall. Rice, miscellaneous grains, vegetables, fresh meat, and daily necessities are all trending downward. The new price limits for major commodities previously approved by the Municipal Economic Bureau are suitable for the level of sales in various stores. If the authorities can persistently enforce the prohibition of illegal trading by speculators, prices will not rise again.

### Special Tax on Native Paper Collected at New Prices

The Municipal Finance Bureau said that the special business tax on native paper in the city is collected at 5% according to the estimated price. Recently, the price of native paper has risen sharply, and the original estimated price has been too long, so it is not applicable. Now, after estimating at the lowest price according to the latest market price, the original estimated price has been increased to 900%. It has been approved by the Municipal Government and has been taxing at the new occupied price since yesterday (the 11th).

### Changning Police Bureau Cracks Down on the Sale of Black Market Tickets

The other was a black marketeer, Shao Genzhao, who sold black market tickets for 5,000 yuan per ticket, also to a woman. The matter was discovered by the station's resident inspector, who immediately detained the ticket-buying woman to ascertain the facts. The woman then identified Shao Genzhao and others, who were taken to the bureau for investigation in accordance with the law.

### Elementary School Students Widely Infested with Head Lice: Please Pay Attention, Schools and Parents

My eleven-year-old daughter, who attends a nearby elementary school on Longmen Road, recently had many lice eggs found on her hairline. When combed, the lice wriggled and were uncontrollable. She had no choice but to shave all her hair off to try to eradicate them. The next day, her class teacher asked her why she did this, and the daughter explained the reason. The teacher then checked all the male and female students in the class, more than forty people in total, and found that no one was spared from having lice eggs. At the same time, the daughter of my friend Mr. Qian, who attends an elementary school on Weihaiwei Road, also has head lice. When she told her neighbors who have school-age children, they all found the same situation. It seems that head lice infestation among elementary school students in the city is widespread. Lice are carriers of infectious diseases, such as typhus, which is transmitted by lice. Isn't this dangerous? Schoolchildren are ignorant, so we must ask the school authorities and parents to pay attention to this. We must ensure a thorough cleaning of all to avoid cyclical infections. Treatment for lice: Bai Bu soaked in wine can be applied to the hairline, or kerosene can be used to wash the hair. (Zhaoguang)

The championship match between the Friendship Team and the Portuguese Business Team in the First Division was held at the racecourse yesterday morning at 10 a.m. The game was closely contested, and the stadium was packed with fans. Liu Xianhan, the goalkeeper for the Friendship Team, played despite being ill, which had an impact. Later, Zheng Yingquan replaced him as goalkeeper, which changed the situation. The Friendship Team took an early lead with a score of 2-0. In the second half, the Portuguese Business Team came from behind to lead 4-2. The Friendship Team lacked substitutes and could not compete, so they left the field. The game ended unhappily, and the audience was also affected. The referee, Chen Jixiang, was beaten, which was unfortunate. Shang Baozheng scored first, and soon after, Luo Shoufu added another goal, giving the Friendship Team a 2-0 lead. The Portuguese Business Team counterattacked, and Lieliao gained possession of the ball and rushed forward to shoot. Liu jumped up to catch it, but due to a long illness and insufficient energy, his foot slipped and he fell to the ground. Bao Xiu Tuo rushed forward and kicked the ball and the man into the net. The referee ruled that the Portuguese Business Team scored a goal, ending the first half 2-1. In the second half, Liu Xianhan, the goalkeeper of the Friendship Team, was replaced by Zheng Yingquan. Fu En scored, tying the score. Fu En scored twice in total, and the score became 2-4, with the Portuguese Business Team coming from behind. At this point, Wu Qixiang and Qu Yongfu of the Friendship Team left the field because Zheng Yingquan was injured, leaving only ten players to compete. Since there were no substitutes, they also left the field automatically. The audience rushed onto the field, and some of the audience even beat the referee. The game ended unhappily.
