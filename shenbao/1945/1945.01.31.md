### Against the Enemy's Two Wings on Luzon Island, Japanese Forces Launch a Fierce Attack; Intense Battle Unfolds Near Rosales

Philippines Frontline Base, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces of the right wing southward advancing unit on Luzon Island, after sustaining a fierce attack by Japanese forces, have halted their advance at the northern end of Clark Airfield. Japanese forces in the vicinity of the western highlands of Bamban have been fiercely attacking the enemy on the left flank since the 20th. Simultaneously, Japanese artillery is also actively moving around, firing upon the enemy. Furthermore, a portion of the enemy forces has infiltrated the western highlands of Mabalacat, commencing the preparation of an aircraft base, and has established a small-scale airfield near Bando Arayat, where several aircraft are already stationed. In addition, the battle line in the direction of Los Ba√±os has been relatively calm since the 25th. Since the enemy's landing, Japanese forces have fiercely attacked and routed several enemy units in the direction of Cabanatuan, and on the 24th, launched a daring counterattack. The enemy's landing force on Luzon Island has reached seven divisions, including tank units. However, the enemy still attempts to reinforce their defensive forces, so another division began landing in Lingayen Gulf on the 28th. In the direction of San Bernardino Strait, there are as many as eighty enemy transport ships attempting to increase their forces.

Japanese Forces Base in the Philippines, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces on Luzon Island, intending to advance eastward towards San Fabian, after sustaining a fierce attack by Japanese forces, stubbornly continue to bombard Rosales, attempting to suppress the area around Paniqui Town. On the 28th, it was reported that since the 24th, enemy forces have been fiercely attacking the vicinity of Rosales, using Tarlac as a base, and are currently concentrating approximately 4,500 troops between the northwest of Rosales and Calaggaran to the north of that location, and possess mortars. Against this, Japanese forces, with the cooperation of artillery units, are launching a fierce counteroffensive and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Furthermore, approximately one large battalion of enemy forces advancing northward from the northwest infiltrated north of Alcott on the morning of the 25th, and another unit of enemy forces infiltrated Bayambang. However, the Japanese forces in that area fiercely attacked them, resulting in a significant victory.

Japanese Forces Base on the Philippines Frontline, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 28th, Japanese air units attacked enemy warships in Lingayen Gulf, destroying two large transport ships. Another unit of Japanese aircraft strongly attacked Fabrica airfield, causing damage with several hits and fires.

### Enemy Americans Concealing Loss Figures to Deceive the Public; Statement by the Army Information Department Chief

(Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch) - Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, the Army Information Department Chief of the Allied Japanese forces stationed in Shanghai, made the following statement to Chinese and foreign journalists yesterday:

The enemy American authorities, concealing their own massive losses, and anxious about a short-term decisive battle, are revealing the absurdity of their deception of their own people due to the severity of the war situation. On January 25th, the U.S. Secretary of War, Stimson, announced that the U.S. Army's losses since the beginning of the war were over 616,000, of which 117,000 were unaccounted for. More recently, he stated that the total losses of the Army and Navy were 701,950, including 149,650 dead, 395,326 wounded, 96,065 unaccounted for, and 61,909 captured. The depletion of human resources is the greatest weakness of the United States, which need not be reiterated. Therefore, the U.S. military's announcements of personnel losses consistently omit the numbers of dead and wounded. The reason for concealing this from the public eye must be attributed to the deliberate policies of the authorities.

Soldier Illnesses

Last September, the American "Miner" magazine published that in this war, the U.S. military's dedication to the war is increasingly declining compared to the last World War. A considerable number of soldiers are developing mental illnesses on the front lines. The authorities are extremely concerned about the trouble of treating these individuals, as 5% of the patients are being sent back to the rear for specialized medical treatment. Those seeking exemption from military service due to mental illness now account for 6% of the total number of exemptions. A 1934 report stated that mental hospitals housed 85,000 patients per month, and the number is increasing daily. Based on these figures, it is estimated that since the beginning of the war until September 1944, there were no fewer than 4 million mental illness patients in the U.S. military. In 1934, approximately 5.7 million people sought treatment. This increase in patients is a current challenge for the U.S. authorities. Furthermore, according to Dr. Gotha, who recently authored "Handbook of Tropical Diseases," a reference for Allied military doctors, U.S. soldiers are indeed returning from overseas with tropical diseases that are difficult to prevent and of unknown origin. Malaria, which has now become a serious problem, has infected a large number of frontline soldiers. The only solutions are repatriation to prevent outbreaks and intensified mosquito control. From the above, it is not difficult to imagine that soldiers fighting hard battles in malaria-prone areas on all global fronts often have a considerable number of patients. According to an Australian broadcast last May, U.S. forces stationed there requested the Australian government to provide hospitals with 27,500 beds for U.S. soldiers. As a result, Australian hospitals are insufficient, causing great difficulties for the general public. Australians find it difficult to understand why the U.S. military commander does not send the wounded back to their home country.

Manpower Shortage

How the U.S. authorities conceal the loss of British personnel from their own people is ultimately a matter of great concern. According to a recent commentary by Mr. Max Macvensky, based on the U.S. Office of War Information's announcement, 270,000 U.S. soldiers have died in the war against Japan. If one assumes that the Japanese army has at least 4 million troops, this mortality rate is quite significant. However, in addition to these 4 million, the Japanese army still has 2 million reserve troops. This is a contradictory advertisement aimed at reducing their own losses, but also acknowledging the abundance of Japanese manpower. Furthermore, on December 2nd of last year, an Associated Press dispatch from Washington regarding the Philippine operations openly acknowledged the superiority of the Japanese army and stated that the Allied forces faced numerous problems regarding operational supplies and human resources. The supply line is thousands of miles long, three times longer than the supply line in the European theater.

Conscription of Black People

In order to solve the above problems, the U.S. authorities recently used material rewards to bring other nations to the battlefield in order to avoid their own losses and pursue their ambition to dominate the world. This includes the public announcement last December of the conscription of 664,000 black people, the formation of 1.2 million Gurkha troops, the mobilization of youth from the Italian exile government, and the Americanization of the Chongqing army as numerous means of utilizing human resources. This has significant implications for the development of nations and the well-being of the world. Resolving this matter is a significant mission entrusted to informed individuals.

### Japanese Air Units Conduct Night Raid on Leyte

Philippines Frontline Base, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the night of the 27th, Japanese air units attacked enemy positions near Balumbon on the west coast of Leyte Island, strafing them from low altitude.

### Japanese Isolated Forces on Omiya Island Continue Guerrilla Warfare

Stockholm, Seoul, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the December 25th issue of the American *Time* magazine, although the U.S. military had earlier declared to the public that it had secured Omiya Island, the fighting on the island has not ended. After ceasing organized attacks, the remaining Japanese soldiers are still hiding in the hills. Recently, the Marine Corps launched a mopping-up operation. It is expected that this type of search operation will continue for several months. The U.S. military used loudspeakers to persuade the Japanese soldiers to surrender, but all were rejected. The Japanese soldiers continue to resist to the end.

Editorial

### Reconstructing Shanghai

The mention of "Shanghai" inevitably brings to mind the encroachment of American and British imperialism. On the one hand, a major city was created from a sandbank, but at the same time, a fragmented and divided municipality was formed, unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. As a result, all despicable evil forces could be nurtured within it, and all abnormal and strange phenomena could be accommodated within it. Furthermore, Chinese and foreign criminals colluded with each other, and overt and covert smuggling and murder raged in Shanghai. The filth of politics and the seeds of unrest were sown in Shanghai, and China's misfortune was rooted here.

Fortunately, through the efforts of our authorities and the cooperation of Allied Japan, all concessions were finally recovered on August 1st of the year before last. From then on, there was hope of seeing the blue sky after the clouds were cleared. At that time, people from all walks of life expressed joy and anticipation, and everyone contributed their opinions on the construction of a new Shanghai from their own perspectives. The situation was enthusiastic and well-founded. In the past year and a half, there have been improvements, but the trend of official corruption has not been curbed, and the trend of civil unrest has intensified. Although its origins have gradually increased, the reason why it has been able to escalate is simply that the governance has not been systematic and the measures have not been thorough.

Now, Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo have come to Shanghai under orders to preside over municipal administration. On the day of their arrival, people from all walks of life expressed their welcome and bitterly complained about their hardships. In half a month, the sounds of seeking policy have spread, enough to make the stubborn and weak have aspirations. The surface phenomenon has already improved, and the fundamental problems should also be eradicated urgently. At the same time, planned, step-by-step, and comprehensive construction should also be prepared and implemented. The temporary disappearance of petty villains may be due to fear of fame or coercion by severe penalties. We must ensure that they live and work in peace, and are sincerely convinced, so as to be far from the realm of governing by doing nothing, and avoid the worry of old habits recurring and lost causes being revived.

To build a city is certainly complicated, but to reconstruct a city is even more difficult and complex. At the same time, during this wartime period, it is even more prone to being pedantic, broad, and impractical. However, the reason why Shanghai has not been able to adapt to the wartime system during the past eight years of war is precisely because it has failed to sort out the complexities and eliminate the obstacles. If it had been possible to think big and start small, and gradually advance step by step, then peacetime discipline would have been sufficient to boost wartime strength, and wartime training would have been sufficient to promote peacetime development. Wartime and peacetime have their common elements and chain relationships (see this newspaper's editorial on December 28, 1944), like the inside and outside of things, which cannot be separated from beginning to end. If we want to build a brand-new Shanghai, we should not be deterred by the complexity and shrink back, nor should we use the wartime as an excuse to seek only temporary peace. As long as we work hard, we will surely reap the rewards we deserve.

There are four prerequisites for reconstructing Shanghai: (1) In any aspect, we must thoroughly eliminate the old habits of fragmentation and division, and form a new Shanghai that has substantive unity. (2) The province and city are subordinate to the central government. To make a city healthy, in addition to the local municipal administrative officials who can make local determinations, there are many aspects that require the central government to make overall plans. Therefore, all problems should be divided into two types: those that should be solved by the central government and those that can be solved by the local government. On the one hand, they should be promoted in parallel, and on the other hand, they should be intertwined with each other, in order to achieve the overall reconstruction of the municipal administration with front-to-back coordination. (3) All political phenomena and social customs are nothing more than psychological reactions. If we want the reconstruction to be effective, it will not be successful without psychological construction. (4) Once the plan is determined, the key is to implement it. Without a sound and reasonable organization, not only will the effort be doubled with half the results and the efficiency be low, but it will also be difficult to manage and difficult to promote. After recognizing these four major prerequisites, we will provide an outline of a plan to reconstruct Shanghai as follows for reference.

All reconstruction problems can be divided into four categories from a horizontal perspective: first, education; second, sustenance; third, health; and fourth, management. From a vertical perspective, they can be divided into three categories: first, examining the existing defects; second, formulating a reconstruction plan; and third, stipulating the progress of the work. Then proceed separately and measure the effectiveness on schedule, with three months as the planning period and three years as the completion period. Then, after four years, not only will Shanghai's appearance be brand new, but the impact on the country's education, sustenance, health, and management will also be profound and significant. We hope that those in position will not be afraid of difficulties and dangers and will lead from above, and that the people will work together with one heart and support from below, so as to wash away the shame of "Shanghai being the source of all evils" and establish the reputation of "Shanghai being a model city for China and the world."

### The Diplomatic Struggle Between the US and the Soviet Union on the European Political Stage

To predict the trends of this war this year, it is necessary not only to study the military situation but also to thoroughly observe the political trends. It is rumored that the Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin three-party summit will be held at the end of this month. Where does the common intention lie? What is the truth of the general world political situation this year? These are all questions that have a major impact. Therefore, reviewing the various situations that have already surfaced in the last quarter of last year to observe the trend of world politics this year is indeed an important task at present.

The Influence of the Franco-Soviet Alliance

The first important point is the secret struggle between Britain and the Soviet Union on the French issue. Due to the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, Britain has been forced to swallow a bitter pill. When Stalin and de Gaulle began their talks in Moscow, Britain happened to be completely absorbed by two events: the crisis of the Italian coup and the outbreak of the Greek civil war. As far as the Italian coup is concerned, Britain has consistently supported the Bonomi government, but the power of life and death of the Bonomi cabinet is entirely in the hands of the Communist Party.

What Britain wants is only face, but with the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, Britain not only lost substance but also could not keep face. Taking the Franco-Soviet alliance as the boundary, the European political situation has entered a new stage. Churchill made speeches on the Greek civil war and the Polish issue in the House of Commons on December 5th and 15th of last year. Regarding the Greek issue, his speech was very tough, completely in the tone of the Prime Minister of the British Empire, and was sharply opposed to the protest of the US Secretary of State Stettinius. At the same time, he warned against the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, and strongly stated that the cause of the Greek civil war was "the attempt to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat." However, his speech on the Polish issue on the 15th was obviously weaker than the former, full of concessions, pleading, and celebrations. Churchill had asked the Polish government-in-exile to accept the Soviet Union's border requirements. This was largely due to his premonition that after the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, the Soviet Union and France would force Britain to recognize the Lublin government in the same step.

After that, the de Gaulle government and the Lublin government exchanged diplomatic representatives, and the French leftists echoed the Moscow radio's refutation of Poland's request to acquire Silesia, and proposed to acquire the west bank of the Rhine (which is contrary to the British and American international management plan for the area).

The second point is that according to reports from the Italian left wing, the time for the formation of the Balkan-Danube Group is approaching, and its center is in Bulgaria, including Greece, which will be guided by Moscow.

The third point is the Soviet Union's recognition of the Lublin government. The above points are all in line with the Franco-Soviet alliance. On the other hand, Churchill's visit to Greece yielded nothing. The year 1944 thus gradually closed in the Soviet Union's wonderful silence.

Britain is Increasingly Isolated

From this point of view, the biggest feature of the European political situation this year can be said to be that Britain is in a chronic crisis of being isolated from Europe. Due to the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, the balance of power in Europe has been broken. Britain is now working hard to regain the old sphere of influence that has collapsed and is trying to pull in Italy and Greece. But its position is becoming increasingly difficult. Britain's diplomacy, in contrast to the Soviet Union's active approach, is gradually becoming powerless to resist. The biggest reason for this can be said to be that US support has been almost non-existent since the last quarter of last year. This American passivity towards European issues is a significant fact during that period and is worthy of attention. There are various reasons for this, but the main ones are:

(1) When the United States elected the president last autumn, Roosevelt tended to the Pacific side due to election strategy and military success, so the United States' attitude towards European politics tended to be cautious.

(2) The United States reorganized the State Department in November.

(3) American capitalists demanded that Roosevelt accept the post-war plan to establish economic dominance over the world after the war, and its preparatory actions.

However, although these reasons exist, the United States is not completely uninterested in European issues. For example, as seen in the International Aviation Conference and the International Commercial Conference held in November last year, conference diplomacy based on the American Tenth Doctrine is still being promoted by the International Security Assurance Conference and the Currency Conference.

US Changes Policy Towards Europe

The only question is that the US policy towards Europe has obviously undergone a major change since the end of last quarter. The main reasons for this change are thought to be:

(1) British and American industrialists have different predictions about the post-war period.

(2) This opposition is reflected in the Washington political circles by the US Senate.

(3) The British's last struggle to organize a Western European group to ensure a European foothold in order to avoid American domination increases the American distrust of Britain.

In addition, the changes in the European political situation are also very obvious, which has resulted in the American First Doctrine's international conference diplomacy also being revised.

In fact, this series of conference diplomacy has been completely discredited because the Soviet Union has always refused to participate. How to evade the obligations arising from the decisions of each conference has become the trouble of the small anti-Axis countries below Britain. American diplomacy, which has suffered from a juvenile illness, has completely failed. In particular, the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance is a challenge from the Soviet Union and France to Dumbarton Oaks, so the US policy towards Europe has become more passive.

Britain Has Become a Supporting Role

So, what route will the United States' policy towards Europe take in the future? In terms of policy towards the Soviet Union, the so-called American "diplomatic counteroffensive" of launching a common British and American front in Europe has a certain degree of possibility. Rumor has it that Roosevelt will visit London soon, and this trip is not unrelated to the formation of a European group, which is worthy of attention.

In contrast, the Soviet Union proposed a three-nation alliance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to Britain in order to prevent the United States from gaining leadership in Europe and prevent Britain and France from forming an alliance, and to threaten Churchill with the terror of isolation.

What is noteworthy here is that there is a big difference between the British and American worries about the Soviet Union's diplomatic offensive, because the Soviet Union's influence on the United States is not as great as that of Britain, which is in a crisis of isolation. For this reason, when and how the United States, as the representative of the capitalist camp, will counterattack the Soviet Union's diplomatic offensive can be said to be a major event of concern this year. Therefore, the protagonists on the international stage this year will be the United States and the Soviet Union on the anti-Axis side, and Britain, like France, will become a secondary supporting role. This opposition between the anti-Axis camps will not be eliminated immediately even when the three-party summit is realized.

We must pay attention to how Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will try to shift the focus of this opposition to other issues. Generally speaking, the Japanese issue is likely to be valued by them, and it is not impossible to strengthen anti-Japanese propaganda. From this point of view, it is absolutely necessary for us to make a correct observation of the European issue.

### Decisive Battle in the Philippines; A Blitz Lecture Meeting

Scheduled to be held in Japan

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) ‚Äì As the decisive battle in the Philippines intensifies, the Greater Asia Association Headquarters will hold a Philippine Decisive Battle Blitz Lecture Meeting at the Hibiya Public Hall here on February 3rd. This is to arouse the special attack spirit of the one hundred million citizens, encourage and motivate the Filipino people, and make a clear declaration of the inevitable victory in the Philippine decisive battle to both domestic and foreign audiences. The planned attendees and speakers include General Iwane Matsui, President of the Greater Asia Association Headquarters, and Vargas, the Philippine Ambassador to Japan, among others.

### Situation of US Bases in the Pacific

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) ‚Äì According to a New York dispatch, US Republican House Representative Smith, who inspected the forward bases in the Pacific at the end of last year, recently returned and discussed the situation in that area on the 28th as follows: In December, I traveled to the battle center in the Pacific with the US troops on Leyte Island and returned before the landing operation on Luzon began. The primary issue in the Pacific War is the issue of troop strength and supplies. The US line of advance is very long. The island we visited was about 23 kilometers in length and had well-equipped facilities such as airfields, ship fuel supply depots, and searchlights. The task of the US soldiers stationed on these islands is to clear out the Japanese troops who are hiding in the hills and caves and conducting guerrilla warfare. I heard soldiers say that they are not only fighting hard against the Japanese troops in the dense forests under extreme heat, but also at risk of contracting tropical diseases.

### Surge in Gold Prices in the Capital; Authorities Investigate Secretly

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) ‚Äì In the past week, the market price of gold has risen sharply. There was a surge of 2,000 yuan per qian in one day, and the discovery of black market prices. Near Xin Jie Kou in the capital city, there are people openly buying at high prices. At a time when prices are soaring, the authorities intend to strictly prohibit such activity. The sudden rise in gold prices is enough to affect commodity prices and hinder the authorities' current policy implementation. The rise in gold prices is mainly due to the fact that speculators, aware of the authorities' determination to crack down on hoarding, have shifted their target to buying gold after selling off their goods with a large amount of floating capital. At the same time, as the situation in the Pacific theater becomes increasingly tense, ignorant citizens believe rumors and compete to buy gold, which is also a force contributing to the rise in prices. It is reported that the authorities believe that the sharp rise in gold prices has a significant impact on price stabilization efforts and are closely monitoring the situation. Those who engage in speculation and spread rumors will be severely punished once the investigation confirms their actions.

Discipline Committee to Begin Work

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) ‚Äì The Capital Commodity Price Stabilization Discipline Committee, after active preparations by the responsible personnel, has largely completed its internal organization. The Supervision Group is scheduled to begin work tomorrow (the 1st). The position of the leader of the Fuel Group has been decided to be held by Mayor Zhou of Nanjing, a member of the committee. The leader of the Military Law Group will be Zhang Qingze, the Director of the Military Law Department of the Ministry of the Army.

### Soviet Tank Forces Invade Brandenburg; German Troops Withdraw from Groz City

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) ‚Äì According to German frontline news: To avoid the heavy pressure from Soviet forces, German troops within Germany have withdrawn from the city of Kreuz (ÁΩóÂÖπÂ∏Ç), west of the border. This city is five kilometers west of the German border, located on the railway to Berlin, and is the intersection of the Stettin railway. It is 170 kilometers from the city to Berlin.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) ‚Äì The German authorities announced on the 29th that the street fighting in the city of Posen continued fiercely on the 28th. German defenders in the city of Schinhael, located seven kilometers inside Germany, have been stubbornly resisting the Soviet armored pressure on the city and are still fully securing it. Elsewhere, Soviet tank units on the Soviet Niekarwava side advanced to the west and northwest, reaching a point ten kilometers north of Groz (Ê†ºÁæÖËå≤Â∏Ç) on the 28th. Whether the Soviet forces will continue north from here, targeting Stettin, or advance west to attack the Berlin front is still unclear. However, judging from the continuous accumulation of reserve forces behind them, it can be inferred that the Soviet forces intend to advance fully to the west.

### German Authorities Issue Serious Warning to the People

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) ‚Äì According to German frontline news: The First Belorussian Front of the Soviet forces has finally broken through the German border and invaded Brandenburg, including the city of Berlin. On the 29th, Dr. Lei Ni (Ëé±Â∞º), the leader of the German Labor Front, issued a serious warning to the citizens of the entire city in view of the urgency of the situation, expressing a tragic determination: "Boasting of the history of German hands, but we will not allow the enemy to wantonly trample on our land, and we are determined to fight on the front of Berlin, to fight in the city of Berlin, and to fight behind Berlin," and so on. At the same time, the German authorities also stated that the front has finally reached the Brandenburg area, and in view of the seriousness of the situation, the 12th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule on January 30 will not be celebrated in any way. Regarding the countermeasures taken by the German army as described above, it is still difficult to speculate freely, but it can be asserted that it is not merely of a defensive nature, as commonly believed."

### 12th Anniversary of Nazi Party Rule

The Keihin Branch Holds a Commemoration

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) ‚Äì The 30th is the 12th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. The Tokyo and Yokohama Nazi Party branches gathered subordinates and Germans from the Keihin area this afternoon to hold a Nazi Party rule commemoration celebration at the Greater East Asia Hall here. Participants included German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer and his wife, German military attach√©s to Japan, and more than 500 others. Japanese participants included General Takao Suzuki, former Ambassador to Germany Mushanokoji, and other figures from various fields. Participants stood at attention during the German national anthem. Subsequently, the cadres of the Nazi Party branch reported on the current situation of the European front and the struggle of Germany. After that, the Japanese branch leader of the Nazi Party rose and expressed his determination that Germany would achieve final victory, and finally shouted "Heil Hitler!"

### Location of the Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting: Possibly in Rome

Basel, 30th (Central News Agency) ‚Äì Huitong News Agency: It is rumored that the anti-Axis Three-Power Conference will be held in Rome. It is claimed that President Roosevelt, accompanied by Secretary of State, Stettinius, and a large number of military, political, and economic personnel, has departed from the United States, and the Three-Power Conference may be held within a few days, and at the latest, no later than February 1st.

### Municipal Government Plans to Increase Revenue; Improve Employee Benefits; Secretary-General Luo Talks to Japanese Reporters

Luo Junqiang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, met with Japanese reporters on the 29th and gave a speech on current municipal issues. The main points are as follows: (1) Regarding the reform and simplification of institutions, I started planning after taking office, and it has only recently been finalized. The general content has not yet reached the stage of publication. I plan to first implement the restructuring of personnel before the end of February. (2) The purpose of adjusting personnel is to eliminate redundant and incompetent personnel. However, it is also essential to allocate talents and leverage the capabilities of outstanding civil servants. (3) The treatment of outstanding officials should be improved. It is now planned to increase the treatment of police-related personnel by 30%, and general civil servants by 20%. As for the source of funds for this salary increase, after the Ministry of Finance approves, it is expected that the consumption special tax will be increased by 4% to 5%. In addition, a business tax will be levied on the first and eighth districts. It is estimated that tax revenue can be increased by 80 million yuan this year from April to May, and it is planned to use this to improve the treatment of employees.

Finance Bureau Plans to Revamp Tax Revenue

Since Luo, who is also the Director of the Finance Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality, actively rectified tax collection, various taxes have increased compared to before. It is now planned to follow the original plan of the Ministry of Finance, which will implement a business tax in the first district of the city (including the old eight districts). The tax rate is 10 per mille, calculated based on the total business volume of each store, factory, and company. According to estimates by the person in charge of the bureau, tax revenue can be increased by at least 100 million yuan per year. The bureau is also planning to revise the tax rate for the consumption special tax, from the original 4% to 5%. The tax rate for luxury consumption special tax is reduced from the original 30% to 15%. The reason for the reduced tax rate is that there were many cases of tax evasion in the past. After reducing the tax rate, tax evasion is absolutely prohibited. Regarding the banquet and hotel tax, the progressive tax levy in the past created opportunities for merchants to avoid taxes.
