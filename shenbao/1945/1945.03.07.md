Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 6th: In recent days, the Japanese forces on Iwo Jima have been bravely battling against the superior enemy forces that have gradually infiltrated through gaps in the defensive lines. Since around March 4th, they have continued to hold strategic points near Mount Suribachi, Mount Osaka, Mount Higashi, and the northern section of Driftwood, fighting valiantly with limited troops. Since the enemy's landing, the Japanese garrison on the island has inflicted the following confirmed significant damage on the enemy on land: 20,000 enemy soldiers killed or wounded; approximately 250 enemy tanks immobilized and burned.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Under intense enemy attacks, the Japanese forces on Iwo Jima continue to secure their positions. The enemy, disregarding losses, continues its attacks. The battle situation on the island is extremely tense. On the morning of the 4th, the enemy launched a full-scale offensive against the Japanese strongholds. The enemy forces on the Yuxuanjia front attacked with over ten tanks, encountering Japanese artillery fire and bayonet fighting. By evening, the enemy's attacks had gradually weakened, but they continued to bombard with naval guns and mortars. Late on the night of the 4th, Japanese forces infiltrated enemy positions in various areas, inflicting considerable damage. Multiple enemy fighter planes were dispatched on the 5th to support ground operations, strafing with machine guns and launching another offensive. Fierce fighting is currently unfolding in front of the Japanese lines. In the Mount Suribachi area, approximately one hundred enemy soldiers landed on the 5th in a large aircraft. The Japanese forces in the Mount Osaka area continue to fight fiercely while heavily surrounded, and have organized commando teams to infiltrate enemy lines. According to assessments on the morning of the 5th, the battle results for the 4th alone included 1,150 enemy soldiers killed or wounded and six enemy tanks immobilized.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – An Associated Press correspondent at the front reported on the 5th regarding the battle situation on Iwo Jima: The bloodiest battle in the Pacific War has entered its second week amid deafening battle cries. The Japanese garrison continues to fight to the death, and its resistance is growing increasingly intense. In the volcanic, smoke-filled caves of Iwo Jima, both armies are engaged in heroic charges to seize every inch of ground. Admiral Nimitz stated that there have been no substantial changes in the battle lines and that the Japanese resistance is exceptionally stubborn, with their firepower gradually increasing. These points alone reveal the intensity of the battle on the island. Furthermore, although American naval vessels continue to coordinate attacks with the air force, the Japanese are still launching large-caliber shells at the southern airfield.

### Japan Implements National Labor Mobilization

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government decided on five major policies at the beginning of this year. The fourth item clearly outlines the establishment of a labor force structure and the implementation of national labor mobilization. During the National General Mobilization Deliberation Council meeting on January 20th, the draft outline of the Imperial Ordinance on National Labor Mobilization was decided upon. Subsequently, with the Ministry of Health and Welfare as the central body, various procedures were carried out. On the 6th, the National Labor Mobilization Ordinance was promulgated in the official gazette and implemented from the 7th. To comprehensively and flexibly operate national labor mobilization, related mobilization laws such as the National Conscription Ordinance, the Labor Adjustment Ordinance, the Ordinance Restricting the Use of School Graduates, the National Labor Service Cooperation Ordinance, and the Women's Volunteer Labor Ordinance will be integrated. The main contents include establishing an industrial essential personnel system, rationalizing labor mobilization, streamlining mobilization aspects, strengthening the mobile deployment system, and establishing mobile countermeasures for labor during air raids. Among these, establishing an essential personnel system is the central focus, and strengthening comprehensive industrial mobilization and promoting mobile deployment will form the two major trends in future Japanese labor mobilization administration.

### German Media Praises Japanese Fighting Spirit

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army's recent struggle on Iwo Jima has deeply moved the German military and civilians fighting the enemy on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. The "People's Observer" reported on the 6th about the fierce bloodbath between the American and Japanese forces: The American forces, relying on overwhelming material strength, have suffered over ten thousand casualties at the hands of the Japanese forces since landing two weeks ago. The Japanese army's bitter struggle is truly a heroic act of the twentieth century. The Japanese army's spirit of calmly sacrificing themselves cannot be compared to the American's instruments of death. The heroes of Iwo Jima will forever be sung in epic poems by future generations of Japan.

### Japanese Air Force Bombs Leyte Airfield

### British Fleet Commander Discusses Pacific War Situation

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – British Pacific Fleet Commander Fraser stated on the 5th: The British fleet is currently preparing to conduct joint operations with the American Navy in the Pacific. Fifty percent of the British fleet consists of aircraft carriers, and the Americans have already acknowledged the immense value of the aircraft carried by the carriers. The war in Europe and the Pacific has now reached its peak. Our fleet is preparing to engage the Japanese fleet, but although the Japanese fleet has retreated to the vicinity of its home country, it will certainly launch an attack when the British and American fleets approach Japan and Japanese land-based aircraft are able to provide support. Furthermore, when asked whether the British fleet would engage the Japanese fleet independently, Fraser stated that he could not predict the outcome if the British and Japanese fleets were to encounter each other in a certain area. Judging from his words, the British fleet seems to lack confidence in independently defeating the Japanese navy, but hopes to follow the American Navy in operations. On the other hand, it is attempting to publicize to the world how active the British fleet is, which is a common propaganda tactic used by the British Empire.

### Fight to the End, Prepare for Mt. Fuji

As an old man, I have celebrated the National Foundation Day more times than most people. However, among these many times, there are only two that I will never forget. The first was February 11th, Meiji 22nd, the day the Constitution of the Japanese Empire was promulgated. On that day, snowflakes were falling in the streets of Tokyo, and we read the newly promulgated Constitution extra edition in the snow. The second is this year's National Foundation Day. As we Japanese subjects welcome today's National Foundation Day, ninety enemy planes came to bomb the Kanto area. This incident of foreign tribes disturbing our homeland is a first in more than 2,600 years. Faced with the current events, we should reflect greatly and strive greatly.

On a celebratory day like National Foundation Day, we cannot avoid talking about the facts as they are. Today's Japan is truly standing at a critical moment of survival. If we take a wrong step, we will fall into an abyss and be unable to rise again. We have walked a path of victory for three years, and just as good news was being reported frequently, the enemy has taken big steps closer to the gateway to the Japanese capital. The United States has already seized the Mariana Islands, and the battle in the Philippines is now in full swing. But the Japanese soldiers are fighting bravely and loyally giving their lives, which not only the Japanese completely believe, but even the enemy cannot deny. Even so, every Japanese person should know that this war cannot be neglected, cannot be taken lightly, and is a dangerous war with cold sweat on our hands.

The gain or loss of the Philippines is truly the key. Since the situation is so serious, then what should we do on this National Foundation Day? Some people should deeply reflect on their past behavior of living in a drunken dream, being careless and lax, and perfunctorily handling matters. Our words are, of course, all good and perfect, and everything makes sense, but in action, we do our own thing, love ease and hate work. We should make a great confession about this. We must also eliminate all past hypocrisy, cunning, and thoughts of temporary peace, take off our tattered and dirty clothes, and wash away the dirt from our bodies, so that our minds and bodies can be renewed. This is something that the military, government, and people should all pay attention to, this is the first. The second is that on this happy National Foundation Day, we should trace back to the source of the history of the Imperial Kingdom, understand the long tradition and great difficulties of the Japanese nation, and absolutely trust the Imperial Kingdom, establish confidence in the Imperial Kingdom, in order to break the current difficult situation.

Any war requires many things. Today, war itself is the most complex and intricate thing. Some people say that we only need airplanes to win, and others say that we only need submarines to win. Still others say that tanks can save the country; others say that science can save the country; others say that materials can save the country; and others say that human resources can save the country, and so on. These are all emphasizing what they should do from their own standpoints. But, war is extremely complicated, and we can never judge everyone by one person, or measure everything by one thing. We can only say that everyone's work is very important.

To go a step further, there is one thing that can be related to everything, that is, the conviction of victory. Japan is definitely not a defeated country. The Japanese people are definitely not people who will surrender in humiliation. Our Imperial Kingdom will eventually be victorious. This belief should be in every heart of the 100 million people. Even if there are difficulties and setbacks along the way, there is no need to worry. Only by firmly believing in final victory can heaven bestow final victory. Looking at the facts of Emperor Jinmu's eastern expedition, we can suddenly understand.

When Emperor Jinmu was forty-five years old, he left the Takachiho Palace and embarked on the path of the eastern expedition. Although he had made great preparations along the way, he had run aground in Naniwa-no-Tsu for a considerable period of time. Even more so, when entering Yamato through Kawachi, he encountered great difficulties. So he made a great detour and went to the sea route Tateno, and then went up the river from Tateno, through Yoshino to the Yamato Plain.

Then he built the capital and ascended the throne in Kasuhara, at the age of fifty-two. In terms of time, our current Greater East Asia War is not even half of Emperor Jinmu's eastern expedition. Therefore, we must be determined to remain calm and persevere to the end. This determination is not without reason. That is, the determination born of firmly believing in final victory is extremely natural and reasonable. It can be said that if you know yourself and your enemy, you will never be defeated. We must know what position the enemy Americans are in now. They rely on the abundance of materials and attempt to defeat Japan in one fell swoop, but this also exposes their greatest weakness. They are now trying to smash the boat and sink it to defeat us, because they have an internal weakness that cannot last. If we can persevere to the end, then they will soon be exhausted and unable to do anything, and then they will naturally disappear. They are now unable to stop, and the longer their supply line of thousands of miles is, the greater their weakness. Therefore, according to a great lesson in national history, we must persist in the belief of victory from beginning to end, never give up, wait for the enemy to tire, gather and annihilate them. On this National Foundation Day, I read the great teachings of Emperor Jinmu's founding. We will overcome difficulties again with a new spirit and a new style. (Translated by Lin from the February 12th Mainichi Shimbun)

Editorial

### Understanding and Striving

Recently, Mr. Tokutomi published an article in the Japan Mainichi Shimbun titled "Strive to the End" (translation found in today's newspaper). After reading it, we feel that the more difficult the times, the greater the responsibility of the journalistic community. Mr. Tokutomi is a veteran of the Japanese press. Precisely because of his advanced age and more experience with national crises than others, the lessons he has learned are also more profound. Therefore, his understanding of the current difficulties is also more thorough and practical. Thus, whenever the situation becomes urgent, he always puts personal gain aside to make urgent appeals, demonstrating the responsibility and spirit of a journalist. Our commentaries on current affairs are also driven by this sense of responsibility and spirit, hence "knowing everything, saying everything."

In his article "Strive to the End," Mr. Tokutomi pointed out three things to his compatriots: first, be practical and responsible in doing things, be diligent and honest, and be consistent in words and deeds; second, understand the founding spirit of the Japanese nation, establish unwavering belief in the victory of the Imperial State, and overcome difficulties; third, persevere to the end and strive for victory. Apart from the first point, which we should similarly reflect on to a greater extent, for the second and third points, we should theoretically understand the historical spirit of struggle of the Japanese nation, trust Japan, truly keep the promise of shared life and death, cooperate in the war, and strive to the end.

Even with such a sound political system and a nation with a strong sense of national purpose, Mr. Tokutomi is still concerned that some may exhibit "living in a dream, being careless and lax, and perfunctory" behavior, or say "everything is perfect" in words but "do as they please, indulging in ease and hating work" in deeds. He asks the people to correct these if they exist, and strive to improve if they do not. Looking back at our country's political affairs and public morale, how are they? These shortcomings, which were previously manifested in political affairs, have been greatly revitalized on the surface after a series of rectifications and reforms by the authorities. However, the root causes of the illness still need to be further eradicated to achieve thoroughness. Otherwise, if we slacken even slightly, the corrupt phenomena that we used to find distressing, such as "disregarding the noble purpose of the nation, disregarding the survival and prosperity of the nation, and only seeking personal gain and selfishness" and "being indifferent to the crisis and difficulties, being perfunctory and irresponsible, going with the flow, and parasites who eat the emperor's salary and enjoy the nation's stipend," may take the opportunity to recur.

The Japanese people must understand the difficult process of building the Imperial State from history, and they must appreciate the arduous process of victory from historical experiences and lessons, so as to strengthen their confidence and be able to recognize that the key to overcoming the current crisis and striving for victory lies in whether they can persevere to the end. And our understanding of the Japanese nation's historical spirit of struggle is to use history to prove that Japan will definitely be able to persevere to the end. This is one point. Second, trust the accuracy of the theory of Japan's coexistence and co-prosperity; third, the strategy of persevering to the end will surely lead to victory.

History is the most truthful proof. Every crisis in Japan's two thousand six hundred years of history is sufficient to prove the spirit of struggle of the Japanese nation. Emperor Jimmu's accession to the throne in Kashihara after eight years of hard struggle is a historical example of the Japanese nation's perseverance. It is even more evident today. The heroic deaths of all officials and civilians on Saipan and Tinian, as well as the Kamikaze spirit, are all current facts that prove that when the survival of the Japanese nation is threatened, the Japanese nation's unwillingness to yield is not just propaganda. And Grew, who knows Japan well, cannot but admit that "the reason why the American army suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Iwo Jima was the result of the Japanese army's struggle."

The strategic weakness of the enemy, America, lies in "attempting to defeat Japan in one go." If Japan adopts a strategy of persevering to the end, taking advantage of their internal weakness of not being able to last, then the enemy, America, must fight on the islands of the Pacific, on the Japanese mainland, and on the Chinese mainland. In this way, the outcome of the war, to whom victory belongs, we can easily imagine.

The current situation is so urgent, and the future prospects are so grand. Our country is a member of the Greater East Asia War, and we should further understand and strive.

### The Focus of Attention: The Rice Market in Zhoujiaqiao

— Xi

Zhoujiaqiao is a place name in western Shanghai. Because it is a concentration point for the sale of rice and grain, it has received special attention from Shanghai citizens in recent years. The reporter hired a car and went there at seven o'clock yesterday morning. After passing Jing'an Temple Road and turning into YuYue Road, passing Zhongshan Park brought a rural atmosphere. The houses along the road were all low tile houses. Some old women, young girls, middle-aged men, and children of twelve or thirteen years old were carrying bags of rice in a continuous stream towards the east. The more westward we went, the more people there were. This was telling us that we were approaching the rice market – Zhoujiaqiao.

After passing the West Station (Fanwangdu Road Station), we could only see a mass of heads moving around. On both sides of Bailinan Road, there were bags and bags of rice on display. Behind them stood the owners of these rice. Surrounding them were many customers from the city carrying empty burlap bags. Some of them were users, and some were rice merchants. They were judging the quality of the rice, arguing about the price, and calculating the weight, creating a noisy scene. More than one-third of the shops on both sides of the road were rice and grain shops.

Zhoujiaqiao itself does not produce rice. Now it is just a distribution center for rice and grain. The rice and grain here are entirely transported from Huangdu via Beixinjing, either by waterway from Suzhou or by land along the highway. The price of rice in Huangdu is now only 40,000 yuan, but because of the Qingxiang blockade and other obstacles, it is not easy to transport it over. Therefore, the price difference over a distance of only sixty miles is huge, which is truly unbelievable. Most of the rice in Huangdu is imported from Suzhou and Wuxi. A few days ago, the price of rice in Suzhou and Wuxi was only 25,000 yuan per stone. Recently, it has only been able to rise to 30,000 yuan per stone due to the reverse influence of Shanghai. This phenomenon of different prices in different places is somewhat unreasonable.

The price of rice in Zhoujiaqiao is of great concern to all Shanghai citizens. Yesterday, the price of Bo Dao (early rice) in that area was 93,000 yuan to 95,000 yuan per stone, Huang Bo Dao (yellow early rice) was 88,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan per stone, and Yang Zhi (foreign rice) was 90,000 yuan per stone. It was only cheaper than the price in the urban area by the cartage fee of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per stone. This is because the rice and grain that arrive in Zhoujiaqiao have already completed layers of checkpoints and have also used up various kinds of expenses. After arriving in Zhoujiaqiao, no further fees are required. Therefore, if someone who is not familiar with this situation takes a rickshaw from the city center to Zhoujiaqiao to buy rice and then transports it back by rickshaw, the calculation may sometimes be more expensive than buying rice from the rice merchants at the entrance of the alley. Since this is a distribution center for rice, there is also a large distribution of rice straw here. In the Suzhou River here, there are large boats and boats of rice straw, as many as two or three hundred. These rice straws are all supplied to bathhouses. Since the source of coal has become scarce, rice straw has become a very common substitute in bathhouses. There are now more than twenty firewood shops here, all doing rice straw business. Bean stalks are only a small amount, and as for other fuels such as firewood, there is very little here.

### The Municipal Economic Bureau Plans to Strengthen the Structures of Various Trade Associations; Adjustments Will Be Implemented After the Completion of the Investigation

In view of the loose organization and unsound structure of various trade associations in the city's industrial and commercial sectors, the Municipal Economic Bureau recognizes that some associations are even organized by industries with similar natures, which often leads to disputes among the trades. Whether the candidates for directors and supervisors of various trade associations are appropriate has a significant impact on the welfare of the industry members and the government's promotion of wartime economic policies. Therefore, the bureau has recently been actively planning to strengthen and adjust the organizational structures of various trade associations throughout the city. For those associations that (1) have unsound internal organizational structures, (2) have inappropriate directors and supervisors, (3) have similar industrial natures, or (4) are hollow inside without actual work, they will be ordered to reorganize and merge, or be banned. It is understood that the bureau's entire plan for reorganizing the trade associations has been largely decided and will soon be implemented. The reorganization steps will first involve sending personnel to conduct a general investigation of the internal organizational system, the qualifications of the directors and supervisors, and the economic situation of various trade associations. After the general investigation is completed, the bureau will, based on the actual business situation, classify them and order them to reorganize or merge, so as to ensure that the internal organizational structures of the trade associations are sound and can effectively shoulder the wartime economic mission of seeking the welfare of the industry.

The first batch of more than 2,000 people was announced on the 1st. It is understood that the second batch of more than 200 people was also announced yesterday (6th). Among them, there are more than 80 people from various sections and departments of the General Bureau, and more than 100 people from various sub-bureaus, including police inspectors, police sergeants, clerks, police chiefs, and police officers. The laid-off personnel will be given considerable severance pay based on their years of service. In addition, the Supervision Department of the bureau has recently been actively promoting the supervision of police work. Many police officers have been reported for misconduct. Those who violate police regulations will be given disciplinary action of dismissal. Those who violate the law will be handed over to the Third Division for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law in addition to being dismissed. More than 200 police officers were dismissed last month, and several were investigated. Therefore, it is expected that the situation will improve under the strict supervision of the police authorities in the future.

### A Black Hat at the North Station Committed Murder; A Young Woman Was Beaten to Death; The Police Bureau Is Strictly Pursuing the Fugitive

Xu Peiwen, the wife of Xu Senzhi from Zhenjiang, lived at No. 21, Xinde Xingli, Xinzhang Road, Zhabei District, in this city. Recently, due to the evacuation of the population in Shanghai, she planned to send her mother-in-law and three-year-old daughter back to their original residence in Zhenjiang. On the morning of March 4th, at 2:00 am, she waited at ticket office No. 4 of the North Station until 7:00 am. She was beaten for no reason by Jiang Shiyan, a black hat at the station. Then, he grabbed her hair and dragged her to his office to beat her, causing her to suffer multiple serious injuries. She was sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium on Bazilu Road. Her kidneys were removed and found to be shattered. She died at 1:45 am the next morning. The murderer fled upon hearing the news. After receiving the report, the North Station Sub-bureau immediately sent police to arrest the murderer but failed to do so. They then negotiated with the China Railway Authority to request assistance in the arrest. At the same time, the police bureau sent out a large number of plainclothes detectives to strictly pursue the arrest day and night, determined to bring him to justice.

### The Finance Bureau Establishes a Committee for the Collection of Cigarette Consumption Tax

Since Mr. Luo took office as the director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau, he has spared no effort in rectifying tax collection. Although it has not been long, there has been a significant increase in various donations and taxes. Recently, in view of the fact that the collection mechanism for the special consumption tax on retail cigarette sales in the past was not sound and the collection methods were inconsistent, a Special Committee for the Collection of Special Consumption Tax on Retail Cigarette Sales was specially established. Representatives from the cigarette industry and experienced experts Yu Ai-yu, Jiang Sen-yu, Zhang Da-lian, Yang Bing-yi, Tan Ting-ze, Xu Wen-xiang, Ye Yun-fang, Weng Bing-yao, and Chen Bo-zong were appointed as members to be responsible for handling the collection and payment of the special consumption tax on retail cigarette sales throughout the city, and two specialists from the Finance Bureau were assigned to supervise and promote the work. The committee was established on March 4th of this year at No. 148 Ding'an Road (formerly Route Magbao Lu), and the first committee meeting was held at the same time, passing the organizational charter and other important cases. It is now rushing to complete the relevant procedures. It is heard that it has been stipulated that the special consumption tax on rationed cigarettes will be collected from the 48th period onwards, and the special consumption tax on non-rationed cigarettes will be collected by cigarette factories assisting in the collection.

### The Issuance of Housing Sublease Licenses Is Handled by the Finance Bureau

The issuance and collection of fees for housing sublease licenses in this city have always been handled by the Finance Bureau. The execution of investigation matters was handled by the Industrial Investigation Office during the former District Public Office period. Now that the Industrial Investigation Office has long been abolished, all housing sublease investigations and executions are under the jurisdiction of the Finance Bureau. If housing disputes arise, which concern the welfare of the people, they can be handled by the Social Welfare Bureau. It is heard that the municipal government has approved this arrangement and ordered the Finance and Social Welfare Bureaus to comply.

### The Shanghai Station Sub-bureau Strives to Eliminate the Black Market for Tickets

Liu Zhenzhong, the director of the Shanghai Station Sub-bureau of the Municipal Police Bureau, believes that although he has tried his best to eliminate black market train tickets, he has not been able to completely fulfill the responsibilities of the sub-bureau. In order to completely eliminate black market tickets, it is heard that he has drafted an overall plan, which is currently being submitted for approval.

### Land Transportation in This City Is Gradually Becoming Smoother

At a time when the Municipal Government is seeking to disperse the population of this city, smooth transportation is a prerequisite. The reporter specially visited Mr. He, a director of the China Railway Company. According to Mr. He, the company had reduced the number of train services due to fuel issues. Recently, the fuel problem has been resolved. In addition to the scheduled services operating as usual, the overnight express train on the Shanghai-Nanjing line was restored from the previous day. Other long-distance buses under the company's jurisdiction are also operating as usual. Therefore, land transportation in this city has gradually become smoother. The company also bears part of the responsibility for transportation in the dispersal of the city's population. The authorities are actively planning how to disperse the population in the future. As for the situation at the North Station, after repeated efforts with the police authorities, the situation has been improving day by day. However, recently, the number of citizens who have voluntarily evacuated from Shanghai has been quite large, and the overcrowding of passengers has caused the order at the North Station to deteriorate again. Passengers who have purchased tickets but are unable to board the train due to overcrowding can go to the designated location to return the tickets or state their reasons to the station master's office. After the station master stamps the tickets as proof, they can still use the original tickets on the next train.

News on Reading and Helping Students

### The Bureau Adds a Subsidy for Books and Supplies to the Students It Sponsors

The allocation of student aid this year was based on a comprehensive estimate of the total amount of donations received at the beginning of the school year and the tuition fees charged by various schools. It was felt that the funds were stretched. Therefore, it was decided to limit aid to existing students and not to provide aid to new students. The maximum amount of general aid for students at all levels was set at 5,000 yuan for senior primary school, 8,500 yuan for junior high school, 12,000 yuan for senior high school and vocational schools, and 20,000 yuan for universities. Although this was an increase of 150% to 233% compared to the previous year, it was far less than the increase in tuition fees at various schools. As a result, the students receiving aid were unable to get sufficient assistance, which the colleagues deeply regretted. However, in the past month, readers have been enthusiastically donating, and the proceeds from the charity market jointly organized by the four groups and the charity performance organized by the recipients of the newspaper's aid were also higher than expected. In order to give new students the opportunity to receive aid, the Charity Market Committee proposed to allocate more than 5 million yuan to various schools to subsidize students in need other than those receiving aid from Shen Bao and Xin Bao. The newspaper also decided to allocate a certain percentage of the proceeds from the charity performance to the schools with the best ticket sales to do the same. Both of these measures are to remedy the situation of not accepting new students this year. In addition, the Student Aid Committee of this newspaper, in order to remedy the shortcoming that the amount of aid could not be increased due to the limitation of donations, plans to re-allocate and subsidize the donations received in the past month. It was immediately resolved to add a subsidy for books and supplies to the students receiving aid, as follows:

1,500 yuan per student for senior primary school,

2,500 yuan per student for junior high school,

4,000 yuan per student for senior high school and vocational schools,

5,000 yuan per student for universities.

The distribution date and procedures will be announced separately, and it is planned to distribute all the funds before the end of this month. The committee also decided to entrust a hospital with the remaining funds to handle medical treatment subsidies for students receiving aid. Detailed measures will be announced later. From April onwards, the committee will resume the morning exercises of the students receiving aid. The readers have continued to donate enthusiastically after the start of the school year. The members of the committee, in view of the impoverished situation of the students, decided to allocate as much of the deposits as possible to the students, hoping that the students will work harder in their studies in the future and not betray the enthusiasm of the readers and the hard work of the colleagues of this newspaper.

Yesterday's Aid Received: A group of colleagues from Shanghai Jian donated 30,000 yuan, Cheng Zhaoying (on behalf of the landlord Mr. Song) donated 25,000 yuan, and Shi Kou donated 400 yuan. A total of 55,400 yuan was received, with a balance of 9,728,953.03 yuan.

### The Education and Police Bureaus Thoroughly Investigate the Black Market for Textbooks

The government provides nationally designated textbooks for various subjects used in primary and secondary schools in this city at stipulated prices for widespread distribution through various bookstores in order to popularize education and reduce the burden on students' parents. However, there are still a few unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate on nationally designated textbooks and sell them at black market prices. Therefore, there has been a great shortage of nationally designated textbooks in this city recently. In order to combat these black market prices, the Education Bureau has secretly dispatched staff members to conduct secret investigations in conjunction with detectives from the Police Bureau at various bookstores in this city. It has been found that Shen Jiliang of Shanhe Bookstore on Yandang Road was selling nationally designated textbooks at 40% above the original price. He has now been sent to the court by the Police Bureau for strict handling in accordance with the law.

### Funds Depleted, Difficult to Maintain - Red Cross Third Hospital Fundraising - Goal 10,000,000 Yuan, Entrusted to Xin Shen and Shen Bao Newspapers for Collection

Dating back to the Second Revolution in the second year of the Republic (1913), the Red Cross established this hospital outside the 16th Pier on Wai Ma Road to treat wounded soldiers, initially known as the Fifth Wounded Soldiers Hospital, marking the hospital's beginning. Subsequently, during various wars, this hospital repeatedly undertook the task of rescuing wounded soldiers, while also serving the general public during peacetime. The Red Cross had already established the First and Second Hospitals, and this hospital was accordingly named the Third Hospital. The hospital's purpose has always been rooted in charity, therefore fees are particularly low, and often free. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it moved to No. 1750 Xinzha Road (Jiaozhou Road intersection), expanding in scale. Statistics show that outpatient visits are approximately 40,000 people per year, and inpatient admissions are approximately 3,000 to 4,000 people. Currently, there are 10 doctors, 25 nurses, 15 staff members, and 28 laborers, totaling 86 people, with 120 beds. In terms of medical services, it is divided into internal medicine, surgery, pulmonology, obstetrics, otolaryngology, and X-ray equipment. As for the hospital's finances, it previously received subsidies from the head office, but the head office ceased operations long ago, leaving the hospital to rely solely on its own resources. However, in recent years, prices have been rising, expenses are enormous, and the hospital has never solicited donations from the outside world, resulting in increasing losses. Since the autumn of last year, prices have risen even more sharply, especially for Western medicine and rice. The hospital needs approximately one shi, two or three dou of rice every day, which is already a considerable expense. Recently, the monthly loss has been 1,300,000 to 1,400,000 Yuan. Arrangements are made everywhere, but it is difficult to cope with the situation. To date, the debt has reached more than 4,000,000 Yuan, and it is difficult to guarantee that prices will not rise in the future, making it even more difficult to cope with the future environment. Therefore, we have no choice but to appeal to all sectors of society for a public donation of 10,000,000 Yuan, and we have separately requested the Xinwen Bao and Shen Bao social service departments to collect donations on our behalf. We sincerely hope that great philanthropists will generously donate to enable this hospital to continue to serve society, directly helping the hospital, which indirectly helps the poor and sick. (The editorial office notes that the Red Cross Third Hospital is well-managed, charges low fees, provides convenience for the poor and sick, and serves the public interest, which is truly worthy of sympathy. Now that the hospital is publicly raising funds and has entrusted this office to collect donations on its behalf, please send your donations to this office.)
