### Northern Balikpapan City Streets: A Fierce Bayonet Charge Unfolds; Japanese Boat Unit Sinks Two Transport Ships

From a Southern Frontline Base, 8th, Central News Agency: Enemy warships off the coast of Balikpapan currently consist of five cruisers, fifteen destroyers, and forty-five minesweepers and transport ships. Compared to the time of the landing, excluding auxiliary craft, they have already decreased by one-fifth of the total number. Furthermore, land battles are currently centered on the northern part of the city and areas near the airfield, where a fierce bayonet charge is unfolding. In recent days, Japanese forces have destroyed two enemy tents, killed or wounded over 150 enemy soldiers, prevented enemy forces from invading, and firmly defended the oil field area.

From a Southwest Pacific Base, 8th, Central News Agency: On the night of the 4th, Japanese armed boats in the Balikpapan area attacked enemy convoys in the port of Balikpapan, sinking a 3,000-ton transport ship and destroying an 8,000-ton transport ship.

### Situations in the Philippines, Burma, and Borneo; Enemy Warships Discovered at Nicobar

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency: The latest war situations in various parts of Greater East Asia are as follows:

In the Philippines, the American 37th Division advancing north from the Salacsac-Barrela area and a portion of the 11th Division advancing south from the Abari area appear to have made contact around Zikega on approximately June 25th. As a result, it is now being proclaimed locally that the Luzon operation has concluded. However, Japanese forces in northern Luzon are still fighting fiercely in the mountains west of the Cagayan Valley and north of Baguio. Similarly, Japanese forces in the mountains east of Paniqui are continuing to fight.

In the Southwest Pacific, enemy forces attacking Balikpapan began landing on July 1st with 250 landing craft, with an initial force of approximately 7,000 men. They have gradually increased their numbers and now have approximately 15,000 men. The enemy's operation against Borneo, a resource-rich area, can be said to be their first engagement in what they call a favorable operation. Meanwhile, the air raids on Banjarmasin are gradually intensifying. On the 3rd and 4th, small numbers of planes launched fierce attacks.

In Burma, there have been no significant changes on the Burmese front. Japanese forces in the southeast of Mandalay are still securing the area near Pyawbwe and bravely fighting against the attacking enemy. Japanese forces in the Pegu mountain range are preventing the invading enemy from advancing. The enemy forces in the lower Sittang River area, consisting of approximately 20,000 men from the Indian 5th Division and the British 17th Division, with 50 tanks and approximately 120 artillery pieces, are currently attempting to cross the Sittang River and advance against the Japanese forces. However, as the area is currently in the rainy season, both sides' operations are being hampered. Nevertheless, the Japanese forces have high morale and are engaging in courageous combat.

In the Nicobar area, on July 6th, fourteen warships centered around two aircraft carriers were conducting reconnaissance in the Southeast Sea. However, no active movements were observed. The discovery of this new enemy fleet requires heightened vigilance.

### Zhejiang Province Establishes Air Raid Disaster Relief Committee

Hangzhou, 8th, Central News Agency: In order to meet wartime needs, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has specially established an Air Raid Disaster Relief Committee. It has now formulated various plans related to disaster prevention and relief and aims to strengthen air raid relief and defense efforts.

### Kanto and Kyushu Attacked Yesterday in Succession; B-29 Type Aircraft First Strike Nansei Islands

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency: Approximately 150 enemy P-37 type aircraft from the Yellow Sea area, led by three B-29 type aircraft, attacked the Kanto region in three waves from 00:02 to 01:30 PM on the 8th, targeting military facilities and airfields in the Tokyo area and the Ibaraki-Boso region. Japanese losses were minor.

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency:

Enemy small aircraft units based in Okinawa operated south of Kikaijima and in the Tanegashima area at around 11:30 AM on the 7th. Separately, two PBM-type aircraft operated over eastern Miyazaki Prefecture and western Shikoku at 9:00 AM on the same day before escaping. Also, at around 2:30 PM on the same day, a formation of 13 P-41Y aircraft and approximately 20 PBM-type and PB4Y-type aircraft invaded from the Kikaijima area, targeting Sasebo and Hirado.

Central Pacific Base, 8th, Central News Agency: Over ten enemy B-20 type aircraft attacked Minamidaito Island during the day on the 7th. This marks the first attack on the island by B-29s.

### United States Establishes New Strategic Air Force

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency: Following his inspection of Pacific bases, U.S. Air Force Chief General Arnold announced through U.S. Under Secretary of War Patterson on the 7th that a new Strategic Air Force has been established for the purpose of operations against Japan. General Spaatz, commander of the U.S. Air Force in Europe under Eisenhower, has been appointed as commander of the force. Under his command are the Eighth Air Force directly subordinate to Lieutenant General Doolittle and the Twentieth Air Force in the Marianas. Major General LeMay has also been promoted to commander of the Twentieth Air Force. Consequently, Spaatz will station himself in Okinawa alongside the Twentieth Air Force in the Marianas and oversee Doolittle's Eighth Air Force, attempting to intensify air raids on Japan through operations on two fronts. This reorganization of the U.S. Air Force reflects the importance of the strategic attack mission against Japan, given the massive air power consisting of one thousand B-29s in the Marianas and the nine hundred fighter-bombers already assembled in Okinawa. It highlights the urgent need for a unified commander. LeMay, the commander of the Twentieth Air Force, is known for his brutal bombings. His collaboration with Doolittle to bomb the Japanese mainland from two fronts is a scheme that reveals the American style and is deeply infuriating, further increasing the determination to annihilate the enemy. Since June 17th, enemy B-29s from the Marianas base have repeatedly bombed small and medium-sized cities on the Japanese mainland, affecting over twenty cities. The southern Kyushu region has been frequently attacked by North American B-25s and small aircraft from the Okinawa base. The Kanto region has been under continuous attacks in recent days by P-51s flying from Iwo Jima. As the enemy strengthens its air bombing formation against Japan, future attacks are expected to become more intense. This type of aerial assault is a prelude to a landing on the Japanese mainland. The enemy's air offensive suggests that a landing operation on the homeland is imminent. Therefore, the Japanese side must not only strive to prevent these attacks but also transform scorched earth into combat power as soon as possible to minimize the impact of the bombings. On the day of the enemy landing, a decisive victory must be achieved by further consolidating our defenses and patiently waiting for the opportunity.

### Boy Pilot

Rain has been falling constantly around the base. It's been drizzling every day, it truly is the plum rain season! The air pressure is low near the Okinawa Islands, and dark clouds are constantly shifting in the sky. Despite the weather, special attack units are constantly taking off and landing, tirelessly preparing for future operations. When we arrived at this base, it was raining heavily, but shortly after, we saw several special attack aircraft landing safely despite the adverse weather conditions.

"Are there any graduates from the boy pilot program here?" A sergeant asked the "maintenance crew" (soldiers who service the aircraft) after getting out of a plane.

"Yes, over there."

The sergeant rushed towards the barracks. How happy it must be to meet old classmates! In the barracks, three corporals surrounded him, joyfully chatting. I couldn't hear what they were talking about, but I imagine they were pouring out their hearts to each other. The bond between those who came from the boy pilot program is different from that of ordinary schoolmates, it is especially pure.

### Cherry Blossoms Blooming Together on the Same Branch

After entering the boy pilot school, the students receive several months of common education before being assigned to special skill training, with some entering flight courses, some entering mechanical courses, and some entering communications courses. Young men who have gathered together occasionally during those months often meet again in unexpected places after leaving school. For example, they might all be in a special attack unit and end up together. Now, surrounding the sergeant are Sergeant Muto of the maintenance crew, Sergeant Kihara of the fighter escort squadron, and Corporal Omura of the communications crew.

"Ah, you're doing this too? Sigh, if only I had entered the flight course when I was in school!"

"Don't say that. I'm about to take off, please make sure my plane is well maintained."

"If I can receive your successful telegram that says 'I have crashed into the aircraft carrier,' then my years of hard training will not have been in vain," said Corporal Omura.

"Are you in Lieutenant Nai's squadron? I'm in charge of providing cover! If enemy planes try to interfere, I will fight them to the death, whether it's Grumman or P-51 or P-47, so you can be sure to strike the enemy ship," said Corporal Kihara.

Special attack, maintenance, escort, and communications, these four classmates with different jobs are tightly united, stronger than steel.

"You and I are cherry blossoms blooming at the same time, flourishing on the branches of war. We will fall even more spectacularly, for the sake of the nation!" The four magnificent figures walked shoulder to shoulder towards the distance, disappearing beyond the vast airfield. That night, I had a dream all night long, dreaming of four cherry blossoms blooming densely together:

### Bearing the Fate of the Motherland

Sergeant Muto of the maintenance crew stayed up all night, meticulously working on Sergeant Wu's plane. His bloodshot eyes were wide open, and he shined a flashlight to check it again and again, refusing to let go of even the smallest problem. At dawn, Sergeant Wu and other special attack team members lined up on the airfield, listening to the commander's instructions.

"The fate of the motherland rests entirely on your shoulders!" The commander shouted excitedly. Sergeant Wu and the others gripped their sword hilts tightly.

The time for departure had arrived. The plane's propellers were already spinning. Sergeant Kihara, who was in charge of providing cover, tightly grasped Sergeant Wu's hand. He said calmly, "I wish you success!" Then, they each boarded their planes. Corporals Omura and Muto waved their hats to see off Sergeant Wu and his colleagues. With a roar, one plane after another disappeared into the southern sky in an instant.

### A Blood-Red Spark

Sergeant Wu stared ahead, gripping the control stick tightly. Just as he flew not far from his destination, more than a dozen black dots suddenly appeared in front of him.

"Enemy planes!" Sergeant Wu couldn't help but bite his lip.

At this moment, several black shadows suddenly swept across the sky above. It turned out to be friendly fighters, and they were waving their wings, sending a signal.

"Kihara, I'm counting on you!" Sergeant Wu couldn't help but shout.

Friendly fighters gathered into a group and charged fiercely into the enemy plane group, immediately shooting down five or six of them, scattering the enemy planes.

At this moment, the radio received a telegram calling Sergeant Wu's plane. It must have been Corporal Omura sending it from the base. However, Sergeant Wu did not reply for the time being. Before long, the target was in sight. The special attack team changed its formation.

"Divine aircraft, charge towards the target!" Captain Nai issued the signal.

At this time, enemy fighters broke through the escorting defense line and flew in from all directions to attack Sergeant Wu. The enemy's anti-aircraft fire also fired wildly. However, Sergeant Wu ignored everything, passed through the fire net, avoided the enemy planes, and quietly searched for his target. At sea, there were battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. Sergeant Wu selected a target and began his attack. At this moment, a friendly plane flew by his side, waving its wings. It turned out to be Sergeant Kihara's plane.

"Kihara, thank you!" At the same time, Sergeant Wu's left hand gently pressed the transmission key, sending a telegram back to the base saying, "I have crashed into the aircraft carrier."

Enemy fighters were closely chasing him on both sides, and Sergeant Kihara tried his best to scatter them, clearing a bloody path for Sergeant Wu. It was time. The control stick tilted smoothly to the right, and Sergeant Wu's plane began to dive rapidly like a bullet. The speed became faster and faster, and the enemy aircraft carrier in front of him became bigger and bigger. The last scene reflected in Sergeant Wu's wide eyes was a flash of bright red light.

This was my dream. The reality must have been even more tragic. Since the Battle of Leyte Gulf, many special attack team members have been martyred for their country in this way. Their greatness is something we should remember. (Report by Ojima news team, translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, June 8th)

Editorial

### The Great Significance of Air Raid Drills

Today is again the regularly scheduled air raid drill, and the authorities have announced the six major objectives of this drill, which will be earnestly implemented. Looking back at the results of the past eighteen drills, to be honest, we do not see any particular achievements. The authorities and those who are ordered to participate in the drills do sweat and work hard to earnestly practice, but most citizens still go their own way. Only a few are able to automatically cooperate and abide by the rules. However, we must clearly recognize that air raid drills are not just acting. The performers perform, and the audience watches. The greatest requirement is to enable all citizens to develop automatic habits. If we look at it from this standard, the past eighteen drills seem to have many unsatisfactory aspects.

Furthermore, air raid drills are a collective action, that is, a planned and organized action. The good or bad results of this action directly reflect whether the society is organized. If drills are forever just drills, and the general public is indifferent, at most only reluctantly perfunctory under the leadership of the authorities, then this merely exposes our society's lack of organization, disorganization, and weakness. If this state of society is allowed to continue, how can we talk about future national reconstruction and development? Therefore, we must regard air raid drills as a test of our social organizational capacity, and the results of each drill must be better than the previous one.

Air raid drills today are also a major test of civic virtue. Taking the prevention of light leakage as an example, according to the regulations, if any household or room is found to have light leakage, the power supply to that household and its surrounding block will be cut off depending on the circumstances. This means that one person's failure to abide by the rules will affect the majority of people nearby. Those who have civic virtue will naturally not fail to abide by the rules. To expand on this, because one person's carelessness can affect the public, those who have civic virtue must not only be careful and cautious themselves but also be aware of whether their neighbors are violating air raid laws. In this way, air raid drills can be said to be a measure that embodies civic virtue. We hope that citizens will have a proper understanding of this.

Any movement requires leaders to set an example, and air defense is no exception. However, we often see light leakage in the buildings of many public institutions. Although we do not want to list their real names, the general public is very clear about this. If we think that we are government agencies and can disregard air defense rules, then what is the negative impact on the psychology of the general public? Furthermore, although government officials themselves understand the importance of abiding by air defense rules, they may not always inspect and supervise their family members and servants. As a result, there are often violations of air defense rules. We hope that government agencies, especially government officials, will pay special attention to this.

We believe that air raid drills, in addition to their own significance, also have the important significance of building hearts and minds and reforming social customs. In addition to the three points mentioned above, during this summer season, we also hope that the general public will adhere to the habit of going to bed early and getting up early, preferably not using electric lights at all in the evening. Those who usually play cards and dance under electric lights will be able to slowly realize that life is more meaningful if they can practice getting up early and going to bed early, saving countless wasted time and increasing beneficial factors for both body and mind. This is very beneficial for oneself, for society, and for the country.

### Proclamation of War by the National Government

On December 8th of the year before last, at the start of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public security, and improved the people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain and the United States continue to use their centuries-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have even intensified it, colluding with elements of the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians slaughter each other. Recently, their violence has been successively defeated by the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have been lost. They are increasingly resorting to cunning schemes, and are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's controlled areas, instigating Chongqing faction elements to constantly harass and hinder the progress of various construction projects, and directly using their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction elements, willingly driven by Britain and the United States, acting as traitors to East Asia, are indeed shameful. However, Britain and the United States, with their long-standing and deliberate plotting against East Asia, have exhausted their ability to provoke and sow discord, in order to ultimately fulfill their desire for annexation. This is something that East Asian nations should jointly resist with hatred. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States, and will exert all its strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations, and share a common desire for East Asian co-prosperity. In the future, they will increasingly seek to support each other, in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on righteousness. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a struggle with the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for several years, and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our nation's participation in the Greater East Asia War will resonate with them, in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Father of the Nation's Greater Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of Greater East Asian construction, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world all depend on this. They must be of one heart and one mind, and work diligently from beginning to end, in order to carry out this great mission of this great era. January 9th, the thirty-second year of the Republic of China. Chairman Wang Zhaoming.

### Lifting of Rice Ban and Tang Yi of Zhujiajiao

Since the National Government implemented emergency measures regarding rice, lifted the rice ban, and stopped purchasing, although the price of rice in Shanghai has seen a decline, the price of rice in the interior has instead increased. Regarding this measure of restoring free circulation of rice, people are quite interested in what kind of impact it will have on the future price of rice. Therefore, we specially visited Qingpu and Zhujiajiao, the sources of rice, to infer the future trend from the discussion of the rice transportation and sales prices of the land.

Before and After the Lifting of the Ban

First, before the rice was restored to free circulation, the price of rice in Shanghai and Qingpu was vastly different, usually differing by more than one-third. Therefore, although it was nominally under control, merchants still smuggled it to Shanghai. Second, some farmers still had surplus rice in storage. After the ban was lifted, farmers dared to transport three or five shi to the towns of Qingpu or Zhujiajiao. Therefore, the lifting of the rice ban did not deplete the local rice reserves. Third, according to the past situation, the price of rice in Shanghai was higher than in Qingpu city, and Qingpu was higher than Zhujiajiao. Although this has not changed in general, when the price of rice in Shanghai declined, Qingpu was the first to fall. The market in Zhujiajiao is not as active as in Qingpu town, so sometimes it is higher than the price in the city. The above three points illustrate that the main driving force behind the rise in the price of rice in Shanghai in the past was artificial obstruction and speculation, and not entirely due to the lack of rice. The price in the rice-producing area followed the price in Shanghai, and it was not that the price in the producing area rose and affected the price in Shanghai. Although free circulation and the cessation of purchases temporarily stimulated the price of rice in the rice-producing area, once the price of rice in the city and the rice-producing area were balanced, the frantic rise stopped. If speculation and hoarding can be reduced in the future, the price will definitely tend to stabilize. Based on this, the National Government's emergency measures for rice are indeed very wise measures.

Current Status of Transportation and Sales

There are six or seven rice shops in Zhujiajiao. Before the war, even during the lean months, they could still collect about 200 shi of rice per day. Now, although the rice ban has been lifted, because farmers are reluctant to part with their rice, they only sell some of their reserves when they need money, and the reserves are not very abundant. Also, because the problem of cash discounts has not been resolved, rice shops lack cash to purchase rice. Therefore, each rice shop collects only about 20 shi of rice per day. Most of this rice is first transported to Qingpu, and then transported to Shanghai.

According to the reporter's estimate, about 200 shi of edible rice are transported from Yuipu to Shanghai every day, mostly transported by trucks. In addition, there are small gasoline trucks, flatbed trucks, bicycles, and porters. Those who transport rice in large quantities also include government merchants, with people in uniform escorting the rice. The transportation fee from Zhujiajiao to Qingpu by waterway is about 2,000 yuan per shi. The price from Qingpu city to Shanghai via the highway is about 18,000 yuan per shi (rising to 40,000 yuan on the 7th). Adding the loading and unloading costs and the inevitable expenses along the way, the transportation fee from Zhujiajiao to Shanghai is about 30,000 yuan per shi.

The reporter's investigation was on July 4th and 5th. At that time, the local price of rice was: about 470,000 yuan per shi for brown rice, and about 560,000 yuan for white rice. At that time, the price of the same type of rice in Shanghai was about 650,000 yuan, a difference of about 90,000 yuan between the two places. (On July 7th, the price of white rice in Qingpu was about 610,000 yuan per shi.)

### Today is the 19th Air Defense Day, Training Exercises to be Carried Out as Usual, Six Major Exercises to be Held Throughout the District

Today is the 19th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters will carry out various air defense training exercises as usual. The time for issuing the daily training alarm has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. At that time, sirens will not be sounded during the alarm time. The method of communication has been specially planned in advance, such as using bicycles, gongs, and oral communication. As for the main training exercises in the whole district, they are divided into six major goals to be implemented: comprehensive training in designated areas, emergency evacuation training, alarm communication training, cleaning and rectification of air-raid shelters, local training, and implementation of blackout training. At that time, every radio station in Shanghai will also broadcast air defense programs from time to time, hoping that the citizens will listen to them.

Points to Note for Air Defense Training

The following matters should be noted in this air defense training: First goal, comprehensive training in designated areas, in the air defense jurisdiction of each police precinct, designate one district or two Lianbao (joint guarantee units) to implement comprehensive training during the training time, and implement it thoroughly in the designated training area and its surroundings in accordance with the training after receiving the radio broadcast assuming comprehensive training is implemented. Thoroughly implement traffic control, such as broadcasting that a simulated wave attack is in progress. Repeatedly hold air defense activities and waiting exercises, and finally implement emergency evacuation training.

Second goal emergency evacuation training. Designate in advance open spaces that can accommodate and protect refugees, or buildings considered safe, and training areas. Each household selects one or more trainees for refuge training, for a total of about five or six people. The route for the refugee trainees is instructed in advance. The refugees carrying the training must carry food for one or two uses, and all other items are prohibited. In addition, in order to prevent the thick smoke in case of fire, personnel engaged in general air defense activities must prepare towels to cover their mouths and noses before taking action. In addition, in order to organize and guide those who are urgently evacuating, mobilize a large number of police and members of the Baojia self-defense corps to maintain order at the scene, and use guidance flags within the possible range.

Third target for communication and reporting training. Each air defense jurisdiction is the unit, and each police department issues orders based on the training implementation time. Plan the communication method in advance and quickly transmit it to the relevant organizations of civil air defense. This training does not sound the alarm siren, but in the event of an actual air raid, a gasoline alarm will be used. In the transmission of orders, try to consider using bicycles, and expect the activities of Baojia's self-defense corps. At the same time as the sound of gongs, oral communication must also be used, calling the phrase "training", and the whole area will universally implement the training alarm flag, to identify it.

Fourth goal is to clean up and adjust the air defense team to mobilize the fourth team of the shocking Bureau's police general team to carry out model adjustment work on the main roads. During the adjustment of air defense, each district sub-bureau chief must consult with the air defense headquarters. For the existing air defense trenches that are obstructive, they should be abolished, and the general public will complete it on the day of the Noo according to the cleaning of the air defense trenches and the adjustment methods.

Fifth target, local training, designated as the four air defense jurisdictions of Tilan Bridge, Yulin Road, Yangshupu, and Xinshi Street. It will be implemented in the morning, and in the afternoon, it will be implemented according to the city's training plan.

Sixth target, blackout training. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters broadcasts general information about fire control by radio. If there are areas with poor lighting control, residents in the area will be urged to pay attention. The lighting control supervision team is formed by the police and Baojia. In addition to earnest guidance, it will also strictly enforce it. And each battalion inspection branch dispatched two or three classes to implement supervision of vehicle lighting control in the city. The lighting control of small boats on the Huangpu River and Suzhou River is implemented by the water police for guidance and supervision.

Black Market

The black market has come to an intangible halt due to the opening of the gold certificate market. Starting on the first day of the week, the gold certificates were listed and auctioned. The maturity (periods 1 and 2) and the third and fourth periods were very lively in buying and selling. The opening market price was still stable, and there was little difference compared to the black market price. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the number of transactions gradually increased. On Thursday, due to some kind of flow of encouragement, buyers were absorbed very hard, and the rise suddenly vibrated from this, with each ten taels rushing out of the 30 million yuan mark. Transactions were extremely prosperous. On Fridays and Saturdays, the market price remained high. The maturity bond rose to 3.33 million yuan per tael, and the third and fourth period bonds were seen at 3.22 million yuan to 3.16 million yuan. Silver and public bonds were also steadily increasing.

Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks were continuing to fall on the first three days of the week. On Thursday, due to the sharp loosening of silver, gold certificates rose sharply. The bulls absorbed with all their strength, and retail investors also followed up and bought. The auctioned price gradually increased. Within two hours of the market opening, the three popular stocks of Mei Ya and Company Yarn Factory, and small and medium-sized stocks generally rose to the limit. On Friday, because the holders still had no intention of getting rid of their goods, the market recovered strongly. Before the market closed, the market was weak due to the bulls throwing out. On Saturday, after the rise, it fell again, then rose again, and hovered up and down all day long, but the foundations were solid.

Prices

As for industry and commerce, industry is still unable to increase production due to power relations. Prices of silk, cotton textiles, and daily necessities continue to rise. Rice has been stable in the past week, and the source continues to be uninterrupted. Although the quantity is not abundant, the people's food can be temporarily maintained in its current state. Prices of miscellaneous grains and oil grains have risen slightly due to the soaring price of gold. At this time of year when the old harvest is exhausted and the new harvest has not yet arrived, it is not easy to suppress the current prices of food and daily necessities. The authorities attach great importance to this. Hoarding and speculation will be strictly prohibited.

### Random Thoughts on the Baojia System

— Lu Feng

Mr. Lu Feng, chief writer of the "Xinwen Bao" and member of the Shanghai Municipal Baojia Propaganda Committee, broadcasted to all citizens from the Shanghai Radio Station at 7:00 PM on the 8th. The following is a transcript:

Fellow listeners: Today, at the invitation of the Municipal Baojia Propaganda Committee, I will be discussing the Baojia system. As a citizen of Shanghai, I am closely connected to the Baojia system. Upon inspection, the Shanghai Baojia work, after the incident (likely referring to the war), has achieved practical results and considerable success, but shortcomings are unavoidable. Now, let's discuss it from two perspectives:

Two Shortcomings of the Baojia Work

First: The shortcomings of the Baojia authorities and Baojia workers. Due to various environmental factors, it is difficult to fully satisfy people. On the surface, Shanghai's Baojia work has indeed achieved considerable results, but it is still far from the ideal state.

Second: The citizens themselves lack sufficient understanding of the Baojia work. The understanding of the citizens is particularly important for the Baojia work. If the citizens have a full understanding, it will greatly facilitate the leadership of the Baojia Bureau. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai should deeply understand the mission of the Baojia and must recognize its essence and work diligently.

Therefore, I hope that all citizens will no longer be perfunctory and only seek formality. Upon inspection, the Shanghai Baojia work is also quite tense in terms of air defense work, and air defense work must be carried out through the Baojia. For example, recent works such as well digging and the excavation of air raid shelters, strictly speaking, how many can actually be used? In fact, most of them are in disarray. How can we expect them to be effective?

Authorities Should Take Responsibility

Therefore, every citizen should take responsibility for the Baojia. If the attitude of the Baojia workers is bad, you can report it to the Baojia authorities for correction. You yourselves should not be perfunctory about the Baojia work, lest you mislead others and harm yourselves. Therefore, I sincerely hope that citizens and Baojia personnel will resolutely review and reflect on this point. In addition, when traffic controls of lights are being implemented, you should not arbitrarily leak light. If you do not handle this seriously, it will directly affect the inability to promote the Baojia work, and those who suffer will still be yourselves.

In addition, the most common phenomenon is that the Baojia procedures are cumbersome, which makes the general public deeply dissatisfied with the authorities. Therefore, I hope that the authorities will take care of the citizens and avoid breeding procedures. The citizens themselves should always pay attention, stand in the position of the people, and cooperate with the authorities to correct shortcomings. Otherwise, resentment and meaningless criticism are in vain. From a small point of view, it is a problem with the Baojia; from a larger point of view, it is the decline of the national organization.

Comparing the Baojia work of Shanghai citizens with the Baojia work of the Allied Japanese people in Shanghai, we see that we are far behind. They not only strictly implement the orders of the authorities, but also take the exercises seriously, which enables them to maintain order and achieve satisfactory results. On the other hand, our citizens not only do not handle things seriously, but even perfunctorily shirk their responsibilities. Therefore, the Baojia work is a small matter, but its impact on the country and the nation is a big matter. In short, if there are shortcomings, you should suggest improvements to the authorities. This is the basic problem. Today, I want to emphasize this in particular.

Rights Begin With Performing Obligations

At a time when the current war situation is tense, enemy planes can come at any time, and there is an unavoidable danger of air raids. In the future, we should do things thoroughly and practically. I hope that every citizen will protect their own lives, seek to live and work in peace and contentment, and overcome difficulties. We must attach importance to the Baojia and never shirk responsibility. We must know that rights and obligations, rights only come after performing obligations. This is one of the most important points.

The Social Service and Health Bureau's Children's Home Will Hold a Regular Closing Ceremony

The Children's Home of the Health Bureau is scheduled to hold a closing ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 12th of this month and will be open to the public for tours on the 12th, 13th, and 14th. There will be an exhibition of children's achievements, and performances will be held from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day.

The institute is located at an address on Changde Road and Xingjia Po Road, and was founded in January of the 30th year [likely of the Republic, i.e., 1941]. When the former Public Works Department commissioned the Salvation Army to run a beggar shelter, it was only a beggar children's area. In August of the 32nd year [1943], it was funded by the former First District Office and commissioned to be run by the YWCA, renaming it the Children's Home. In April of this month, it was taken back and run by the Health Bureau.

Generally, wandering street children abandoned by their parents are taken in by the Police Bureau's Rehabilitation Section and transferred to the Children's Home by the Health Bureau's Sixth Section. The institute provides guidance according to the individual children's aptitudes, so that they can become useful talents in the future society. This kind of work is very necessary at present, and it is also the achievement of the institute's arduous management and painstaking efforts.

### The China Leprosy Association Hopes For Final Donations

The China Leprosy Relief Association's current fundraising campaign has raised 14.88 million yuan as of today, exceeding the original target by nearly 5 million yuan. The excellent results are beyond expectations. However, the cost of living has risen, and current prices are four or five times higher than when fundraising began. To make up for this, a minimum of 20 million yuan is required. Therefore, we specifically appeal to all sectors to make a final effort to complete this task. If you would like to donate, you can send it directly to the association at No. 53, Lane 613, Jing'an Temple Road, telephone 126563.
