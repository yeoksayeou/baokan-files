### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Convenes Leaders of Peiping and Tientsin to Hear Reports on the Recovery of Various Areas; Situation in North and Northeast China Increasingly Stable

[United Press International, Peiping, 13th] Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Peiping, from high-ranking diplomatic officials to rickshaw pullers, all have expressed great joy.  It is widely believed that the situation in North and Northeast China will become increasingly stable. Furthermore, since the Chairman has shown concern for the people's suffering and diligently sought out their concerns, the progress of receiving enemy and puppet property and carrying out the work of arresting traitors in Peiping and Tientsin has shown a tendency to become more active after the promulgation of the order. Immediately after arriving in Peiping, the Chairman convened local senior officials to collect reports on the recovery situation in Peiping, Tientsin, and North China. The Chairman arrived on a four-engine plane with Madame Chiang, and is staying at a certain location in the northern district of the city. A helmeted guard stands outside the door, which is the only security measure around Chairman Chiang's residence.

[United Press International, Peiping, 13th] According to reliable sources here today: The purpose of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang's visit to Peiping, in addition to comforting the people and inspecting the situation in North China, is to prepare to welcome the new U.S. Ambassador to China, General Marshall. It is expected that the President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, will also arrive here before Marshall's arrival.

[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] It is widely believed that before the National Government returns to Nanjing, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek may visit other recovered cities. If this happens, he is likely to visit Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou.

[United Press, Tianjin, 13th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Peiping, coupled with the National Army's entry into Shenyang and Changchun by both land and air, leads general observers to believe that the eastern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces will be completely taken over by the National Government within a few weeks. The Communist forces in the Northeast have offered almost no resistance, and the Soviet attitude is also very friendly. Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Forces, flew back to the Northeast Command after consulting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing and Peiping, ordering his subordinates to enter Shenyang. At the same time, the National Army in Peiping also boarded American transport planes to Changchun. While news of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Peiping did not mention Madame Chiang and President Song accompanying him, Major General Rockey, commander of the U.S. 3rd Amphibious Corps, and his chief of staff have been staying in Peiping for several days, presumably to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the old capital has further increased the hope that the North China issue will be resolved quickly and that civil war and bloodshed can be completely avoided. In addition, it is heard that Du Yuming's troops have advanced to 120 li northwest of Shenyang, apparently heading for Harbin. According to the current marching speed, they should arrive in Harbin by Christmas.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] The Mayor of Tianjin, Zhang Ting'e, returned to Tianjin from Peiping on the afternoon of the 13th. Zhang went to Peiping on the 12th and reported the situation of the reception of Tianjin City to Chairman Chiang. The chairman attached great importance to the Dagukou New Port, ordering it to be completed as soon as possible to promote the prosperity and development of the North. After returning to Tianjin today, Zhang convened all relevant parties for talks to formulate plans so that the work can be started immediately.

### Negotiations in Changchun Continue; Chiang Ching-kuo to Fly from Northeast to Peiping to Report

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 13th] Xiong Shihui told visiting reporters: The negotiations in Changchun are continuing, and have not yet come to an end. When the reporter asked when he would go to Changchun, Xiong replied: "Soon, I suppose." A foreign reporter told him that he planned to enter Shenyang via Jinzhou within a week. Xiong expressed doubt about this possibility. It seems that the National Army may not be able to enter Shenyang recently. The National Army scheduled to be airlifted to Changchun has been preparing in Peiping for a long time, but as of the afternoon of the 12th, they had not yet received departure orders.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 13th] According to the Command Headquarters, Chiang Ching-kuo will fly to Peiping to report to the highest authorities on the situation of the Changchun negotiations. It is rumored here that Chiang will take another position as soon as the Northeast reception negotiations are completed. Liu Zeyong, Xinjiang Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs, will continue to handle Northeast diplomacy.

[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] Today's Central News Agency reported: According to the agreement reached between the head of the Chinese military delegation in Changchun and the Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army, the Soviet Army will provide assistance when the National Army receives the cities in the Northeast. This is one of the many agreements obtained in the technical negotiations for the airlift of the National Army to the Northeast. In addition, there are the following points: (1) When the National Army lands, the Soviet Army will be responsible for guarding the airfield; (2) The Chinese Air Force will set up radio stations at various airfields to guide the arrival of transport aircraft; (3) Soviet liaison personnel will accompany the Chinese administrative officials when they receive various cities and regions in the Northeast.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] After arriving at Goubangzi, it is heard that a certain unit of the National Army has continued to advance and will soon arrive in Panyang. Another unit of the National Army has recently arrived at Goubangzi. The troops waiting to be airlifted to Changchun are still being assembled and are ready to depart within days.

[This Newspaper] According to Chongqing Radio on the 13th: "Xinmin Daily" reported that the National Army had entered Shenyang City by land, and also stated that the first transport plane of the airlifted National Army had landed in Changchun.

[United Press International, Peiping, 13th] Chinese authoritative sources here expressed doubt about the news that the National Army has entered Shenyang. They pointed out that in the past two weeks, rumors that Shenyang had fallen into the hands of the National Army were rampant, but most of them lacked any basis. At present, the National Army's entry into Shenyang is awaiting notification from the Soviet side. As soon as it is received, they will set off immediately. However, according to those close to General Du Yuming's headquarters in Jin County, Peiping has not received any news of notification from the Soviet side.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] It is learned that the Preparatory Office of the Northeast Headquarters is scheduled to start moving to Peiping from the 17th.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th] (1) The Communist army in southern Jin attempted to besiege Wenxi City without success, so they shifted their main force and launched a fierce attack on Dongzhen.

### He Siyuan's Talk

Communist Army Destroys Arbitrarily, Shandong Province Suffers Heavy Losses

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] After the Japanese army surrendered, the Shandong Communist army arbitrarily destroyed railways, factories, mines, schools, and other institutions. Chairman He Siyuan recently issued another statement saying: When Japan surrendered, I immediately ordered all troops in the province to first control the city walls, protect transportation, industry, and mining, and gather troops to rush to Jinan for a swift takeover. Unexpectedly, the Communist army launched a fierce attack on our takeover troops and wantonly destroyed cities, industry, commerce, transportation lines, mines, etc. The extent of the destruction is unprecedented in previous years, especially the railway. At the same time, the Communist army is actively expanding its army in order to gain internal chaos, and all men between the ages of fifteen and fifty have been forcibly enlisted. Recently, even children as young as twelve and women between the ages of fifteen and twenty-two have been conscripted into the army. Wherever the Communist army goes, young men and women flee together. Our troops' residences are overcrowded. According to a recent survey in Jinan alone, the schools in various places have been destroyed by the Communist army, and the number of young people who have lost their studies and come to Jinan has reached ten thousand. The number in Qingdao is about five thousand or more. Although this government has done its best to order schools to increase the number of classes and set up remedial classes, it is still difficult to accommodate them. In the past month, nearly 100,000 refugees have fled to Jinan. As the weather gradually turns cold, they are like beggars. The refugees are lingering in the streets, and the situation is very pitiful. This government has launched a fundraising committee organized by all sectors of society and charitable organizations, and has set up five relief stations in the city. According to the minimum calculation, about 150 million yuan is needed. If relief stations are set up universally along the transportation lines, at least 2.7 billion yuan will be needed. In addition, due to the Communist army's blockade of materials and destruction of transportation, the industry and commerce are depressed, and factories have stopped working. As a result, more than 50,000 workers in Jinan City are unemployed. In the Zichuan, Boshan, and Zhangdian mining areas, the coal mining machinery was destroyed by the Communist army, and the workers' dormitories were burned down by the Communist army. More than 100,000 workers are unemployed. In the Zaozhuang, Dawenkou, Xintai, and Laiwu mining areas, more than 120,000 workers are unemployed and are waiting for immediate relief, which has become the most serious problem at present. As for the vast rural areas, the able-bodied men are threatened, and the plows and vehicles are taken away. Even if they are recovered, it will be difficult to restore their vitality in a short time. The loss of eight years of Japanese control is not as terrible as the loss of three months. The various railways, bridges, and culverts have never been as badly damaged as they are today since they were built. The sleepers were burned, the rails were raised and the roadbed was flattened, and even ditches were dug. The poles, wires, stations, and various equipment were all destroyed. Taking railway equipment alone, in these months, it has been repaired and destroyed, repaired and destroyed. According to recent statistics, its value has reached more than 4 billion yuan. The equipment of industrial and mining enterprises has been destroyed by more than 12 billion yuan. The construction of the country for decades with countless manpower and material resources is now destroyed by the Communist army in one fell swoop, which is really heartbreaking. This is only the tangible loss that can be seen. As for the intangible loss suffered by various aspects as a result, it cannot be counted.

### China Textile Construction Company Will Gradually Be Transformed into Private Operation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that after the articles of association of the China Textile Construction Company were approved by the Executive Yuan, Minister Weng concurrently served as chairman of the board of directors and convened a board meeting. President Song personally attended the meeting and gave guidance, solemnly explaining that the government still focuses on private operation for light industry. Therefore, the business term of this company is only set for two years so that it can be transferred in time. However, because there are a large number of Japanese and puppet textile equipment, it must be quickly taken over and resumed work. Therefore, this company will be responsible for the matter first. The method of transferring to private operation was discussed. It was decided that the company should estimate the value of the assets of the Japanese and puppet textile factories as soon as possible, and after the company has been established for one year, it will specify the number of shares based on the head office and branch offices, and sell stocks. All people of the Republic of China nationality can purchase them. After the stocks are sold to more than 50%, a shareholders' meeting will be convened to change to commercial operation. Before the company is changed to commercial operation, the company's business operations will pay the taxes and duties that should be paid to the government according to the same regulations as private textile factories.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Lieutenant General Van Fleet, Commander of US Overseas Forces, wrote to Republican Senator Brewster today, stating that US troops are under orders to fulfill their obligations to China, an allied nation, to end the war against Japan, and to assist in the disarmament of Japanese troops in China. This mission is currently underway, and it is anticipated that US troops will not remain in China after the mission is completed.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] According to news last night, US troops will remain in North China for several more months, unless Marshall can bring about an agreement between the Nationalists and Communists as soon as possible, in which case a different outcome may occur. According to diplomatic sources, the earliest date for US troop withdrawal is after April or May. It is official US policy that US troops will remain in China until all Japanese troops have withdrawn from China. According to reports, there are still 325,000 Japanese troops in North China between the Yellow River and the Great Wall, and 1.3 million Japanese troops in Taiwan and throughout China.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Former US Ambassador to China, Hurley, stated that the recent review of the outline of US policy toward China has shown a positive influence, and this public announcement can also help General Marshall, after he takes office, to promote unity among all parties and factions in China to build a strong, unified, and democratic government. Hurley stated that the announcement of this policy was caused by "controversy," which clearly refers to the uproar caused by his sudden resignation on November 27.

[US News Agency, Washington, 12th] Representative Rogers, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, recently requested that the House conduct another investigation into US foreign policy and the reasons for the resignation of former Ambassador to China Hurley, stating that such a review is indeed necessary to find out whether US foreign policy has been undermined. When Mrs. Rogers expressed her opinion, the House received a report from Secretary of State Byrnes stating: "I have heard nothing about undermining our policy toward China."

US Secretary of State Byrnes, accompanied by Mr. Vincent, Director of the Far East Department, Mr. Cohen, Advisor to the State Department, Dr. Conant, President of Harvard University and an atomic issues expert, Mr. Bohlen, an expert on Soviet affairs, and Colonel Kelly of the Army Department, departed from the National Airport yesterday on a C-54 giant transport plane to Moscow. General Eisenhower, Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, Assistant Secretary of State Dunn, and Mrs. Byrnes saw them off at the airport. They will land in Bermuda, the Azores, Paris, and Berlin to refuel and are scheduled to arrive in Moscow on the evening of the 14th.

British Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to fly to Moscow on the morning of the 14th with Mr. Bennett, Director of the Far East Department, and is expected to stay in Berlin for several hours or overnight, but it is not yet certain whether he will meet with Mr. Byrnes first. In addition, Mr. Charles, Second Secretary of the US Embassy in Iran, will represent Mr. Murray, the US Minister to Iran, at the meeting. British Ambassador to Iran Bullard has already set off from Tehran. The presence of the directors of the Far East Departments of both the US and Britain at the Moscow meeting is sufficient to show that the meeting will focus on the Far East issue. Although China and France will not be attending, the content and decisions of the meeting will be notified to the two allied nations. Truman announced yesterday that the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will be held in Washington in March or April next year, as stipulated during the Yalta Conference. President Truman declined to comment on Mr. Byrnes's trip to Moscow, saying only that it was a long-planned event.

The delegation includes Sir Cadogan (Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), Sir Campbell (Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), Mr. Penner (Director of the Far East Department of the Foreign Office), Mr. Walter (Director of the Reconstruction Department of the Foreign Office), and General Jacob (Representative of the Chief of the General Staff). No scientists are accompanying the British delegation. Regarding the atomic issue, Bevin will consult with Sir Campbell and Sir Cadogan, as the former is a member of the Washington Atomic Bomb Committee and the latter is a member of the Atomic Exploration Committee chaired by Sir Anderson. Although there is no formal agenda for the Moscow meeting, the list of the British delegation indicates a wide range of topics for discussion. Sir Lumley, who is traveling to Moscow as the secretary of the delegation, is a key member of the Western Department of the Foreign Office and is familiar with French affairs. Mr. Hyde, Director of the Southern Department of the Foreign Office, is also in the delegation. If the issue of the situation in the Balkan satellite countries is raised during the meeting, as Washington has proposed, he can provide Bevin with qualified opinions. British Ambassador to Iran Bullard will join the delegation in Moscow. The British delegation will spend a night in Berlin on Friday, at which time Bevin will meet with Sir Strang, the British political representative to the Allied Control Council, and General Robertson, Deputy to Field Marshal Montgomery.

[Reuters, London, 13th] When the British House of Commons debated the loan agreement and the Bretton Woods Agreement yesterday, Financial Secretary Dalton stated that the price of Britain's participation in the war was acquiring a large amount of debt, so it had no choice but to borrow from other countries to maintain financial stability. At the beginning of the war, Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves were approximately 600 million pounds, but by April 1941, only 3 million pounds remained. Although Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves had increased to 450 million pounds by October 31 of this year, foreign debt had also risen to 3.5 billion pounds.

### Editorial: Government Comfort and People's Appeals

Chairman Chiang arrived in Peiping on the 11th, and on the 12th, he announced that the people were allowed to express their sufferings. Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, two central officials, were ordered to comfort the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. They flew to Shanghai on the 11th, and at the tea party at Kang Le Restaurant yesterday, they extended their warmth to the citizens. Representatives from all walks of life were able to speak frankly and without concealment, expressing their wishes. This is a happy event that deserves special mention recently.

The government and the people are originally one body. The government cannot be separated from the people, and the people cannot abandon the government. The government should understand the suffering of the people, and the people should also know the difficulties of the government. Originally, the task of the national revolution was at least to relieve the suffering of the people, and its ultimate goal was to build a free and equal new China. Difficulties and obstacles were also expected by the general public. However, since the Anti-Japanese War, the national government moved westward, and the central authorities and the compatriots in the recovered areas were separated for eight years, far apart from each other. Although they cared and missed each other, it was not as easy to communicate up and down as usual. At the beginning of the Japanese surrender, the takeover work in various recovered areas once caused some misunderstandings and disputes. In fact, half of it was due to the uneven quality of the takeover personnel, and half of it was due to the long separation and lack of understanding. As long as the people can speak honestly and responsibly, and the government can work hard with an open mind, the people's likes and dislikes will not be difficult to become the government's criteria for reform, and the government will still be afraid of not having the people as its backing? We are very happy to hear that government officials have come to comfort the people, and especially to receive the telegram from Chairman Chiang's personal visit to Peiping allowing appeals. This is the central government's remembrance of the recovered areas. This is the government's attention to the people. This is even more auspicious and harmonious for the government and the people to be united.

Government comfort seems to be just a verbal job, but in fact, how can it be just a verbal job? The fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts in the recovered areas have suffered the poison of the enemy and the oppression of the traitors for eight years. The long night is endless, and every day is like a year. Their mental suffering is truly unspeakable. They fully expected that once the day dawned, they could see the light of day again. Who knew that although the light was seen, the mist had not dissipated. Due to excessive expectations, they unconsciously blamed too much. The central government understands the hidden feelings, so there is comfort. The intention of comfort should not be limited to verbal explanation. We believe that Chairman Chiang and the central officials will be able to explore the true public opinion, and resolutely and decisively eradicate the evils and appease the good people from the people's preferences. As long as the government distinguishes right from wrong and rewards and punishes clearly, the people will definitely support the government's facilities wholeheartedly. This is a rigorous reality and the most ideal. Such comfort can truly benefit every old person and never forget the central government's kindness.

Conversely, if we want the government's comfort to truly benefit the people's actual lives, we must first look back at whether our people have the qualifications to receive comfort, and whether they can truthfully and without any increase or decrease express their own sufferings. The country and the nation have suffered a great disaster, fought bloody battles for eight years, and only then have they won. Countless people have been displaced, decapitated, and broken arms. During this period, if they only know how to be cunning and self-interested, and make a fortune from the national disaster, and then make a fortune from the victory, and even do not hesitate to collude with the enemy and oppress the people, such people, even if they are not all punished for a while, should also feel ashamed, how can they transform themselves and mix with the honest and kind old people to receive comfort together? Secondly, since the government has allowed the people to express their sufferings, we the people must, as Chairman Chiang said, have the courage and insight to speak out directly, except for those who make false accusations with malice or create sensationalism. The Chinese people often have a weakness: they are unwilling to argue when they are wronged, and they dare not speak out when they are harassed, thinking that "suffering a loss is a gain," and the people dare not offend the government. "Only state officials are allowed to set fires, and the people are not allowed to light lamps." The people are silent, and the state officials naturally act recklessly. Little do they know that the national government is by no means an autocratic government, and the national government will never "protect each other," and the harassing officials, soldiers, and police will not be allowed to survive in broad daylight. The people, after reading Chairman Chiang's announcement after his visit to Peiping, should know that they have their own responsibilities. They swallow their tears into their stomachs when they are wronged; they blame their own bitter fate when they are harassed. How can such people create a democratic country? Now the government has a democratic style and tries its best to let us speak responsibly. If the people still do not speak out in detail, and do not present the specific facts of being wronged and harassed, and ask for punishment, who can they blame!

In short, we hope that from now on, the government will have measures to comfort the people at any time and any place, and the people will also have the right to appeal to the government at any time and any place until the suffering is completely relieved.

### Chairman Concerned About People's Suffering, Deeply Hopes Shanghai Citizens Will Appeal

Various Circles Welcome Ye and Niu, Two Comfort Ambassadors, Yesterday

Mayor Qian Dajun specially invited representatives from various groups and the public in this city, as well as the heads of party, government, and military agencies, to a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. to welcome Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, the specially appointed comfort envoys from the central government to comfort Shanghai. Over five hundred people were present, including Shen Gongzhan, Xu Jiguang, Du Yuedi, Wang Xiaohuan, Wu Shaoshu, He Dekui, Cheng Cangbo, Xuan Tiewu, Shen Shihua, Li Jilan, Feng Youzhen, Guo Yunguan, Zhao Zukang, Wang Yansong, Yu Songyun, Zha Liangjian, Qin Runqing, Gu Yuxiu, Zhang Yiwan, Yu Zuoting, Jin Runxiang, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Suzhong, Pan Xulun, Liu Hongsheng, Chen Shiquan, Luo Qinghua, Lu Jingshi, Chen Xunyu, Pu Zhengdong, Xu Caicheng, Qian Jianqiu, Mao Zipei, Wang Xinheng, Sun Qinchi, and Kui Yanfang.

Ye Chucang Hopes to Hear Public Opinion

Mayor Qian delivered an introductory speech, followed by a speech by Comfort Envoy Ye Chucang, who said that when Chucang and others left Chongqing, the Chairman instructed, "You must listen to the people more on this trip. I am deeply concerned about the people of Southeast China. You must listen clearly to the sufferings of the people of Southeast China." Today, I saw in the newspaper that the Chairman went to Peiping and set up a petition box at the headquarters, so that the people's opinions can be put into the box so that the Chairman can understand and solve them one by one. Chucang and others are here and do not want to talk too much, but want to ask everyone to talk more. Chucang and others are the petition box, and hope that everyone will express their opinions and report them to the central government as much as possible. Chucang and others hope that everyone's opinions will be realized one by one, except for those that cannot be realized due to difficulties. A veteran of the Jiangsu Revolution once talked about how after a major change, it would take a considerable amount of time to sort things out. During the Xinhai Revolution, the great changes in the country and society were only in the political aspect, and the economy was not affected. The destruction of this war was ten times that of the Xinhai era, and the economic damage was great, so we should pay more attention to economic recovery. Our task will not be completed until all the opinions you provide are implemented. Today is just the beginning.

Wang Xiaolai States the Hopes of the Business Community

Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech, saying that the Chairman is concerned about the price of goods in Shanghai and has often asked Mr. Du Yuesheng to assist the government in finding ways to stabilize prices, which have gradually fallen and are now stable. It is hoped that the scope of private and state-owned enterprises will be determined as soon as possible. It is also hoped that the various property rights will be quickly determined. The enemy and puppet property should be sealed and disposed of by the government, and the people's property should also be returned quickly. The people also hope to subsidize the original factories so that they have the opportunity to revive. In addition, the most important task of winning over the people is to enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, it is hoped that the central government will quickly deal with the communist rebellion, otherwise the country will be unimaginable. We the people unanimously support the central government in making a decisive decision to quell the civil unrest.

Representatives from All Walks of Life Continue to Express Their Sufferings

(1) Bank Representative Xu Jiquan took the floor and reported on the silver group of underground workers in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War and his own assistance to the government in stabilizing the Shanghai financial situation, saying that in the future construction work of our country, the following points should be noted: (1) Stabilize the people's livelihood, (2) Increase production, (3) Consolidate finance, (4) Revive the economy. To revive China, we must first revive Shanghai. To revive Shanghai, we must first revive the economy.

(4) Education Representative Jin Tongyin said that the problem of students dropping out of school has not been completely resolved. He hoped that the central government would increase education funding as much as possible and improve the lives of teachers so that teachers can teach with peace of mind and students also have the opportunity to study.

(3) Student Representative Chen Musheng said that 918 victims have been registered. He hoped that the central government would (a) give the greatest encouragement and guidance to young students who are working hard to participate in national reconstruction and rehabilitation; (b) cultivate talents for reconstruction and rehabilitation. It is hoped that the central government will issue a concrete training plan so that young people have a correct way to serve the country and create a new China based on the Three Principles of the People; (c) hope to have correct leadership in the student movement to assist the party and government in carrying out rehabilitation work.

(4) Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union made four suggestions: (a) Anti-Japanese workers are now unemployed, and it is hoped that the central government will provide relief; (b) After the victory, the enemy and puppet factories were shut down, and the number of unemployed workers suddenly increased by 300,000. Only one-tenth of the factories have resumed work, which has made the unemployment problem of workers extremely serious. It is hoped that the government will provide universal relief.

(5) Farmer Representative Hou Junren said that he hoped that the government would seriously investigate the losses in rural areas and provide practical relief. Special attention must be paid to rural education and the cultivation of talents must be stepped up.

(6) Qian Jianqiu, a representative of the Women's Association, said that she hoped that the central government would pay more attention to supporting the women's movement in the future.

Inspector Cheng Pays Attention to Local Finance

Then, Ye Chucang introduced Cheng Zhongxing, the central government's long-term eyes and ears in Shanghai, Inspector Cheng, who stood up and delivered a speech, presenting four points of the report of what he had seen and heard in Shanghai in the past three months: (1) The takeover problem has been going on for four months, and there are still unsatisfactory places. Researching the crux of the problem, the first is that there was no overall plan at the beginning, the second is that the powers and responsibilities were not clearly divided, and the third is that the takeover personnel were too unskilled. (2) On the issue of local politics, after the establishment of the Inspectorate in Shanghai, it received many complaints, most of which were accusations against the county magistrates and the executive bureaus, accusing them of arbitrarily arresting people and arbitrarily apportioning funds. The people's lives and property were not protected. The reason is that the two special envoys should report to the central government that the central government has paid too little attention to local finance in the recovered areas. The counties along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway need to spend 20 to 30 million yuan per month, while the income is only 4 to 5 million yuan, and even the local education funds are not available, so many problems arise. Now the most important thing is to tighten local spending on the one hand and solve local financial difficulties on the other. (3) The problem of military discipline is extremely serious. The Chairman cannot go to every small county and town to inspect, and the people and officials dare not speak. (4) The five powers of the Five-Power Constitution are extremely important in local politics. The most basic issue in rectifying local politics is to give full play to the effectiveness of the five powers, which is also the minimum requirement of the people.

Niu Yongjian Hopes to Be Informed in Writing

Then, Mayor Qian again asked Comfort Envoy Niu Yongjian to deliver a speech, saying that the report stated that Chairman Chiang had an opinion box in Peiping, hoping that the people would submit their opinions as much as possible to explore the people's feelings. This is very important. Everyone must inform us in writing, and we will report to the central government in detail in the future for selection. We deeply hope that the people's feelings can be communicated to complete our mission and help the cause of national construction.

Mayor Indicates that Winter Defense and Security Are Not Worried

Finally, Mayor Qian reported on the security of the city and municipal facilities, saying that he was willing to briefly report on the things he was in charge of in his position: A. The security of the city, the number of police officers is gradually increasing, and the garrison of troops has also been determined. The number of theft cases has been gradually decreasing since December. The winter defense period is coming soon, and there is absolutely no need to worry about security, which can be comforting to the people of the city. B. Municipal facilities. There are thousands of things to do about municipal construction plans. The way to implement them should be gradually implemented according to the urgency. Now I would like to put forward two points and ask you for advice: (1) After the clean-up campaign was implemented, I often went to various places to inspect, and I often saw very well-built lanes with a lot of garbage accumulated. The high-class residents of the city do not know how to pay attention to cleanliness, and do not report to the Health Bureau and apply for removal. This is something I cannot understand. (2) If a theft case occurs in the city, it should be reported to the nearby police station immediately, and there should be no scruples. I am responsible for the local security and strictly prohibit the illegal behavior of villains. Once it is verified, it will be severely dealt with. As for the subordinates, I have repeatedly told them that if there are one or two derelict personnel, they have been severely punished after verification. I am afraid that my eyes and ears are not complete, and I deeply hope that local groups and all citizens will assist as much as possible so that the implementation of administrative orders can proceed smoothly. The welcome tea party ended in warm applause at about 5 o'clock.

### Hua Sheng Sinks After Hitting a Mine, Salvage Operations Continue

(Our Newspaper's Report) The Hua Sheng, a vessel belonging to the You'an Company and leased by the Minjiang Company, was on its way back to Shanghai from Fuzhou when it struck a floating mine at Litongsha waters, about ten miles from the Wusong estuary, on the morning of the 12th.

Ningbo: Letter Requesting Rectification of Land Reclamation in the Lake

[Dagong Agency] Dongqian Lake in Yin County has more than one million mu of fields, which are relied upon for irrigation. During the Anti-Japanese War, part of it was blocked and reclaimed for farming. Citizens of the county, including Wang Gongyu, believing that this matter concerns the water conservancy of three counties and the food of seven districts, sent letters to the Ningbo Association and relevant parties, requesting rectification.

Dangtu: Puppet Infantry Brigade Disarmed in Dangtu.

### Social Services: Public Benevolence Villa Solicits Donations

— Sun Fuji

The Public Benevolence Villa has been in operation for 32 years, providing burial services for the exposed dead, providing coffins, medical consultations, and establishing charity schools. Its achievements are remarkable. All expenses are dependent on donations from all sectors of society. Recently, with the arrival of winter, the number of beggars dying on the streets due to hunger and cold has been increasing daily. The corpses of prisoners sent by the court are often ordered to be coffined and buried, and the huge cost is conceivable. The stock of materials for coffins is limited, and if they are not purchased and manufactured quickly, it will be impossible to cope. Therefore, a meeting was held yesterday to discuss and decide to invite famous performers and opera singers to broadcast and solicit donations at the Jiancheng Radio Station on the upper floor of No. 60 Glock Road on the 15th and 16th of this month. The radio station has agreed to provide its services free of charge. It is hoped that listeners will be charitable and generous in donating large sums of money to support this good cause.

### Government Loans to Various Factories, First Batch About 900 Million Yuan, Subject to Strict Investigation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding rumors that Shenxin and other factories have obtained huge loans from the central financial authorities, our reporter specifically visited a relevant authority in Ying yesterday to inquire about the truth. It is said that there are many textile factories in this city that urgently need loan assistance, and the amount of loans is not as large as rumored. It is rumored that the amount of the first batch of loans is about 900 million yuan, and the Bank of Communications, which is responsible for the mission of developing national industry, is handling the loans. Beforehand, each factory must undergo strict investigation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to determine whether its products are urgently needed by society, whether it is difficult to obtain raw materials for the products, and whether the factory's organization is sound, before deciding whether to provide assistance. Therefore, it is expected that more than just the five Shenxin factories will receive loans. In addition, the factories that the Ministry of Economic Affairs approves for assistance will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review, and then sent to the Shanghai Branch of the Joint Treasury for final decision by the Joint Treasury Headquarters in Chongqing. It is rumored that the first batch of loan plans was submitted to the Joint Treasury Headquarters two weeks ago and should be approved soon. The approved amount of loans will be proportionally shared by the three banks and two bureaus, and the Bank of Communications will handle the loan procedures. Short-term emergency loan methods will generally not deviate from acceptance discounting and mortgage lending. The highest monthly interest rate on loans is 3.6%, and once the industrial situation improves, construction of the financial and capital markets will begin to guide the entire industry towards healthy development.

Spring and Autumn

### Music Education Movement

— Song ShouChang

Most people think that music can make people happy and comfortable in body and mind, and comfort their spirits, so they regard it as a noble form of entertainment. In fact, the relationship between music and humans is not only on this aspect, it is deeper than entertainment. Because music has a subtle effect, it can change personality, cultivate temperament, and enable human life to improve, so it can also be used as a tool to educate society.

The direct effects on personality change can be roughly divided into three aspects: morality, religion, and art. Among them, morality is achieved through the influence of the personality of great men; religion is obtained through faith in God; art is implemented through direct contact with emotions. The three methods of changing personality are different, but morality and religion cultivate personality by relying on great men and gods, while music directly touches personality with emotion, and its influence is naturally more practical and powerful than morality and religion. If we want to cultivate our temperament and complete our personality, music is indispensable. This fact has been recognized by scholars in the East and West.

Confucius of our country was in the chaotic Spring and Autumn Period. In order to save the people's hearts at that time, he advocated rituals and music. He said: "Be based in poetry, establish in rituals, and complete in music." In Confucius' view, the significance of music is very important. It is not only to educate individuals, but also to govern the country. Western Greek philosophers such as Plato advocated using music to cultivate temperament; Aristotle said that music is a means of pleasant cultivation. The European and American countries today also regard noble music as a necessary item for character cultivation. These are all facts that music is used as a tool to cultivate moral character and cultivate beautiful emotions.

The ancient sages and sages of our country also advocated emphasizing music in governing the country, because rituals are used to regulate external behaviors in life, and music is to regulate the inner spirit. In other words, rituals are formal, and music is spiritual. Xunzi said in his essay on music: "In terms of behavior, music can broaden the will, make the appearance dignified, the ranks correct, and the advances and retreats orderly... It can make the ears and eyes sharp, the mind and heart peaceful, change customs and habits, and make the world peaceful." In his view, rituals and music are mutually dependent. Where the power of rituals is insufficient, music can be used to complete its effect.

The relationship between rituals and music is so close. I hope that in the sound of advocating a new life, we will actively carry out the music education movement.

A Historical Short Story

The early summer evening was gorgeous, the sky was a brilliant blue, with clouds of light yellow, light red, and purple, so evenly and harmoniously matched. Jing Ke was walking on the edge of the market, looking up at the sky for a while, then suddenly lowered his head and sighed. He seemed to have a bellyful of depression that he couldn't express.

Just as he walked into the street and was about to turn the corner, Tian Guang came walking towards him. Tian Guang was hunched over, his face also gloomy. He was old and walked with some difficulty, but he still looked strong. When Jing Ke saw him, he hurried forward and said:

"Scholar Tian, I haven't seen you for a few days, why do you look so worried?"

"I'm afraid we all have such a mood, your face doesn't look good either."

Jing Ke couldn't help but smile, but it was a bleak, bitter smile. He immediately asked, "What is the definitive news about the Qin state sending troops to attack Qi and Chu?"

"Our Yan state is certainly in danger. The King of Han has already been captured. Qin troops are attacking Qi to the south and Zhao to the north. The fate of Yan state is very terrible. It seems too late now to 'unite vertically'."

"That's the sentence, 'uniting vertically' is too late," Jing Ke said. "Then what is the scholar's opinion?"

Tian Guang sighed infinitely, saying, "I am old and weak and incompetent. Although I am eager to serve the country, what can I do? Today, Prince Dan actually discussed the country's major plans with me. I did not presume to recommend you. Please go to see the prince tomorrow. I think the prince will definitely value you."

"It is a soldier's duty to serve the country with his life," Jing Ke said passionately and generously. Tian Guang stared at him deeply for a while, and moved, he stretched out his right hand and patted Jing Ke's shoulder and said:

"Then let it be! The survival of Yan depends on you brave men who are willing to sacrifice."

Jing Ke watched the old man walk away before turning to leave. He was still thinking about how he would see Prince Dan the next day. The country is in such a critical situation, and the tyrannical Qin State does not need much strength to destroy several small countries. Now that there is no chance for the small countries to unite, we must think of the most direct and effective way to save Yan from the imminent disaster.

He walked and thought like this. He had already reached the entrance of a small wine shop, a place where Jing Ke often came to drink. Today, he happened to meet Gao Jianli drinking here. He raised his head and saw Gao Jianli and the dog butcher both holding wine glasses and drinking heartily. A large bowl of steaming dog meat was placed on the table. It must have been that the dog butcher had killed a fat dog today, and the boss's wife had cooked it in advance. (To be continued)

Cultural Communications

### Cultural Association Branch to Be Established Soon

According to news from Chongqing, the Shanghai Branch of the Literary and Art Association, since Xia Yan came to Shanghai to launch it and announced a public letter supporting the reorganization, has matured after several gatherings and can be established in mid-month. It is heard that Zheng Zhenduo, a veteran of the orthodox literary world, will preside over it.

The deputy supplement of the Chongqing version of the Peace Daily is now edited by Wang Pingling. The Shanghai version is also internally determined to be Feng Hezi (Feng Zi) combined with Xie Bingying for the Han version, a quite strong lineup.

Xie Bingxin, due to a publishing dispute over "About Women," recently told reporters: "It is difficult not to write, and it is difficult to write. What should I do?"

Zhang Henshui is still living at No. 23 Taozigou, South Hot Spring, Chongqing, and has no intention of going to Peiping or Shanghai for the time being. A certain large newspaper in Shanghai that will soon be published is currently negotiating with him for a long novel. (Meng Yun)

### Song of Li Ling

— Gu YiQiao

The Xiongnu invade Han lands,
The general goes out to conquer.
The Chanyu's army is hundreds of thousands,
Their force like a torrential rain;
I have six routes of troops,
Sure to meet at dawn,
Five routes lose their way,
Sighing and gazing at the stars.
I have five thousand men,
Whose bravery can compare?
Tramping, much exhausted,
Neither horse nor foot can fight.
Waving my arm, I call to my soldiers,
The soldiers all ask for battle,
Drawing my sword, I point at the Xiongnu,
The barbarians are surprised by me,
Heaven and earth are enraged,
Killing enemies, their heads are light;
Many soldiers drink blood,
The Chanyu wants to retreat.
Who knew there'd be a Han traitor,
Revealing my true strength,
Troops exhausted, arrows all gone,
Food depleted, no reinforcements,
How to get Shen Baoxu,
To weep and beg the Qin court.
Alas, I am captured and humiliated,
Wanting to repay Han's kindness, I only leave behind a name,
Thinking it better to die standing than live in shame,
Who will understand my faithful heart?

### Don't Be an Inheritor of Crimes

— Wu RenZhi

During the war, the enemy and puppets occupied many public and private properties of our people. These properties have been taken over by various government agencies at the same time as enemy and puppet properties. Because they were taken over separately, the situation was quite chaotic at the beginning. After several high-ranking officials came and made several adjustments and unifications over the past three months, the handling mechanism has gradually been put on track. However, the receivers, custodians, and even the current users still do not feel the need to be dealt with urgently in their minds and actions. They only know that things received from the enemy and puppets should be subject to the same fate. They do not distinguish between enemy public property, enemy private property, puppet public property, puppet private property, or property seized by the enemy and puppets. This serious mistake is enough to cause people's complaints, resentment, and even exceed the emotions of complaining and hating the enemy and puppets in the past. Why? People expected to be occupied by the enemy and puppets, but the current encounters are unexpected, so the resentment is deep.

If a bandit robs the people's things, and you drive away the bandit and recover the stolen goods for the people, the people will of course be very grateful to you. But if you think that "this thing was taken from the bandit by me, of course I will use it," or come up with a way to "let me use it for a while and then talk about it," even the most docile people will probably complain and hate you!

I am afraid that there are many such things. In the eyes of someone like me with a very small range of social contact, there are two cases: One is the school building of XX Middle School, watching others use it, and there is no hope of recovering it, but instead borrowing houses elsewhere to start school. One is the XX Grand Theater (originally the property of a British-籍 Chinese XX), which was taken over by a handwritten note and turned into a movie theater. What culture, what school education, what drama movement, these theories that have long been regarded as insignificant, we will not talk about them for the time being. But this is not enemy property, not puppet property, this is the school property of the people, the private property of allied nationals. The former occupation was the crime of the enemy and puppets! Now inheriting and using it, we should consider not becoming an inheritor of crimes!

Commercial News

### Powerful Players Continue to Acquire, Gold Prices Rise Continuously

Gasoline Payment Stimulates Buying Interest

Yesterday, the shorts tried to fight to the death, continuing to put pressure on the market. The opening price fell from 685,000 to 672,000. When the chips were exhausted, retail investors absorbed them at lower prices. After that, it revolved upward. Banks from the Northern Gang and Sichuan Gang came to buy, and then broke through the 700,000 mark. A certain short firm added to its position, and the floating longs sold off. After that, the longs and shorts fought each other with all their might inside and outside the 700,000 mark. Until noon, they were still struggling around 690,000. Later, the Jin and Gan gangs continued to add, and the 700,000 mark was firmly established. At the same time, rumors spread that the exchange rate against the US dollar was fixed at 1,500, so it rose sharply. Although there were some twists and turns due to the banks throwing out at high prices, the result was that because the US dollar was extremely scarce, the red finished at the highest price, an increase of 35,000 compared with the previous close. The trend is to move forward courageously and continue to move forward. It can be seen that the banks are constantly absorbing gold in the gold market, and the chips have been swept into the hands of powerful players. This newspaper has repeatedly mentioned that various unreasonable speculations in the market, discussions after drinking and eating, are fabricated out of thin air, and there is no factual proof. On the contrary, gasoline payments are not only above the free market price, but also exceed the church exchange rate by a lot. Therefore, there is a rumor of 1,500 to 1 this afternoon. In fact, an excessively low exchange rate will cause domestic factories to be on the verge of bankruptcy, and an excessively high exchange rate is not welcomed by the Allied side. Everything should wait for the authorities to decide carefully. Therefore, after the surge, it is feared that it will turn into consolidation. The high price of gold jewelry in silver shops is 78,000, the price of silver is still 600 yuan, the price of silver dollars is about 430, and the discount rate is still between 10 cents and 12 cents.

Foreign Currency: The US dollar was always firm yesterday under the manufacturers' cash-out purchase. The lowest was 1,075 yuan, and then it gradually pulled up. By noon, it had broken through the 1,100 yuan mark. Gasoline payments continued to be paid today, and the closing price was about 1,425 yuan (the legal tender price of 400 yuan per 28 cents of US dollar). There were rumors in the market that the exchange rate against the US dollar was set at 1,500 to 1. The buying interest in the US dollar, which was already in short supply, was further stimulated, and the price soared, closing at the peak, an increase of 70 yuan compared with the previous close, and the buying trend is still rampant, and the asking price is still increasing. Hong Kong dollars are limited by the environment, although they are firm, they still feel constrained. As a result, the old goods are 10 yuan better than the previous close, and the new goods are 2 yuan better. Australian pounds are worth about 2.6 US dollars, and rupees are 27 or 28 cents.

Securities: The public bond market was confused yesterday, with many twists and turns in the middle. Although it was once pulled up due to the activity of buyers at the end, the result was still softer than the previous close. However, Class D bonds rose slightly, and the difference continued to narrow. The market for foreign stocks was sluggish because the market closed earlier. As a result, large stocks fell slightly compared with the previous close, while small stocks rose slightly.

Rice and Grain: The rice market is stable in both sales and consumption. The situation is stable, and Zhongguan has risen slightly by one or two hundred yuan. The same is true for flour. Oil prices have become more active due to the transfer of store sales to stocks, and have rebounded by one or two thousand yuan. The soybean market has become a stagnant market. Raw peanuts are sold as soon as they arrive, and the rise and fall are uncertain. Bean cake is fair, and cotton cake is sluggish due to the recent decline in fuel prices.

Yarn Market: It continues to see a surge, because gold prices have repeatedly increased, and there are rumors of more favorable foreign exchange. Therefore, the customer gang's buying interest has increased, and the price has gradually increased. 16-count Guangming yarn opened at 270,000 and gradually rose to 300,500. The closing price of 20-count ordinary goods rose from 380,000 to 400,000, both of which increased by 40,000 compared with Saturday. There is demand for fine yarn and thread, but holders are hoarding and not releasing them, so the rise is even more fierce, rising by about 60,000 to 70,000. The trend is still prosperous, but it must be supported by gold prices and actual sales.

Wool: The factory's production is pending, and it takes time to import foreign goods. As a result, the inventory of better old-fashioned fine wool is lacking in the same industry, but sales have also decreased due to environmental factors. It has become a situation of both supply and demand shortage. It is difficult to increase the price, and it is difficult to fall. If the transportation becomes smooth one day, and the customer gang starts to search and handle it, the future is still more promising.
