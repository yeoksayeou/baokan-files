### Special Attack Units of the Japanese Army and Navy Continue Fierce Attacks on Enemy Warships; Japanese Forces on Ryukyu Island Suddenly Recapture High Ground

Tokyo, 11th (Chuten News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Army and Navy special attack units launched fierce attacks on American warships in the seas west of Okinawa between the night of the 9th and dawn of the 10th. Due to the late hour, the results of the battle are yet unknown, but according to the situation observed from land, the enemy has already suffered heavy damage. On the other hand, Japanese naval special attack units bravely engaged in hand-to-hand combat with American warships on the seas west of Kadena, achieving the results of destroying one destroyer, two large torpedo boats, and three large columns of fire.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese forces in the western coastal area of the Ryukyu main island launched a fierce counterattack on the enemy entering the Kazu area on the 9th, driving them back to Height 85 south of Oyama. Furthermore, on the night of the 9th, a large force launched a surprise night raid, engaging in fierce battles throughout the night. By approximately 9:00 AM on the 10th, the enemy was completely driven out, and the high ground was recaptured. On the east coast, the enemy attacked Height 155 southwest of Tsuba with a strong force. The high ground was briefly captured by the enemy on the evening of the 9th, but Japanese forces stationed in the area launched a fierce counterattack, finally retaking it that night. On the other hand, in the Nago and Kin Nago areas, the enemy attempted to land on the evening of the 7th with 130 tanks and approximately 5,000 troops, but the stationed Japanese forces disabled 33 of their tanks. Also, on the morning of the 8th, the enemy landed one battalion of infantry on Tsuken Island, and it appeared that another battalion was added at noon.

### Nearly 300 Enemy Warships Sunk or Destroyed Around Okinawa; Aircraft Carrier Essex Has Been Sunk

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Enemy forces around Okinawa have not only landed on the island itself, but have also landed on Kerama Islands, Kamiyama Island, Mae Island, Tsuken Island, and others. A large number of troops are currently striving to reinforce and replenish their forces, but their warships have also repeatedly suffered heavy damage from fierce Japanese attacks. In the two weeks since the enemy's invasion of Okinawa, the Japanese side has sunk or destroyed 287 enemy warships, a great achievement. This is only the preliminary stage of the Japanese side's general offensive, and the enemy's losses will be even greater when the second and third phases are decided. The enemy's mobile force operations in the Pacific have been completely defeated around Okinawa. It is foreseeable that the Japanese Army and Navy will further exert their full strength to continue inflicting heavy damage.

Ryukyu Islands, Somewhere on the Battlefield, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In the fierce attacks on the enemy's mobile forces between the 6th and 7th, subsequent investigations have revealed that the enemy ships sunk included three aircraft carriers: the escort carrier *Langley* converted from a cruiser, the standard carrier *Essex*, and the auxiliary carrier *Liscome Bay*.

[Mr. P, Military Authority, Discusses Reasons for Japan's Inevitable Victory

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a certain military authority: The final victory of this Greater East Asia War will undoubtedly belong to Japan. I make this determination for three reasons: Firstly, Japan has decided to adopt "bleeding tactics." Originally, serving in the military for one's country in modern warfare often does not require sacrificing one's life. The Anglo-American concept of military service is merely to use extremely precise aircraft or tanks to go to war, with the hope of a safe discharge in mind. In other words, Anglo-Americans can fight for their country, but they cannot sacrifice for their country. However, this time Japan is using "bleeding tactics" against Anglo-America, causing Anglo-America to bleed heavily everywhere. Anglo-Americans are not afraid of the loss of military equipment, but they are afraid of the sacrifice of blood and life. According to the US authorities' announcement, as of recently, more than one million people have been sacrificed, and the UK is also above this number. Therefore, in the past six months, the Anglo-American concept of war has been shaken, especially the soldiers, who feel panic towards the "bleeding tactics" they never expected. Secondly, Japan can defeat the many with the few. Although Anglo-America may be able to land 100,000 troops on Japanese soil, Japan will be able to use millions of troops domestically to invite and attack them. The war of the few against the many on various islands will inevitably find its opposite phenomenon on Japanese soil. If Anglo-America lands in China, it will inevitably suffer the same fate. We must not forget the strong forces of the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, which number approximately several million, and various military supplies have already begun to be self-sufficient locally. Thirdly, Japan will definitely use long-term tactics to defeat Anglo-America. Japan has decided to adopt a long-term strategy since several years ago, and various military factories are located in Manchuria, the Chinese mainland, and the South Seas. The Japanese army will definitely be able to use this to counter Anglo-America's counterattack. The only things Anglo-America can use for a counterattack in East Asia are aircraft and warships, but these two items are not enough to make a final decision. The most important thing for victory is to attack the enemy country with a superior army, but this operation is extremely difficult for Anglo-America. After a long-term war, the Anglo-American people will inevitably feel war-weariness and will doubt the purpose of the war, and will eventually seek a peaceful way out.

### Japan to Convene Night Cabinet Meetings at Any Time

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Suzuki Cabinet, in view of the current state of the war, urgently needs to decide on major policies for accomplishing the decisive battle. It was decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 10th that in addition to regular cabinet meetings, night cabinet meetings and cabinet member discussions will be convened at any time. The reason for choosing the nighttime is that during the day, the ministers of each ministry are devoting their full efforts to carrying out administrative affairs, and they are relatively free only at night, so that they can take advantage of this quiet time to discuss the fundamental policies that the government should implement.

### Decision on Personnel for Executives of the Greater Japan Political Association

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The selection of personnel for the executives of the Greater Japan Political Association, which had been carefully considered by President Minami, was decided at the general affairs meeting on the 10th, with President Minami appointing each person separately.

### Japanese Lieutenant General Yasui Enters Cabinet, Appointed Minister of State; All 24 Parliamentary Vice-Ministers Replaced

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki, in order to fill the number of Ministers of State, strengthen the cabinet lineup, and seek close liaison with all parties, requested Minister of the Army Anami to recommend suitable cabinet members. Minister of the Army recommended Yasui Fujio, Reserve Army Lieutenant General and Commander of the Second Division. The Prime Minister held a cordial discussion with Lieutenant General Yasui on the afternoon of the 11th, and as a result, he agreed to enter the cabinet. At 5:30 PM, the appointment ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace, which has been announced by the Japanese Information Bureau.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese parliamentary vice-ministers all submitted their resignations at the same time as the resignation of the Koiso cabinet. The government dismissed twenty-four officials, including Matsuda, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the 11th. However, the government authorities retain the parliamentary vice-minister system, and the selection of personnel and activities will be reformed in the future, with the assistance of the Greater Japan Political Association, and will appoint young talents.

### Strict Prohibition of Speculative Activities

Although the Shanghai market maintains a calm appearance, inside, due to the extreme activities of speculators, gold and stocks continue to soar. If this is allowed to continue, the prices of various commodities will inevitably rise further, and the people's livelihood will be increasingly on the verge of crisis. Not only will serious adverse effects be stirred up economically, but painful problems will also occur ideologically and politically. Therefore, we particularly urgently hope that the authorities will fundamentally rectify this malpractice with decisive measures.

Those who speculate on gold and stocks mostly have a hostile attitude towards the Axis powers ideologically or politically. They not only act as intermediaries, constantly causing capital to flow into the anti-Japanese war zone, but also directly create an atmosphere of capital flight. The more the banknotes depreciate, the more depressed the Shanghai economy becomes, and the more the government's credibility decreases, the more successful their speculation will be. Currency stability, price stability, and government stability are completely contrary to the interests of speculators. Speculators are gloatingly hoping for the disadvantage of the national government and the crisis of Japan, thus believing in the advantage of the enemy country, which is inevitable. At the very least, it can be said that rumors about the unfavorable war situation are all being created by them. It is especially worth noting that a considerable amount of gold in Shanghai is flowing in from the anti-Japanese war zone, and a considerable amount of customs gold units are also increasingly flooding the Shanghai area. These two facts are the enemy's attempt to use gold and customs gold units to disrupt Shanghai's finances, so they should not be allowed to continue even for a moment.

Strictly prohibiting speculation and purging the anti-national attitude of the financial community require both suppressive measures and financial policies. First of all, the police need to strictly prohibit their actions and supervise financial institutions to block the source of speculative funds. Looking at past crackdowns on speculation, although the police have taken decisive actions, the financial policies have never been coordinated with them. Therefore, speculative behavior has never been suppressed, but this unreasonable phenomenon must be corrected immediately. When the economic police begin to operate, the financial institution inspection office of the Central Reserve Bank should also begin to operate immediately and should never condone such hostile speculative elements.

Some people say that even if the crackdown on speculation is enforced, prices will not fall without building up production. Or some people say that speculative behavior is inevitable if no measures are taken to address idle capital. Both of these statements are very reasonable. However, conversely, as long as speculative behavior does not stop, it will be impossible for funds to flow into production, and thus measures to address idle capital will also be ineffective. Therefore, instead of going around in the above-mentioned vicious circle, it is better to cut the Gordian knot and stop speculative activities. If we want today's price and currency countermeasures to succeed, we should first start by cracking down on speculation.

Those who do not hope for the prosperity of their own country, do not care about the victory of their own country, and only seek their own private interests, these speculative elements should be suppressed. This can not only guide the economic world to the right track but also has great significance politically and ideologically. If this major issue is neglected under the pretext of the difficulty of implementing policies, then it cannot be said that it is fulfilling the mission entrusted by the country. (Translated from the editorial of the Continental News on April 8).

### The Key to Solving the Problem of Idle Capital

— Yangtze River Person

The problem of advancing capital has now reached the most serious stage. Today, this newspaper has already pointed out in another column that hostile speculation in gold, public bonds, stocks, etc. has become a frightening phenomenon. Since the enemy planes came to bomb on the 2nd of this month, stocks, which had once shown a decline, have begun to create new records of soaring prices. What is gratifying is that only rice and other major materials still maintain their usual stable state, but we must not ignore the recent trend of speculation in Shanghai's financial community because of this. Now we must use a calm mind to face the extremely crazy speculative market in order to break the current dark and chaotic situation.

A part of the most heinous and hostile elements who seek happiness in the suffering of the people are carrying out speculative work with relish, which has already aroused the anger of Chinese public opinion, condemnation, and accusations. The argument against speculative behavior can be seen when such hoarding incidents occur in the rice market, but now it can still be said that it is the target of public opinion's scathing criticism. For example, the editorials of *Shen Bao* "Report Speculators Disrupting the Market" (31st), "Speculation and Idle Capital" (April 5th), "Cracking Down on Speculation and Guiding Idle Capital Simultaneously" and the editorials of *Xinwen Bao* "Three Discussions on the Gold Price Problem" (April 3rd), "The Key to the Price Problem" (April 4th), "Expedite the Elimination of Speculative Activities" (April 5th), "Action is More Important Than Words" (April 6th), all focus on demanding that the national government immediately crack down on speculation in gold and securities with decisive measures. According to this trend of public opinion, it is also clear at a glance that the problem is extremely serious. If the national government authorities claim that "there is no way" and do nothing, then they will drift with the tide and deal with the matter perfunctorily, and the hostile speculation that is active behind the scenes in Shanghai's economy will definitely move towards an increasingly acute stage.

There are many ways to guide the idle capital that is flooding the speculative sphere, but the most important of them is to quickly and decisively implement planned rural loans. In the past, only Huaxing Commercial Bank and Jiaotong Bank were engaged in rural loans, but if only these two banks are handling it, rural finance cannot be flexible. We must quickly research a way to closely combine Shanghai's national capital with the farmers who are groaning in financial difficulty. We are not asking for this as a vague and abstract discussion. For example, Shanghai needs rice and farmers need money. If Shanghai's national capital is willing to show sincerity, then rural loans have objective conditions that can be fully realized. According to the report of those who recently returned to Shanghai after completing purchasing work in the interior, farmers are no longer eagerly asking about particularly cheap necessities as they used to, because of the lack of finance. It is precisely these farmers who need to be supplied with idle capital. A financial countermeasure of cracking down on one side and guiding on the other has now reached a time when the authorities must quickly decide and implement it.

### Japanese Elite Forces Completely Occupy Laohekou with a Three-Pronged Attack; Simultaneously Fighting in the Hanshui Area

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The press department of the Allied Japanese Expeditionary Army in China announced at 3:00 PM on April 11th: Units of the Japanese Army in North China occupied the Laohekou airfield, a forward base for US Air Force bombing of Japan, on March 27th. After that, they searched for and pursued the main force of the Chongqing Fifth War Zone Army and completely occupied Laohekou on April 8th. To coordinate with the above-mentioned battle, units of the Japanese Army in Central China are fighting in the Hanshui area.

### Situation of Laohekou and Okinawa; Lieutenant Colonel Shimada Explains to Reporters

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Expeditionary Army in China held a meeting with reporters in the capital at its press department at 4:30 PM on the 11th. Lieutenant Colonel Shimada explained the situation of Laohekou and Okinawa Island as follows:

Situation of Laohekou

The Japanese Army in North China began attacking Laohekou at dawn on March 7th, and completely occupied it by 4:00 PM on the 8th. Laohekou was the location of the headquarters of the Chongqing Fifth War Zone Army. Therefore, when the Japanese Army began attacking, the Chongqing Army on the west side of the Hanshui River mobilized with two divisions to counterattack, but the Japanese Army occupied Laohekou completely in one day. Currently, the Chongqing Army west and north of Laohekou is preparing to counterattack, while the Japanese Army is pursuing the defeated Chongqing Army of the Fifth War Zone, aiming to annihilate and strike them. Furthermore, the Japanese Army in Central China is also coordinating with this, attacking from Jingmen, occupying Xiangyang, and then advancing along the Hanshui River towards Laohekou to flank the Chongqing Army. Overall, the morale of the Chongqing Army is extremely low in this campaign. Laohekou was a forward base for the Chongqing Air Force in the Northwest. Due to the loss of Laohekou, the Chongqing US Air Force's Northwest forward base has been lost, and the Chongqing Fifth War Zone and the US Air Force's air raids on the Pinghan Line and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River will be reduced. Economically, Laohekou is a distribution center for materials in northern Hubei and a transportation hub. Therefore, the occupation of Laohekou will greatly benefit the future purchase and transportation of materials.

Situation of Okinawa Island

The battle of Okinawa Island is as announced by the Japanese Headquarters. The enemy troops landed in the narrowest area in the middle of Okinawa Island. After landing, the enemy troops divided their forces into two branches, one heading north and one heading south to attack. Those attacking to the south were the enemy's 7th, 24th, and 96th divisions, and those attacking to the north were the enemy's 1st, 2nd, and 33rd Marine divisions. In the past, the fighting in the Okinawa Island area was mainly naval warfare. The land area is narrow, so there were no major battles. According to the Japanese Headquarters' announcement, the Japanese Army's casualties in land battles were only 400, which shows that the scale of the war is not large. However, future land battles may become full-scale, which means that the enemy's losses will also increase. Furthermore, the Japanese special attack units are still fiercely attacking the enemy's mobile forces. Based on their experience of heavy losses on Iwo Jima, the enemy is making every effort to defend against the Japanese special attack units' suicide attacks in the Okinawa operation. However, the Japanese Army will continue to carry out "bleeding warfare" based on the spirit and tactics of the Battle of Iwo Jima, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.

### Military Affairs Commission Commemorates General Rong Ziheng

### Center of Western Front War Shifts to the Leine River Area; Hanover and Gottingen Have Fallen

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - As the anti-Axis forces advancing on Berlin from both the east and west intensify, the European war situation is becoming increasingly critical. While the Montgomery troops on the Western Front reached the Elbe River, the Soviet army on the Eastern Front is about to launch a general offensive on Berlin. The center of the German war effort has shifted from the Weser River to the Leine River. The US Ninth Army stormed into the city of Hanover on the 10th and completely occupied it after fierce street fighting. After occupying Gottingen, the anti-Axis forces expanded southward, apparently intending to cross the Leine River, shifting from Hanover via Hildesheim to the Gottingen area. Currently, Brunswick and Magdeburg are the targets of the anti-Axis forces' attack. US armored units reached the highway between Hamburg and Hanover.

### A Major Battle Will Occur on the Banks of the Warta River

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports that a large number of Soviet reinforcements have concentrated near the Benzin-Guben area. In addition, a large number of troops have moved to the Kustrin area north of Frankfurt. It is expected that the Soviet army intends to advance north and south of Berlin with two wings in order to achieve its encirclement.

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to German front-line news, the main German force is concentrating on the west bank of the Warta River to prevent the Soviet attack on the front of Berlin. The left wing of the Konev army and the Air-Yo Montego army advancing northwest of Slovakia are cooperating in an attempt to strike jointly with the US army on the western front from the Munich area. The battle on the Warta River is becoming increasingly urgent.

### German Troops Withdraw from Vienna

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to German front-line news: German garrison troops launched fierce street fighting in the center of Vienna.

### Further Discussion on Suppressing Speculation

Some time ago, I briefly discussed the issues of suppressing speculation, guiding idle capital, and the way out for industry. Now, after reading the editorial "Strictly Prohibit Speculative Activities" in the *Continental News* on the 8th of this month (see today's edition), in addition to expressing my deep agreement, I still have more to say, so I will elaborate further as follows:

The recent rampant rise in gold bars, stocks, government bonds, foreign currencies, and other commodities in the city market is the result of speculators' activities. One type is active and proactive speculation, using the creation of political and economic rumors as a means and plundering huge profits in a "big fish eats small fish" manner as the goal. Therefore, it is often not easy to distinguish between it and political speculation. The other type is passive speculation, which actually accounts for the vast majority. These people have considerable assets in their hands. Their goal is to maintain and increase the actual value of their assets in this volatile situation. Therefore, when hoarding is profitable, they throw out their currency and exchange it for goods. If gold bars and stocks are profitable, they throw out their hoarded goods and move to gold bars, stocks, etc.

However, no matter what kind of speculation it is, when it forms a wave and reaches its peak, it is the same in terms of disrupting the financial market and harming the social economy. Although speculators do not necessarily have a political background subjectively, they will create results that benefit the enemy objectively, which cannot be ignored. In the report the other day on the talks of economic consultant Ogura, he said: "Speculation and hoarding are important reasons for high prices... If the atmosphere of curbing speculation and hoarding permeates the economic world and gradually extends to other aspects, there will definitely be good results shown." Therefore, the urgent task for the future is still how to suppress and eliminate the atmosphere of speculation and hoarding. If the methods of suppressing speculation and reducing speculation cannot be thoroughly implemented, then today we will drive the speculative wave to the gold bar and stock market, and tomorrow we will drive them back to the daily necessities market. In this way, the economic malaise will only sink into despair, and things such as stabilizing people's livelihood, materializing combat power, and cooperating with the allies will all become empty talk.

The recent speculative wave has reached its peak. Its disruption of the financial market and harm to the social economy are extremely serious. It is also sufficient to induce the rise of other prices, threatening the people's livelihood, and the crisis should not be underestimated. Let me give two examples to illustrate: The paper merchant Wang has accumulated assets of more than tens of millions of yuan due to speculative profiteering over the years. This time, he speculated on shares of the American Asian Silk Factory, losing tens of millions of yuan within eight hours, and being short tens of millions of yuan even after liquidating all his assets. The exchange is currently handling the aftermath. Someone in a certain commercial bank and a giant in the yarn factory industry is said to have temporarily organized a speculative group, a bullish company, with a capital of 500 million yuan, and has already made a huge profit of 800 million yuan in this wave. In such cases, the losers are not to be pitied, but the winners will inevitably make one family laugh while ten thousand families cry.

Therefore, speculators who start waves are the public enemy of the general public. If they are not completely eliminated, the wave will be bigger and the suffering will be more severe. On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will use strict laws to investigate and punish speculators. On the other hand, we hope that the public will be responsible for reporting speculators as much as possible. The authorities should keep the identity of the informants confidential.

### The Police Bureau Actively Maintains Order at Train Stations

In response to a request from the city's Population Evacuation Committee to take effective measures to maintain order and discipline at the wharves, the Municipal Government has instructed the Security Command and ordered the Police Bureau to comply.

Passenger inspection procedures should be simplified to facilitate evacuation. Upon receiving these orders, the sub-bureaus have investigated the organization and operations of automobile and steamboat transport companies within their jurisdictions, and have strengthened the management of boat and train ticket sales to ensure reasonableness and absolutely prohibit unauthorized price increases or black market sales, which will be investigated and dealt with. The Shanghai Railway Station and the Changning Road and Huangpu sub-bureaus have increased the number of officers stationed to maintain order at the railway stations and wharves.

### Overview of Dongting Xishan

—Province One

Dongting Xishan is an island in Tai Lake, closest to Suzhou, and therefore under the jurisdiction of Wuxian County. Because it is located in the middle of Tai Lake and free from the dangers of war, it has always been regarded as a paradise. The fact that the Municipal Population Evacuation Committee has designated this mountain as an evacuation area is very appropriate.

Although Xishan is named "Mountain," it actually has many open spaces. The houses are all built on flat ground, and there are particularly many tall buildings, most of which were built during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty. Unfortunately, in recent years, local unscrupulous people, blinded by private interests, have demolished houses to sell old materials. However, the demolished houses account for less than one-tenth of the total, and the vast majority of those that remain intact are still the absolute majority. The streets in the mountain are all paved with bricks and are quite clean. The small roads are dirt roads, and they are inevitably slippery on rainy days.

Administrative Region

Xishan is listed as the thirteenth district of Wuxian County, with a district office. The current district head, Wang Renjie, is from Hunan and is the most recent appointee. It is divided into two towns and eight townships, namely Donghe and Xiaoxia towns, and Huili, Zhenxia, Lucun, Qianwan, Hanzhi, Dongyuan, Litang, and Qixian townships. Among them, Donghe Town is the most lively and the safest. The district office and the Xishan Directly Subordinate Outpost of the Wuxian County Police Bureau are located here, forming the political center of Xishan. West of the town, beyond Wangyan Ridge to the Quan Shimenkou, are the Baoshan and Shicheng coal mining companies, which produce about 1,000 tons of coal per month. The Suzhou Electric Plant relies entirely on this for its needs.

Products

Xishan has a circumference of about ninety li and a current population of 30,000. It has 8,985 mu of cultivated land, 20,027 mu of land, 42,617 mu of mountains, and 3,874 mu of marshland. The main products are fruits, such as loquats, waxberries, pomegranates, oranges, tangerines, peaches, plums, chestnuts, and persimmons. The next is silkworm cocoons, about 2,000 dan per year. Tea leaves amount to about 300 dan per year. The famous "Dongting Biluo" tea is produced in Xishan. Other abundant products include greenstone and bluestone for construction. However, the sight of barren mountain land is also striking. If investment and cultivation can be added, production will be very rich.

Xishan does not produce much rice. In years of good harvest, it is only enough to meet the needs of the mountain people for three months. The rest is relied upon from outside. The current sources of rice in Xishan are mainly from Heqiao, Fangqiao, Zhou Tieqiao, which belong to Yixing County, and Hengjing and Puzhuang, which belong to Wuxian County. Each stone is sold for 37,000 to 38,000 yuan. Fish and shrimp are cheap because they are local products of Tai Lake. Other items such as oil, salt, and various daily necessities are far more expensive than in Shanghai.

Education

Xishan currently has two county-run elementary schools and ten private elementary schools, with more than 1,500 children attending. They are all primary schools, and there are no complete elementary schools, not to mention middle schools. It can be seen that education is not very developed. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in the society will quickly start schools.

Places of Interest

Xishan has many famous scenic spots and historical sites. The most famous are Shigong Mountain and Xiaoyou Temple, with natural scenery that is very suitable for recuperation and meditation. It would be most appropriate to establish a hospital here. There are also many temples and monasteries in Xishan that can accommodate a part of evacuated charitable organizations.

Transportation

To get from Shanghai to Xishan, you must first go to Suzhou. There are two steamboats from Suzhou to the mountain, one named Lixingyuan and the other named Shanbei. They take turns on a daily basis, berthing at the Yong'an Lane Chai Tea House pier outside the Xumen Waiyang Bridge. They depart at about 9:00 AM and arrive at Bendu at 12:00 PM. Passengers can go ashore for lunch and taste the delicious food at the Shi Family Restaurant, but it is very crowded. The boat leaves Bendu at 1:00 PM and arrives at Xishan at about 4:00 PM. The boat docks at Houbao, Qixian Township, and passengers disembark and walk to their destinations. In addition to steamboats, there are also sailing boats, coal boats, and stone boats (i.e., empty boats that return after unloading coal and stone in Suzhou) from Suzhou to the mountain. Sailing boats generally dock at the Jinting Pier in the Dahui Bridge area outside Xumen, while coal boats and stone boats generally dock near the electric plant. However, sometimes due to environmental factors, they only go as far as Mudu, in which case travelers must inquire on their own. In short, Bendu is a must-pass stop for boats to Xishan. If travelers take a taxi or bus to Bendu in Suzhou and wait for a boat to Xishan, they will not have to worry about not being able to catch a boat. (Moved to Chou Yixue)

### Assistance for Poor Women in Childbirth Report Handled by This Office - Hui Sheng and Hui Lü Hospitals Enthusiastically Assist

The Hui Sheng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital on Kang Nao Tuo Road in this city has always been extremely enthusiastic in serving the poor and sick. With this office's special agreement to handle free childbirth assistance, the hospital stipulates that for each parturient in March, the maximum stay is seven days. Including delivery fees and meals, only 3,000 yuan is charged. At a time when prices of goods and medicines are soaring, the hospital is covering a considerable deficit, benefiting poor parturients. Their enthusiasm is highly admirable. In March, a total of sixteen women were admitted for childbirth, and all had positive outcomes, totaling 48,000 yuan, which was directly paid by this office to the hospital, with no expenses for the parturients. The names of the parturients who received assistance are recorded below:

Yao He Yuying gave birth to a son. Cai Wangshi gave birth to a daughter. Liu Qianshi gave birth to a daughter. Zhang Zhoushi gave birth to a son. Yao Zhenli gave birth to a daughter. Wang Qianhua gave birth to a daughter. Chen Lu Shimei gave birth to a daughter. Chen Zhangshi gave birth to a son. Wang A'mei gave birth to a daughter. Liang Cailan gave birth to a son. Zhou Liu Lanying gave birth to a son. Li Wangshi gave birth to a son. Xu A'mei gave birth to a son. Ouyang Qiao gave birth to a daughter. Song Sunshi gave birth to a son. Wang Dexian gave birth to a daughter.

Furthermore, the Hui Lü Hospital, under special agreement, had three women admitted for childbirth in December of last year: Wu Caishi, who gave birth to a daughter; Huang Xiulan, who gave birth to a son; and Wang A'bao, who gave birth to a daughter, each costing 1,400 yuan for a total of 4,200 yuan. In January of this year, two women were admitted for childbirth: Qian Zhangshi, who gave birth to a daughter, and Shao Jinshi, who gave birth to a daughter, each costing 2,500 yuan for a total of 5,000 yuan. In February, nine women were admitted for childbirth: Shao Yinfeng, who gave birth to a son; Guo Yangshi, who gave birth to a daughter; Liang Wangqun, who gave birth to a son; Sheng Yulan, who gave birth to a daughter; Huang Ruizhen, who gave birth to a daughter; Xu Chenshi, who gave birth to a son; Zhu Hongshi, who gave birth to a son; Shao Youdi, who gave birth to a son; and Shen Cuishi, who gave birth to a son, each costing 2,500 yuan for a total of 22,500 yuan. The above all stayed in the hospital for seven days with meals provided, and all expenses were directly paid by this office to the hospital, with no expenses for the parturients. According to the report from Hui Lü Hospital, Wu Caishi had a difficult labor, and Dr. Huang Shuai, the director of obstetrics, performed surgery to deliver the baby with positive results. The hospital voluntarily covered the cost of anesthesia materials and other expenses of approximately 20,000 yuan, as well as procedure fees, hospitalization fees, and meal costs for over twenty days, without any additional charges. Their enthusiastic service is truly admirable, and we hereby express our gratitude.

If there are poor parturients who need assistance from this office and the specially contracted hospitals, please apply to this office. As long as they meet the conditions of being impoverished, the procedures are simple.
