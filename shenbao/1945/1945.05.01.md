Our air units have continued to attack enemy air bases on Okinawa Island and enemy ships and mobile units off the coast of the island, especially the continuous fierce attacks since April 27th, inflicting great losses on the enemy. Among the battle results obtained by our side, those confirmed by April 18th are as follows: One battleship or cruiser sunk, four cruisers sunk, two transport ships sunk, one oil tanker sunk, and fifteen ships of unknown type sunk (two of which are believed to be aircraft carriers).

### Decisive Battle in Ryukyu Imminent

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Because the weather has recovered, Japanese air units have begun large-scale operations since the 27th, desperately attacking enemy ships and enemy airfields and land positions around Ryukyu. The special attack units directly charged enemy aircraft carriers and battleships in rapid succession, with unstoppable courage. As a result, flames soared along the coast, and the enemy fleet was in great confusion. The enemy is feeling great pain from the attacks from the Ryukyu area. The battle has now reached its climax. Japanese special attack aircraft are continuously advancing to grasp the enemy's warships and warplanes. At this crucial moment, it is up to the one hundred million people in the rear. How they produce special attack aircraft greatly affects the progress of the war. The decisive battle in Ryukyu is indeed imminent.

Japanese Special Attack Units Launch Daytime Attacks

From a certain Japanese base, 30th (Central News Agency) – Japanese attacks on enemy mobile units around Okinawa have become more intense since the weather improved. On the auspicious day of the Emperor's Birthday, the 29th, Japanese special attack units launched daytime attacks, sinking or destroying four enemy aircraft carriers and four or more escort aircraft carrier-type ships. The enemy's resistance to this Japanese air attack was very weak, which is worthy of serious attention. In addition, it was confirmed that Japanese aircraft rammed enemy cruisers. Also, in the attacks from the 29th to the morning of the 30th, five enemy ships of unknown type caught fire, one of which sank after catching fire. Operations are still in progress, and the battle results are gradually expanding. At the same time, the Japanese special attack units attacking enemy ships in Kadena hit one cruiser around 1:00 AM on the 30th, causing it to catch fire. At approximately 1:40 AM, one large warship and one small warship also caught fire.

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from Guam states that Nimitz Headquarters announced in a communiqué on the 29th that approximately 200 Japanese aircraft launched a large-scale attack on US naval forces in the Okinawa area from the daytime of April 28th to the 29th, causing significant damage.

### Japanese Kanto Region Attacked Twice Yesterday

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Since the 26th, enemy air forces from southern bases have continued to attack Japanese air bases in southern Kyushu.

The first wave, consisting of approximately 80 B-29s formed into ten teams, entered the mainland at approximately 10:00 AM, passing near Shimoda, then over Fujisawa and Ishikozuki, and reaching Tachikawa, where they bombed aviation facilities. Then, they turned left and flew towards Suruga Bay. The second wave, consisting of approximately 20 B-29s and approximately 100 P-51s, jointly bombed Tachikawa, following roughly the same route as the first wave. The P-51s strafed the areas near Hiratsuka and Atsugi with machine guns and flew towards Sagami Bay at approximately 11:00 AM.

### Hu Yukun Goes to Beijing to Take Office

Beiping, 30th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Chief of General Staff, Mr. Hu Yukun, took a train to Beijing on the 30th to take office. The heads of various agencies here went to the station to see him off.

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Kishi, Chief of Intelligence of the Japanese Embassy, recently wrote an article entitled "Japan and China" for the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Central News Agency. His insights are insightful and unique, and can be used as a reference for those who are concerned about Sino-Japanese issues. The original text is as follows: Japan will always exist as China's neighbor, so China's destiny is inextricably linked to Japan. China can view Japan from its subjective Chinese perspective and take Japan lightly, but objectively, it cannot deny the existence of Japan. Therefore, regardless of whether one loves or hates Japan, regardless of whether one is in the resistance faction or the peace faction, Chinese people who are truly concerned about the fate of their motherland must know the truth about Japan, and must know Japan's strength, Japan's trends, and Japan's traditions. At the same time, they should also examine the question of "what should Japan be like" and the fate of their own country, and constantly express their opinions to Japan.

National Self-Awareness and Understanding of Japan

Generally speaking, Chinese people who have lost their original appearance, fallen into the ideological framework of Britain and the United States, and are unable to extricate themselves, often underestimate Japan's strength. Furthermore, those with minds distorted by imperialism, whose original spirit of freedom has been perverted, believe that Japan's movements along the path of history are merely concessions taken as a result of defeat. Furthermore, with a blind Anglo-American style of thinking that ignores the glorious traditional values ​​of their motherland, they will certainly not be able to understand Japan's beautiful traditions. Once a person loses his subjectivity, he loses the ability to measure the object, because the standard of measurement must be oneself. Therefore, in order to understand Japan, whether as an enemy or a friend, the establishment of one's own subjectivity by Chinese people must be a prerequisite. In other words, the restoration of national self-awareness must be a necessary condition. This is not merely a matter of a knowledge procedure, but a serious matter of morality for national self-awareness.

### Relationship between Japan and China

-Intelligence Chief Kishi Publishes Essay-

Policy Changes Due to Misunderstanding

I am Japanese, so I say this, on the one hand, also because we Japanese have made the biggest mistakes in understanding China. This serious misunderstanding is the fundamental reason why the Sino-Japanese Incident has not been fully resolved to this day. However, Japan is now reflecting step by step, and there has been a major psychological revolution. From the recognition of "punishing the Zhi," "destroying the party," and "suppressing the Communists" at the time of the July 7th Incident to today's "coexistence and co-prosperity," Japan's policy toward China has repeatedly changed, and finally reached the so-called New Policy toward China of the previous year, which is a great way that will never change. However, the Chongqing regime (i.e., the resistance camp) has consistently maintained its national policy. Their unchanging national policy is to appeal to the military and economic power of Britain and the United States to defeat Japan. Because they are determined to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict through military force, Japan has realized its fallacy, but resistance China has not yet awakened from its dream. Those with vitality often change, while those who do not change or cannot change are in fact dead in vitality.

Japan Does Not Hate China

Japan and China's fellow travelers in harmony, through this war, will reflect on themselves from their original selves, and through further reflection, will carry each other along. At least Japan holds respect and sympathy for China and the Chinese people, regardless of whether they are in the resistance faction or the peace faction, and has no sense of hatred at all. Of course, in some occasional phenomena, the Chinese people may cite examples of Japanese people remaining the same, but in fact, even in times of peace and prosperity, this should not be ruled out. We cannot be obsessed with trivial facts. The entire Japanese people and the solidified form of the Japanese national will, towards China and the Chinese people, certainly do not have the hatred that Britain and the United States or the Soviet Union hold towards Germany, nor can they harbor this hatred. The tragic state of affairs in what is now called the liberated countries in Europe, which in the peaceful areas are called occupied or liberated areas, is that the British and Americans there have no mild human feelings, and only have material desires and a desire for revenge. Furthermore, what is their form of combat? General Fang Xianjue, who was captured by the Japanese army in the battle of Hunan, was not returned to the resistance area according to his free will? This example is proof that our war is a "war of humanity."

Promote the Eastern Spirit

Chinese and Japanese people both have a great sense of glory, and this sense of glory is enough to become a god. There are eight million deities in Japan, many of whom spent their lives on earth. The various deities in Yasukuni Shrine are all ordinary citizens who lived in this era, just like us. Among the Chinese gods, I also know many, who are loyal officials, righteous men, filial sons, and virtuous women. These heavenly beings must have tasted many hardships in their human lives. Those with pure and powerful lives are revered as gods. Whether we are enemies or friends, we cannot fight like beasts. We deeply feel that it is a great honor and joy for East Asians to be able to fight with human feelings even when they cannot shake hands as friends and fight as enemies. Finally, I hope this article will have the opportunity to meet with people in Chongqing.

### The San Francisco Conference and the Near East Question

The ongoing San Francisco Conference, with the conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union over the Polish question becoming apparent, has turned into a bitter satire before the conference even opened. It is expected that several more tragicomedies will be performed during the conference, the essence of which is nothing more than the struggle between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for post-war interests. We have previously commented on the multiple contradictions between the three countries, from European issues to Pacific issues. Even the Near East question, which has not received much attention in the past, has recently become a new powder keg for conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The focus of the Near East question is, of course, the struggle for interests between Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and even between Britain and the United States.

The Soviet Union's intentions have always been openly stated: to eliminate anti-Soviet forces in countries and regions bordering the Soviet Union, and to further create forces friendly to the Soviet Union. Under this basic policy, since the Second World War, the Soviet-Finnish War and negotiations, the establishment of Soviet regimes in the three small Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the establishment of a pro-Soviet regime in Poland, and even the changes in the Balkan countries since last year have occurred. With the rapid turn of events in the European war situation, the Soviet Union's policy of stabilizing its borders can also shift from the west to the east, turning its attention to the Near East, first to Turkey, then to countries such as Iran. The recent declaration of the abolition of the Soviet-Turkish Treaty, the thorough realization of the opening of the Straits, and the intensification of the oil disputes in Iran and Iraq are all consistent with this policy.

The Near East policies of Britain and the United States are clearly opposed to those of the Soviet Union. In particular, Britain invariably stands in opposition to the Soviet Union when it comes to Near East issues. Not only since the Second World War, but as far back as the 19th century, Russia and Britain have been in constant conflict over this, shedding the blood of thousands upon thousands of people! As the Asahi Shimbun editorial pointed out: Whenever Russia's national power weakened, it demanded the closure of the Black Sea, while Britain demanded its opening; conversely, when Russia's national power was strong, it demanded the opening of the Black Sea, while Britain resolutely opposed it; Turkey, caught in the middle, was inevitably dragged into the war regardless of the situation. This only concerns the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Straits issue. In addition, in order to maintain its connection to its eastern colonies, especially British India, Britain must maintain its exclusive rights over the Suez Canal area, not allowing others to interfere from Egypt to Arabia. However, due to the major changes in the Balkan situation, Soviet power has now faced the Eastern Mediterranean, and its activities in Egypt and Arabia are becoming increasingly active, showing a trend of directly threatening Britain's hegemony over its eastern colonies. This is another new factor in the opposition between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Near East question.

The United States' activities in the Near East mainly began with the Second World War. For the sake of operations, the United States demanded the use of certain military bases in the Near East, and also demanded the use of key resources in the Near East, such as oil. For the sake of material aid to the Soviet Union, American power gradually entered Iran. On the demand of joint operations, Britain and the Soviet Union both agreed to the extension of American power to the Near East, but when the war situation began to change and the significance of joint operations receded, both Britain and the Soviet Union began to be dissatisfied with the excessive expansion of American power. Therefore, since last year, a growing dispute has formed among the three countries, centered on the oil concession rights in Iran and Iraq. The Soviet Union and the United States were at odds over the Iranian oil rights issue, causing instability in the beleaguered Iranian political situation; Britain and the United States also had disputes over the Iraqi oil fields; in addition, in order to deepen its involvement in the Near East, the United States proposed a so-called plan for the establishment of a Muslim state, while Britain launched a pan-Arab alliance to counter it.

The most unfortunate thing is the Near East countries under the contention of the three powers. Turkey's repeated changes in attitude, the constant reorganization of the Iranian cabinet, the recent bloodshed in Egypt, the declaration of war against the Axis powers by Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, etc., and the instability of the Iraqi political situation are all reflections of the struggle between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for hegemony in the Near East. However, this is not the end result, but only the prelude to a major change in the Near East. After the San Francisco Conference, changes in the Near East and other regions will follow one after another.

### The Dynamics of the Near East and the Two Powers, Britain and the Soviet Union

Due to the recent rapid turn of events in Europe, the situation in the Near East has also entered a new stage. In the eyes of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the way to resolve the Near East question, like the European question, is very complex and delicate. However, under the urgent need to resolve the European question, the Near East question has remained unattended until today, seemingly left to develop naturally. The center of the Near East is Turkey. Due to the recent pressure from Britain and the United States, Turkey abandoned its long-standing opportunistic neutral policy and joined the anti-Axis camp, finally declaring war on the Axis powers. However, the problem does not lie in Turkey simply expressing an anti-Axis attitude, and then everything will be fine, which is well known. As Turkey's anti-Axis stance gradually intensified, the question of which power, Britain, the United States, or the Soviet Union, it should turn to arose. On this point, Turkey continued its opportunistic attitude, maintaining an alliance relationship with Britain while having a friendly neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, thereby seeking its own security guarantee in the balance of power between Britain and the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union suddenly shattered this situation with a "knocking brick." That is, the Soviet Union declared to Turkey on March 21 that it was abandoning the Soviet-Turkish Neutrality Treaty. The reason was that the great changes in the situation of World War II made the Neutrality Treaty unable to adapt to the new situation, so it had to be changed. In short, this proves that the Soviet Union wants to readjust Soviet-Turkish relations.

The Soviet Union's propaganda machinery had previously asserted that Turkey's current administration was anti-democratic and strongly criticized it as having fascist tendencies. In fact, Turkey's current administration is increasingly pro-British and pro-American. Seeing this, one can also infer the Soviet Union's intentions.

One of the main principles of Soviet diplomacy is, of course, to try to establish pro-Soviet regimes in the surrounding countries, and it is still working hard according to this intention. Given this, and based on geographical relations, Turkey becoming a target of Soviet work will be no exception. Moreover, Turkey controls the Dardanelles Strait, the exit from the closed Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea with its pleasant climate and scenery. Naturally, the Soviet Union's concern for Turkey is not something that has only become extremely strong today. On the other hand, it is also very clear that the declining Britain, as long as it still wants to maintain the lifeline of the British Empire, will never agree to hand over Turkey and the Dardanelles Strait entirely to the Soviet Union for disposal. To understand this point, one need only look at how fierce the continuous Anglo-Russian wars over the Dardanelles Strait were throughout the 19th century.

When Russian power was weak, Russia hoped to block the Dardanelles Strait, while Britain hoped to open it. Conversely, when Russian power expanded, Russia hoped to open the Strait in order to seek an outlet for its power. Today, both Britain and the Soviet Union have more say than other countries in this regard, and both are expanding their power, which is a self-evident fact. If the Soviet Union obtains access from the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, it can be concluded that Britain will have infinite fear and anxiety. Therefore, the Anglo-Soviet diplomatic war over Turkey will gradually become clear. This also deeply reveals the contradictions between Britain and the Soviet Union. (Translated from an Asahi Shimbun editorial)

### Hoping Citizens Will Make Adequate Air Defense Preparations at All Times, Air Defense Headquarters Authorities Issue Statement

According to a person in charge of the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters who spoke to reporters: "In recent days, enemy American planes have repeatedly invaded Shanghai. On the evening of the day before yesterday (28th), at around 11:00 PM, two enemy B-24 type (reported as B-29 type, actually incorrect) planes invaded Shanghai's airspace. Before they could drop their bombs, one plane was shot down by the Japanese air defense elite's artillery fire, and the other plane was wounded and fled in panic. The one that was shot down exploded in the air and shattered, falling into Pudong. The wreckage has been taken by military authorities and is on display at the entrance of the Continental Daily News (大陸新報社) at 17 The Bund, Nanjing Road.

The City May Be Subject to Air Raids at Any Time

However, enemy planes have repeatedly attacked Shanghai in succession, and all of them have been at late nights, so Shanghai is at any time subject to the possibility of being air-raided. Therefore, it is necessary for citizens to make adequate air defense preparations at all times to cope with any eventuality, especially the light control regulations. They must strictly abide by these, and after nightfall, whether there is an air raid alarm or not, they must properly install curtains and door screens around the windows, absolutely preventing light from leaking out. Even when going to sleep, they must place clothing, air defense equipment, etc. in appropriate locations to avoid being caught off guard and causing danger. At the same time, attention must be paid to traffic control. After hearing the alarm, the Baojia (neighborhood watch) air defense personnel must all go out to assist the police in implementing traffic control and maintaining order, and guide the public into nearby air raid shelters or appropriate buildings. It is absolutely forbidden for the public to stand in the street to watch the bombing and artillery fire, to avoid being hit by stray bullets and causing unnecessary deaths and injuries. In short: Shanghai has now entered a state of being subject to air raids at any time. Citizens should always make various air defense preparations to ensure the safety of the people's property."

### Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau Stipulates Inspection Measures for Hotels; Police Officers Must Show Identification Cards

The Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau, due to its central location and concentration of public entertainment venues, is particularly strict with security. It has recently been found that some lawless elements are wearing uniforms and impersonating police officers, even claiming to be police officers from the Lao Zha Sub-bureau. They go to public places such as hotels under the guise of inspecting travelers and extort money through intimidation. They are lawless and do anything they want. The sub-bureau has received repeated reports, so it was decided at the bureau affairs meeting to summon the persons in charge of various public places such as hotels to talk and issue a public notice. In the future, if police officers go to various public places such as hotels to carry out inspection work, regardless of whether they are wearing uniforms or not, they must show their identification cards to the owner and carry out inspection duties together with the owner or a designated person in charge. Otherwise, the owners can refuse and report to the sub-bureau by telephone, and the sub-bureau will send police officers to thoroughly investigate the matter. If there are any criminals impersonating public officials, they will be taken to the bureau and severely punished according to law.

Reiterating the Ban on Operating Past Hours

In addition, it is reported that the sub-bureau has recently found that entertainment venues are often operating past the allowed hours. Moreover, travelers in various hotels are still gambling and engaging in prostitution, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, the previous order has been reiterated, ordering various entertainment venues to strictly comply with the operating hours stipulated by the authorities and absolutely not to operate past the allowed hours. Various hotels and apartments must also operate on time, and after the stipulated time, hotels must absolutely not engage in gambling or prostitution in order to adapt to the wartime system. Those who dare to deliberately violate the regulations, whether they are owners or travelers, will be punished according to law. The Second Section is ordered to send police officers to various public places at any time to investigate and supervise.

### Enemy Fleet Suffers Heavy Damage Off the Ryukyus, Enemy Troops Have Difficulty Operating, Minister Matsushima Expresses Views

The Japanese General Headquarters announced the results of battles on various fronts in the Western Pacific on the 30th, stating that approximately 80 enemy ships were sunk (some were damaged). From this, it can be seen that since the start of the battle off the Ryukyus, the overall results obtained on the sea surface have been very great. More than 470 enemy ships have been sunk or damaged. Regarding this matter, Colonel Matsushima, the press chief of the Fleet in China, expressed his views as follows:

Eighty Percent of Enemy Ships Damaged

The results announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on April 30th are sufficient to prove that the Japanese army has launched a great operation from the mainland to the Admiralty Islands south of the equator, in this 2,000-mile waterway. From this announcement, it is known that the enemy ships off the Ryukyus have suffered as many as 470 casualties since the start of the battle, and most of them are ships used for combat. Therefore, it can be estimated that approximately 80% of the enemy ships used for combat in the Pacific have been damaged. However, the war in the Pacific is different from the war in Europe, and naval power is the most important condition. Therefore, the enemy's fleet has suffered heavy damage. No matter what the war situation in Europe is, it will be difficult to speed up and smoothly promote operations in the Pacific from now on.

Attempting to Recover Ground Losses

Since the enemy has suffered great losses at sea, they now want to recover their ground losses. Therefore, since April 19th, they have started to stir up trouble and directly attacked the strong Japanese positions south of Ryukyu Island. However, their advance has been slow and has been repeatedly blocked by the Japanese army, resulting in great losses of troops. Furthermore, the enemy hopes to eliminate the power of the Japanese mainland air force, so they have mobilized B-29 heavy bombers to bomb from the Mariana Islands, with an almost continuous stream. However, the Japanese air force will not be damaged by the enemy's B-29 bombings, and now it is still dispatching to the Ryukyu area to attack enemy ships on a large scale, and the results of its battles are remarkable.

The Japanese People Are Even More Tempered

At the time of the world war transformation, the nation is even more tempered and determined to pursue and attack the enemy Americans and enemy British. We hope that the nations of our East Asian allies will work closely with Japan, endure all difficulties, and increase combat power in order to liberate the East Asian nations. This is our glory.

### Fire in Yaoshui Lane Yesterday Morning

The police from the Puhua Road (普陀路) sub-bureau in charge of the area went to the scene to suppress the fire, maintain order, and assist the firefighters in rescuing the people. By 5:00 AM, the fire had been completely extinguished. According to the investigation, a total of more than 260 houses were destroyed, and more than 370 households were affected.

### Obligatory Night School Hopes for Extended Electricity Allotment

We, not deterred by our feeble strength, with the spirit of "a newborn calf fears no tiger," are trying to run a night school in our spare time, entirely voluntarily. We do not seek to contribute to society, but merely to fulfill our human responsibility of mutual assistance. As for expenses, some are covered by donations from others, and some by dipping into our own pockets, so it is generally not a problem. The most difficult thing we feel is the electricity for the lights. With only six degrees of electricity, the night school uses more than the limit, so we have to think of other ways, like retrofitting storage batteries, but because the light is too weak, even students sitting in the front find it difficult to see the words written on the blackboard. Therefore, we feel much more strained when teaching. We feel very sorry for the students, as their studies will be greatly affected. But we will continue to run it, as long as we have a bit of strength, we will use that strength well. We hope that the authorities can understand our plight and, within the realm of possibility, extend the electricity limit for obligatory night schools. This is a worthwhile issue to consider in the sense of aiding universities. (Liu Zhizhi)

### Nanshi People's Hospital Holds Relocation Ceremony, Hopes All Circles Will Donate Money to Help the Poor and Sick

The Nanshi People's Hospital at 775 Minguo Road, this city, was founded in the late spring of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). At that time, public-spirited people, seeing that Nanshi had not recovered from the damage after the incident (likely referring to the war), and that most of the residents in this area were poor, found it even more difficult to bear the cost of illness. Every summer, epidemics breed, making people feel helpless and waiting for death. Therefore, the establishment of the Nanshi Epidemic Hospital was proposed to assist the various hospitals in this area. Initially located on Zhaojia Road, with simple facilities, it provided diagnosis and medicine, saving thousands of civilians from summer to winter. Later, as the number of patients increased and the hospital site was insufficient, and it was felt that there was a need to add a complete hospital in this area, it was decided by the initiators to change it to the People's Hospital. After moving to the new site in January of this year, the hospital rooms were expanded, X-ray machines were purchased, and operating rooms and laboratory rooms were opened. Regarding the important equipment of the hospital, everything that should be available is available, the planning is gradually complete, and the services are becoming more extensive. There are currently more than 100 beds, with 40 to 50 inpatients, and more than 100 outpatients every day. Poor and sick people are given diagnosis and medicine, and the diagnosis work is becoming more and more complicated, and the expenditure is also increasing day by day. However, the hospital's funding is limited, and the number of poor and sick people is increasing day by day, resulting in a feeling of inability despite great effort. Regular expenses originally relied on donations from all parties, but due to insufficient funding, poor patients cannot be accommodated as much as possible, which is regrettable. Recently, it was learned that the hospital will hold a relocation ceremony in the main hall of the hospital at 10:00 AM on May 3, in order to let the outside world understand the actual situation of serving the poor and sick, and to invite all circles to visit, in order to arouse the enthusiasm of public-spirited people to support them together. If you are willing to donate cash to be used as the hospital's medical fund, it will directly help the poor and sick, and indirectly benefit the society.
