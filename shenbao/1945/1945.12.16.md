Among those attending were local gentry and elders from Peiping and Tianjin: Zan Yunpeng, Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhu Qiqian, Gu Zhongxiu, Pan Qibi, Wang Shuchang, Yu Zhen, educators Chen Yuan, Li Yuzhu, Lu Zhizhang, Wang Tongling, Zuo Zonglun, Yu Qichang, Shi Zhiquan, Miao Qun; representatives of the Tibetan clergy Danba Dazha and Ge Bi Dada Haerba and their spouses; religious representatives Chang Zichun and Scott; women's representatives Zhou Liang Lingxian; journalists Cheng Shewo and Cao Gusha from newspapers and magazines such as the Associated Press, United Press, Reuters, Time, Life Magazine, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun; councilors Mo Dehui and Rao Fenghuang; industry and commerce representatives Yan and student representatives Yang Shaoye; US military commanders stationed in Peiping and Tianjin, General Rockey, General Jones, and General Walden; and over 260 diplomatic personnel from allied nations. The Chairman and Madame Chiang slowly entered the venue at 4 PM, receiving a warm welcome and thunderous applause. During the event, the Chairman personally went to each table, shaking hands with the elderly gentry and inquiring about their health. Returning to his seat, he smiled and delivered a speech, expressing deep respect for the people of North China and individuals from all walks of life who had endured hardship and oppression under the enemy and puppet regimes for the past eight years, remaining steadfast and unyielding. He stated that this spirit truly represented the integrity of the nation and was the guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance. He also expressed hope that everyone would maintain their past spirit, lead their compatriots, and assist the government to complete the great task of national reconstruction. After the speech, everyone applauded in unison. Mr. Zan Yunpeng stood up to respond, stating that today's tea party was a grand event in history, and that the nation, in the past ten years or more, had relied on Chairman Chiang's wise leadership to overcome a strong enemy and lay the foundation for the country. However, the great task of national reconstruction was just beginning, and he hoped that the Chairman would continue to lead China for another thirty years. (The crowd applauded greatly.) He said that if the entire nation, from top to bottom, worked together with one heart and devoted themselves to hard work, then in thirty years, China would surely become a modernized nation. The tea party concluded at around 5 PM in a joyful atmosphere. The Chairman and Madame Chiang shook hands with the guests to bid them farewell. It has been ten years since the Chairman last left Peiping in the 24th year of the Republic. After the War of Resistance, Peiping and Tianjin fell, and the people were in dire straits, longing for the Chairman's arrival like rain after a long drought. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the Chairman is the first to visit Peiping, and the morale of the people is imaginable. Therefore, the gentry and elders who were honored to be invited by the Chairman and Madame Chiang were all exceptionally excited. Mr. Jin Xinyun, who is seventy years old and originally resided in Tianjin, upon hearing of the Chairman's invitation, immediately flew from Tianjin to Peiping on the same day and finally arrived at the venue at around 4 PM to meet the Chairman, considering it a great honor. This further illustrates the love and support of the people of North China for the Chairman."

All these events have greatly increased the opportunity for China's unification and solidarity. Most importantly, it proves that both the Soviet Union and the United States have a deep understanding of China's situation, which will not only help to eliminate the Chinese civil war but also make the Far East issue hopeful for resolution. And the peace of the Far East will also be guaranteed. The speed of the Chinese government's promotion is largely due to the assistance of the United States and the Soviet Union. The newspaper concluded: The parallel military actions taken by the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East are an optimistic sign of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Rumor has it that Fu Zuoyi Arrived in Peiping from Suiyuan: Visited Chairman Chiang to Report on the Situation in Suiyuan and Baotou, Expressing Pain Over the Communist Army's Claim of Chaos

"[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 14th] (Late Arrival) It is rumored that Commander Fu Zuoyi flew to Peiping from Guihua on the afternoon of the 13th and immediately visited Chairman Chiang that night to report on the bitter battle in Suiyuan and Baotou. It is rumored that Fu stayed here briefly before returning to Suiyuan. On the 14th, Fu Zuoyi met with reporters from this newspaper. According to him: After the enemy surrendered, I led the army to advance rapidly and had traveled two thousand miles by August 27th, reaching Datong. The Ping-Sui railway traffic was quickly restored, and the work of disarming the enemy was also completed quickly. All the people of Suiyuan were celebrating that they could finally recuperate, but they knew that unreasonable civil strife had arisen. Now, the two cities of Suiyuan and Baotou have suffered more than a month of bitter fighting. Although they have fortunately been unharmed, Fu Zuoyi (Fu said himself) is extremely distressed. In the past, when fighting against Japan, whenever Fu Zuoyi saw wounded brothers with broken legs and torn skin, he praised their loyalty and bravery without any sadness. Today, when he saw wounded brothers, Fu Zuoyi burst into tears and was overcome with grief, because the blood of these good men should not be shed in this way. Now that the Political Consultative Conference is about to be held, I deeply hope that a good solution can be discussed, and that we will not fight among ourselves and make our people suffer. After this battle, Suiyuan and Baotou have been severely damaged. Almost the entire railway has been dismantled, the telegraph poles have been pulled up by the Communist army to serve as ladders, many strong men in the countryside have been kidnapped, and food has been looted. Even if the Communist army withdraws in the future, it will not be easy to restore the original state."

### Journey to Paradise

— Shao Fu

Glimpses of Oriental Venice

Every day I walk past the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road and see the iron railing door that is one person wide, with crowds of people outside clamoring and shouting. I always feel a little uncomfortable. I am quite surprised that people are so enthusiastic about traveling.

The Beijing-Shanghai train is indeed better than it was in early September. At that time, people were sitting on the roofs of the carriages, and people entered and exited through the windows. As soon as we arrived at the station, like a black whirlwind, hundreds of strong men with hand-carried packages swarmed out. Now we can't see this lively scene.

On the train, an old man said that he bought a second-class ticket to Suzhou for 1,500 yuan. He didn't feel frustrated. He kept shouting, "It's hard to come by!" "Unexpected!" Because he got a seat and could sit comfortably to Suzhou. Spending a few more dollars also bought a little comfort.

Two people who looked like service soldiers occupied eight seats. When people who couldn't find a seat asked them, they were turned back with the word "Someone." Among these people, occasionally one or two angrily said, "Do you reserve seats on the train?" The answer was "I'm reserving seats!" At this time, people like Lu Zhonglian came out to mediate. Lu Zhongyun was afraid that the seat-reservists would really get angry, and it was unfair to eat stray bullets from the side. When the train was about to leave, two officers came. There were four seats left. Two were immediately taken, and the other two had briefcases on them. There were at least fifteen people standing in this car. I watched coldly. I admired the two Gandhianists. After their full request to the officer was rejected, they were not discouraged. They stood on the seats with the briefcases, without saying a word. The train started, and the officer started a conversation and automatically took away the briefcases. The Gandhianists silently sat down, not even looking at them.

On this day, the rickshaw pullers in Suzhou were on strike because the owners increased the rent. It was very difficult to walk into the city from the station outside Pingmen. If you had luggage, it would be even more troublesome. A few horse-drawn carriages took the opportunity to raise prices, and there were also a few sedans with the names of institutions or military vehicles on them, occasionally doing some wild chicken business.

Japanese soldiers rode tall horses on the road, looking like they were going for a spring outing.

Our officers, even a platoon leader of the county security team, were followed by a "Ma Sheng" with a box cannon. When the officer took out a cigarette, the "Ma Bian" immediately struck a match. Walking on the road, he was extremely nervous, almost treating every passerby as an assassin, and the box cannon was always ready to be pulled out. I thought to myself: How majestic!

It's more prosperous outside the door. I was chanting silently!

Lightly flowing water, long-lasting feelings; falling flowers are intentional, but fall to the ground silently.

The emotions in "Suzhou Night Talk" deeply infected me.

Not only outside _men, Guanqian is now also showing unprecedented prosperity. More than a dozen new restaurants have opened, and the hotels are also quite magnificent. During the occupied area, this was a city that never sleeps; after the victory of the War of Resistance, for the past two or three months, it has been just as brightly lit. Among them, there are still some past owners, but they have changed their badges and symbols.

Many small streets, many deep alleys, the kind of dead silence made people feel cold. The eight years of occupied life showed even more how this city was squeezed and exploited. The gentle homes of the Wu people seemed even more gentle, and even more happy, knowing their fate, and being content with their situation.

Perhaps it is because of its proximity to Shanghai, the metropolis swallowed up the small county towns, and labor was concentrated in the cities, even women were no exception. My relatives' family could not hire a female immortal. It is said that the young people have all gone to Shanghai, and all that are left are old women over fifty years old.

The most miscellaneous troops wandered around in this area, discussing this kind of story in teahouses and hotels in twos and threes, extortion, robbery. In a small restaurant across from the military station, I even heard a lawsuit about robbing dozens of ducks.

If this city still has any vitality, it is the red and green slogans of "Welcome XXX"... that are plastered all over the streets and alleys.

Full of sorrow and killing, it is difficult for me to find facts to prove that this is paradise, this is the Oriental Venice. December 14th

### Legislative Yuan Meeting: Amendment to Household Registration Law

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The Legislative Yuan held its 290th meeting of the fourth session on the 14th. Fifty-eight members attended, chaired by President Sun and Secretary-General Wu Shangying. The following important matters were passed: Amendment to the Household Registration Law. Key points of the content include: A. A census is a static survey of the population and differs in nature from household registration. Therefore, a separate Census Law should be formulated. Previously, censuses were conducted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, while registration of changes in personnel was handled by the Ministry of Interior. This resulted in a lack of administrative unity. This amendment specifically stipulates that the Ministry of Interior is the competent authority for censuses, and a separate Census Law will be formulated. B. Because it is difficult for registration personnel to handle statistics concurrently, it is stipulated that the competent authorities at all levels responsible for household registration should prepare various statistical tables and submit them to the superior competent authorities on a regular basis. C. The current system includes both temporary and permanent household registration. This amendment stipulates that temporary household registration is an exception to permanent registration, with flexible provisions made in Article 18 to maintain the effect of one person, one registration while retaining temporary registration. D. After completing registration, national identity cards will be issued. Article 11 stipulates that national identity cards may be issued in areas where household registration has been completed, or in areas approved by the Ministry of Interior. E. Registration procedures for foreigners residing in the Republic of China will be determined by the Ministry of Interior in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### Hirohito Becomes an Isolated Emperor; 500 War Criminals to Soon Be Tried; A Huge Rope Newly Placed on the Gallows

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Since our chief representative arrived in Japan three and a half months ago, Emperor Hirohito has been an isolated and depressed figure, like an ancient tree battered by artillery fire, standing tall amidst the ruins of Tokyo. This Japan, once called an empire, is now an isolated, helpless, amputated effigy. Whether Hirohito abdicates or not is left unsaid, but it can be asserted that his situation is deteriorating. He is now isolated from the general Japanese public, and some Japanese are questioning the concept of the "inviolable god," setting a precedent in Japanese history. Three key figures who maintained contact with the public, Konoe, Kido, and Hiranuma, have been removed from the palace and imprisoned. The remaining cabinet, which still maintains some contact with the public, is weak and on its last breath. MacArthur has frozen a large portion of the assets of the Emperor and the imperial family, further limiting the Emperor's privileges. The Allied Command's threat to Hirohito is akin to the treatment of financial cliques. The imposition of war taxes will impoverish Hirohito, and even his own farmland will be sold to ordinary farmers under the newly revised land reform law. In addition, MacArthur plans to order the Japanese government to cease its support for Shintoism and abolish its privileges.

Japanese conservatives note that while the Emperor remains on the throne, his potential imprisonment is increasing. MacArthur's arrest warrant for Prince Higashikuni has shattered the Japanese people's hope that the imperial bloodline would be exempt from arrest and trial. MacArthur had previously stated that whether Emperor or commoner, avoiding trial as a war criminal was impossible. The upcoming major trials in Yokohama have made Japanese conservatives uneasy. Today's "Stars and Stripes" newspaper of the U.S. Army reported that a huge rope has been newly placed on the gallows in Sugamo Prison, where approximately 500 Japanese war criminals and others related to initiating the war are being held.

Crown Prince's Birthday Celebration Canceled

[U.S. News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The celebration for the 13th birthday of Crown Prince Akihito on the 23rd of this month has been canceled at the Emperor's request. This is the first time a national holiday has been canceled. The cancellation is said to be based on the imperial family's "serious plan."

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Tokyo newspapers today published photos of Crown Prince Akihito going to school, with headlines stating that the Crown Prince is in good health and will graduate from the Gakushuin Elementary School next March. They also say that the Emperor is eager to ensure the Crown Prince learns the "way to be a person."

Japanese War Criminal in Hong Kong, Lieutenant Colonel Koga Arrested

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 15th] Japanese war criminal Lieutenant Colonel Koga, formerly the warden of Stanley Prison in Hong Kong, has been arrested in Guangzhou and handed over to the British. He was flown to Hong Kong and imprisoned in the same cell in Stanley Prison. One of the war crimes Koga is accused of is ordering the execution of 33 out of 41 individuals in Stanley Prison on October 19, 1943, who were accused of smuggling medicine and food and transmitting information in and out of prisoner-of-war and internment camps. The trial was conducted by the Japanese without interpreters. According to a memorandum issued by the British Army authorities, Koga was responsible for inflicting torture on prisoners and killing the innocent. As a result of his tyranny, hundreds, if not thousands, of people died in Hong Kong and Guangzhou.

### Local Dispatches

Kunshan

Kunshan-Jiao Zhi Ferries Robbed Simultaneously: The Kunshan-Jiao Zhi ferry was robbed by four plainclothes bandits armed with rifles near Zhangpu River Bend at around 10 AM on the 11th, with losses amounting to approximately one million yuan. On the same day, the Su-Kun ferry was also robbed by bandits in Xiedun, about five li from Jiao Zhi. None of the passengers escaped, and losses were extremely heavy. The authorities are currently investigating.

Changshu

Public Association Responsible for Procuring Military Rice: The provincial committee has sent members to Changshu to procure 60,000 shi of military rice. Originally, 30,000 shi were to be handled by the Grain Public Association, and the rest by the village chiefs from the farmers. Due to the past abuses of using the Baojia system for rice procurement during the enemy puppet era, it was decided that the entire amount would be handled by the Public Association to avoid misunderstandings among the farmers. During the procurement period, the export of rice is prohibited to avoid affecting rice prices.

Sealed Materials to Be Sold at Reduced Prices: Wheat, rapeseed, and other perishable enemy puppet materials sealed in this county will be opened, sorted, and sold at reduced prices after the provincial committee member Fang Junyuan comes to Changshu to confer with the county government and various agencies. The proceeds will be used for local education, sanitation, and charitable causes.

Wuxi

Suggestion to Expedite Repair of Qingwu Highway: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, noting the severe damage to highway bridges in various counties, has dispatched members to inspect and supervise repairs. Yesterday, members Wang Shihong and Lin Xiaofang, accompanied by Hu Tingji, head of the Construction Section of the County Government, went from Wuxi to Chengjiang to inspect the Xicheng and Qingwu Roads. Due to the severe damage to the Qingwu Road, the committee members are temporarily stationed in Qingyang to supervise the urgent repairs, which are to be completed by the 20th of this month. The Qingwu Road runs from Qingyang in Jiangyin to Henglin Town in Wujin. Most of the bridges along the road have been destroyed and need to be repaired, which may not be completed in a short time.

Hangzhou

All Circles Bid Farewell to Commander Gu: Commander Gu Shitong of the Third War Area stationed his troops in Hangzhou immediately after the Japanese surrender. Now, having received orders for a promotion, he is about to leave Hangzhou. Gu held a tea party at his official residence the other day to entertain leaders from all walks of life, and various circles have scheduled a farewell for tomorrow. Gu's departure is imminent. A portion of his troops will accompany Gu, while the rest will leave Hangzhou successively.

High Court Actively Trying Traitors: Cases of punishing traitors in Zhejiang Province have now been concentrated in the High Court, with no fewer than five or six hundred pending cases. Court sessions are being held day and night, with most resulting in death sentences or life imprisonment. Defendants are allowed to hire experienced lawyers to defend them, and those who cannot afford to hire lawyers are assigned lawyers by the court for free. Recently, many cases have been transferred to Hangzhou from various places, causing overcrowding in the prisons.

### U.S. Loan to Finland - $5 Million - For Importing U.S. Cotton

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 15th] The Export-Import Bank announced today that it has signed an agreement with the Finnish government and the Bank of Finland to provide a loan of $5 million to help Finland import approximately 46,000 bales of U.S. cotton. This loan to Finland is the first allocation of the $100 million total loan the Export-Import Bank decided in October to provide to European countries for purchasing U.S. cotton. The term of the loan for Finnish cotton is 15 months, the maximum period under the cotton export loan agreement. The loan interest rate will be 2.5% per week.

### President Truman's Salary Problem

[Associated Press, New York, 14th] President Truman's annual salary is only $75,000, while his expenses are enormous. If he does not make efforts to economize, he will surely be heavily in debt when he leaves office. White House Secretary Daniel recently published an article in Collier's magazine listing President Truman's unavoidable daily expenses. The minimum expenses are as follows: 1. Federal taxes $46,000; 2. Private expenses at the White House $25,000; 3. Missouri state taxes $1,000, totaling $72,000. After deducting the above expenses, there remains $3,000 to cover all other expenses. It is possible to spend all of his salary in a single week. Such expenses include the cost of food for the president's family and private guests, private tea party expenses, family cleaning and laundry fees, clothing purchases, and donations to the Democratic Party. In addition, President Truman's enthusiastic purchase of war bonds has set an example for the country, and he is constantly invited to speak by various fee-paying organizations and urged to assist by charitable organizations, leaving him no respite. If he accedes to every request, the President's annual salary could be spent in any given week. Of all the U.S. presidents, only Taft expressed dissatisfaction with the annual salary of $75,000. He told President Wilson that he managed to accumulate $100,000 in salary after four years, which was quite an achievement. However, even if the expenses of the White House today were the same as they were in Taft's time, President Truman would be fortunate to leave office with only $100,000 in debt, because President Truman has to pay $200,000 in federal and state taxes during his four-year term, while there was no such burden in Taft's time, so his savings were not entirely due to thrift. Presidents Roosevelt, Hoover, and Harding all had private wealth, Coolidge was exceptionally frugal, and Wilson's second wife was wealthy. Only President Truman has no private savings. Serving as President of the United States is the most difficult job in the world, but in terms of income, although the reputation is good, the salary is almost entirely returned to the people through taxes and the costs of living in the White House.

### The Days of Blood, the Cases of Blood: Ironclad Evidence of the Nanjing Massacre

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi

The world's poetic saint Dante had an eternal masterpiece, called "Inferno." Our Buddha Sakyamuni also told sentient beings that there is a hell in the human world. — But may I ask: Where is hell?

I will answer you: It is here.

I recently went to Nanjing and witnessed the tombs burying tens of thousands of corpses. I met survivors who had personally experienced the events eight years ago. Bringing up the old matters made my nerves twitch, and my speech was trembling. Not only that, but even as I write this dispatch, my pen is still shaking with my hand.

The Enemy Only Knew How to Kill

The 13th of this month was the eighth anniversary of the fall of Nanjing. When I arrived in Nanjing, which I had not seen for many years, a feeling of immense desolation washed over me. I immediately visited the Nanjing War Crimes Investigation Committee and learned that their investigation work is currently underway and proceeding smoothly, but they have very few staff. To date, they have collected over three hundred reports and documents. As I examined these documents, a hellish picture emerged before my eyes.

Li Mingwu, 59, an employee of the Chongshantang, has lived a hard life for the past eight years and is thin and frail. His son is currently serving in Chengdu. At that time, he and a group of elderly people, supported by their blended Buddhist-Taoist faith, bravely went to bury corpses, braving the enemy's insults and threats. He told me:

"The enemy only knew how to kill and never buried a single corpse."

He listed numerous atrocities he had witnessed and provided them to the Investigation Committee.

Women Were All Brutally Violated

Their sworn statements submitted to the Investigation Committee stated:

South Gate Bridge: Three women around the age of twenty, the upper part of their underclothes intact, their hands gripping their waistbands, the lower part of their underclothes torn, like disheveled silk, their eyes gouged out, their ears and noses cut off. They were subjected to torture and died for refusing to be raped. Their names are unknown.

There were as many as nine cases of women with separated limbs, staring angrily to their death, in places like Sanfang Lane and Huashi in Xinjekou, in the city.

In a thatched hut on the east side of the city wall inside Xingzhong Gate, there was an old woman in her sixties or seventies, her lower body swollen and broken, having been gang-raped to death.

A girl, about twelve or thirteen years old, lying on the side of the road behind Guyilang, her underclothes torn, her eyes closed and mouth open, dead.

By the roadside on Banshan Street, there were seven women around the ages of forty and sixty or seventy, their breasts pierced, their hair disheveled, their underclothes torn, their heads raised, their eyes wide open, their mouths open and teeth bared, dead.

A girl, about thirteen or fourteen years old, was lying dead north of Yangpi Lane, her abdomen ripped open, her intestines pulled out, her eyes wide open, bleeding from her mouth.

Below Huangni Ridge, there were over eighty male corpses and six female corpses lying scattered about. There were also two corpses of children. All had been stabbed to death with knives.

I casually perused a few sworn statements, and the tragic scenes on the streets of Nanjing at that time immediately became clear.

### Material Evidence and Testimony Confoundingly Mixed; The Cunning Enemy's Crimes Cannot Be Concealed

It must be pointed out here that these were all women and children. Japanese fascists created "achievements" on their bodies as a foundation for the "Greater East Asia New Order." But this was merely a small-scale massacre. The large-scale massacre was carried out after the occupation of Nanjing was announced. This is ironclad evidence of a planned massacre.

According to the "Battle Traces and Scenic Spots of Nanjing" compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, the number of "enemy" corpses abandoned was 53,874. The Japanese propaganda department is known for its skill in lying, and this time was no exception, but instead of exaggerating the "achievements," it downplayed them. This is because the number of "enemies" who died under their bayonets, bullets, and rapes, including women, children, youth, and prisoners of war, is simply unbelievable, but the published figure is less than 20%.

That booklet shamelessly wrote, "The Imperial Army achieved unprecedented great victories." Yes, this is the consequence of fascism!

According to the report of the Nanjing Red Swastika Society, they buried corpses between December 22nd, burying 129 corpses on the back mountain of Qingliang on the first day, and 109 corpses on Wangjiangji outside Zhonghua Gate. On December 28th, they collected 6,468 corpses at one time and buried them in Pude Temple outside Zhonghua Gate. Later, the number gradually increased to 9,721. Their work continued until the summer of the following year and was not yet completed. By the end of October, they finally summarized the numbers, totaling 43,071 male and female corpses. In addition, Chongshantang had a report that they organized four burial teams and worked for four months, burying a total of 112,267 corpses. Just adding these two numbers together, there are 155,338 corpses buried. When I first saw this number, I was simply shocked and incredulous: Could such a thing really happen in the world? And it happened in Nanjing. But this is indeed a fact, an ironclad fact. There are also the cremated corpses and other privately buried corpses, which are not included. But in any case, this number is already so far from the Japanese military's report, and this is also an ironclad fact. How could these "enemy" corpses exceed the published "achievements"? Clearly, there is a conspiracy, a cruel, vicious, and bloody story contained within, which the Japanese criminals are trying to cover up.

Now we can also present witnesses to accuse the crimes committed under the direct guidance of the criminal Iwane Matsui. We, the citizens of Nanjing, should have the right to come and try Iwane Matsui and declare his doom.

### The Enemy Fascist Army's Masterpiece: Large-Scale Mass Murder

Xiaguan is a painful term. The other day I met Lu Su, the inspector of the police department at that time, who had participated in street fighting. After being injured by bombing in Sanpailou on the 12th, he endured the pain and walked to Yijiangmen, climbing into the city.

He recorded his experiences at the time, writing:

"...After arriving at Shangwen Gate, the houses along the way had all been burned down. In the cold winter months, the north wind was biting. I hid in a pile of wheat straw, drinking river water to quench my hunger, struggling until the morning of the 16th. I saw a villager washing a summer cloth in the river. I called him over and asked about the situation outside. He said that there were many refugees living in Damaodong in Laohushan, about a mile away. I paid him seven yuan to carry me to the entrance of the cave. There were six policemen there, preparing breakfast with a bucket of porridge... The enemy was searching nearby, driving the cave dwellers to the roadside. The young men were dragged out one by one, and they said, 'Chinese soldiers,' and immediately shot more than twenty people. The six policemen were also unable to escape. I squatted on the ground, shouting several times, but they ignored me, continuing to serve the porridge. Fortunately, the order to assemble was given, and they abandoned me and left. That night, I was still in the cave. My fellow refugees treated each other like brothers, placing the young men at the bottom of the cave, while the white-haired children stayed at the entrance. The Japanese Kou came to search again, dragging away six people and stabbing them to death with bayonets on the river bank. That night, there was heavy machine gun fire in the Caoxie Gorge area, about twenty or thirty machine guns, for three consecutive hours. I suspected that the National Army was launching a counterattack. The next day, before dawn, two bloody people came, one being Squad Leader Feng of the Training Corps and the other being Guard Guo of the Security Team. They described their experience, and I learned that after the enemy entered the city, they had rounded up 57,410 prisoners of war and civilian refugees of both sexes, and ages, and confined them in several small villages under Mount Mufu, cutting off their food and drink, and many died of cold and starvation. On the night of the 16th, they used wire or rope to tie the legs of two people together, tied into bunches, formed four lines, and drove them to Caoxie Gorge in Xiaguan, where they were all mowed down with machine guns. At this time, the victims courageously shouted, 'Seize the guns, seize the guns!' so that corpses piled up like mountains, and the enemy again attacked with bayonets, and finally poured kerosene and set them on fire. Feng and Guo pretended to lie on the ground, covering their bodies with corpses. Feng was still stabbed in his right arm, and both of their clothes were burned... Honest people around the world: What kind of scene is this!"

This was not the only mass slaughter; this planned massacre took place throughout the city of Nanjing, meaning that the slaughter by the Japanese invaders on Chinese soil was of unprecedented scale. I have already pointed out the evidence that the enemy deliberately concealed their crimes, and these large numbers are only corroborating this point.

Xu Jingsen, a victim who lived at No. 4, Wutiaoxiang, Gulou, reported another mass slaughter. He wrote:

"On the morning of December 16, 1937, four enemy soldiers rushed into my house, searching for young men, and abducted dozens of young men living together. At that time, I witnessed groups of young people placed in Dafangxiang Square, arriving one after another. By dusk, there were tens of thousands of people (Miss Hua of Jinling University had accurate statistics). The enemy took four or five hundred people whose clothing was insufficient, and massacred them with machine guns near a pond. The rest were driven away, and those who fell behind were also shot."

This is another example of a large-scale collective slaughter. Another report stated:

"I personally witnessed the crimes of the enemy as follows: There was a young man named Xia Taisheng. On the afternoon of November 14, 1937, several enemy soldiers came to my house at the West Road entrance of the refugee area and forcibly dragged him away. Xia Taisheng, along with a group of young people, was escorted by enemy soldiers to the riverside in Xiaguan, where he was shot with machine guns."

This is an example of the slaughter of young people.

### Corpses and Tombs Throughout the City

As I write this, I feel ashamed, pained, and resentful. As a journalist recording history in the civilized age of the twentieth century, how could I have recorded such human behavior? Does anyone want to know what fascism is? To understand its political, economic, cultural, and military theories? Then this is it. Fascism is war, is beastliness, is slaughter! Fascism has now been declared to be at its end, but the tragic experience of mankind must be forever remembered and deeply pondered by every honest person in the world.

Corpses buried in suburban areas account for 62% of the total. At first, I did not understand the reason. Citizens who personally experienced it helped me solve this problem.

When the enemy troops were gathering their forces to attack the city, these massacres had not yet unfolded on a large scale. The people in the suburbs who had no chance to escape were later unable to enter the refugee area within the city (which was delineated by the International Committee organized by Miss Hua Qun and Bates after negotiating with the enemy army). They gathered in one place during the day, helping each other, but after being discovered, most of them met with disaster. They witnessed that these corpses were mostly shot in the back and died lying on the ground, and there were also some who were stabbed to death and lay sideways in pools of blood. In particular, the Japanese invaders often searched at night, and the people - especially the women - fled the villages in separate groups. When they heard gunshots, they hid in the haystacks. When the sky was bright, the Japanese invaders would look down from the heights and immediately discover them and shoot them with machine guns. The enemy invaders pursued them all over the mountains, and the faster women ran the denser the gun fire, resulting in more casualties.

### Sixty-Six-Year-Old Man Bitterly Recounts Tragic Experiences

Now, let's hear from Yi Yu, the director of Chongshan Hall. He is sixty-six years old this year, with paralyzed legs and difficulty walking. He was the person in charge of burying 110,000 corpses. He spoke with me twice, and I find it hard to believe that this ailing old man has done so much. I think someone like him should receive a government medal. Recently, he summarized and said:

"In the urban areas, there were more corpses with knife wounds than bullet wounds. In the suburbs, it was about the same. Wherever there was a female corpse, male corpses were found relatively far away. In the urban areas, corpses were often found in basements and at street corners. In rural areas, they were lying in the hundreds or dozens in drainage ditches, ponds, under the ridges of fields, and in the middle of haystacks. The scene was indescribably tragic, especially for the women. Some died resisting rape. Their faces were blue-black, their teeth were falling out, their cheeks were broken, blood flowed from their mouths, their breasts were cut off, their chests and abdomens were pierced, their intestines were dragging out, their lower abdomens were kicked, and their lower bodies were stabbed repeatedly with bayonets, to the point of being torn apart, their vaginas swollen and festering, and their lower abdomens bulging like..." The above two situations applied to young women around twenty years old and old women of sixty or seventy. There were even girls who were sodomized..."

Mr. Zhou didn't want to say anymore. He shook his head, remained silent for a moment, and continued, "It was truly a catastrophe! These beasts!"

This is a true picture of the Japanese invaders' cruelty to women.

The empty spaces inside and outside Nanjing were almost entirely filled with buried corpses. Now, Nanjing is filled with bright lights, revelry, and extravagant displays, more lavish than ever before. I have been visiting various tombs for days, and I cannot help but shed tears for those who suffered cruel killings by the Japanese invaders. Because they were buried hastily at the time, most of them had no markers and were exposed. Now, I will list the burial sites I have investigated below:

Wutaishan, from Hongtu Bridge to Beijige, east end of Zhuhqiao behind Guanyin Temple, north of Gu Bridge, Wolong Bridge Floating Building, city wall of Dazhong Bridge in Santiao Lane, east end of the park, north of the Floating Bridge area, foot of Fugui Mountain, east city wall of Yijiangmen, east city wall of Zhonghua Gate, city wall from Xingzhongmen to Xiaodongmen, city wall from Xiaofenfu to Lianziying, city wall from Dashu Cheng to Lanjiazhuang, barren vegetable gardens near the rain flower Flower God Temple outside Zhonghua Gate, barren vegetable gardens near Shanghe outside Shuixi Gate, barren vegetable gardens near Xiaoshanmen to Maqun, barren vegetable gardens near Tongjimen to Fangshan, Hou Mountain of Qingliang, Jinling University Farm, Qingliang Mountain Cemetery, Han Jiaxiang Xicang Mountain, Gulin Temple Mountain, Yinyangying South Xiu Village, North Xiu Village, Wangjiangji outside Zhonghua Gate, Gao Pi Bai Village, Pude Temple, Shangxinhe Black Bridge, Sandao Ganzi outside Shuixi Gate, Shangxinhe Sun Palace, Nansan Lane outside Shuixi Gate, Shangxinhe Er Geng, Shangxinhe Jiangdong Bridge, Shangxinhe Cotton Embankment, Guangdong Cemetery outside Hanxi Gate, Great King Temple outside Shuixi Gate, Xiaguan Dugu Lane, Central Stadium Cemetery, Shangxinhe Central Prison, Shangxinhe Guanyin Nunnery Open Space, Fenghuang Street Open Space, Erdao Ganzi outside Hanzhong Gate, Shangxinhe Beihekou Open Space, Jiujia Peng in Xiaguan, next to the Xiaguan Torpedo Military Camp, Xiaguan Caoxie Gorge Open Space, Xiaguan Torpedo Military Camp Pier, Xiaguan Shiliu Garden, below Mufu Mountain, Shangxinhe Wufu Village, Xiaguan Jiangjia Garden, Xiaguan East Battery, empty spaces inside and outside Shangyuan, southwest empty space of Sanwen River, next to Yongqing Temple outside Heping Gate, riverside of Xiaguan Coal Port, embankment behind Xiaguan Naval Hospital, Shangxinhe Ganlu Temple Open Space, top of Hua Peng Temple Mountain outside Zhonghua Gate, city wall outside Taiping Gate, west mountain of Anderli outside Zhonghua Gate, Shangxinhe Jiajia Mulberry Garden Open Space, riverside of Xiaguan Military Station, edge of Lao Jiangkou, riverside of Xiaguan Jiangtan.

### Traitor Gao Guanwu Erects a Stele; The Souls of the Dead Cannot Rest in Peace

The traitor Gao Guanwu (Municipal Superintendent of the puppet Reformed Government) also collected more than 3,000 skeletons in the Ma'anshan Linggu Temple area, deeply burying them in the east side of Linggu Temple, creating a rather beautiful "Tomb of Ownerless Lonely Souls" and engraving a stele with an inscription. When he came to collect the bones, it was already December of the 27th year [1938]. The corpses of the murdered only had bones remaining, and the large-scale burial work in Nanjing had already been done by the people. Gao Guanwu shamelessly wrote on the stele:

"Gentlemen, you suffered the chaos of the times, your flesh and blood nourished the wilderness, your bones were left on the mounds, whether as soldiers or civilians, men or women, old or young, with or without descendants, none can know. The greatest pain in life is to live without support and die without mourning, especially for those like you whose bones lie exposed and without support. Although life and death are ordained, and the length of life is determined, inquiring as if violating human principles, Peng and Shang can be equalized, all return to dust. What people strive for is not the brevity of years, but the immortal virtues and spirit..."

Bah! This is simply the greatest insult, and it contains a propaganda of peaceful conspiracy. He emphasizes "bones lying exposed and without support," which is tantamount to saying that they were well-massacred by the Japanese invaders. This stele is still standing there. If it is not destroyed, and the traitors are not killed, the souls of these victims will not be able to rest in peace for a single day.

After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Chinese prisoners of war in Nanjing were liberated. Among them were those who had been captured in Nanjing, now only thirty-six in number. But they included almost all units that participated in the street fighting in Nanjing at the time. They told me the most cruel story: the Japanese invaders burned alive two thousand people, including prisoners of war and civilians, on Purple Mountain. This day was December 12th, the day before the fall of Nanjing.

It is not easy to ascertain the exact number of people killed by the Japanese invaders, but according to my on-site investigation, the estimated figure is at least 250,000 people successively murdered on land, and 100,000 people directly or indirectly murdered in the river. The Japanese invaders' reporting department claimed: "The naval forces, after opening the Yangtze River, arrived at Xiaguan on the evening of the 13th, and the elite of the army and navy were completely deployed."

The massacre at Xiaguan was precisely the "masterpiece" of the Japanese army and navy. In order to clearly and understandably hold trials, it is necessary to severely try them, and in order to wash away the great shame of humanity, it is also necessary to severely try them.

### Small Airplanes Displayed in New York Department Stores

Inside a New York department store, a single-seat private airplane is on display, named "Ercoupe," priced at $995, and reservations can be made at the store. The wings are twenty feet long, and with a full tank of gas, it can fly for three hours. The engine is 55 horsepower, consuming three gallons of fuel per hour. The normal speed is 100 to 105 miles per hour, and the maximum speed is 115 to 120 miles per hour. The entire body is made of metal.

### How Tragic This Scene!

The stubborn and wicked Japanese soldiers, at the end of 1937, with their ammunition full, massacred hundreds of thousands of defenseless citizens of Nanjing. This massacre can truly serve as a typical example of the Japanese invasion of China. (Top) The image shows: The tragic state of the Chinese people after being brutally killed, their intestines dragged out, even women and children could not escape their bitter fate. (Bottom) The image shows: The Japanese army created a dark and terrifying world, yet they "boasted" of their "great achievements." (A gift publication from the News World Society)

Sunday Forum

### On the Kunming Student Protests

— Zhang Shizhao

The Kunming student protests began on the evening of November 25th with a speech meeting at the four major universities. The topic was opposition to the civil war, and more than 6,000 teachers and students attended. The speech was not finished when the lights were cut off, and gunfire erupted outside the wall, with bullets flying like hailstones. The meeting ended prematurely, and the students were greatly angered. They claimed that the government was interfering with freedom of assembly and speech, and they rallied and called for action, and their momentum grew stronger. Conflicts between students from the Second Army Officer Corps and students from major universities were frequently heard. On December 1st, hand grenades caused casualties. The perpetrators were soon identified as Chen Qida and Liu Youzhao, and they were arrested, both retired soldiers. Their confessions were suspicious, and suspicions grew even more. One side said it was a plot by reactionary elements to provoke discord, while the other side believed that it was instigated by special forces. Chairman Chiang issued a telegram to the students urging them to resume classes, but initially, it did not have much effect. The Provincial Garrison Commander Guan Linzheng resigned, or rather, it seemed that way in writing. Finally, the main culprits who threw the grenades were brought to justice, and the anger subsided somewhat. Alas! Who did it? Who caused it? Since the May Fourth Movement, this type of phenomenon has been commonplace. But in the early days of constitutional government, how should it be explained? What kind of cause and effect does it have? Different people have different views. Based on my humble knowledge, I would like to offer my opinions.

Recently, the government has proclaimed the implementation of constitutional government, and the preparations of institutions and the exhortations of proclamations are almost all that are required. But in reality, has the end of tutelage government and the beginning of constitutional government reached a point where water flows to form a canal? What is the government's true intention? What are the people detecting from the government? Anyone on the street can tell you: constitutional government is just a name, and the government's true intention is definitely not this. The officials surrounding the government tell each other: constitutional government is just a name, and the head of state's true intention is definitely not this. Even the strategists who lead the trend whisper: constitutional government is just a name, we are using this name to deceive people, and the true level of the people is not worth considering. They come with a name, we respond with a name, creating a chaotic situation, like a hostage situation. Taking this case as an example: from the garrison commander to the students of the military officer corps, how could they not know that freedom of speech is the foundation of constitutional government, and that the country has no explicit laws to suppress dissent, and what is wrong with opposing the civil war? But there is a hidden mastermind who believes that suppressing speech, restricting freedom, and suppressing the anti-civil war faction to prevent them from advocating for the Communists is the central government's true intention, and it is their duty. Even if the government is bound by public opinion and pressured by foreign countries, it cannot but deem this action wrong, so it approves it secretly while condemning it openly. The path to fame and fortune lies in this, so what is there to fear not doing? On the other hand, a few cunning individuals today are exploiting the weaknesses of young people, using names as a pretext, and recklessly inciting. Once they achieve their goals, the system will be at stake, and what they once opposed will become forbidden, and they will even become more unscrupulous, turning the power and position into something inevitable. As the saying goes: if the father kills, the son will rob. By examining similar cases, we can know what will happen in the future.

Cao Cao issued an order to seek talent, specifically looking for those who could use gold to buy talented people to serve the world. Official positions were established, such as the Colonel of Gold and the General Who Excavates Tombs. This made serving as emperor and waging war into one thing. There is probably no second emperor who did this. However, its effectiveness is more direct than seeking talent while plotting to steal. As the Book of Rites says: Yao and Shun led the world with benevolence, and the people followed them. Jie and Zhou led the world with tyranny, and the people followed them. If what they commanded was contrary to what they loved, the people would not follow. The Han Dynasty's Fifth Lun said: Those who teach by example are followed, and those who teach by words are debated. The Song Dynasty's Su Shi also said: The people do not follow the orders of their superiors, but their intentions. If there is disharmony between words and actions, or if there is a clear discrepancy between orders and intentions, stubbornly adhering to the words and orders to control the people, and if the signs and phenomena of contradiction are everywhere, like a beast trapped in mud, impossible to hide, how can one win the hearts of the people and unify their will? I don't know.

If the above principles are clear, the crux of the matter is obvious. Who would dare to say that the Kunming student protests were definitely a way to outwardly defy the government's orders but secretly fulfill the government's intentions? And yet the people of the world are talking, and everyone is watching, and they have broken the government's intentions and orders into two pieces. Even if they had the tongues of Su Qin and Zhang Yi, they could not argue. I clearly do not understand why this is the case. Mencius said: How can the world be at peace? It is settled by unity. I believe that the heroes of the past were able to unify the world. Someone like Chairman Chiang today is hard to find in ancient and modern times. First, he led the people to fight bitterly for eight years, saving the country from the brink of extinction. Then, he used determination to lay the foundation for the country's ten thousand years of future, advancing the country to the realm of freedom and equality. Without the previous determination, there would be no way to begin the latter determination; all of the latter determination would continue the previous determination. Words are like ropes, and achievements are like mountains and rivers. What benefit is there in not showing sincerity to heaven and future generations? If we know that Su Zidan's words are outdated and that someone is executing the highest orders incompletely, not examining and restraining their own actions, leading to doubts and slanders arising invisibly, and spreading confusion among the masses, then there is no other reason.

Then what can be done? I say: All affairs of the family and the country cannot be done without being literate. Sincerity leads to clarity, and clarity leads to sincerity. How to handle this case is but a trivial matter. Even if the facts are slightly different, it does not matter much. I only hope that honesty will help the authorities to be clear and to increase their future sincerity. Thus, the great clarity and sincerity of the head of state will shine throughout the world and never fade. As for the people not knowing how to make good use of freedom, everyone knows that. Unlimited freedom, closely following ten years of tutelage government restraints, also tends to be chaotic and without restraint, leading to unruliness. How to properly control this, starting with the perfection of constitutional government, is another question, which I will discuss further later.

### New Exchange Rate Expected to be Announced Next Week; US Dollars and Gold Bullion Both See Firmness

B-Type Bonds Briefly Surpass 600 Mark

According to reports, the new exchange rate has been decided by the Supreme Economic Council, and will be announced within the next week. People have different views on the exchange rate (similar to that provided in the fourth issue of the Economic Weekly) for US dollar cash, with varying approaches and slight hesitation. The market opened with the momentum from the previous close, and short selling was rampant, with prices falling to 700,300. Banks saw low prices and gradually purchased, maintaining the 700,000 mark. Prices gradually stabilized. By noon, short sellers covered their positions, briefly pushing prices up to over 730,000. In the end, it stagnated with no significant changes, closing slightly up 5,000 from the previous close. Gold jewelry was priced at 78,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars remained between 440 and 450. Black market discounts were sluggish due to speculation, falling to 6% and 8%.

Foreign Exchange: US dollars, with the difference between the closing price of gold bullion in the wartime capital and cash reaching 685 yuan per ten taels, and rumors that the general view of the new exchange rate in that area would not exceed 1,350 yuan, prompted sellers. The market opened below 1,200 yuan, and arbitrage sales increased, reaching a low of 1,165 yuan. At this time, the arbitrage spread had narrowed to over 600 yuan. The gold market in Taiwan recovered, and major players rushed to buy, gradually rising back to over 1,220 yuan. The result was no significant change from the previous close. The supply and demand of Hong Kong dollars were balanced. Guangdong dealers were gradually paying attention to old goods, slightly up from the previous day, while new goods remained flat.

Securities: Public bonds were initially very quiet. When internal bonds were about to fall below the 500 yuan mark, major players in the market purchased to maintain the price, gradually showing improvement. By noon, a certain bank on Sichuan Road suddenly sold a large amount of gold and purchased bonds, aggressively purchasing over 5 million B-type bonds. The narrow price market suddenly saw a spectacle, surging to over 600 yuan. However, unpopular miscellaneous stocks were unable to keep up due to time constraints, and the price difference widened significantly. The result was an increase of 15 to 80 yuan from the previous day. The trend is under manipulation, and efforts will be made to raise prices further.

China Merchants Bank gradually attracted the attention of major players, so large stocks were quite firm. Smaller stocks lacked sustained power from retail investors, and were quite popular in the middle of the day, but were sold off at the close. As a result, the Shanghai Cotton Mill and American Asian Corporation rose from the previous close, while the three small mills saw slight declines.

Foreign stocks remained stable, hovering around the opening price. Affected by the gold market, they were sluggish, but there was no shortage of investors buying at low prices. Therefore, each unpopular stock was bid for at 10% lower than the closing price.

### A Glimpse of the Market "Situation"

Grains Slightly Weak: Yesterday, all grains saw declines. Rice market production prices remained firm, but the Shanghai market was sluggish, with production and consumption moving in opposite directions. White japonica and indica rice saw a decline of 100 to 200 yuan, but white yuan rice was the only bright spot, with prices rising 300 to 400 yuan. The oil market was similar, fluctuating up and down. Shipments from Qingdao continued to arrive, and sentiment softened, with prices falling by a small amount of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply and demand of flour was weak, and the market was stable. Actual consumption of yellow soybeans was sluggish, with prices down a small amount of 200 to 300 yuan. Raw peanuts were still being increased for slaughter. Soybean cake was flat at 100 yuan. Wine prices were stable, with few arrivals and sales.

Yarn Market Stable: Yesterday, the yarn market briefly fell by 10,000 to 20,000 in the morning, but then recovered as local dealers were keen to purchase 16-count yarn, and prices rose. The result was 10,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The trend of fine yarn and thread was quite mediocre, about 20,000 yuan lower than the previous day. The ups and downs of 10-count and 20-count yarn were mixed. The yarn market is currently in a period of consolidation.

Foreign Tea Merchants Active: The tea market is driven by tea factories rushing to produce foreign tea, which is in high demand, and local and Suzhou-Wuxi dealers are continuing to sell, and the market is firm. Local foreign tea merchants are preparing for export trade, and have decided to standardize products, dividing them into three grades: superior, medium, and secondary. Superior black tea is Qimen, green tea is Longjing, and scented tea is Huizhou baked tea. Medium and secondary grades are limited to ordinary market sales. In the future, transactions will be based on the above-mentioned product names.

Coal Sales Soften: Although coal sales are gradually becoming more active, the underlying trend is still softening. Following the Jin-Hu line in Zhenjiang and other places, it was previously heard that coal prices in Shanghai were high, and people rushed to collect coal stored in that area and transport it to Shanghai, waiting for good prices. Now that it has arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai coal price has rebounded, making it even more difficult for the coal market to recover. A large batch of dry pine firewood from Ningbo has arrived, priced at around 900 yuan, making it even harder to sell the previously arrived damp firewood, and prices have fallen again.

North-South Goods: Black dates and walnuts are supported by customer demand, and the market is firm. A large number of spring bamboo shoots were loaded on the China Prosperity Wheel, but unfortunately it sank in a thunderstorm, so prices are still stable, but the trend is still weak. The impact of gold prices is making people uncertain about foreign miscellaneous and seafood products, leading to less trading. Since the offering of glutinous rice branches, the initial asking prices were too high, so it did not open. However, only a small number of self-operated goods were sold at 123,000 yuan, making it difficult to guarantee capital. Yesterday, a batch was finally opened, priced at 145,000 yuan. After sorting out broken shells, it is estimated that it will need to be sold for 180,000 yuan to be profitable. Regarding the sugar market, the initial plan was to load flour to Taiwan in exchange for sugar, but the Taiwanese authorities prohibited sugar exports, so it was unsuccessful. Furthermore, the China Prosperity Wheel had an accident in transit, resulting in significant losses, so the sugar market is tight.

### Stock of Cloth: 1.4 Million Bolts

[Our Newspaper News] Among the various enemy and puppet materials, approximately 40,000 bolts of cloth have been sold at a low price since the flat sale. 50,000 bolts were shipped to Chongqing and 100,000 bolts to Taiwan, totaling less than 200,000 bolts. However, the suppression of market prices has been quite effective. It is rumored that there are still 1.2 million bolts in stock. Since the reopening of the city's textile factories, production has reached more than 100,000 bolts, and this does not include the clothing cloth supplied by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The supply of cotton cloth is very optimistic.

### Two Major Textile Companies: Both Organized

[Our Newspaper Special News] Recently, two major textile companies have been established in this city. One is the Zhongxin Textile Company, with a capital of 450 million legal tender, which is a joint-stock company, all subscribed by the promoters Chen Hanwen and others in one go, without further share offerings. The other company is the Damei Textile Enterprise Co., Ltd., initiated by Wang Xiaolai and others, with a capital of 500,000 yuan, all subscribed by the promoters in one go, specializing in the business of machine cotton, silk, wool, silk, and rayon textiles, and related businesses.

### Commercial Registration Postponed

[Our Newspaper News] The person in charge of the Industry and Commerce Registration Office of the Social Affairs Bureau recently told reporters that this city-wide industry and commerce registration does not include companies, so it is planned to be completed within six months. Therefore, the registration deadline for each district may be slightly shorter. Now, for the convenience of the business community, the first batch of registrations has been extended to the 20th of this month, but the deadline for the completion of all registrations may also be extended to more than one year. At present, to facilitate matters, some guilds have been allowed to list shop names in accordance with the district method, collect registration forms in batches, and distribute them on their behalf.

### Arbitration Committee Elected: Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Xuefan, etc.

[Our Newspaper News] Since the restoration, prices have fluctuated greatly, and enemy and puppet factories have not been able to fully resume work. The number of unemployed workers is very large, resulting in labor unrest, which has not been completely eliminated. The Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the City Chamber of Commerce and the General Labor Union to each nominate 24 arbitration committee members in accordance with Article 16 of the Labor Disputes Handling Law, so that if mediation is ineffective, the municipal government can be requested to convene a meeting to arbitrate. The Chamber of Commerce is said to have nominated Wang Xiaolai and 24 others, and the General Labor Union has nominated Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, and 24 others.

### Mobil and Other Companies Continue to Supply: Gasoline, Diesel, and Machine Oil

Second Batch of Kerosene Flat Sale to Begin Next Week

Since Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco Oil Company began selling civilian kerosene at a low price, the sales of foreign candles in the market have disappeared. After the first batch of these companies has been sold out, the second batch has been scheduled to continue next week, stipulating 2 kilograms per person, 100 yuan per kilogram in legal tender. In addition, the gasoline of the three companies has also been sold, with each gallon temporarily set at 400 yuan in legal tender. There are also a considerable number of diesel and machine oil arrivals, which will soon be launched for sale. All factories for proper use can register first. The price of light diesel is said to be 86,000 yuan per ton, heavy diesel is 70,000 yuan per ton, large buckets of machine oil are 1,800 yuan per gallon, and small cans are 2,000 yuan per gallon. Therefore, the current fuel panic can be partially resolved. [Dagong News Agency]

Shanghai Cost of Living Index for November

There are two cost of living indexes in Shanghai, one compiled by the former National Regulations Committee and the other compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. After the Incident, the former has long been suspended. The latter has been able to continue with the efforts of the chief editor. However, due to the rampant rise in prices, the former Public Works Bureau and the enemy and puppet period did not allow publication to avoid stimulating people's minds. Now, because the government is about to publish on schedule, and the Wage Assessment Committee has also used this index as a powerful basis for assessment, the Chinese worker and staff indexes for November are published below. The Western part is omitted, but the total index is recorded as 96,613.99, which is 17.1% higher than October and 965 times higher than the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. (Base period: 100 in the 25th year of the Republic (calculated in legal tender)).

Education and Sports

### Overseas Chinese Education Restoration Plan: War-Time Overseas Chinese School Losses to Be Compensated by the Japanese; Emphasis on Future Teacher Selection, Training, and Development

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch] The Ministry of Education's post-war restoration work for overseas Chinese education has formulated a plan. The losses suffered by all schools in enemy-occupied areas are being separately investigated and registered. These losses will be compensated by the enemy. The plan particularly emphasizes the selection, training, and development of teachers for overseas Chinese schools in Southeast Asia in the future. Currently, the registration of teachers in overseas Chinese schools in various parts of Southeast Asia is being carried out step by step to facilitate further examination and short-term training. In addition, a special training class for overseas Chinese education teachers will be established at the National Teachers College, as well as an overseas Chinese normal school. A training class for Party ideology teachers for overseas Chinese schools will be established at the Central Political School, selecting domestic university graduates to undergo six months of training to serve as Party or history and geography teachers in overseas Chinese schools in Southeast Asia.

### University of Nanking to Relocate to Nanjing Next May

[Our Newspaper Chengdu Dispatch] University of Nanking, one of the thirteen Chinese Christian universities, has a glorious history of fifty-seven years. During the Anti-Japanese War, faculty, staff, library, and equipment were completely relocated to the rear. The current campus is located at Huaxi Dam in Chengdu, and some facilities have been expanded. Over the past two years and recently, the Joint Board of Trustees of Chinese Christian Universities and the Christian Higher Education Association have held multiple meetings in New York, Chongqing, and Chengdu to plan for the post-war development of each university. It has recently been decided that the four universities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou will be merged into one school, making a total of ten schools, with University of Nanking given priority status. University of Nanking and Yenching University are designated to run graduate schools, with University of Nanking also running and expanding the electro-optical education department. To expedite the return to Nanjing, the school has shortened the current semester, which will end on January 4th next year. Immediately after the end, the spring semester will begin, preparing for the relocation to Nanjing in early May. (Yuan)

### American University Student Enrollment Soars This Year

[United States Information Service, Washington, 14th Dispatch] The U.S. Department of Education announced this week that university enrollment this fall has increased by approximately 25% compared to last year. According to statistics obtained after the department surveyed 1,700 schools, this year's enrollment is approximately 950,000 students. Last year's enrollment was approximately 750,000 students. The pre-war enrollment in 1939-1940 was 1.4 million students (that year had one of the highest pre-war enrollments).

### Hunan University Establishes Surrender Hall; Victory Arch Erected in Front of Science Building

[Central News Agency Changsha, 15th Dispatch] Hu Shuhua, President of National Hunan University, has renamed the school's science building, where General Wang Yaowu accepted the Japanese surrender for the Changheng region, as Surrender Hall, displaying various souvenirs and war trophies from the surrender ceremony. A Victory Arch has also been erected in front of the building as a memorial.

### Brief News

The Shanghai University Alumni Association held a Christmas social gathering last night at the Kangle Restaurant, elected next term's officers, and launched a fundraising campaign for a 50 million yuan school restoration fund.

The Xiang Yao Elementary and Middle School in this city has been reorganized this semester, with Zhou Fei becoming the chairman responsible for the school. Shao Rugan, Chai Zifei, and others have been appointed as school directors, and Tang Jingxiu as the principal. However, Principal Tang recently resigned, and Gu Xudong has been appointed as acting head.

According to Chongqing news, the student union and alumni association of the National Women's Normal College held a reception for women's circles in Chongqing at the Social Hall to report on the school's situation and the progress of the petition to the Ministry of Education regarding the school's relocation, unanimously supporting the school's relocation to the capital.

Due to the lack of a president at St. John's University in this city, a committee temporarily formed by professors Wu Qingtai, Tang Zhongmo, and Wei Xiben is responsible. Bu Fangji, the former president of the school, sent a telegram from Chongqing, inviting the staff and students to Shanghai around February of next year. Upon hearing this, the teachers and students were very excited.

It is reported that the Shanghai Education Bureau has recently agreed to allocate the school building of the former Fifth National School of Japan, located at the intersection of Qimei Road and Sida Road in Hongkou District, as the school building for Zhongzheng Middle School.

The Shanghai Education Bureau has decided to establish a municipal normal school for kindergarten teachers at 404 Yuyuan Road. Chen Heqin, the director of the Supervision Department, will temporarily serve as the principal. It is currently scheduled to recruit 150 new students on the 20th, and applicants must have a junior high school diploma. At the same time, 300 elementary school students and 100 kindergarten students will also be recruited.

### An Interview with Mr. Li Denghui

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, amid the cries for restoration, universities and colleges that had moved west have been discussing their return to their original locations. According to news that a committee has been established in Shanghai for the restoration of National Fudan University, our reporter specially interviewed Mr. Li Denghui, the former president of Fudan University, at his private residence in Ruisun Village on Avenue Joffre. He provided detailed information as follows:

During the enemy's occupation, the Fudan University Preparatory Department in Shanghai adhered to three principles: (1) not to compromise with the enemy; (2) not to accept subsidies from the enemy; and (3) to close down if unable to maintain operations. Keeping in communication with President Zhang in Chongqing, they pursued the same path through different means, finally reaching today's bright road.

Original School Buildings

The original Jiangwan campus buildings, such as the dormitories for male and female students and the gymnasium, have been completely destroyed. The remaining damaged parts have been repaired by the puppet Shanghai University during its occupation and can still be used. The Fudan University Preparatory Department moved the Department of Civil Engineering and the Department of Chemistry back to the Jiangwan campus at the beginning of last month to hold classes. A large barracks built by the Japanese invaders on the western side of the campus, which could accommodate thousands of people, is currently being used by the National Army. Once they withdraw, it can be reclaimed for our own use.

Date of Return

The return of the entire main campus from Beibei, Chongqing, is expected to take place during the sweet-scented osmanthus season next year. President Zhang flew from Chongqing to Shanghai last month to discuss the restoration of the school, established a restoration committee, and actively proceeded with various tasks. He also inspected the new campus site in Wuxi with the educational authorities.

New Site in Wuxi

The planning for it started long before the war. The Wuxi campus is located next to Taihu Lake, with an area of 1,014 mu, which is twice the size of the Beibei and Jiangwan campuses combined. It is only a 40-minute journey from the city, offering tranquility in a bustling area. The 36,000 hectares of Taihu Lake, with its scenic beauty, provide ample opportunities for cultivating character and broadening horizons. This is the best environment. In this environment, there are few who cannot be made into talents. As the saying goes, "The land is fertile, and the people are outstanding." However, it is still an empty space, and completion is still pending.

Merger of Chongqing and Shanghai Campuses

Currently, the Fudan University Preparatory Department in Shanghai is divided into four colleges, with a total of more than 1,400 students. The main campus in Chongqing is divided into five colleges, with a total of more than 2,500 students. After the complete relocation next year, it will be merged with the Shanghai campus. The freshmen will first attend classes in Wuxi. Before the school buildings are completed, temples and ancestral halls nearby will be temporarily borrowed.

Rescheduling of the Anniversary

Fudan University has been established for 40 years. This year, it was preparing to hold the 40th anniversary celebration. Due to the distance between Shanghai and Chongqing, the celebration has been postponed to next year and will be held at the same time. At that time, I (Li Denghui) will retire, and President Zhang will take over the overall responsibility for the school's affairs, he said.

The reporter was deeply impressed by this 73-year-old educator, with his white hair and kind smile, speaking eloquently without any sign of fatigue. I respectfully record this to enrich our publication. (Jin Yuan)

### Sino-American Charity Basketball Game Opens Last Night to Unprecedented Success; China United and China Youth Secure Victories; China United vs. O'Sinas Tonight

The Sino-American charity basketball game, co-sponsored by our newspaper and Tongde College to raise scholarship funds, opened last night at the old Jai Alai Stadium. China United and China Youth secured victories, and the scene along Avenue Edward VII was unprecedented. Enthusiastic basketball fans eager to support education scrambled to attend. Two exciting games will continue tonight at 7:30 PM. Here is a report on last night's games:

Pan Opens the Game

The game began at 7:30 PM, with China United facing the American Marine Corps. Mr. Pan Gongzhan personally performed the opening tip-off. After Mr. Pan tossed the ball, the battle began. China United started with its ideal five players. The American Marine Corps' skills were slightly inferior, and China United took the lead, eventually gaining an absolute advantage with a score of 23 to 6. The American Marine Corps was at a loss. China United then replaced all players with fresh troops. In the first half, China United still led with 27 to 16. In the second half, the American Marine Corps once narrowed the gap to 33 to 27, but China United was not a weak team after all, and ultimately won 46 to 34, with China United easily defeating the American Marine Corps.

One-Point Victory

In the second game, China Youth was originally scheduled to face the American Sea Bees, but the latter was unable to attend due to circumstances. Instead, the American Marine Corps fought in their place, with Mr. Hao Gengsheng performing the opening tip-off. Relying on their height advantage, the American Marine Corps, China Youth worked hard to be cautious, trailing closely behind. At 20 to 17, China Youth suddenly saw an opportunity. Chen Qingjiang scored one point with two free throws, initially taking the lead with 21 to 20. In the first half, China Youth managed to win by a narrow margin of one point, 23 to 22. In the second half, China Youth fought more bravely, with the score fluctuating back and forth. The audience cheered and encouraged them non-stop. With the score tied at 36, China Youth was extremely cautious. Zhang Jinxuan's final shot resulted in a victory of one point, 38 to 36.

Tonight's Great Battle

The same two games will be held at the same venue starting at 7:30 PM tonight. Tickets are priced at 400 yuan for general admission and 1,000 yuan and 3,000 yuan for honorary tickets. Mr. Wang Xiaoyu will perform the opening tip-off. The schedule for today has been revised as follows:

American Sea Bees vs. China Youth 7:30 PM

O'Sinas vs. China United 8:30 PM

The strength of the Sea Bees is unknown. The battle between O'Sinas and China United is expected to be one of the most exciting scenes. O'Sinas is the champion team in the American military league and has a strong team. China United is no less than the representative of the Chinese team. This game is a battle for the Sino-American championship, and fans will not easily let go of this opportunity. It is expected that there will be an unprecedented spectacle today.

### How to Rectify Private Schools in This City

— Taking Traditions First

Shanghai is a relatively developed area in China for education. The reason for this development is that in addition to a few municipal schools, there are also a large number of private schools. Their quality can affect the entire educational situation of this city. Now the City Education Bureau is sending personnel to inspect various schools. We take this opportunity to say a few words.

We believe that although the number of schools in Shanghai (in terms of primary and secondary schools) is not small, there are few that are substantial in content and many that are poor. There are certainly many schools that are run for local education, but there are also schools that are run as businesses. Because the government authorities cannot yet provide universal education, private schools should be encouraged. However, there are many bad schools that go beyond what is reasonable. We hope that the education authorities will ruthlessly ban them.

A good school requires three conditions: First, fair and effective administrative staff; second, good teachers; and third, sufficient funding. We now find two types of schools among the private schools in Shanghai:

One type is the school that has fair and effective administrative staff and excellent teachers, but they have the ability and enthusiasm to run the school and suffer from economic pressure, which prevents their school from developing properly. For this type of school, we hope that the education authorities will provide financial assistance. In the education administrative budget, in addition to the funding for municipal schools, add a private school subsidy.

There is another type of school where funding is not a big problem, but there is no good principal or teacher. Because the principal's finances are not transparent, they lower teachers' salaries and reduce the number of class hours for students, making it impossible for good teachers to stay. I heard that in a school in Nanshi, teachers' salaries are only about 40,000 yuan in puppet currency per month. There is also an elementary school with six grades that only uses two teachers, using a "three-grade combined" system, and the salary is only 300,000 yuan in puppet currency. We hope that the education authorities will immediately order such schools to close down!

### Friendship Soccer Tournament Awards Ceremony Today; Donghua and British Navy Perform

Donghua will play a special exhibition game against a British Navy mixed team. Tickets are 200 yuan.

### Privately Operated Water and Electricity Plants Returned Separately

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Since the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company was taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, it has returned the privately operated water and electricity plants previously occupied by the enemy and puppets to their original owners. The Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi branches have also been completely taken over. There are a total of twelve warehouses, storing a large number of water and electricity materials. It is reported that it will be formally handed over to the Resources Committee soon.

The various water and electricity plants belonging to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company have suffered heavy losses over the past eight years and are currently undergoing vigorous repairs. According to the person in charge of the company, there is a significant shortage of water and electricity materials. They are currently applying for assistance from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Therefore, the entire Zhabei area is currently being supplied with electricity by the British-owned Shanghai Power Company. It is feared that it will take two to three months to fully restore all water and electricity plants. It is reported that the company's application to the financial authorities for a loan of 300 million yuan has not yet received formal approval documents.

### First Batch of American Women's Auxiliary Corps Leaves Shanghai to Return Home

The first batch of thirty members of the American Women's Auxiliary Corps, who came to China to work, left China yesterday to return to the United States. General Stratemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Air Force in China, personally went to the Huangpu River pier to shake hands and say goodbye to them. The American ship General Scott, on which they were traveling, carried a total of more than 3,000 American soldiers, making it the largest ship to transport American troops back to the country. During the war, the Women's Auxiliary Corps traveled back and forth between the front and rear, making significant contributions to the war effort. There are currently hundreds of people working in Shanghai. The female soldiers leaving Shanghai to return to the country today are the first batch.

### Eighteen Tankers to Arrive in Shanghai Soon

According to shipping industry sources yesterday, eighteen ships sailing from the Philippines and Australia to Shanghai are all tankers. One of them may arrive in Shanghai within days.

Harbor Freight

The British-owned Far East Shipping Management Office, acting as an agent for Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng Wheel, re-sailed from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 6th of this month and arrived in Hong Kong on the 10th. Both import and export goods have been completely loaded and unloaded. It returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong for the second time yesterday and is expected to arrive at the port next Tuesday. The Taikoo Company's Beihai Wheel is reportedly loaded with relief supplies from Hankou and sailed to Haifeng, Shanwei, and Shantou to unload the cargo before sailing to Shanghai.

Transport of Materials to Chongqing

The Minquan Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday. It was originally scheduled to sail to Yichang next Tuesday, but it is now known that the ship will set sail early tomorrow morning. This time, a large number of gauze, hardware, and commercial goods will be transported to Yichang for transshipment to Chongqing. The Jiangshun Wheel is also scheduled to sail to Hankou tomorrow morning. The commercial goods are mainly 1,000 tons of coal to be transported to Hankou. Passengers must board the ship tonight before the two ships set sail at dawn tomorrow morning. The Dahua Wheel returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday, bringing a large amount of local products from eastern Zhejiang. It is scheduled to continue sailing to Wenzhou and Dinghai on the 18th.

### Former French Concession Police Commissioner Chareyre Arrested

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Chareyre, the former police commissioner of the French Concession, has been arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command for engaging in large-scale espionage activities for Germany and Japan during the enemy-puppet era. The suspect used reports from French Concession police personnel to provide the enemy with our military and political intelligence. It is reported that during the "August 13th" Incident, Chareyre reported our military situation to the Japanese side to facilitate the enemy's landing strategy at the time. Before his arrest, the suspect claimed to the arresting personnel that he was of French nationality and therefore not under our jurisdiction.

### Shanghai Local Association Welcomes Envoys Ye and Niu

Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, the Shanghai Local Association held a reception for Envoys Ye and Niu on the sixth floor of the Pudong Building. Over a hundred people attended, including Ye Chucang, Niu Yongjian, Chen Xing, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Xiaolai, and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors. The association's chairman, Du Yuesheng, delivered the following welcome speech:

Du Yuesheng's Welcome Speech

Since Shanghai's restoration, high-ranking central government officials have visited one after another, providing invaluable guidance, which has greatly inspired the citizens. Despite his myriad daily responsibilities, the Chairman cares deeply for the people of Jiangnan. He has specially dispatched two envoys from afar to Shanghai to convey his virtuous intentions, offer comfort, and express his concern, for which we are extremely grateful. The two envoys are highly respected for their age and virtue, and are veterans of the party and the nation. Furthermore, being natives of Jiangsu, they have a profound connection to Shanghai and Jiangnan. Upon their return, they will surely alleviate the Chairman's worries and fulfill the hopes of our people. I, Du Yuesheng, with my limited abilities, represent the citizens in extending our warmest welcome and gratitude. Shanghai fell early, second only to Tianjin and Beijing. The enemy occupied our city as a base for westward and southward expansion. For eight years, they exploited, extracted, ravaged, and oppressed us to the extreme. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai suffered the most and eagerly awaited the dawn. The two envoys are well aware of the past experiences, so there is no need for me to elaborate. After the enemy surrendered, the sun shone again. The citizens, after a long period of anticipation, are eager to alleviate their suffering. This urgency is understandable. However, the surrender was received hastily, and preparations were insufficient. Some measures may not have been entirely appropriate, which is forgivable. But even the wisest can make mistakes. The citizens of the entire city deeply understand the central government's good intentions and the diligence of the authorities.

The Stability of Society: Prerequisites

In my humble opinion, the stability of society requires two prerequisites: the stability of livelihood and the maintenance of order. These two aspects are two sides of the same coin, mutually causing and influencing each other. After eight years of long-term resistance, the moral standards of the general public have inevitably declined. At the same time, the standard of living for the vast majority of the people is still below par. If production mechanisms are not halted, people can find employment, transportation is improved, goods can flow freely, and public security is restored everywhere, so that people who have lost their home are no longer displaced, then the hungry will easily find food, and the thirsty will easily find drink. Now that the war has ended and everything awaits restoration, the people only wish to live and work in peace. If this wish can be fulfilled, they will be comforted. Therefore, today's priority is to ensure that workers can find jobs, businesses can operate normally, and scattered soldiers, rogue parties, and bandits are completely eradicated, so that farmers can return to their fields and engage in cultivation. This will stabilize the hearts of the people and restore social order to normal. Although this is not a lofty theory, it is practical. It is undoubtedly necessary to start with stabilizing people's livelihoods. Moreover, local conditions vary. Past measures may not be suitable for today's environment, and improvements and reforms are necessary. However, there is a sense of urgency and priorities in time.

Better to Use the People Than to Tax Them

Rather than taxing the people for unnecessary matters, it is better to use them when necessary. Rather than taking from the people to fund non-urgent affairs, it is better to leave it with the people to preserve a glimmer of hope. Recently, in some areas, as reported in the newspapers, the people have been exhausted and their wealth depleted to provide for social engagements and non-urgent matters, leading to public resentment and demands for "no more deepening of the water and no more heating of the fire." Their pain is unspeakable. Director Qian has diligently worked on restoration, making significant progress compared to the initial period of takeover. Given more time, there will undoubtedly be continuous improvement. Our association is a comprehensive organization of people from all walks of life, including finance, industry, commerce, education, culture, and freelance professions. It was established before August 13th. In ordinary times, it is dedicated to social undertakings, such as rural improvement, children's education, food distribution, and compilation of various statistics. During the war, it was dedicated to the relief of refugees, comforting the troops, and raising funds for various national salvation donations. Most of the charts and publications it compiled were destroyed during the occupation, and a small portion was transferred to the rear, which has not yet been returned. Therefore, we cannot present them today. Post-war reconstruction is a challenging task. Our association has always been dedicated to serving the local area as its mission. In the future, under the leadership of the central government's policies, we will assist the local authorities in this challenging task and contribute all our strength to achieve the mission. We ask the two envoys to provide us with more guidance.

Ye Chucang Said, "Take the Good and Discard the Bad"

Ye Chucang then delivered a speech, briefly stating: "This is the local association led by Mr. Du. It is a good opportunity to listen to the opinions of local leaders. The central government is a central government composed of all the local areas of the country, and the central government is the central government of all the people. Therefore, the central government attaches great importance to the opinions of the people. Many of you are leaders in the business world. The business world is extremely important for national construction. I hope you will tell us the true situation in all aspects, and I will certainly report it to the central government. I believe Chairman Chiang will highly value your opinions. 'What is good must be done, and what is bad must be discarded.' What should be done and what should be reformed will surely be handled quickly." Niu Yongjian then gave a speech, elaborating on the central government's emphasis on civil rights and people's livelihood.

Bright Prospects for Maritime and Land Transportation

Du then invited Liu Hongsheng to report on Shanghai's transportation and economic situation. He briefly stated: "Eighteen American ocean liners and eight Liberty ships will soon arrive at the port. There is a glimmer of hope for the future of shipping. For land transportation, we have learned that twenty locomotive heads and 3,740 tons of train materials are coming to Shanghai. The prospects for land transportation are also optimistic. Regarding economic recovery, we should first try to restore the pre-war state. When factories reopen and the unemployment problem is solved, the market will gradually prosper, and the people's livelihood problem can also be solved easily. We also hope that the stock exchange will be restored soon, and special attention should be paid to industrial stocks, which will greatly benefit the future of industry." Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank and Special Commissioner for Financial Affairs in the Nanjing-Shanghai Area, expressed two opinions on developing industry: "First, there must be a strong bank dedicated to investing in industry. Second, shareholders should contribute a large amount of capital to supplement the insufficiency of national loans." Cai Zhengya then reported on Shanghai's price and cost of living index. Compared to the pre-war period, the total index for workers increased by 1021 times, for staff by 784 times, and for Westerners by 965 times. Subsequently, Zhang Jianhui, Jin Runxiang, Xue Mingjian, and Xu Yongzuo reported various real situations of people's suffering. The two envoys both stated that they would relay all the situations to the central government.

### Pei Songsun Arrives in Shanghai Amidst Rumors of New Exchange Rate

[Our Dispatch] Pei Songsun, manager of the Bank of China, arrived in Shanghai by plane yesterday from Chongqing. Mr. Pei is a foreign exchange expert. Several months ago, he accompanied President Song to the United States to discuss China's financial issues with the US Treasury Department. He returned to Chongqing from the United States earlier this month to report to the central authorities on his trip to the United States. When reporters inquired yesterday, Mr. Pei was asked whether the widely rumored foreign exchange rate had been decided and would be announced soon. Mr. Pei told reporters that he had not heard of this rumor. Financial figures in the city claimed yesterday that Mr. Pei would conduct an important review of foreign exchange issues after arriving in Shanghai.

### Chen Tingrui Returns from Studying in the United States, Discusses Implementing the Rule of Law

— Ping Er

"If China wants democracy today, it must first have the rule of law."

This is the view of Councilor Chen Tingrui. Mr. Chen is a famous lawyer in Shanghai. He was invited by the American Legal Academy as a special commissioner of the Judicial Yuan to go to the United States for investigation. He has recently returned to Shanghai. The reporter specifically inquired about the latest judicial administration situation in the United States.

Mr. Chen told reporters: "During this trip to the United States, I traveled all over the states and major cities. Under different circumstances, I had contact with American social and political leaders and ordinary people. What impressed me deeply was that the American people's friendship and love for China were completely sincere. They have high hopes for China's future. The Americans I met unanimously hoped that China could unite politically and embark on the path of the rule of law judicially."

Mr. Chen added: "There is currently a great deal of floating capital in the United States. However, if China wants to absorb this floating capital, the domestic political situation must be peaceful so that industry and commerce can develop as much as possible. Secondly, investors must have legal protection. The expectations of all sectors of American society are: (1) China can have modern laws; (2) China can have a sound court system. Regarding modern laws, Mr. Chen told reporters: 'In the past, our country's laws adopted the German and Japanese systems. This continental legal system is undemocratic. British and American laws are based on the people's sovereignty and interests as the basis for legislation, such as the British and American jury system, which not only enables the people to participate in decision-making and judicial administration, but also enables the people to generally gain legal knowledge when participating in the jury. China must follow the evolution of the trend in the future to establish modern laws.'"

When Mr. Chen arrived in the United States, the war against Germany and Japan was entering its final stage. The US government had strict control over prices and the distribution of materials. If a merchant was found to be engaged in black market trading or raising prices, they would be severely punished by law. During the months of investigation in the United States, I never saw government officials using their positions of power to engage in business and make money. Therefore, I believe that the greatest advantage of American law is that the law is for the people. Before the law, everyone, from the President to the common people, stands on an equal footing and is subject to the rule of law.

Mr. Chen's conclusion from his trip to the United States is that the foundation of China's prosperity lies in the formulation of a true rule of law, so that our country can generate a sound government, industry, commerce, and society under the spirit of the rule of law. Mr. Chen hopes that the media can call attention to the future of China's rule of law and arouse the attention of all the people.

Chen Tingrui

### Expectations for Today's Art Scene

— Xin Fang

After eight years of the War of Resistance, the art scene can be said to have undergone a crucible of forging. At the same time, its contributions during the war were significant. Now, with the arrival of victory, we are entering a period of national reconstruction and revival, and it bears an even greater mission. Let us consider: the popularization of education, the improvement of culture, the training of academic skills, the prosperity of industry and commerce, international communication, and even the development of transportation, and continuous exploration—which of these is not an important task of national reconstruction, and which does not require the assistance of art scene workers? Because the mission of the art scene is so important, our expectations for today's art scene are extremely high. As someone who has always enjoyed interacting with the art world, I would like to share some thoughts with you all.

The work of the art scene, expanding from "points" to "surfaces," has already yielded results during this War of Resistance. Now, in the period of reconstruction, we need to expand even further from "surfaces." When the government recovers lost territories, it should "not lose the hearts of the people." This principle of "not losing the hearts of the people" should also be applied to today's art scene. When artists from the rear return to the recovered areas, they must continue the spirit of striving for progress that they have maintained over the years. They also need to quickly remedy the damage that the enemy has inflicted on the art scene. We must use all our energy to build a new art scene. Major commercial ports and provincial capitals are certainly target areas for our work, but we must also open up new art scene work in border regions and remote villages.

In the past, the art scene was a "star system," dominated by a few individuals. I hope that the future art scene can discover more artists with innate talent and specialized skills. The success of artists does not require "hype." We need to educate the administrative authorities to pay attention to the cultivation and training of art scene talent. Only with this talent can the art scene and reconstruction work complement each other.

Today's world is a democratic world, but today's art scene has not yet reached a "democratic" state. The ticket prices of various theaters can prove this; their exorbitant prices make it impossible for us to enter. One way to remedy this is for local administrative authorities to establish public theaters or public art galleries in various places within their means, using the lowest possible prices to instill art in the masses. Another way is to reduce the number of merchants in the art scene. By the end of the five-year post-war economic plan, I hope that every Chinese person will be an appreciator of the Chinese art scene. I hope that every Chinese person can see the theater of the new China on stage, and I hope that every Chinese person can see the development of the new China on the screen.

### Watching Four Plays by Mei Lanfang

— Chen Dezhen

I watched "The Assassin," "Broken Bridge," and "The Strange Twin Meeting," a total of four plays. Unfortunately, I arrived late and "A Stroll in the Garden, Awakening from a Dream" was already nearing its end, which is a real pity. I am now briefly recording my impressions below, which may be of interest to audience members who missed it!

The Assassin—This play was performed at the Lyceum Theatre a month ago and is a masterpiece of Mei's. However, the tiger was played by Cheng Shaoyu, which was somewhat inferior. If it were replaced by Wang Yurang, it would undoubtedly be even more wonderful. This play is divided into six scenes. The earlier scenes involve planning and persuading [the protagonist] to drink, and the final scene is the assassination of the tiger, which is the most intense. Mei's performance is flawless, and her heroic spirit fills her brow. It is a great honor for our country to have such a female hero!

Thinking of Worldly Matters—This is a one-person performance, making it even more demanding, and there are many movements. Mei's performance is beautiful and captivating. Although her voice is broad and bright, her singing is graceful, and her facial expressions are even better. She is neither frivolous nor licentious, and it is a pleasure to watch her. This is what makes Mei so valuable. The state of mind of not being focused on the scriptures while chanting is very subtle. When she walks outside the mountain gate and sees the beauty of nature, her joy is immediately apparent on her face. And when she escapes to the foot of the mountain, because she has gained liberation and freedom, she is even more delighted. In this play, Mei plays the young nun Sekong, whose general idea is that she cannot bear the loneliness and monotony of life in the nunnery, and finally escapes from the temple, advocating liberation and proclaiming freedom. Her consciousness is particularly good!

Broken Bridge—This is a folk tale, a section from the Legend of the White Snake, known to every household. Mei plays the White Maiden, and her cries of "bitterness" are unbearable to hear. Then, she appears with Xiaoqing, wearing a girdle and dressed in plain white, indicating the pain in her abdomen, which cannot help but make people shed tears of sympathy. Xiaoqing rebukes Xu for his faithlessness, glaring at him, while Bai attempts to persuade him in every way, showing extreme love and affection, and lamenting her own misfortune, expressing the deep love between husband and wife, which moves everyone. When she sings the song "Golden Lasso," it is like weeping and complaining, like resentment and longing, making people's hearts ache. Yu Wu, who plays Xu Xian, does an excellent job of acting, especially when he kneels and begs for mercy. Xiaoqing, who delivers the tea, is also not weak, but her face is too scary!

Strange Twin Meeting—This is the Buying Horse Tale, a popular Chuichang Opera in recent years. From the start of the weeping in prison to the reunion of the three, Lanfang's Guizhi is dignified, elegant, steady, and generous, befitting the identity of a lady. When she hears Li Qi's cries, she wants to recognize her father but does not dare to, and her heart is filled with mixed feelings of joy and fear, which is truly moving. Her writing and Zhuang Yi and Zhenfei's singing and answering each other perfectly express the beautiful scenery and tender feelings. The joy of the boudoir is enviable, and the beauty of this scene is unparalleled. The supporting roles are all famous actors, making it even more of a perfect combination!

### Morality in Old Plays

— Su Shaoqing

Here, "old plays" include Kunqu Opera, Gaoqiang Opera, Zouqiang Opera, Yiqiang Opera, Peking Opera, and various local operas. Peking Opera was born relatively late, with only over a hundred years of history, but it has been able to penetrate into the folk and be welcomed by a large number of people, spreading throughout the country. Even a village or town has its traces, so its good or bad performance has a great impact on the society and the people.

Because I study popular education and my temperament is close to drama, I have specialized in studying old plays. Among old plays, Peking Opera is the most popular and has the largest audience, so I have put a lot of effort into it. Now I will only talk about Peking Opera.

Peking Opera can be divided into historical plays, family plays, satirical plays, and miscellaneous plays, of various types. It is a collection of ancient plays and local plays, containing Kunqu Opera, Bangzi Opera, Huizhou Opera, and Han Opera, with various tunes, especially inheriting more elements of Kunqu Opera. Most of the scripts are adapted from Kunqu Opera, especially historical plays.

Since Peking Opera is a descendant of Kunqu Opera, its expressive meaning is the same as Kunqu Opera, actively focusing on maintaining morality, and especially writing about the昏庸荒淫 [morally corrupt and licentious] of the monarchs of fallen countries and the loyalty and treachery of ministers, giving people a cautionary tale and calling on people to be vigilant.

This belongs to historical plays. In family plays, there are also many plays that express benevolence, filial piety, trustworthiness, and righteousness. Examples are readily available and do not need to be listed one by one. In addition, there are satirical plays, such as "Promotion Through Three Grades," which vividly depicts the snobbishness of an innkeeper. There are also miscellaneous plays and mythological plays, which are used to regulate the eyes and time, and are not of great importance. In short, the purpose of old plays is purely to maintain loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and various moralities. They are by no means solely for entertainment. Peking Opera is like this, and other old plays are also like this.

Since the establishment of the Republic of China, for more than thirty years, it has gone through the dictatorship of warlords, foreign aggression, social unrest, and the people's livelihood has not been secure. Old morality has declined sharply. In addition, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, there was no time to talk about it, especially for the people in the occupied areas, who were shameless and lost all old morality. Moreover, evil doctrines are rampant, and the danger at this time is very great. We should promote old morality to try to save it. I believe that if we want to preserve morality, we should start with improving old plays, so as to achieve the effect of imperceptible influence and achieve twice the result with half the effort. I think that government leaders and social leaders have already seen this with their far-sighted vision.

### Hollywood Dynamics After the War

— Xin Meng

Since wars broke out in Europe and Asia one after another, the overseas market for Hollywood films plummeted, and the film industry suffered an unprecedented blow. The films produced could only be shown in North and South America, and the market has shrunk drastically. When the United States joined the war, the situation changed again. Large companies were guided or controlled by the state to make propaganda war films, while small companies could not support themselves and closed down one after another. Some of the male and female stars were drafted into the army or volunteered for service. The entire film city showed signs of decline.

Now the United States has won, and world peace has been achieved. The film city has naturally become active again. In addition to large companies, which are planning to shoot a large number of films, small companies that have closed down are also eager to return to work and resume their businesses. Some of the male and female stars who went to their posts or the rear have returned to Hollywood, ready to try the life of the silver screen again. Everything is different from the war period. Although a few filmmakers have died or grown old in the past five or six years, most of the world-famous stars are healthy and will soon be able to see us again.

After such a big change, the style of Hollywood film companies will naturally have to change. Because recently, American newspapers and magazines have welcomed writings about the diaries of conscripts, the activities of spies, international conspiracies, and battlefield reports. Therefore, Hollywood film companies will also adopt this type of material for future film scripts. They are currently soliciting from all parties. At the same time, because Americans have always sympathized with China for eight years, and especially admire China's resistance, they also plan to collect stories about China's war of resistance and the real situation on the battlefield, and compile them into scripts for filming. We can foresee that this type of film will be very popular for at least the next year or two.

### This Week's Film and Theater

— Xu Daming

Opening the newspaper's theater advertisements, they are truly dazzling, like a "brightly dressed" beauty, and it also seems to be a world of "songs and dances of peace." However, when you observe it from another angle with an eye for appreciating art, you will be disappointed, even sad, because there are so few plays that are worth watching and meet the conditions for selection.

One thing that can be mentioned this week is:

Japanese Spy (Film)

This film is produced by the China Film Studio in the wartime capital and is a new film that will be shown at the "Great Light" and "Nanjing" theaters after "A Spirit-Stirring Nation." The scenes are magnificent, ranking among the top international films. The director, Xiao Mei, is not unfamiliar to the people of Shanghai. The leading actress, who plays a Japanese female spy, is Miss Su Jingzi. This is a newcomer from the rear, and few people in Shanghai know her. Here we will see Miss Yu's acting skills. Especially since British and American expatriates are participating in the performance, after the people of Shanghai have seen the puppet film "Regret on the Yan River," they can change their tastes.

Mount Miaofeng (Play)

This is a work by Ding Xilin four years ago. "Mount Miaofeng" takes Wang Laohu, a guerrilla hero from a peasant background, as the protagonist. It uses the revolutionary war during the War of Resistance as the background and writes down the historical facts of real meritorious deeds in the War of Resistance. It will tell us what kind of army can win the support of the people, how can we persist until victory, and how can we win the hearts of the people. Especially since the author handles such serious material with a witty and pungent approach, to this day, we have not seen a comedic touch that surpasses his. This is a true depiction of the War of Resistance. From the perspective of ordinary people like us, we will undoubtedly feel extra close to it.

Youthful Wanderings (Play)

"Youthful Wanderings" has emotion, "Youthful Wanderings" is poetry. "Youthful Wanderings" is a work completed by Wu Zuguang in the rear. But "Youthful Wanderings" is not the group of young people in Mao Dun's "Corrosion." Some people say that this is Wu Zuguang's own youth, which may be possible, because the authenticity of the work is allowed. In short, "Youthful Wanderings" is a play worth mentioning.

Meng Jiangnu (Musical)

This is a play that focuses on music and emphasizes dance and dialogue equally. This is a new attempt in China. The general audience may not be able to appreciate its artistic conception or the beauty of this Chinese classical art, but this attempt has indeed attracted attention from all parties and has led to a review of the future direction of Chinese drama. The Shanghai Broadcasting Station is broadcasting this play to the whole country tonight, which shows the general importance that all parties attach to "Meng Jiangnu."

Mei Lanfang's Plays (Kunqu Opera)

The evaluation of Dr. Mei Lanfang has already been settled, and there is no need for me to repeat it. The problem is that Mei Lanfang's loyalty and integrity and his return to the stage today are worth commemorating. Especially his artistic level is worthy of being called a representative of Chinese art. Moreover, Dr. Mei's performance opportunities will probably not be many in the future, so it is indeed worth seeing.

Social Service

### Watching the Games While Helping Students Predicts Even More Enthusiasm Tonight Supporting the Righteous Cause is a Due Duty

The Sino-American Charity Basketball Game opened last night. Two games were played, and the situation was enthusiastic, unprecedented. The reporter, who participated in the event, cannot help but speak about it. I will pick up a few points to tell the gentlemen who missed it:

Public Order is in Good Order By 7:00 pm, the vicinity of the Chinese Sports Field was crowded with people from all walks of life. There were so many cars and horses that it was impossible to pass. Some people were worried that the order might be disrupted. But the person in charge of the venue was confident. They guided the audience to take their seats in order. Many receptionists and inspectors also assisted from the side. Before long, everyone took their places, and the order was in good order, which shows that the audience's level has reached a standard, which is truly a gratifying phenomenon.

Players Adhere to Morality Any cause must adhere to morality. Isn't it the same for sports? A basketball game is a strenuous sport. It is easiest to have irregular actions when you are competing with each other and it is difficult to distinguish between them. Moreover, in the international competition between China and the United States, there are differences in bloodlines and customs. Last night, the two sides competed and ran as they pleased, but they always maintained a moral concept and sports discipline. In terms of international friendship, they can be regarded as working together in harmony, which is truly commendable.

The Audience's Emotions are Enthusiastic Judging from the enthusiastic emotions of the audience at the opening game last night, tonight will definitely be even more energetic. Because today is a Sunday, and the citizens of Shanghai can take the opportunity to watch two basketball games in the evening, which will refresh their minds and make them even more interested. Moreover, buying tickets helps students and relieves the poor, and cultivating talents for the country is a duty that people should have. So-called killing two birds with one stone, why not do it?

### The Kawamura Memorial Tower Should be Renamed Immediately Please Pay Attention to the Municipal Authorities

On the 28th of last month, the editor of this column instructed us that there are many unreasonable things in society that the people should urge so that the responsible authorities will be alert. In the democratic era, any political affair should be based on the people, and no one can hinder it. Therefore, I sincerely support the position of your column, and I dare to put forward some small thoughts here. Whenever the 26th road tram passes through the Xiaoshadu Road on the [illegible] road, the most [illegible] is that the "Kawamura Memorial Tower" that the enemy destroyed us is still standing in front of us. After eight years of bloody battles, my country's international status has been raised, extraterritoriality has been abolished, and concessions in various places have been recovered. Does this "Kawamura Memorial Tower" have any special existence for its poor record of invading our country?

I demand that the bad name of the "Kawamura Memorial Tower" be eliminated immediately, and that it be renamed the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Tower, the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Tower, the Lone Army Memorial Tower, or the Unknown Heroes Memorial Tower...etc., as well as great figures or the facts of great historical achievements that the people truly support, to enhance and enlighten the national ideology of the citizens. I raise this issue and ask the municipal authorities to consider it.
