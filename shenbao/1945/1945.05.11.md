### The Battle of Okinawa Reaches its Climax: Japanese Forces Launch a Preemptive Counterattack, Kamikaze and Special Attack Units Heavily Damage Enemy Warships

From a Central News Agency dispatch from a certain base on a Nansei Islands (Ryukyu Islands) island, dated the 10th: Enemy forces in the Okinawa area, including landing forces on the northern and southern fronts of the main island, as well as on the islands of Kerama, Tsuken, and Ie, have reached a total strength of eight divisions. Since landing, the enemy has consistently focused its attacks on the southern front, deploying more than half of its forces in that area. The Japanese garrison has been engaged in a decisive battle for 24 days. On the night of the landing, the U.S. Army's 24th Corps, commanded by Major General Hodge, was the main force. However, after the Japanese garrison on the southern front launched a full-scale counteroffensive in coordination with special attack units, the 96th and 27th Divisions of the 24th Corps suffered heavy losses within just two weeks of landing, losing more than half of their combat strength. Deeply concerned about the lack of progress, the enemy command, in addition to army units, dispatched the Marine divisions under Nimitz to join the operation. Since then, the Marine divisions have been in a position to direct the battle. On April 16, the enemy transferred the heavily depleted 96th and 27th Divisions to the rear, and deployed the 1st Division, which had been guarding Saipan, and the 7th Army Division, a total of two divisions, to the front line, attempting to forcefully break through the Japanese positions north of Shuri. On April 19 and 26, with the support of naval forces and airpower, they launched the first and second general offensives, respectively. However, they were again met with fierce Japanese counterattacks, suffering heavy casualties and setbacks. Since then, they have repeatedly launched local counterattacks while reorganizing their forces, planning for a third general offensive. Since the 8th of this month, the enemy's overall offensive has suddenly intensified, and the signs of a general offensive have become increasingly strong. On the 8th, the enemy simultaneously launched fierce attacks on the Maeda area north of Shuri, the southern part of Nakama, and the area west of Awa, west of Nakama. The battle reached its climax at 2:00 AM on the 9th, but the enemy's offensive was ultimately thwarted by a brave Japanese preemptive counterattack. However, the enemy is still urgently replenishing troops and equipment from the rear. At dawn on the 9th, they launched another full-scale counterattack, but all were repelled by Japanese forces. In the battle on the 9th, the enemy placed its main force in the west coast area. Furthermore, as the weather in the battle area cleared, the attacks by Japanese special attack air units also became more intense. From dusk to 9:00 PM on the 9th, they broke through the enemy fleet around the main island, achieving glorious results. At 7:20 PM, they sank an enemy warship in the waters of Nakagusuku Bay. At 8:00 PM, they broke into enemy ship formations in the waters off Minatogawa, causing the enemy to fire anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately and fall into a state of panic and confusion. Also at 8:45 PM, a pillar of fire reaching the sky appeared in the waters off Naha, indicating that an enemy warship had been hit and caught fire.

(Another Dispatch) On the afternoon of the 9th, Japanese kamikaze units discovered an enemy mobile unit south of the Ryukyu Islands and launched a fierce attack, apparently inflicting significant damage. From the evening of the same day to the early morning of the 10th, Japanese special attack units departed several times, repeatedly and fiercely attacking several enemy warships around the main island of Okinawa, breaking through enemy cruisers and other large ships, inflicting heavy damage.

### Ambassador Cai Expresses Determination

From a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 10th: Cai Peihuang, our ambassador to Japan, who will soon return to China from Japan, issued the following statement on the 10th expressing China's determination to fight alongside Japan: China, which has firmly united with Japan, will not waver due to the sudden changes in the European war, needless to say. The war aim of the Japanese government is self-existence and self-defense, which is the same as that of China. The resolution of the Japanese government is the resolution of China. China's unswerving resolution to move forward towards the goal of war remains unchanged, and it is regretful that the allied Germany has surrendered due to unfavorable war situation. However, we, who aim to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, have not changed in the slightest, needless to say. However, China has not made any significant contributions to date, which is regrettable. We deeply feel that we must strengthen our efforts to defeat the common enemy.

### The Pope Appeals for the Construction of a Just Peace, A Golden Opportunity to Thoroughly Reconstruct the World

From a Central News Agency dispatch from the Vatican, dated the 10th: On the occasion of the cessation of hostilities in Europe, the Pope made a brief broadcast yesterday at the Vatican, calling for peace to be built in an atmosphere of mutual trust and complete justice, replacing deception and malice with truth and goodwill. In the face of the great difficulties facing Europe, the corruption of public institutions, famine and misfortune, the barbarization of customs, and the licentiousness of youth are all scenes of the present time. Therefore, a solid peace cannot be established unless it is with a sincere heart. The new world should be based on faith, respect for humanity, and the equal rights of all nations, large and small, strong and weak. Now is a good time to rebuild the world, and we hope that prisoners of war and detained civilians will quickly be able to return to their homes to engage in the work of peace.

Editorial

### The Polish Question and the Future of the United Nations

On the same day that the news of the end of the war in Europe was announced, another shocking news item was released, that the San Francisco Conference was on the verge of collapse due to the dispute between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union centered on the Polish issue, and that it would be difficult to resolve unless Truman, Churchill, and Stalin held a three-way summit. Originally, the Polish issue was not a major issue compared with other proposals at the San Francisco Conference. Why did it become such a serious problem? There are things worth studying here.

As everyone knows, the Polish issue was the flashpoint for this European war. On the eve of the war, Britain and France had established an agreement with Poland, obligated to an alliance of mutual defense. Looking back at history, this was entirely because the British and French authorities attempted to use Poland as a special sphere of influence against the Soviet Union and Germany, and to gain control of the European continent with Poland as a base. At that time, the Soviet Union proposed a system of collective security in Europe and negotiated with Britain and France, hoping that Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland would establish a united defense line on the Polish issue. At that time, Britain and France were afraid of the westward advance of Soviet power, and finally rejected the proposal for a collective security system, adopting a "policy of appeasement" towards Germany and Italy on the one hand, and forming an alliance with Poland alone on the other, continuing to use Poland as an anti-Soviet base. The Soviet Union then turned to form an alliance with Germany, establishing the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. A week later, Germany launched a blitzkrieg against Poland, and the Polish government was defeated and fled abroad, living its exiled life in France and then Britain. After the German army attacked Poland, Britain and France also declared war on Germany on September 3 in accordance with the agreement. This is how the European war broke out. So the Polish issue is indeed not a simple issue.

Now, although the war in Europe has been declared over, the Lublin regime has been established in Poland with the support of the Soviet Union, and has further evolved into the Warsaw Provisional Government, which has been recognized successively by the Soviet Union, the pro-Soviet French Provisional Government, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and others. However, the old Polish government in exile in Britain is still in London, and is still recognized as the legitimate government of Poland by Britain, the United States, and some other countries. In particular, Britain, on the one hand, wants to maintain its own face, and on the other hand, is unwilling to completely abandon its long-standing policy toward Poland, ignoring the recognition of the Warsaw regime supported by the Soviet Union and withdrawing from the European continent, living in isolation on the three islands. Therefore, no one below Churchill advocates insisting on not allowing the Warsaw Polish Provisional Government to participate in the San Francisco Conference. The United States, in order to win over Britain and to restrain the Soviet Union, can only use the Polish issue to support Britain's position before obtaining other excuses. Conversely, in order to prevent the construction of an anti-Soviet front in the western border, the Soviet Union naturally has to argue with Britain and the United States.

In the San Francisco Conference, the Polish issue has caused a great deal of commotion and is in a stalemate, and the reason is nothing more than the above. Therefore, some people say that the European war cannot truly end if the Polish issue cannot be resolved.

### A Military Commentator Discusses the Situation in Asia and Europe, The Pacific Operations Continue to Advance

A certain military commentator, observing the recent Pacific war situation and the trend of Britain and the United States in the Greater East Asia War after the end of the war, has published a detailed report, which is recorded as follows:

Japanese Forces in Okinawa in a Pincer Formation

The center of the Pacific naval war remains concentrated around Okinawa Island on the surface. Japanese special attack units have launched fierce attacks on the US mobile units and submarine groups around Okinawa Island, resulting in great damage to the US military. The elite Japanese troops in the southern land battle also continued to launch fierce attacks, and are engaging the Marine 1st Division and the Army 77th Division, which have recently transferred from the north. The total enemy force in this area is about five divisions, which has stopped the enemy's advance. Another part of the Japanese forces bravely landed behind the enemy and completed a pincer formation.

U.S. Fleet Sustains Heavy Damage

Enemy air power and mobile units have been crushed and attacked by Japanese forces, and their ships have suffered heavy losses. All that remains are special aircraft carriers. Japanese forces have launched a fierce attack on the central and northern airfields, causing them considerable damage and making them unusable. On the 8th, the number of enemy aircraft that came to attack totaled no more than six. The US military has suffered such repeated heavy blows. According to Reuters, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet, Nimitz, broadcast from Omiya Island on the 9th, saying: This time, the British fleet assisted the US military in the Okinawa Island operation and achieved unexpected results. The two sides have the same mission. In the future, we hope that the British fleet will continue to cooperate and provide more assistance. This shows that the US Pacific Fleet has suffered heavy damage. According to Nimitz, the US military continued to attack in front of Shuri and Yonabaru, but due to bad weather, the operation could not proceed as expected, and the war was stagnating. At present, the two sides of the Pacific war situation have lost balance. The US military is preparing only six divisions. Using five divisions for this operation, plus the entire Pacific fleet, has resulted in a stagnant and ineffective war. It is clear that the US military will suffer a complete defeat in the near future.

The European War Comes to an End

According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 8th, the German forces in Prague have stopped fighting and have announced an armistice with the Allied forces. Therefore, the final resistance of the German army has also come to an end. The heroic result of Germany under the rule of Nazi Party leader Hitler for five years and eight months is what we are witnessing today. We express our sympathy and respect. Japan and China must have a belief in certain victory and fight to the end. After the European war comes to an end, Britain and the United States want to devote their full efforts to the Pacific. The enemy leaders all unanimously advocate a short-term decisive battle. Their rulers, such as Truman, Churchill, and Gru, on the one hand, suppress the demands of the people for a truce and peace, and on the other hand, know that the Japanese army is not easy to deal with, and have to painstakingly worry and make all kinds of plans.

Difficulty in Moving British and American Forces

There are many difficulties for Britain and the United States to move their European forces. One is the international political problem, that is, the subtle diplomatic relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The second is the military and technical problems that are difficult to solve, such as the lack of submarines and the lack of bases in the Pacific. Regarding the first question, the statements by Molotov's return from San Francisco to Moscow on the 8th and Japanese Foreign Minister Togo can be understood. As for the second question, the military technical problem, the first is the lack of ships and submarines. According to New York Times commentator Xia Leide, if Britain and the United States want to move most of their forces and military supplies in Europe to the Pacific, they need considerable ships and submarines, even if the entire US merchant fleet is transferred, it is not enough. The food problem in the non-liberated areas of Europe is extremely serious, and a large number of ships are also needed for transportation. The entire US merchant fleet has been used for this. Secondly, the lack of air bases in the Pacific. As Nimitz said, many bases are needed to attack Japan. Spafford, the commander of the European Allied Air Force, also said that if the European air force is to be transferred to the Pacific, there must first be suitable bases. A Reuters dispatch from New York on the 7th quoted military sources as saying that the air bases in the Pacific are already in full use. In the future, if a large number of air forces are to be moved, there must be a large number of bases. Nimitz also said when meeting with reporters on the 9th that the transfer of the air force from Europe to the Pacific is a problem, and we must work hard to obtain a large number of bases for application in the future. Therefore, the difficulty of moving the air force is very obvious. Based on the above, even if the enemy's air force in Europe can be moved to the mainland of China, its quantity may not have an impact on the war situation.

Japanese Forces Have Long Been Fully Prepared

Regarding naval forces, most of the naval forces of the United Nations had been transferred to the Pacific before the German army was defeated. Therefore, the end of the war in Europe is not a concern for strengthening the Pacific naval forces. On the ground forces, Britain, the United States, France, etc. have about five armies and fifty divisions, a total of 750,000 people, on the front line in Europe, and a total of 4 million people including the rear. The Soviet Union's front-line troops are 250 divisions, totaling 4 million people. Recently, the US Department of the Army announced the release of 2 million people's mobilization. Even if the forces in Europe can be moved to the Pacific, it will take a considerable amount of time for training and combat. In summary, the end of the war in Europe has no decisive impact on the Pacific war. Deputy Secretary of State Gru said on the 8th, "It would be untrue to say that Japan had no preparation for the defeat of the German army, and it would be even more incredible to say that it was alarmed by it. Our army is fighting in the Pacific Ocean, which is very far away, and the Japanese army is still extremely strong even if it fights alone." As Gru said, Japan has long known that the European war is about to end and has been fully prepared in advance. As the Japanese government announced on the 9th, the determination to war has not changed, and the Pacific operations will continue to advance until victory. Japan and China should support each other and work hard to fight, and wait for the glory of victory.

### Japanese Troops in Tarakan Launch Bayonet Assault

From a Central News Agency dispatch from a base on Borneo, dated the 10th: The land battle of attack and defense in Tarakan has gradually intensified after the enemy prepared its offensive. The enemy army is attempting to break through the Japanese positions. Now, in the area south of the airfield on the west coast, it is expanding its positions from the water purification plant to the oil field area, and is fiercely shelling the Japanese positions in the water purification plant area. The Japanese army is sending bayonet assault teams into the enemy lines, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. A bayonet assault team composed of several brave men, including Gunzo Hattori, annihilated more than 20 enemy soldiers holding light machine guns one night. Sergeant Murai and several others destroyed two enemy barracks with artillery, killing and wounding more than 30 enemy soldiers. On the night of the 6th, a suicide squad led by Sergeant Kitagishi also penetrated deep into the enemy lines, killing and wounding 75 enemy soldiers, destroying one barracks, blowing up one truck, and destroying two machine gun emplacements. In total, they have killed and wounded about two-tenths of the enemy soldiers, amounting to more than 1,500. Enemy soldiers are unusually fearful of the Japanese bayonet assault teams. Every night, they are heavily guarded, and important weapons, such as tank lights, have been moved to the rear. They are also forcing local residents to build positions, trying to avoid Japanese attacks. Meanwhile, the Japanese new elite special attack units are divided into several groups and continue to launch bayonet assaults on the enemy, inflicting fatal injuries on the enemy. The Japanese bloody warfare is becoming increasingly fierce.

### Important Documents Discovered in Hitler's Bunker

From a Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, dated the 9th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, Soviet engineering units continued to search for the remains of Hitler in the underground bunker of the Berlin Chancellery. In the room of Propaganda Minister Goebbels, a document box containing documents was found, containing the plan for the Hitler's SS guards to guard the official residence. The European map used by Hitler has also been found.

### 400,000 US Troops to Remain in Europe

From a Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated the 10th: A Washington dispatch states that US Secretary of Supply Summerville announced on the 9th that the United States plans to return 150,000 to 500,000 army personnels to the United States each month, withdrawing a total of 3.1 million, with plans to leave 400,000 troops stationed in Europe as a garrison.

### Military Affairs Department is Being Organized, Divided into Four Bureaus, Hu Yukun Discusses the Significance of the Establishment

From a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, dated the 10th: In order to enhance the efficiency of command and control and determine the unified mechanism for guiding operations and dispatching troops, the National Government authorities have specially established the Military Affairs Department, with the post of Minister concurrently held by General Hu Yukun, Chief of the General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission. In order to understand the significance of the establishment of the department, the reporter visited Mr. Hu on the afternoon of the 10th to ask for his opinion, and he replied as follows: This Commission specially established the Military Affairs Department to strengthen the military command structure and adapt to the wartime system. Its significance is to promote the integration of command guidance and determine the system of military affairs and military administration. In the future, matters concerning military administration will be handled by the Ministry of the Army, and matters concerning guidance of operations and dispatch of troops related to military orders will be handled by the Military Affairs Department. The department is divided into the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Bureaus, which are responsible for various important management businesses. It is currently being secretly organized, and the use of military orders and military administration will become smoother and more agile.

### KMT's Sixth National Congress in Chongqing: Differing Opinions Among Factions; KMT-CCP Friction Intensifies

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to Chongqing broadcasts: The Kuomintang's Sixth National Congress, convened in Chongqing under the chairmanship of Chiang Kai-shek, opened on the 5th. Chiang Kai-shek delivered an address, followed by a preparatory meeting. On the morning of the 6th, at 9:00 AM, the second meeting of the presidium of the Sixth National Congress was held at the Central Party Headquarters, chaired by Ju Zheng, to discuss the grouping of the presidium and the proposal review committee, and to announce the list of the drafting committee, etc. The presidium decided to divide into four groups: Chiang did not personally attend, and the congress was chaired by the presidium in rotation. The first group consisted of Ju Zheng, Soong Ching-ling, and nine others; the second group consisted of Yu Youren, Zou Lu, Chen Guofu, Zhang Lisheng, Nai Luweng, Lin Qingnian, and nine others; the third group consisted of Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Ji, Chen Cheng, and nine others; the fourth group consisted of Feng Yuxiang, Sun Ke, Zhang Zhizhong, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Shiying, and nine others. The review committee was divided into six groups: party affairs, politics, economy, education, military affairs, and foreign affairs. The first general session of the Sixth National Congress was held on the morning of the 7th, with Wu Tiecheng giving a report on party affairs. The second session was held in the afternoon, with Wu Dingchang giving a political report, and Cheng Quan-yi and Xue Yue also giving reports. The third session continued on the 8th, with Chiang Kai-shek listening to military reports and answering questions from various parties about the party. On the 9th, party and government facilities were reviewed. Afterwards, the focus was on discussing various proposals. The purpose of convening this Sixth National Congress in Chongqing was to discuss and pass the necessary plans for convening a National Assembly and establishing constitutional government on November 12th of this year, the 80th anniversary of the birth of the founding father. Strengthening combat power, improving people's lives, improving relations with the Soviet Union, and the issue of the Chinese Communist Party were also discussed. However, judging from Chiang Kai-shek's address on the 5th, these points were very vague, and he did not mention a word about relations with the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party also held its Seventh National Congress last month, with the aim of responding to the Sixth National Congress in Chongqing. Therefore, the convening of the Sixth National Congress in Chongqing has not shown results, and it may further intensify friction with the Chinese Communist Party, which is an undeniable fact. The representatives participating in this meeting included three factions: the Livelihood Improvement faction, the pro-British and American faction, and the neutral faction. The leaders of the three factions all wanted to expand their influence at the meeting, and due to internal disagreements, little can be expected from the convening of the Sixth National Congress.

### Inside Story of the San Francisco Conference: The Focus is the Polish Question

For the past month, Washington has been largely performing the prelude to the San Francisco Conference solo. Due to the disputes over the Polish question and the death of Roosevelt, a discordant chorus suddenly arose between London and Moscow. However, the conference will still open according to the scheduled plan. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the "change in American attitude" caused by Roosevelt's death, as can be seen from the Soviet Union's decision to reassign Molotov, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. Roosevelt had spared no effort to build a "bridge of peace" between the United States and the Soviet Union. Faced with the San Francisco Conference, Roosevelt's sudden death seemed to the Soviet Union to have lost this "bridge." We only need to recall the "secret agreement" that existed among Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin at the Yalta Conference to prove this fact. On the way back from the Crimean Conference, Roosevelt told reporters from EP, UP, and INS in Algiers on March 28:

"At the Crimean Conference, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Stalin, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Churchill, and I had a certain secret agreement. The content will be naturally explained by time, and the period may be very short, or it may be delayed for fifty or sixty years."

There are several reasons to determine that this secret agreement was related to the political form of various European countries after the war.

Soviet Doubts

Will this "secret agreement," which was born from the combination of Roosevelt's "idealism" and Stalin's "realism," continue after Roosevelt's death and Truman's accession to power? This is the focus of Soviet doubts and the reason why Molotov had to attend the San Francisco Conference.

For example, the Soviet Union has repeatedly emphasized that the San Francisco Conference must not be a "revival of the League of Nations." Furthermore, on April 4, Moscow Radio broadcast a passage from the editorial of the Pravda newspaper, including Stalin's speech, saying: "If the San Francisco Conference violates the fundamental conditions of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to solve problems with understanding and harmony, then it will not get good results." However, the scope of "understanding" and "harmony" that can be stipulated by Moscow, Washington, and London is, in any case, no more than the scope of "peace of their own liking" that the three countries have learned from the war. The continuation of this "understanding" and "harmony" is just like Roosevelt's ambiguous words: "Perhaps it will be a very short period, or it may be delayed for fifty or sixty years." The problem lies in how the entire San Francisco Conference will stipulate the political form of each country they hope for.

The San Francisco Conference will become a performance for these forty-odd invited countries to pursue their national interests in the "security mechanism" under the influence of the three major powers. This is the destination of the San Francisco Conference. Small countries, misled by peaceful fantasies, seem to turn a blind eye to the fact that Japan and Germany are determined to continue the war, but in reality, the countries to be reorganized after the war are trembling before the fact that the foundation of the "harmony" of the three major powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which is the backbone of the post-war international mechanism, is about to collapse. The biggest reason for the collapse of the foundation is the Polish question. The fact that the current Warsaw regime was rejected by Britain and the United States from participating in the San Francisco Conference is really intriguing. To exaggerate a little, the way this Polish question is handled symbolizes all the contradictions and oppositions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. We only need to recall the historical fact that Britain declared war on Germany because Germany invaded Poland to be suddenly enlightened. At the same time, the political consciousness of the London authorities regards Poland as Britain's military and political bridgehead to Germany, and also as a bridgehead to the Soviet Union.

The fact that Chamberlain created the "defeat" of Britain at the Munich Conference - that is, the London authorities' idea of using Nazi Germany as Britain's bridgehead to the Soviet Union - was never cleared up after Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union and then Britain and the Soviet Union cooperated. We only need to look at Churchill's famous declaration: "I will never be the one to dismantle the British Empire" to understand. The Polish government in exile can only survive by supporting Britain's political consciousness, and this situation has not changed to this day. When it was forced to recognize the accomplished fact of the Polish government established by the Soviet Union after the Crimean talks, Britain and the United States did not readily recognize the current Warsaw government, but used the phrase "expanding the Warsaw regime, recognized by Britain and the United States," which was an attempt to guarantee the political influence of Britain and the United States in the new Polish government. The current Polish government is called "a country lacking unity" by Roosevelt. Naturally, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, the three "partners," will never know the true meaning of this disunity. When the situation of "division" expands and develops in the post-war international security mechanism, those who pride themselves on being "peace" lovers will re-prepare to use force.

Warsaw Demonstration

On this point, the Polish Liberation Committee and the current Warsaw government, which were supported by the Soviet Union, are naturally very displeasing to Britain and the United States. Just look at what Pance, the former Director of the Mobilization Bureau of the United States, said when he returned to Washington from the Crimean talks to fully illustrate.

"People in the liberated countries who want to seize power must first obtain the support of major powers before they can act, and this tendency is very obvious."

This tendency is particularly obvious in Poland today. In the eyes of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the liberation of Poland itself is not important, but what is important is in what form it is liberated. Churchill reported the decisions of the Yalta Conference in Parliament on February 27. Regarding the "unity" of Poland, he expressed his sad hope.

"Should the independence of the Polish people be preserved? Or should pressure be used, regardless of the will of Poland, to make it a protectorate of the Soviet Union? This is more important than delineating the borders."

Churchill, the Polish government should adopt a "policy friendly to the Soviet Union," and the nature of the regime should be "determined by the general will of the people with the help of the United Nations." The current Warsaw regime does not conform to Churchill's "liking." But the current Warsaw regime strongly protested against the refusal of Poland to participate in the San Francisco Conference, saying that "the London government in exile is an institution that violates the general will of the Polish people," and the next day, the Soviet Union used TASS to support this declaration. Britain and the United States can certainly ignore this declaration, but before the San Francisco Conference, the Soviet Union will definitely ask Truman's United States to allow the current Warsaw regime to participate in the conference (announced by the U.S. State Department on April 19) to show its determination. The United States' reply to the Soviet Union:

"The United States government absolutely insists that Poland can only be approved to participate in the conference after a new, unified, temporary government is formed in accordance with the Crimean resolution."

European Terror

Several cabinet members of the exiled Polish government have "disappeared" on their way to Moscow to seek compromise. London's position also proves Washington's position. That is to say, if Britain and the United States fully recognize the political character of the Warsaw government, then regarding the political character of France, Yugoslavia, the three Baltic countries, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other European and Balkan countries, they will lose "harmony" with the Soviet Union, and the result will be that the political failure of Britain will be deduced. Therefore, the current Britain and the United States are most afraid of the "countries lacking unity" that are emerging like mushrooms after rain. Only because they foresaw the terror did the "secret agreement" occur in Yalta.

This terror is increasingly strengthening, because the Soviet Union has used the slogan "supporting democracy" against Nazi Germany by Britain and the United States to guarantee the victory of the influence of the Soviet political character. Britain and the United States want to use the democracy they like to overwhelm this Soviet "victory" at the San Francisco Conference, and this is one of the main meanings of the conference. The current Polish question, for the organization of the general will of the world, is a major touchstone of success or failure. This question may be the end of the unnatural "union" between capitalism and Bolshevism, which were united by the common struggle, as shouted by Hitler on the 25th anniversary of the Nazi Party program (February 24).

### Authorities Actively Preparing to Establish Gold Securities Market; Appoint Influential Figures in the Gold Industry to Preside

After the Central Reserve Bank issued gold securities and the initial listing price was officially set, they went on sale from the 7th of this month until the 9th, and merchants and civilians rushed to buy them, so the sales volume of gold securities was very good. The bank has delivered the quantity of gold securities sold and the equivalent amount of gold reserve to the Gold Securities Issuance Reserve Management Committee for deposit in a special treasury for safekeeping. Once the Management Committee has completed the review and verification of the sales report of the gold securities delivered by the Central Reserve Bank and the reserve gold for redemption, a public announcement will be issued. Regarding the establishment of a gold securities trading market, the relevant authorities are actively preparing and it can be realized in the near future. It is reported that the establishment of the market will designate influential figures with outstanding reputations in the gold industry to preside over it, and the number of brokers and the regulations for their business can be fully determined in the coming days.

Central Reserve Bank Relaxes Cash Position

Due to the shortage of cash on hand, the banking and money industries in the city previously felt difficulties in their business. Almost all receipts and payments with other industries and colleagues were made by negotiable instruments. Therefore, the deposits of colleagues in the Silver Union Money Reserve and the funds transferred for daily clearing were also all negotiable instruments. Therefore, the exchange of negotiable instruments in the money market of the exchange has become particularly busy. According to sources in the banking and money industries: the number of negotiable instruments exchanged by the two industries in April increased by more than one or two times compared to the previous month, and the number also increased frequently at the beginning of this month. However, in the past two or three days, the situation has gradually improved, and the exchange of negotiable instruments has gradually decreased slightly. The reason is that the Central Reserve Bank has relaxed the cash position required by the financial industry.

### Deputy Police Chief Man Inspects Police Reality; Instructs Key Points of Work for Cadres at All Levels

### Cooking Oil Sources Become Smoother

Due to the scarcity of sources in the past two months, the price of cooking oil in the city has been chaotic. The household oil ration has been suspended for a long time, which has greatly affected the people's food. According to sources in the industry, sea transportation has recently been smooth, and the transportation of cooking oil from northern ports such as Qingdao and northern Jiangsu has gradually become smoother. A large amount of cooking oil has arrived in Shanghai in recent days. It is reported that about 300 loads are transported from Wusong every day, so the city's need for cooking oil is no longer lacking.

### Construction Bureau Cracks Down on Illegal Temporary Advertisements

The city's construction bureau has recently been actively rectifying the management of advertisements, and stipulates that when each business posts temporary advertisements, they should apply to the bureau for approval, pay taxes, and stamp them to comply with the procedures. The bureau has repeatedly announced this to the public. It is learned that while many businesses have complied with the regulations, there are still many violations. Recently, it was learned that the advertisements posted by Dahua Shipping Company, Jiye Transportation Company, Guofeng Society, Aiwen Bookstore, Guangming Grand Theater, Shanghai West Bone Setting Hospital, etc., were all found by the bureau because they had not been approved for tax payment, and were fined separately.

The National Commercial Control Council, previously established a Nanjing office at the former site of the Bank of Communications Nanjing Branch on Baixia Road in Nanjing due to business needs, in order to facilitate immediate consultation and necessary liaison with the central government and the Materials Review Committee. However, because important work is now mostly concentrated in the Shanghai headquarters for handling, the office appears to have no continued value.

### Small Newspaper Federation - Officially Established Yesterday - Director Liu of the Propaganda Department Attends and Addresses the Meeting

The Shanghai Special Municipality Small Newspaper Federation held its inaugural meeting at Golden Gate Restaurant at 2 PM on the tenth. Those present included Liu Dexuan, Director of the Propaganda Department, Zhang Yicheng, Director of the News Inspection Office, Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, Huang Min, representative of the Fourth Section of the Police Bureau's Inspection Department, Hu Wenbin, representative of the Cultural Section of the Special High Police, and representatives from major newspapers such as Chen Riping, Jin Xiongbai, Jiang Xiaoguang, Lu Feng, Xiang Jie, as well as representatives from various small newspapers, totaling dozens of people. The meeting commenced on time, with Wang Xuechen designated as the temporary chairman.

Chairman's Report

The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly: Small newspapers in Shanghai have a considerable history, but in the past, they were like scattered sand, each going its own way with no organization. Today, the establishment of our Small Newspaper Federation can be said to be the most glorious day in the history of small newspapers. The establishment of the assembly has received the guidance and considerable cooperation of Director Liu of the Propaganda Department, for which we are extremely grateful. In the past, small newspapers took small paths; from now on, they should enter the grand avenue. Therefore, we must encourage each other, work together with one heart, and shoulder the mission of the great era to promote culture and lay a permanent foundation for small newspapers. Then, Tang Xiumei, chairman of the preparatory committee, gave a very detailed report on the preparatory process.

Director Liu's Speech

Director Liu Xuan of the Propaganda Department delivered a speech, stating briefly: Today is the day the Small Newspaper Federation is born, and I am very pleased to be able to participate. After I took office on January 16, all parties believed that small newspapers were no longer necessary during wartime and hoped that the government would take them away. At that time, I believed that previously there were more than 30 small newspapers, but after reasonable consolidation by the authorities, there were 14. These 14 have all exhausted their efforts and ability to maintain their position to this day, and it would be a pity to cancel them. Moreover, the position of small newspapers can be improved, so after consultations with all parties, they are still allowed to exist. However, texts promoting indecency and theft will be resolutely banned, and wartime news and current affairs will be published. The style should also be centered on promoting culture. Furthermore, now that the Small Newspaper Federation has been established, it should unite and promote cultural spirit and consider progress. He also reported incidentally that he had been granted permission by Mayor Zhou to resign due to heart disease, and Mr. Gu Senbian would succeed him."

Chen Binhe's Speech

Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, then gave a speech, stating briefly: "Small newspapers are softer in content, but their propaganda power may actually be greater than that of so-called major newspapers. Although the content of the member newspapers of the News Federation and the member newspapers of your association is different, they are still in the same industry. The News Federation has been established for two years, and Mr. Xiongbai is also one of the leaders. After the establishment of the federation, the spirit of cooperation among the newspapers in handling affairs can be said to be a record before the incident. Small newspapers also have the necessity of uniting, and everyone's promotion of its establishment has been no small feat. The New Association has recently been handling welfare undertakings for the staff of member newspapers, regardless of employees. Now that your association has been established, it will certainly be able to obtain mutual benefits. In terms of associations, we are all in the same industry, and we can work together both publicly and privately. Today, I express my congratulations on the establishment of your association.

Huang Min of the Inspection Section delivered a speech, saying: "All manuscripts of each newspaper are sometimes inspected, which is due to different standpoints. I hope that each newspaper can be particularly forgiving. Regarding the widespread phenomenon of "literary men despising each other," I hope that at least in small newspapers, it will become a historical term after the establishment of your association today. I hope everyone will not criticize reality and earnestly take on the responsibility of culture, spreading good awareness to the people." Jin Xiongbai, Hu Wenbin, Jiang Xiaoguang, and others then successively delivered speeches, and finally, the constitution was passed, and directors and supervisors were elected.

List of Directors and Supervisors

Wang Xuechen, Tang Xiumei, Hu Xiongfei, Hu Ligeng, Deng Yin first, and Mei Youhan were elected as directors, and Zheng Meitan, Yang Hewen, and Li Quanshi were elected as supervisors. Wang Xuechen was appointed as chairman of the board, and Tang Xiumei and Hu Xiongfei were appointed as managing directors. All directors and supervisors took office under the supervision of Director Liu. The ceremony ended around 3 PM.

After a fierce battle, Baima defeated Qiaolian by a score of 3 to 2. After the contact, although Baima was at a disadvantage against the wind, the offensive was very strong, but because it was eager to win, it failed to attack Huanglong directly. Qiaolian turned the tide, and Villa opened a corner kick, which was headed into the red heart by Yato Mali, and Qiaolian took the lead with a score of 1 to 0, opening the record. Baima was unwilling to show weakness, and Sun Laojin went straight in and scored a goal, tying the score at 1 to 1 in the first half.

### Goods Distribution Office Revises Citizen Certificate Collection Method

The Shanghai Goods Distribution Office, in order to enable citizens to deeply understand the procedures for applying for distribution certificates, formulated and implemented the Citizen Certificate Collection Instructions last year. However, since the implementation, it has been felt that the original articles are still not perfect in application and need to be revised. After jointly proposing it to the current certificate distribution office director meeting together with the method of handling household registration changes and certificate issuance, it was decided that the office would revise it and submit it to the municipal government for approval and recording. It is now heard that the office has divided the above-mentioned revised instructions and methods into its subordinate distribution offices for compliance, and has also sent letters to the municipal police bureau's Baojia department and relevant agencies for reference and handling. The revised articles are excerpted as follows:

Certificate Collection Instructions

Any citizen of this city who has one of the following circumstances may apply for a comprehensive distribution certificate: Those who originally lived within the scope of this city; Those who moved in from outside the scope of this city; Those who were newly born in this city.

When citizens of this city apply for distribution certificates, the landlord or his representative should carry various household registration documents on behalf of his family members or his employees (for example, areas such as the first and eighth districts should prepare municipal total donation receipts, Baojia department monthly donation receipts. In districts such as Nanshi Zhabei Xuhuafang Pudong City Center, before the municipal total donation receipts are widely issued, they should apply to each distribution office of this office for distribution certificates for distribution items, transport the certificate and the Fanggongsuo household registration certificate or the police bureau household registration certificate, and present the citizen certificate when necessary.) In accordance with the issuance date announced by the Shanghai Goods Distribution Office, go to the distribution office in each district to collect the distribution certificate.

If the number of applicants for the aforementioned distribution certificate is falsely reported or collected, and the office verifies it to be true, it will be sent to the judicial authority for legal action.

When a citizen moves from District A to District B, he should return the movement certificate issued by the Baojia department and the remaining distribution certificate to the distribution office in District A. The office will issue a certificate return receipt and a movement report certificate, and fill in the return date, number of sheets, and issue number on the back. The Baojia chief and household head of District A will stamp the back of the movement report certificate to prove the move out. When moving to District B, he should purchase an application form for increasing distribution to the distribution office in District B, and have the Baojia chief and household head of District B stamp it for verification. Transport the documents and receipts to the office for approval, and then he can receive the distribution certificate with the same number of sheets and issue number as the certificate returned.

If the population of each district has moved in from outside the scope of this city, or if they are newly born in this city, the household head or landlord or his representative may bring the documents to purchase an application form for increasing the distribution certificate from the distribution office in charge, and hand it over to the Baojia chief and landlord for verification. Together with the move-in light or birth certificate, it will be sent to the distribution office for registration and submitted for approval and allocation.

Citizens who return to their hometowns should present their movement certificate to the original distribution office. In the event of death, the household head or the family members of the deceased should present the death certificate and movement certificate to the original distribution office within a period of one mile.

Civilian schools, public hospitals, church charitable organizations that are exempt from house donations in accordance with the regulations must obtain a tax-free certificate from the Donation Office of the Finance Bureau. Drivers of vehicles and elevator drivers should obtain a certificate from their employers, and they can obtain a non-taxpayer certificate from each distribution office. Fill in the form and submit it to the Baojia chief and his supervisor in charge of the area for verification, and then apply for the issuance of a distribution certificate.

The issuance period for each issue is stipulated as one month. The start and end dates are announced by the office in newspapers. Each distribution office should stipulate the number of households and household numbers to be issued each day within the start and end dates, and issue certificates on a daily basis. The number of households and household numbers to be issued should be announced to the public three days before the issuance date.

After the issuance date of the aforementioned certificate has been announced, each household must apply for the certificate in order. If the certificate is not collected after the deadline, it can only be collected after one month of the issuance period has ended. When re-applying, a late fee of 20 yuan in national currency should be paid for each certificate, and the receipt should be prepared by the distribution office in charge. No re-issuance will be made after the deadline.

After citizens receive the distribution certificate, they should cut off the designated number in the distribution certificate and purchase it from the designated retail store in accordance with the date and the name, quantity, and price of the distribution materials announced by the office.

After citizens receive the distribution certificate, they should keep it properly. In the event of damage or loss, the office will not re-issue or exchange it under any circumstances.

If citizens have any questions about the procedures for applying for certificates, re-issuing certificates, or returning certificates, they may inquire at each distribution office. Staff members of the distribution office wear service badges. If there is any illegal behavior, citizens may find out the staff member's badge number or name and submit evidence to the office for prosecution, but they must not falsely accuse them with malice.

Method of Issuing Certificates for Household Registration Changes

If a citizen moves from District A to District B in this city, he should hand over the household registration movement certificate to apply for increasing the distribution certificate and return the remaining comprehensive distribution certificate to the distribution office in District A. The receipt should be returned to the distribution office in District B. The receipt should be returned to the distribution office in District B.

In addition to making a daily report to the office, the distribution office in District A should also make a receipt for the return. The distribution office in District B should also report the returned receipt to the office together with the movement certificate and the application form for increasing the distribution certificate to make a daily report for approval before the distribution certificate can be exchanged (the form of the receipt for the return of the certificate and the daily report for the issuance of the certificate and the return of the certificate is determined.)

If a citizen encounters death or returns to his hometown, he should return the remaining distribution certificate to the original distribution office and present the movement certificate or death certificate. The office will fill in the receipt for the return of the certificate, make a daily report, and present it to the office for registration together with the distribution certificate. After stamping the receipt with a record seal and returning it, the citizen will hand it over to the police bureau's Baojia department for verification together with the change certificate.

Citizens who move in from outside the city area should submit the application form and the house donation receipt to the distribution office in charge for approval before the distribution certificate can be issued, but each distribution office should issue the entire sheet and should not cut it.

Match Smuggling is Under Investigation

In addition, the Goods Distribution Office has recently received many confidential reports from citizens, all claiming that they were using the 46th Comprehensive Joint Ticket to purchase household distribution matches from designated retailers. They discovered that the retailers often increased the price of the distributed scattered small boxes. Since each retailer has a legal profit, they should not claim to have illegal gains. It is extremely illegal and it is heard that personnel are being sent to investigate secretly in order to punish them severely.

### Flooding on Fanhangdu Road - Please Dredge the Drains

The terrain in the West Shanghai area is low-lying. Every time it rains heavily, the water accumulates into canals. Especially in the 45th Lane of Fanhangdu Road, the problem is the most serious. In the past, it was limited to the rainy season between June and July. In recent months, even when there is light rain or no rain, water has accumulated to the knees and has not receded for months. Sewage overflows and the stench is unbearable. As summer approaches, it is easy to breed mosquitoes, which has the potential to spread diseases and has a significant impact on public health in the area. Residents of the area have hired experts to inspect it. According to them, the cause of the water accumulation is the siltation of the drains on Fanhangdu Road inside and outside the lane. Therefore, we appeal to the authorities to only dredge the drains to ensure public welfare and maintain hygiene. The entire residents of the area are extremely sincere in praying. (Jiang Changluan, resident of No. 45, Lane Bing, Fanhangdu Road, West Shanghai)

### Mr. Jiutai Donates a Large Sum - To Be Used as Small Loan Funds

Yesterday, Mr. Jiutai generously donated 100,000 yuan to be used as small loan funds for the poor. His enthusiasm is commendable. The purpose of small loan funds is to subsidize those who have lost their jobs. Anyone who is engaged in small-scale brokerage and is short of funds or needs to add capital can apply for a loan from the office during office hours with their residence certificate. The procedure is extremely simple. The principal is repaid once a month at a rate of 2%, and it is repaid in ten installments without interest.

### Limited-Price Pork - Profits Used for Charity

The Shanghai District Livestock Industry Pork Retailers Association came to discuss: "Our association, in view of the recent high price of pork in the city, which is not only disrupting the wartime economic structure, but also affecting the foundation of people's livelihood, has been ordered by the authorities to assist the authorities in eradicating illegal black markets. It has also announced in newspapers to its members to report each other and not engage in black market trading. On one hand, it summoned industry insiders to discuss an overall plan, intending to purchase in groups by the association at a limited price and distribute it fairly to benefit the people's livelihood and eliminate the black market. Unexpectedly, after only one day of implementation, it was abandoned halfway due to various obstacles, which is extremely regrettable. After purchasing 19 live pigs (1,150 yuan per kilogram) on the first day of the implementation of group purchases by the association (April 24), in addition to distributing it to each member (in order of registration) at 900 yuan per catty on the 26th, there was still a legal profit of 80,473 yuan. Now, the funds are offered to be used as your newspaper's aid fund for poor children, 40,473 yuan to be transferred, and the remaining 40,000 yuan to be donated to the News Small Loan Fund, I hope you will collect it."

### Learn Boxing to Show Gratitude - Donate to Charity School Funds

The Yongnian Taijiquan class held by our office is taught voluntarily by Feng Qingchuan and Zhong Wenjun. The reader, Mr. Sun Zhengzhi, yearns for it, but is unable to learn due to work reasons. He wrote to Mr. Chuan, begging to be taught individually on weekends and holidays. He also knows that Mr. Chuan's teaching of boxing is purely voluntary in nature. He is afraid that he will not accept the remuneration, so he attached a check for 20,000 yuan, asking to donate it to the "Charity School Fund" and the Chinese Moral Education Association to create blessings. It was delivered by Mr. Fu yesterday, and he has agreed with Mr. Sun to join the group practice.

### The Fuk Yo Orphanage Board of Directors

The Shanghai Fuk Yo Orphanage held a plenary board meeting yesterday afternoon at the Tian'an Church. More than twenty people, including Wu Yunzhai and Ding Fubao, attended. Chairman Chen Yisheng reported on the progress of the orphanage's affairs, stating roughly: The orphanage was established four years ago, and currently provides shelter for three hundred and fifty-four destitute children. Thanks to the enthusiastic support and generous donations from compassionate and charitable individuals from all walks of life, hundreds of homeless children have been saved from wandering the streets, receiving education and guidance. This not only fills the staff and children with boundless gratitude, but also benefits the society and the nation. Next, Dong Bin reported that the orphanage provides three meals a day, requiring 33 shi (a unit of dry measure) of rice and 140 bags of flour per month, along with cooking oil, salt, vegetables, and fuel, costing approximately seven million yuan per month. Currently, donations are meager, and the orphanage relies entirely on existing food reserves to sustain operations. Accountant Ning Sihong then reported that the orphanage's income and expenditures for last year totaled 8,874,000 yuan. Finally, the board discussed and ratified the appointment of Xu Datong and 29 others as directors and added Lin Kanghou, Zheng Yuan, and Shen Yongkang as executive directors. It was also resolved to streamline the orphanage's operations, economize expenditures, and, in order to adapt to the environment, to comply with the authorities' intention to disperse residents, preparing to move to the countryside and implement a plan for production and education.
