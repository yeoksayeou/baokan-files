Since June of last year, until Japan announced its surrender, these armies fought on the India-Burma battlefield and recently captured Liuzhou and Guilin. They have not rested for more than a year, so their great achievements in serving the country on the battlefield make people deeply admire them. Someone asked when the National Army will be able to parade and meet with the four million compatriots on the sea who have been separated for eight years. The answer was that it will be possible only after all the troops and mechanized units arrive within a week.

### Minister Wu's Speech

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th – A foreign reporter briefing was held at 3:00 PM on the 5th, presided over by Minister Wu Guozhen, Vice Minister Gan Naiguang, and Counselor Zhang Pingqun. After Minister Wu took office at the Propaganda Department on the first of this month, he hosted the briefing for the first time today, first delivering a speech to the reporters, declaring the mission of the Propaganda Department in the future, and promising to provide as much convenience as possible to the reporters in their work. Minister Wu first said: For the past three years, due to my responsibilities, I have developed close ties and friendships with gentlemen. In the future, I will provide you with various news, not propaganda, but frank, true, and reliable facts, hoping to provide you with many conveniences in your work. Minister Wu continued: Gentlemen, regarding the facts of China, you must take a fair attitude and a long-term vision to make accurate reports. Based on past experience, in the past few years, China has been subject to much criticism, but current facts prove that past criticisms were unfounded. I will cite two things as examples. In the past, various parties often reported that China might withdraw from the war. Regarding this point, the people of all countries must be very clear now that although China has suffered more pain and sacrifice in the eight years of the war of resistance than any other Allied country, surprisingly, China has not only not withdrawn from the war, but has won today's victory. In the past few years, Japan has continuously launched peace offensives against us, but all attempts have been strictly rejected. I believe that fair-minded people in the world will surely recognize that this is the will of the supreme leader Chairman Chiang, who has never given up, and the unwavering confidence of the people of the whole country. In the past, some people criticized China for being undemocratic and lacking freedom of speech. The center of the general criticism was China's censorship system. Regarding this point of explanation, first, we were fighting a war at the time. Any country has a censorship system during wartime, not just China. Second, we admit that China's organization is not as good as other Allied countries, so in times of emergency, we had to rely on the censorship system. Third, China has not yet had laws like the UK and the US, so we had to use the censorship system to suppress the remarks that the UK and the US could use the libel law to sanction. However, the censorship system will be abolished in the near future, this point can answer to the general criticism. Even more, gentlemen, you have been in China for many years, and from an objective point of view, you cannot but admit the progress China has made in recent years, compared with the situation in the previous warlord era, there is a world of difference. Fortunately, the Japanese invasion caused the democratic progress plans originally scheduled by Chairman Chiang and the National Government to be greatly hit. Now that the war has just ended, the various measures taken by our government recently should enable you to recognize that we have immediately continued the work interrupted by the war and are engaged in building a new China that is democratic and free. I hope you have a full understanding of this. Minister Wu said: In the future, my task is to give you various conveniences and assistance.

Nanjing Correspondence

### General Leng Xin's Interview Record

— Special Southern Correspondent of this Newspaper, Han Ruo

Before General He Jingzhi arrived in the South, Lieutenant General Leng Xin was one of the most important military officers in Central China. In order to further understand the situation of the Forward Command Post of the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army, this reporter was dispatched to conduct a special interview with Lieutenant General Leng.

The Capital is Not as Enthusiastic as Shanghai

Since the broadcast seeking peace on August 10th, the people of Shanghai have expressed enthusiastic celebrations. National flags have been flying all over Shanghai for two weeks, and large-scale celebrations are also being prepared in full swing. We imagined that the people of the capital must have the same celebratory mood, but upon arriving in Nanjing, we found it not to be the case. There was not even a trace of celebratory atmosphere on the streets. It was cold everywhere, and even the national flag was not hung. It seems that the people of Nanjing do not seem to care much about this, which is truly puzzling.

General He's Forward Command Post is located in the Overseas Chinese Hotel on Zhongshan North Road, while Lieutenant General Leng's office is located in the Yingbin Hotel, which is also the official residence of the President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Li.

Although it is early autumn, the sultry heat is worse than midsummer. In front of the Forward Command Post stood brave national soldiers, who had recently come to Nanjing with Lieutenant General Leng. They were all young and strong, amiable and approachable. Under the guidance of a soldier, I met with Councilor Diao Zuomin of the Command Post.

Diplomatic Veteran, Councilor Diao

Councilor Diao is a veteran in the diplomatic circle and currently serves as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Because the Command Post has some diplomatic affairs to handle, Councilor Diao has taken on the important task of this "forward diplomacy." Councilor Diao, who is over sixty years old, looks no more than fifty years old and looks very heroic in military uniform. Diao, the former Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is his son. Both are very famous figures in Chinese diplomacy.

Councilor Diao told the reporter many things about the Forward Command Post, but unfortunately, they cannot be published here at this time.

Director Leng's residence is not far from the Command Post. Thanks to Councilor Diao's instructions and coordination, I had the opportunity to visit him once.

In the large reception room, people waiting for an interview were ushered into the Director's office in batches every few minutes. Dishes had been placed in the hall for a long time, but visitors continued to arrive one after another. It is conceivable that Director Leng is so diligent in handling official duties that even meal times are delayed. After waiting in the reception room for a short time, it was my turn to be received.

In the Director's office, several staff members were buried in their work. Against the wall was a row of sofas, with a pile of official documents placed on the coffee table in front of the sofa. Between the sandbag and the coffee table, Director Leng stood quietly, greeting me with a smile and humbly inviting me to sit down, which made me feel warm and pleasant.

"You've been waiting for a long time! I'm sorry," the Director shook hands with the reporter very kindly, while uttering humble words, with a Sichuan-Guizhou accent, sincere attitude, and courteous manners.

The Mission of the Forward Command Post

In order to save time, the reporter briefly raised a few questions and asked for instructions. Except for confidential matters that could not be published, they were answered one by one. Director Leng said: "I was ordered by General He to come here to establish the Forward Command Post. The main tasks are: to prepare for matters that should be handled before the Commander-in-Chief arrives, and to supervise Japan's fulfillment of the treaty provisions. Staff members from both China and Japan have been busy contacting each other to handle everything in accordance with orders. Once the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army is stationed in Nanjing, the Command Post will be dissolved. The Military Affairs Commission has regulations on the handling of the Japanese surrender and the procedures for the National Army to be stationed in various regions. The signing ceremony for the surrender of Japanese troops in the Chinese region will be personally presided over by General He when he arrives. The date can only be determined after the Commander-in-Chief arrives."

Experiences During the War of Resistance

Regarding the Lieutenant General's personal experiences during the War of Resistance, the Lieutenant General told the reporter: "Since the 28th year of the Republic (1939), I have been ordered to serve as the commander of guerrilla warfare in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas, leading troops to resist the enemy. I am a soldier and only know how to carry out military orders, and I do not want to say much, so few people outside know that I fought against the Japanese in the Jiangnan area."

With a short stature, matched with a neat British military uniform, and black hair neatly combed, he looks only thirty-four or five years old. He answers guests' inquiries in a concise tone, so simple, concise, and powerful, like a military order. A cigarette is never far from his mouth. His attitude is calm and serious, but he sometimes gives people a kind smile. This is the appearance of Lieutenant General Leng Xin. In the five-minute conversation, I felt that the Lieutenant General was indeed a very capable, taciturn, typical soldier.

Finally, Deputy Commander Zhang delivered a thank-you speech. The representatives departed at six o'clock.

### Representative Chiang Strictly Forbids Strikes in Public Utilities, Violators Will Be Punished According to Military Law

Yesterday, workers at the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Shanghai Electric Power Company stopped supplying electricity for more than two hours due to a dispute with the company over wages. Although the Municipal Party Department and the General Command of the Workers' Patriotic Salvation Army mediated and resolved the situation, the communication work of various telecommunications agencies was greatly affected. Representative Chiang was extremely shocked upon hearing the report, believing that public utilities are of great importance to people's livelihoods and security. In this transitional period, there should be no acts of sluggishness or strikes. He issued a notice strictly forbidding such behavior, stating that if such incidents occur again, they will be severely punished according to military law.

Protect Telegraph and Telephone Lines

The telegraph and telephone lines along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways have been repeatedly sabotaged by bandits, causing the interruption of wired telegraphs and long-distance telephones between Shanghai and various locations. The Jiangsu-Jiangnan District Telecommunications Restoration Office of the Ministry of Transportation, for military reasons, plans to repair them and has requested Representative Chiang to order protection. After receiving the report, Representative Chiang telegraphed the General Command of the Shanghai Mobile Corps and the Nanjing Advance Army Command to send troops to provide effective protection.

### Allied Aircraft Fly Over the City and Drop Comfort Items

Yesterday, five Allied aircraft flew over Shanghai, soaring and circling, causing great excitement among the citizens, who waved flags and shouted and set off firecrackers to show their welcome.

Because the comfort items dropped by the Allied aircraft yesterday had small safety parachutes, there were rumors that paratroopers had arrived in Shanghai, which was actually a false rumor.

### Various Groups Telegraph Mayor Qian to Assume Office, Post-War Construction is Urgent

The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, and various groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce jointly telegraphed Mayor Qian yesterday, requesting him to assume office as soon as possible to preside over municipal affairs in order to seek restoration and construction. The original telegram stated: "Mayor Mugong Jian: Since the Japanese invaders invaded the east, this city, being located on the coast, was the first to fall. Subsequently, with the outbreak of the Pacific War, enemy troops entered the urban area. Since then, this corner of the sea has no longer had an inch of clean land. For several years, the people of the city have been living in deep waters and hot fires, crying out repeatedly, with no way to appeal to heaven. Now, fortunately, the War of Resistance has been won, and the sun has shone again. We have also heard that the central government has selected you, our public, as the mayor of this city. Your great plans will surely live up to the expectations of the people. The remaining people after the disaster are celebrating the recovery, their joy is beyond description. However, this place is home to people from all walks of life, and the situation is complicated. In addition, after eight years of occupation, the accumulated poison is deep, and it is urgent to eliminate the dirt. The post-war construction is especially complex, with everything waiting to be started. We sincerely hope that you will arrive early to console the people's longing. The telegram cannot express our anticipation. Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, Sanminzhuyi Youth League Shanghai Branch, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Municipal Education Association, Shanghai Municipal Student Union, Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Shanghai Municipal Women's Association, Shanghai Municipal Association, respectfully."
