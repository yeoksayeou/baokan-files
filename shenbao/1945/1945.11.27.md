The full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is published below:

Full Text of Instructions

The establishment of this committee has one goal: to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, to help the people, and to dedicate all our strength to the great work of peaceful reconstruction and development in the future. As we begin our work, I want to frankly explain to you, and through you to our fellow countrymen, a few words about the many economic and recovery problems we face, and the actions we must take to solve them.

We cannot ignore the basic need of our fellow countrymen to attain a higher standard of living because of the domestic unrest. Currently, our country is facing a period of turbulent waves, which is unavoidable after the war. During this period, it is very natural for the people to feel uneasy and anxious. Moreover, there are still some people in the country who put the interests of parties and individuals above the interests of the nation, and fiercely obstruct the recovery work of the National Government in the recovered provinces and regions, and destroy various economic foundations. The government is now correcting this situation, and we must do our best to restore domestic order and security, but at the same time, we must also bear the equally great responsibility to help the people recover from the wartime losses and damages, and improve their living conditions. The National Government has now established this Supreme Economic Council because it recognizes the need to immediately adopt sound economic measures. I personally am very willing to take personal responsibility for the economic construction and development of our country, and to provide guidance.

Grasp the Current Economic Situation and Adopt Effective Corrective Measures for Unfavorable Phenomena

As we proceed with our work, we must grasp the many unfavorable phenomena in China's current economic situation. The eight years of the War of Resistance have severely damaged our economy, which refers not only to the bombing of cities and the destruction of houses and factories. During the war, our country lost the productive power of countless people, who were forced to leave the countryside and the cities. Because of the enemy's blockade, we also lost the commerce we needed from the coast. In many places, the Japanese completely or partially dismantled our factories. In other places, they even converted our civilian industries into their wartime industries. Therefore, it is not an easy task to restore these factories and have them produce what our people need. Currently, some of our country's industries are at a standstill, and some are only maintaining a small amount of production. The majority of laborers have lost their jobs, creating a widespread phenomenon of hardship.

This situation cannot be allowed to continue. The first thing we must do is to enable the people to regain employment. However, in order to revitalize industry and enable workers to find jobs, it is indeed a very complex problem because of various difficulties. Many places in our country lack coal, and our current railway and highway facilities are by no means able to meet the needs of transportation. We also do not have a sufficient number of trained management and technical personnel to take over and manage the businesses previously run by the Japanese. Our national finances have been greatly devastated because of the enormous wartime expenses and the enemy's plunder. We must correct these situations, otherwise our industries cannot hope to develop.

Our agriculture has also been greatly hampered. Our country does not have sufficient modern agricultural materials, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and good seeds. Nor is there sufficient widespread modern farming knowledge. Experts believe that if we adopt these new methods, the harvest can certainly be greatly increased in the short term. Another important thing is that the average farmer now bears too heavy a burden of land rent, taxes, and interest. This phenomenon greatly weakens the entire agricultural structure of our country. The government's current regulations on reducing land rent by 25% and exempting land taxes in the recovered areas are the first step in correcting this phenomenon. The farmers of our country, like the laborers and managers in the industrial sector in the cities, need the strongest support from the government.

Temporary Hardship and Unease After the War are the Price of Striving for Victory and Freedom

After every great war, there will be a period of hardship and unease. From the perspective of the whole country, this is a very small price to pay for striving for victory and freedom. But we must admit that for countless people, this winter is a serious economic crisis. This crisis requires our people to bring out all their perseverance to cope with it. During this period, what is needed is absolute fairness and integrity in all public and private life. This is a critical juncture in our history, and it is absolutely intolerable for slow, corrupt, or selfish people to exploit the people in order to seek personal wealth. Such personnel must be eliminated and severely punished.

During this War of Resistance, the bravery and perseverance of our people have won the praise of the whole world. I can now say to you, and to our fellow countrymen, that the suffering we have endured has not been in vain. I can also tell you that never before in our history has such a great economic opportunity been unfolding before us. This opportunity can be shared by all our fellow countrymen. I firmly believe that in the coming months, we will definitely be able to, and must strive to, take preparatory steps in the area of peaceful reconstruction and development. This step can directly lead the people to a more satisfactory life. When we have improved all the basic conditions, quelled the internal unrest, and expanded various economic activities, the opportunities for work in all aspects will naturally increase, and the necessities of food, clothing, housing, and transportation will become cheaper and more abundant. The goods and services that are currently lacking will gradually be increased and supplied to the general public.

Utilize Our Construction Strengths and Seek Economic Cooperation with Allied Nations

In carrying out this important work of construction and development, this committee must recognize that our country's problems cannot be solved by merely hoping that other countries will help. We must help ourselves. The entire future of our country depends on our ability to exert our construction strengths. This strength is the key to a great nation. What we seek from our allied nations is primarily economic cooperation on a sound basis.

The task of this committee is to immediately give the people sound help and guidance, so that they can help themselves, and take appropriate steps to achieve economic progress as soon as possible. This committee should closely coordinate with the important work of various government ministries related to economic matters. This committee should examine various facts and make practical and rapid decisions on various issues in economic policy at any time. It should pay attention to and supervise the relevant government ministries to implement various policies quickly. These tasks, in some respects, are similar to the various powers exercised by the War Production Board during the war, but this committee will have even higher powers. We must understand that the government's establishment of this committee is not intended to take on all the administrative work and responsibilities in the economic field. On the contrary, I believe that the governments of each province, city, and county must gradually assume responsibility for economic construction and development within their own regions, in accordance with the general policies of this committee. Only in this way can each region achieve the greatest development, and sound local administration is the cornerstone of building a strong democratic country. At the same time, this is also a way to develop the private talents and management capabilities of a country, which is the driving force of economic progress in a democratic country. The local governments of our country must stand on their own feet. Anything they can do themselves should not rely on the central government to do it. They must take all possible steps to improve the living standards and working conditions of the people within their own borders, and give more support to local industrial, commercial, and other economic undertakings. At the same time, the people of each locality should also trust the capable and dedicated local administrative officials to solve the various economic problems that arise from the local situation. Any local officials who are incompetent or disloyal to their duties must be punished by the government at any time, and the people must also have a local leader they can trust, a local leader who must be able to endure hardship and be determined to sacrifice everything personal in order to accomplish his great mission.

I propose that this committee should complete a nationwide transportation improvement plan as soon as possible by all possible means. The first thing we must do is to make good use of all the existing transportation equipment. After that, we must also strive to maintain and expand our equipment to achieve greater and higher efficiency. I believe that strengthening our country's transportation is the foundation of all our efforts to promote economic construction and progress. What we must pay special attention to is to transport food and fuel to areas that lack them. This transportation plan should include not only railways and maritime transportation, but also the construction of highways and the acquisition of vehicles, so that they can be maintained in constant operation. Under this entire plan:

Complete the Transportation Improvement Plan

First, the committee should immediately plan and implement a nationwide highway construction program. I believe that if this program is properly implemented, it will definitely greatly increase our country's economic strength at a lower cost within a few years. On this point, I want to remind this committee that there are currently more than one million Japanese prisoners of war in our country. Because of the lack of transportation and the various difficulties encountered by the Allied Supreme Commander in Japan, the repatriation of these prisoners of war must be implemented gradually. Before returning home, these prisoners of war should be allowed to do some productive work, thereby helping to restore some of the damage they have inflicted on our country. I firmly propose to this committee that before the Japanese prisoners of war return home, we should immediately use them to help our country build modern roads and build an entire transportation system.

Implement a Program to Improve Agriculture

Second, the committee should immediately plan a practical program to improve our country's agriculture and implement it. This plan should of course include increased production, import, and distribution of major fertilizers, pesticides, and improved seeds, as well as the dissemination of modern agricultural knowledge to farmers. The committee must also immediately find ways to reduce excessive land rent and usurious interest, and adjust land taxes to suit the people's ability to pay, in order to improve the living conditions of our country's farmers. To achieve these goals, the government has already established certain laws and regulations. The committee must be responsible for strengthening these laws and regulations, and urging their effective and rapid implementation. I further propose that the committee should plan a long-term afforestation program, so that the precious soil in our country's agricultural areas can be maintained and can supply the necessary timber. Afforestation on our country's barren mountains is indeed very important and should be started immediately.

Formulate Measures to Support Industry

Third, the committee should immediately formulate a plan to help various industries increase production, especially industries that produce various necessities, such as fuel, textiles, and building materials. To achieve this and other economic construction and development goals, the most urgent thing is to determine the exchange rate to stabilize the currency, which must be done as soon as possible. The committee must take immediate action on this point. To further encourage large-scale industrial production, the various controls imposed on industry by the government during the war should be lifted immediately, unless under certain circumstances, the lifting of controls would affect the entire national economy, which may be considered an exception. Direct and effective action should also be taken to facilitate the recruitment of qualified industrial management personnel, technical personnel, and skilled workers. Methods for importing industrial equipment based on our country's ability to pay should be supervised by the committee to ensure that the most important industries and public utilities can first obtain the funds and transportation needed to purchase these materials. The committee should guide the production of industry so that goods with a fixed market at home and abroad can be produced, and reduce unhealthy production. The interest rates and loan policies of our country's banks must be thoroughly reviewed and revised to encourage industrial production. The true situation of various industries operated by the Japanese during the war must be understood and analyzed. On this point, I can report that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has collected a lot of valuable information on the various economic activities of the Japanese in the occupied areas.

Find Ways to Encourage Foreign Trade

Fourth, the committee should find ways to encourage our country's foreign trade. This should be our main task. The committee should immediately formulate a plan to encourage and help produce various agricultural and industrial products needed abroad, of course, this production should not cause our country to lack other essential goods, and it cannot despise the deserved enjoyment of our laborers. By developing foreign trade, our country can obtain foreign exchange to purchase more necessary machinery and equipment and materials that cannot be produced domestically.

Fifth, the committee should concentrate its efforts on improving domestic health conditions. We must immediately determine policies and programs to plan the production, import, and development of various health and epidemic prevention equipment and facilities. Closely related to health programs are programs to improve housing, compulsory education, and other programs that are necessary to build a strong social foundation for people's economic activities.

Collect Information on Economic Plans

Sixth, the committee should immediately begin to collect detailed information from the government's various ministries, local agencies, and relevant groups and individuals on the economic plans for the next five years. Some of these plans should be implemented as soon as possible, and some can be promoted later. Our country is currently a poor country and cannot hope to achieve all the necessary reforms in a few years. The committee should be responsible for analyzing the facts about various economic plans and immediately give effective encouragement and help to the plans that are most valuable to the national economy. Among these plans, I advocate that special attention should be paid to the issue of river management, because river management is indeed one of our country's greatest resources. Sound river management methods can provide our country with urgently needed flood control methods, large irrigation projects, increased inland waterway transportation, cheap sources of electricity, and entertainment facilities urgently needed by the people within a few years. Through close cooperation between the central government and local governments, the committee will soon be able to complete and implement a comprehensive plan for economic construction and development. Under this plan, the people's most urgent needs will be addressed first. In summary, I hope that this committee can take action immediately. I hope that it can take action to strengthen our country's transportation, increase its agricultural and industrial production, develop its foreign trade, improve its health conditions, and make it work under a sound plan to seek economic progress.

Willing to Dedicate Ourselves to this Work so that People can Enjoy a Better Life

Our fellow countrymen now need and must have a realistic foundation of faith in the Principle of People's Livelihood. When the work of this committee bears fruit, the people will feel that they have gradually achieved a higher standard of living. In addition, they will also see that our country's prestige in the international community is increasing day by day. As long as there can be hope for domestic stability, I will do my best to achieve this stability. Then, the economic achievements of this committee will soon usher in a great era in our country's history.

Our people, after years of poverty and war, have won the right to enjoy a higher and better life. The members of this committee should find ways to make this better life a reality, not in the distant future, but in the near future. The duty of this committee is to work quickly and effectively to meet the needs of the people. Here and now, we jointly dedicate ourselves to this great work. (End)

### Editorial: Current Economic Policies - Reflections on Chairman's Instructions

Yesterday afternoon, the Supreme Economic Council held its first meeting in the Executive Yuan, with the Chairman personally attending and delivering instructions, solemnly outlining the complete picture of current economic policies. While we have not yet received the full text of the telegram as we write this after midnight, we can already glimpse the key points. In his instructions, the Chairman emphasized the restoration of production, the stability of people's lives, and the improvement of living standards. These are, in essence, the ideals that the people are seeking day and night. If the entire nation follows the Chairman's instructions and works together, these ideals can surely be realized.

The Founding Father (Sun Yat-sen) clearly stated long ago that the priority in nation-building is the people's livelihood. Therefore, the Chairman's instructions this time, right from the start, state that the purpose of establishing the Supreme Economic Council is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. This shows that nation-building must begin with the economy. Confucius first emphasized "sufficient food," and Mencius lavishly spoke of "kingly way," even though the Confucianists who valued benevolence and righteousness and looked down on material gain, did not go beyond first ensuring adequate food and clothing before imparting education. Moreover, modern nations have entered an era of intense international economic competition. Whether a nation is based on agriculture, industry, or commerce, its focus cannot be separated from the economy. In discussing politics today, it is already intertwined with the economy. To ignore economic measures while hoping for political progress is almost impossible. After eight years of the War of Resistance, our country's strength has been exhausted, and production has been destroyed. Unless we rise up quickly and work hard to restore normalcy, we will not be able to survive, let alone build a nation. The Chairman's announcement that he is willing to take on the responsibility of guiding future economic measures shows his deep concern.

The main points of the Chairman's instructions are broad in scope. Speaking from the perspective of self-governance, it is about stabilizing people's livelihood and restoring vitality. Speaking from the perspective of its foundation, it is about cultivating agricultural and industrial manpower and improving living standards. In a nutshell, what the Chairman is constantly concerned about is how to enable the people to live in peace and enjoy a prosperous and abundant life. He is deeply concerned and planning how to enable the unemployed to regain employment. This spirit of "feeling the hunger and drowning of others as one's own" should move everyone to work together to promote economic policies and implement the Chairman's intentions.

The scope of the economy is vast, so it requires cooperation from all sectors. Economic measures require the right people, so it is necessary to start with rectifying officialdom. The power to rectify officialdom lies with those at the top.

The Chairman already deeply loathes the general trend of corruption, indulgence, selfishness, and self-interest. Therefore, in the future, verifying names and realities, and promoting integrity and eliminating corruption, will surely be swift and decisive, and will not betray the people's expectations. However, how to rescue the dying and heal the wounded, and strive for construction, so that the unemployed can return to work and the jobless can find jobs, is not the sole responsibility of the government. If the government strives to restore transportation and increase industrial and mining production, but some people destroy railways and damage coal mines to hinder the government's recovery work in the recovered areas, such insane actions should bear significant responsibility for the current suffering of the people's livelihood. The government has recently been working hard to correct this situation, and the people should also cooperate to restrain this evil force that obstructs construction, so that we can expect people's livelihood to become stable. The Chairman said, "Never before in history has such a great economic opportunity been unfolded before us." Indeed, we are facing this great economic opportunity. How to follow the instructions, support national policies, each fulfilling their duties, depends on our own choices.

This area is one of the richest in Central China. The surrender of Japan has actually become a signal for the Communist army to launch an attack on this area. At that time, some Japanese and puppet troops surrendered to the Communist army, while others retreated to the Taixian, Yizheng, and Yangzhou areas, waiting to be disarmed.

### National Army Has Entered Jinzhou, Continues to Advance 144 Li and Arrives at Goubangzi, Wedemeyer Summons Babe to Discuss Troop Transportation

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 26th] The National Army entered Jinzhou on the 26th and continued to advance along the railway line. The National Army that occupied Jinzhou was a unit of the 52nd Army that landed in Qinhuangdao by sea.

### U.S. Occupation Authorities Transform Japanese Economic Institutions, Resulting in Pension System; Second Post-War Japanese Diet Convened Yesterday

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] As a result of the U.S. transformation of Japanese economic institutions, a pension system may emerge. According to Mr. Kramer, the Economic Chief of MacArthur's headquarters, although there is no definite plan at present, the Japanese government should take proper measures for the elderly who have no one to turn to. If the Japanese government designs a guarantee system, we will approve it and do our best to assist its development.

According to his explanation, in the military pension system, regardless of age or physical condition, one can retire after three years of military service, and this pension accounts for 15% of the government's annual revenue.

### Hitler's Life: Disdain for the Japanese, Calling Them Half-Monkey Human Toys

[Central News Agency Nuremberg, 25th] A document submitted in the trial of Nazi war criminals reveals that Hitler never respected the Japanese. Hitler once called the Japanese "half-monkey human toys who won't stop jumping." On August 22, 1939, before the attack on Poland, Hitler told senior German generals that we should be aware of Japan's shortcomings. I have given Japan a whole year to make a decision. The Japanese Emperor is like the late Russian Emperor; his weakness and incompetence may lead to his downfall before a revolution breaks out. In an earlier conversation, Hitler said that since the autumn of 1938, I have found that Japan is unwilling to unconditionally follow us, while Mussolini is intimidated by a cowardly monarch and a villainous prince. I have decided to unite with Stalin. In short, there are only three great statesmen: Stalin, that person, and Mussolini. The weakest of the three heroes is Mussolini. Only Stalin and I can predict the future by using force to break through the shackles of royalty or theocracy. In the same document, Hitler described Daladier and Chamberlain as "pathetic worms" who were unwilling to take any further steps beyond blockade. Another document concerning the Berlin meeting between Hitler and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on April 4, 1941, reveals that Matsuoka repeatedly requested Hitler to provide Japan with new German naval and military inventions that Japan needed.

### "Mickey Mouse" Creator Re-creates Cartoons to Meet the Needs of the Peaceful Era

[United Press Hollywood, 25th] Walt Disney, the creator of "Mickey Mouse," has been dedicated to producing war films in his modern studio for the past four years. Now he is returning to his old business, creating humorous cartoons to meet the needs of the peaceful era. The studio is a strange place. Although you won't see Betty Grable, there are hundreds of sounds, including duck quacks, parrot squawks, and earthworm cries. The stories of these artists are unknown to the outside world, so let's reveal one or two things. During the war, Disney devoted himself to producing military films, psychological warfare short films, and health and educational cartoons. He used more equipment and spent more time than other major Hollywood companies. "Mickey Mouse," "Donald Duck," and other cartoons have ten different language copies. Disney still provides the voice for Mickey Mouse himself. The duck language is created by Mr. Nash. His duck quacks are not limited to the three languages that Mr. Nash knows. Experts provide other languages with phonetic symbols. It is truly interesting to hear him quack in Portuguese or Greek. Mr. Nash likes to make animal sounds with milk carts to amuse the neighborhood children. This only stops when people from the studio come looking for the sound. Sometimes he makes horse sounds, which shock everyone. One day he tried it on the studio's broadcasting machine, and the meeting was disrupted and stopped countless times. It takes five or six months to complete a cartoon that is six or eight minutes long. Some cartoons, such as "The Three Caballeros," take two years to complete. Disney has a chemical laboratory to create special pigments with thousands of colors. Cartoon drawings are first outlined on large celluloid sheets. After being colored with this pigment, they can be photographed in the same way as color films. After that, films made by combining real scenes and cartoon characters will become increasingly popular. The new film "Make Mine Music," which is currently being produced in the studio, features the voices of Benny Goodman and the Andrews Sisters, but you don't see them. This is what the Disney people call "ghost actors."

### Our Garrison in Keelung Holds Mandarin Classes

[This Newspaper Keelung News] The Political Guidance Office of the 223rd Regiment of the 75th Division of the 70th Army of the National Army is holding Mandarin literacy classes. Since the start of the classes, the number of students enrolled has been quite enthusiastic.

More Classes Added

### City Elementary School Principals Hold Talks; Director Gu of the Education Bureau Delivers a Speech

[This City News] The City Education Bureau convened the first meeting of city elementary school principals at the bureau's auditorium at 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. More than 80 principals from urban and rural areas attended, and Director Gu, Chief Zhu of the National Education Department, and Chief Zhu of the Social Education Department also attended.

Taking Over City Elementary Schools

Director Gu delivered a speech, stating, "Minister of Education Zhu once said that education comes first during the period of national reconstruction. After the restoration of our city, we must start with national education to organize and improve. At present, there are 91 city elementary schools that have been taken over, which can accommodate about 35,000 students. However, even if the students from private schools are included, only more than 100,000 people can be accommodated. If there are 400,000 school-age children in the city, more than half of the children were not in education previously. It can be seen that we still need to make continuous efforts to popularize national education."

Working Hard to Restore Education

However, after the resumption of schools, school buildings were damaged, and desks and chairs were lacking, causing many difficulties. Due to the city government's financial constraints, it cannot provide as much assistance as possible. It is hoped that those in charge will actively work hard in difficult environments. The funds for the restoration of education in our city were personally promised by Minister Zhu for a loan of 20,000 yuan. If it is settled, it will be distributed equally among the elementary and secondary schools.

Improving Teacher Treatment

As for the treatment of city school teachers, it has been approved by the city government that it will be handled in the same way as civil servants, with increased subsidies and rice allowances to stabilize their lives and enable them to work with peace of mind. Female teachers can be granted leave to rest during childbirth. In short, the Bureau is doing its best to plan for the welfare of teachers. The number of office supplies is small, so I hope that you can use them sparingly. If the drawing equipment is simple and lacking, you can ask enthusiastic people in the community to donate voluntarily, but you are not allowed to collect donations.

Assisting Private Schools to Develop

As for private elementary schools, as long as they aim to run schools, the Bureau is willing to cooperate and help them develop. This semester, 18 million yuan can be allocated as scholarships for private schools. I hope that educators will embrace the spirit of sacrifice and struggle to cultivate outstanding talents for the country." His words were sincere, and all the principals were inspired.

Monthly Talks

Then, the Section Chief of the National Education Department reported on the filling out of the teaching staff list, and some notes on rent, desks, and chairs, etc., and decided to hold principals' talks once a month to facilitate communication. Finally, it is planned to distribute a portion of this month's operating expenses to each school.

### Measures to Improve Teachers' Treatment; Chahar Provincial Department of Education Submits Application to the Ministry for Implementation

[Dahua News Agency Chongqing Airmail] If we want education to be effective, we must rely on the continuous efforts of excellent teachers. If we want excellent teachers to be able to serve with peace of mind, we must allow them to

Reasons for Improvement

Be able to maintain a minimum standard of living. Before the war, the lives of ordinary teachers were already poor. Since the incident, prices have risen sharply, and teachers' salaries have not been able to keep up. Personal life has become a problem, let alone supporting their families. Given this situation, it is difficult to prevent them from seeking opportunities, and it is even harder to force them to work for the public. Moreover, because teachers cannot solve their livelihood problems, their bodies are in poor condition due to lack of adequate care, and their interests are reduced due to anxiety and depression. Therefore, the decline and regression of educational efficiency are inevitable. The Chahar Provincial Department of Education, in view of this, has specially formulated measures to improve teachers' treatment and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for unified implementation. The original measures are recorded as follows:

Implementation Measures

(1) The treatment of teachers and staff in provincial elementary and secondary schools should be increased based on the price index to ensure that they can maintain a minimum standard of living. (2) The treatment of teachers and staff in municipal and private elementary and secondary schools should be ordered to the municipal and county governments or school boards to try their best to follow the example of provincial schools. (3) Teachers' salaries should be equal and uniform, regardless of whether they are public or private, with the same work and the same treatment. (4) In the provinces and cities that have been occupied, education has been destroyed, schools have been damaged beyond repair, and the people are extremely poor. Land tax has been exempted. Although an additional educational fund has been added, at the beginning of the restoration, school funds still need to be allocated by the government, and in order to improve teachers' treatment, the government should be asked to provide a large amount of subsidies.

### Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament: Liangxi Wins Over Morning Friends, Xie Xing Defeats Flying Horse

Two games were played in the Morning Friends Cup basketball tournament yesterday. As a result, Xie Xing defeated Flying Horse 36-16, and Liangxi defeated Morning Friends 38-28.

### The Goal of National Taipei University

— Luo Zonglu

The purpose of a university lies in the pursuit of truth and seeking the welfare of mankind. The systems of universities around the world may differ, but their ideals are the same, hence the saying "scholarship knows no borders." National Taipei University must assume this noble task in the future, and should not regard itself as merely a university of Taiwan, confined to a small scope. Know that if you aim for the highest standard, you will only achieve the middle; if you aim for the middle, you will only achieve the lowest. We can start from small things, but our goals must be lofty and far-reaching. Oxford University is located in Oxford, hence the name, but Oxford University is not merely a university of Oxford; it is a university of England, and also a university of the world. The same is true of Cambridge University. Although National Taipei University is named after Taipei, it is not merely a university of Taiwan, but a national university of China. We must strive to make it a university of the world. Running a university requires such lofty ideals. If it is run with a shortsighted vision and utilitarian thinking, it will never become a true university.

The predecessor of National Taipei University was the Japanese Taipei Imperial University, established twenty years ago (preparations began in 1925). Mr. Oshima Kintaro was the one who ran around and planned it. Mr. Oshima had lofty ideals. Although the justification for the preparations was to develop Taiwan's industry, his real goal was to create a complete temple of agricultural science. Although he unfortunately passed away early and was unable to fully realize his ambitions, the fact that the Faculty of Agriculture of Taipei Imperial University has such a scale is undoubtedly the result of his lofty ideals, which can serve as a lesson for us. I hope that our fellow compatriots in Taiwan will have a clear understanding of this point, and not regard this National Taipei University as merely a university of Taiwan, but broaden their horizons and work together to make National Taipei University a world-class academic institution, comparable to Oxford and Cambridge.

### General Rockey Returns to Tianjin Tomorrow; Yesterday He Told Reporters That the Situation in North China is Serious; He Met Chairman Chiang in Chongqing for the First Time to Discuss Major Policies

[Report from this City] General Rockey, Commander of the North American Marine Corps stationed in China, came to Shanghai from Chongqing the night before last with his Chief of Staff General Lawton, and is scheduled to return to Tianjin tomorrow (the 28th). When Mr. Rockey left Tianjin, he met with General Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Command, and his Chief of Staff Zhao Jiayi. However, the results of all plans and discussions do not seem to have reached the point of publication. When Mr. Rockey was in Chongqing, he went to see Chairman Chiang privately. He met with reporters in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and said: He went to Chongqing to meet Chairman Chiang for the first time to discuss major plans, and expressed his gratitude for the Chairman's kindness. He also said that Madam Chiang's health is not good and she intends to come to Shanghai to recuperate.

America is Determined to Save the Current Crisis

The situation in North China today is indeed serious, and seems to be worse than we expected. However, the US military will withdraw only after completing its mission. We will take action to save the current crisis. The US Marine Corps stationed in North China has a total of 50,000 people. Although most of them suffer from homesickness, he personally feels very happy with his work and is proud to assist the National Army in completing its mission. The Chinese government's request to the United States for ships to transport troops north has not yet received a definitive answer.

Communist Army Attacks Occur Daily

The US military's defense area in North China extends to Qinhuangdao. There are no US troops in the nine provinces of Northeast China. Most of the US troops are stationed in Tianjin, and they have been there for two months. They may stay in Tianjin for another two months to half a year. Everything depends on the development of the situation in North China and the orders of Washington. Because the number of troops stationed is huge, the supplies required are also large, and the transportation of materials is frequent. Moreover, supplies must be transported from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin and Beiping. Communist military harassment and attacks occur daily. The US military does everything possible to protect life and property. As for the so-called taking military action, it is not impossible, but there are concerns that innocent people will be affected. Most of the Japanese in North China have been disarmed, but some are still ordered to guard railways and assume defense responsibilities.

A Glimpse of Key US Officials Stationed in Tianjin

Currently, the Marine Corps Headquarters in Tianjin has several people: (1) General Rockay, (2) General Peck, (3) General Shepherd, (4) General Woods, (5) General Johnson, (6) General Snow. In Beiping, there is General Jones. They fought in various places during the war and were transferred to North China this autumn. Mr. Rockey never expressed his views on the future movements of the US Marine Corps in North China, but it is known that the US Marine Corps will never withdraw from this complex environment, because the US military's mission is still ongoing.

Commercial News

### Gold Price Plunges 40,000 Amidst Speculation

There is a rumor of an 80% Discount on US Dollars

Yesterday (the 26th), the financial market turned sluggish because Chairman Chiang was about to deliver a speech on economic policies. However, there was no shortage of short covering after the decline. In addition, there was much speculation in the market about the official exchange rate, and no one could agree. After the decline, the market turned hesitant. The domestic gold market reported a slight decline. After the opening, the price broke through the 800,000 mark and gradually fell to around 760,000. The afternoon session closed with a surge in short covering, which pulled the price up, once returning to 790,000. In the afternoon, it hovered within 780,000. As a result, it fell back 40,000 compared with last Saturday. People generally have deep expectations for Chairman Chiang to suppress prices and stabilize the currency value. However, there are different opinions on the negotiation of US dollar exchange rates. It is unknown whether the gold price will be lowered to match the US dollar, or the US dollar will be raised to match the gold purchase price. However, calculated at a US dollar price of 1,300, the gold price is still too high. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops was 84,000, which was also 3,000 lower than last Saturday. The official price of silver was unchanged at 650 yuan per tael. Therefore, the price of silver dollars lacked momentum to rise and continued to hover around 430.

Foreign currency US dollars fell as soon as the gold market fell, initially retreating to 1,320 yuan, and then breaking into the 1,300 mark. There was a rumor in the market that the official US dollar exchange rate would be 20% lower than the black market, and it once fell to 1,280 yuan. Afterwards, it hovered around 1,300 due to the rebound of the gold price. As a result, it fell back 30 yuan compared with last Saturday. The same was true for Hong Kong dollars. Although there were rumors of a devaluation of the pound sterling, the Hong Kong US dollar exchange rate fell to 5.00 yuan. The two statements offset each other, so although it fell, it was still flat. As a result, old Hong Kong dollars fell by 25 yuan, new goods fell by 3 yuan, Hankou pounds were 3,100, and rupees were 280, all of which were purchase prices.

Yesterday, the public bonds market saw a concentration of general floating funds because the stock market could not be publicly traded. In addition, large investors were watching the gold market and also came to participate, resulting in a situation where demand exceeded supply. The price of each bond rose by 20 to 50 yuan. People generally have various extravagant hopes for the future repayment of principal on public bonds. The market continued to rise after the close and the market was particularly brisk. Hua shares have already been sold for liquidity. Yesterday, they were further discouraged by personnel from the Securities Building, making trading even more inconvenient. Off-market bidding was intermittent. As a result, large-cap stocks were still flat compared to last Saturday, while small-cap stocks fell by nearly 10%. This was because retail investors were scrambling to close their positions, resulting in this situation.

Due to various inconveniences, off-market trading of foreign stocks also showed signs of disappearing. Except for Jardine Matheson Textile Mill, which was noticed at around 1,400 to 1,500, no one consulted on the rest.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Using American Cotton (Small)

Cotton is spun into yarn, yarn is woven into cloth. The process seems very simple. But where does the cotton come from? Can the 5,000 bales brought by the Victory supply the operation of 200,000 spindles in large and small yarn factories throughout the city?

In the past, cotton merchants could exchange five dan of cotton for one piece of yarn from the yarn factory. Gradually, it went from five dan to seven dan, and then to seven and a half dan, and even eleven dan for one piece. The trading conditions of the yarn factory seemed to be gradually gaining an advantage. Has the supply of foreign cotton created this advantage?

Shaanxi cotton has not come to Shanghai for a long time. The prospect of Tongzhou cotton is very dim under the recent situation. The varieties of local cotton are mixed and of low quality. Under the premise of accelerating production, the supply and replenishment of domestic raw materials have become a major problem, and we can only rely on foreign cotton. This loophole, whether large or small, is ultimately not the fundamental way to build the country.

Purchasing foreign cotton requires foreign exchange funds. I absolutely support foreign exchange management, but I also advocate production management. In the stage of nation-building, the people should live frugally and it seems unnecessary to use a substantial amount of foreign exchange to purchase expensive raw materials to meet the "urgent needs" of the market.

It is said that the cost of American cotton is only two-thirds of that of domestic cotton, so using American cotton is tantamount to helping the government suppress prices. However, the highest principle of using foreign exchange is to be able to obtain more foreign exchange as a result. If the only goal is to suppress prices, the price seems too high.

Cotton is the main raw material for yarn and cloth. Our country does not lack planting land, so why not think about improving farming and smoothing transportation?

It is said that there are a total of 18,000 looms in Shanghai, and the daily output can reach 36,000 bolts. This means that each person consumes at least 1,000 pieces. So far, there are only 200,000 spindles in operation. The daily output is 500 pieces. Even if it can all be supplied for commercial use, only half of the looms can be operated.

It is also said that there are a total of 1,400 pairs of dyeing vats in Shanghai, and they can produce a total of 140,000 bolts of colored cloth per day. Assuming that all the looms are currently operating and all are supplied for processing, only a quarter can be supplied. What's more, the raw materials for weaving are experiencing problems.

Based on the above two points, it can be seen that the distribution and establishment of our country's enterprises have never been planned in a comprehensive way. Further on: it can be seen that the source of raw materials for most of the state-owned industries has always relied on foreign goods.

Yarn and cloth are the source of clothing for the people. Planned economy is the key to building the country in the future. In this regard, it seems necessary to have planned planning.

### New Candidates for Trade Associations

Zhi Rongsan was appointed as a member of the reorganization committee of the Rickshaw Trade Association.

### A Glimpse of the Market Situation

Rice Market: Yesterday, rice sellers were very firm. Retailers' demand was normal, so there was no power to rise. High-quality goods remained stable, while medium and lower-quality goods rose slightly by 200-300 yuan. The situation was firm in the morning and stable in the afternoon. Glutinous rice rose slightly by 100-200 yuan. Flour was sluggish, continuing to decline by nearly 100 yuan.

Oil Cakes: Due to the continuous arrival of goods from Qingdao, oil prices fell. Retail sales were weak. Raw oil and soybean oil fell again by about 1,000 yuan. Clear oil and rapeseed oil remained stable. Soybean cakes were actively sold due to shipments to Taiwan for use as fertilizer.

Miscellaneous Beans and Explosives: Both arrivals and sales of soybeans were scarce. However, several oil factories have started operating, which is related to raw materials. The market trend is temporarily stable.

Cotton Yarn and Cloth: The yarn market was weak in price and sales, and there was still no improvement. Although various trading groups had demand, the factory's tax payment procedures were troublesome and time-consuming, so the merchant groups took a wait-and-see attitude. Currently, the yarn factories intend to sell and buy American cotton, but due to the lack of outlets, the yarn price seems to lack progress. Merchant groups and dyeing factories had poor demand for fine cloth, but there was some trading on the street. Prices were stable and weak. Well-known brands of shilin cloth and other colored cloths sold well. Bleached cloth had a solid and stable market price due to thin inventories and some retail sales.

Coal Market: People's hearts are still idle, and importers are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. Except for high-end goods, which are still being supported by the holders, the rest continue to show a weak trend. The other day, another American ship arrived, loaded with 8,700 tons of Kailan Special Grade Eight coal from Qinhuangdao, allocated for the use of the electricity company. Unloading began yesterday. The firewood and charcoal market was very calm. Various routes in eastern Zhejiang continued to have arrivals. Traders absorbed at low prices, and the price was not much changed from before.

Hardware: The market is quite idle, and the market situation of various goods is weak on the inside despite a strong showing on the outside. Those holding goods mostly take a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to sell at lower prices, while the raw materials stored in the factories are still sufficient to cope with the time, and there is no intention to purchase. Therefore, transactions are weak, and the price of goods is difficult to improve in a short time.

North and South Goods: The market is stable and weak because arrivals from various routes are very scarce and actual sales are sluggish, also due to weak purchasing power. Moreover, transportation is not smooth, and prices are still in turmoil, but the increase has been fierce, so it is unlikely to rise again.

Dyes: Yesterday's dye market was weak in sales, so prices tended to decline, and retail sales were also sluggish.

Tea Market: Yesterday, people's hearts still showed a firm intention. There was a continuous flow of sales, and buyers had strong demand. The market rose from sluggish to high. As a result, the prices were reported to have risen across the board compared to last week. High-quality Qimen tea jumped to 32,500 yuan per dan, and medium-quality Shuangxun tea rose more than 10,000 yuan compared to last week, breaking the 100,000 yuan mark per dan. Other varieties were also considered popular.

### New Post-War Enterprises: Two Peppermint Oil Factories

The production of peppermint oil is one of the emerging enterprises in recent years. The future is especially bright after the victory of the War of Resistance. It is recently learned that local tycoon Xu Jiqing and others have initiated the organization of a peppermint oil refining factory with a capital of 20 million National Currency. The full amount was raised by the initiators and no more shares will be offered to the public. It is named Fuhua Peppermint Oil Refining Factory Co., Ltd., specializing in refining and sales, and also operating its related subsidiary businesses. In addition to Xu, it is also heard that someone else is organizing this factory, and the work has already begun.

### Economic Briefs

Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Huafeng Wheel returned to Shanghai from Ningbo, carrying 121 bales of Yuyao flowers.

Coal briquette businesses are requesting the Fuel Management Committee to supply coal dust to increase raw materials.

50,000 bags of flour and 1,760 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Keelung today as relief supplies from the Relief Administration for Taiwan.

The "Reorganization of Book Capital Amount" manuscript published yesterday was temporarily suspended due to limited space and will be continued.

### Cracking Down on Passengers Clinging to Trolleys

Trolleys in this city are crowded with passengers, causing some passengers to cling to the trolley doors, hanging outside the car, or riding on the rear of the trailer, which is not only dangerous to themselves but also violates traffic rules. It is learned that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has already informed the Municipal Police Bureau and the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police to strictly crack down on this. It has also ordered the trolley company to comply.

### U.S. Military Surplus Materials to Be Sold at the Beginning of Next Month

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The U.S. authorities will establish an Overseas Liquidation Affairs Office in Shanghai on December 1, responsible for selling huge amounts of U.S. military surplus materials according to U.S. government instructions. The office is expected to be headed by General Johnson. It is reported that U.S. surplus materials include aircraft, trucks, building materials, medicines, clothing, food, etc. It is generally estimated that the value of the surplus goods is over 300 million U.S. dollars. According to a report from this newspaper's reporter, all the materials to be sold in Shanghai, except for those belonging to the Navy which are still en route, have been concentrated in Shanghai. Part of them will be sold at a fair price to local private institutions, but according to the measures set by the U.S. government, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Chinese government agencies, and various charitable organizations will have the right to purchase with priority. The office has not yet received official instructions regarding the application procedures for the sale.

### The People's Intelligence Has Been Opened

— Huang Jiayin

The storm of the War of Resistance opened the door to the Chinese people's intelligence!

It goes without saying that the general education level of the Chinese people is backward. Regarding national affairs and the world situation, the Chinese people in the past mostly adopted an attitude of indifference because they could not manage, dared not manage, and could not manage. Since the War of Resistance, this attitude has changed greatly. Because of the close relationship between personal interests and life and death, everyone has to care about current affairs and the world situation, so the people's intelligence has been greatly opened. Because of the war, the general public has increased a lot of knowledge about the geography of China and the world. Many place names that have never been heard before have appeared in newspapers and in the mouths of children. Everyone has also gradually become familiar with the historical facts of World War I and the League of Nations.

This fact is especially evident in Chongqing, the wartime capital of China during the War of Resistance. We can often see rickshaw pullers reading newspapers, and illiterate sedan chairmen and maids talking to you about national affairs. These were rarely seen in the past, but now they have gradually become popular.

I think the War of Resistance has at least opened the people's intelligence two years earlier.

Another major gain of China's War of Resistance, I believe, is the progress of the people's intelligence.

### The Latin Quarter of Paris After the War

— Shen Yikun

The Latin Quarter of Paris has been the wandering center for students from all over the world since the 13th century. Today, it makes the French government feel a headache.

Thousands of ragged students are wandering the streets under the shadow of the University of Paris, looking for houses and books. Many of them have returned from German concentration camps.

The small hotels crowded in the winding streets of the Latin Quarter have shrewd owners who know that renting rooms to passing couples can earn more money than renting to students. Therefore, the Ministry of Education had to requisition hotels that had been conscripted from returning prisoners of war last spring. Many hotels are miles away from the university.

Other hotels in the Latin Quarter are occupied by the American Red Cross and the Allied forces. An official said: "We may have to build barracks for these students."

The number of students registered at the University of Paris this year is higher than in any year since 1930. But the cost of living for students has increased four or five times. Due to the lack of paper, there is a great shortage of books. Food is also quite difficult to obtain. The Ministry of Education has set up cheap canteens where students can eat a simple meal for a few francs. But there is a fear of freezing this winter.

The cafes on the sloping sidewalks around the Panthéon are sparsely seated. The great French writers Voltaire and Zola were both in the Panthéon.

A twenty-seven-year-old student said: "The price of beer is four times more expensive than before the war, and there is no good wine now." He was a prisoner of war for five years and is now starting his university career again.

The most significant change in this past most pleasant place in Paris is a large sign next to the famous Cluny Museum that reads: "Students! Do not forget the classmates in the sanatorium. Please donate to the National Student Sanatorium Association." Many young French people have returned from Germany in such poor health that they cannot go to school.

French universities receive an average of one hundred letters a week from Americans asking to study there. But because accommodation is difficult, I am afraid that no Americans will be able to come, but several hundred American soldiers will attend lectures at the university.

Academics

### Starting From Lectures

— Jinjiang

At the beginning of this year, when various forms of lectures were booming in this city, a certain bank used the form of a school to hold a business lecture. At that time, it was a unique undertaking in the society.

In order to make many people interested in commerce, anyone who volunteered to participate was accepted regardless of the age and level of the students. As a result, for the above reasons, the lecturers found it difficult to teach; also for this reason, most students could not develop a good impression. The result was that the number of students decreased from 450 to 50!

These fifty students who really came to learn included bank employees, students, bosses, engineers, apprentices, and counter friends in grocery stores. From the age point of view, it ranged from sixteen to forty years old. In terms of level, some had graduated from elementary school, some were in the second year of college. It is really difficult to find a line of results from such complex molecules to hold lectures! And at the end, these fifty people were still playing this scene. There was no result to taste.

Does China not need the form of lectures to elaborate on academics? No, definitely not, it's just that there are too few needed.

Let’s talk about Mr. Yu Tao’s speech at the Youth Association last month. A famous university sponsored it, and the topic was novel and interesting. At first, as many as 700 people asked for tickets to attend, and even more people wanted to go but could not get tickets. The grand occasion should be unprecedented! But, no, when the meeting started, there were only about 300 people present, not to mention those who left halfway. From this, it can be seen that holding academic lectures in China is really a difficult task to please. (Some people say: It's still more interesting to listen to storytellers!)

Based on our experience: Isn't night school the same? Isn't cram school the same? Therefore, the work of eliminating illiteracy in the future should start from complete elementary schools, starting with school-age children!

### Traces of Cytotoxins

— Shou Zhe

Recently, in a certain scientific association in Moscow, Soviet scientist Peter Bezhensky reported his newly discovered cytotoxins and the amazing effects obtained in the experiment.

According to Peter Bezhensky's experimental results, the application of cytotoxins can make cows produce more milk, make chickens lay more eggs, and increase the productivity of other animals. Cytotoxins are a type of toxin that is naturally formed in the blood serum. There are many types of toxins, each specifically attacking an organ or a part of the fat tissue. For example, there are kidney cytotoxins, liver cytotoxins, etc. The function of each is now under study.

Peter Bezhensky applied a small amount of a certain cytotoxin and was able to increase the amount of milk produced by cows by 65%. When applied to chickens, it can make chickens that do not lay eggs lay eggs, and make the production of chickens that lay eggs suddenly increase. Horses that have been infertile have actually produced foals after applying maternal hormones. Piglets that have been born for ten weeks have an average weight that is 20% heavier than that of ordinary pigs after being given toxins for seven months.

Animals do not have any adverse reactions after applying a small amount of cytotoxins. Each time, only a certain part of the organ is stimulated and appears to be slightly enlarged.

Municipal Administration

### Waste Cannot Be Used

— Lin Bao

Not long ago, I met a municipal expert who had returned from studying abroad. He sighed and said that even Chinese garbage is not as good as foreign garbage. Everyone felt strange, thinking that this was another first-class figure who thought that the foreign moon was rounder than the Chinese picture. Later, after asking about the cause, I realized that this was a fact.

He said that a few years ago, the Shanghai Municipal Council spent a lot of money to build a large house at No. 2 Binlang Road, with various garbage incineration equipment inside, preparing to burn garbage like large cities abroad. This combines hygiene principles and can also obtain many useful by-products. This method is called garbage disposal. Foreign countries have been using it since 1890. The garbage is placed in a tightly closed pipe and heated with steam. At the same time, a machine is used to stir the garbage being heated to decompose the garbage into water vapor, oil, and solid nitrogen-containing substances. Oil can be used to make soap, and solids can be used to fertilize the fields. It can be said to be a multiple win.

The Municipal Council tried it in Shanghai for a very short period of time, but it failed unexpectedly. The reason for the failure is that China is too poor, so even Chinese garbage is not as good as foreign garbage. Because Shanghai's garbage has been picked through several times by poor children, and items such as rotten cloth and waste paper have been removed, the remaining items are often useless broken glass or broken iron lumps, which cannot be burned, let alone oil and Solids containing 　, these kinds of valuable by-products. In order to save coal, the Municipal Council had to close the house that was prepared to burn garbage. Therefore, Chinese waste cannot be used.

Now this large house with a tall chimney towering on the bank of the Suzhou River has been converted into the Shanghai Factory Union Hospital, which is also a waste of resources.

Invention

### Wireless Iron

— Chong Mei

The iron is dragged by an electric wire behind it, and it is always inconvenient to iron clothes. Wireless irons have now been invented, and the American Orika Vacuum Cleaner Company is supplying them. Daozhong iron also has a safety thermostat seat. The iron only needs to be placed on it to heat up, and the level of heat can be determined according to the nature of the ironing things, and can be adjusted at will.

### The Enemy (6)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

Hana asked: "Are you saying he will die during the operation?"

Sadão said: "Yes."

Hana thought with some suspicion. Before she could answer, Sadão had turned away. He said, "We have to think of a way anyway. The first thing is to wash him." He walked out quickly, and Hana followed him. She didn't want to be left alone with this white man. Since she left America, he was the first white man she had seen. He seemed completely different from the white people she had seen in America. Whether he was dead or alive here, he was always her enemy, making her feel threatened.

She turned to the nursery and called out, "Yumi!"

But the children heard her voice, so she had to go in for a while, smile at them, and play with the little baby boy who was nearly three months old.

Leaning over the baby's soft black hair, she pouted and said, "Yumi, come with me!"

Yumi replied: "I have to make sure the baby is settled first. He's going to sleep."

She and Yumi walked into the bedroom next to the nursery. She stood holding the baby, and Yumi spread the bedding on the floor, and then put the baby down to sleep well.

Hana quickly led her softly to the kitchen. The two servants in the kitchen had heard what the master had told them and were very frightened. The old gardener tugged at the few mustaches on his lips.

He said frankly to Hana, "The master shouldn't heal this white man's wounds. This man is destined to die. He was shot first. Later, the sea caught him, and the rocks in the sea injured him. If the master heals the injuries caused by the gun and the sea, they will come to take revenge on us."

Hana respectfully said: "I will tell him what you said." Although she was not as superstitious as the old man, she was also very afraid. Would helping the enemy be a good thing? But she finally told Yumi to bring hot water to the room where the white man was lying.

She walked ahead and opened the door between the two rooms. Sadão hadn't come yet. Yumi, who was following behind, put down her wooden bucket of water. She approached the white man. As soon as she saw the man, her thick lips closed stubbornly. She said, "I have never washed a white man. Now I don't want to wash such a white man."

Hana said sternly to her, "You have to listen to your master's orders!"

Yumi stubbornly said, "My master shouldn't order me to wash an enemy."

There was a very fierce resistance on Yumi's dull round face, which made Hana afraid for no reason. What if the servants reported some fabricated facts?

She said solemnly: "Very well. You should know that we just want to wake him up so that we can hand him over as a prisoner."

Yumi said, "I don't want to have anything to do with this. I am a poor person. This is not my business."

Hana said gently, "Then please go back to your own work."

Yumi left immediately. This left Hana alone with the white man. If Yumi's stubbornness hadn't aroused her anger, she might not have dared to stay there.

She muttered fiercely, "Stupid Yumi, isn't he a person, an injured and helpless person?"

Social Services: Urgent Need for Implementation in Recovered Areas; Reviving the Moral Movement

— Ji Ping

Loyal and Steadfast Should Be Commended

Eliminate the Dregs and Scoundrels Thoroughly

Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, our country's eight-year War of Resistance, with full mobilization and unity from top to bottom, finally achieved the final victory. Now, reflecting on the pain, the sacrifices have been enormous, but it was worth it! However, people generally only pay attention to material reports and neglect the spiritual and psychological losses. Material things are tangible, so they are easy to detect; spiritual things are intangible, so they are naturally not easy to detect. However, in terms of importance, material and spiritual things are equally important. What is the spiritual loss? That is "moral degradation." In an independent and free country, people live together in a healthy society. If people have no moral compass, what kind of society would that be? Even with material civilization, it will inevitably end in bankruptcy. The principle is clear and cannot be denied.

Let's not even talk about the free areas of the past eight years, but especially in the occupied areas, especially metropolises like Shanghai, everyone shouts: "People's hearts are bankrupt, it's not a society!" Apart from a few who were steadfast in their loyalty, unyielding in the face of power, and secondly those who were law-abiding and maintained integrity, the actions of the general public were truly extremely vile. For example: (1) currying favor with the powerful and oppressing the weak; (2) speculative merchants, valuing profit over righteousness; (3) defrauding and extorting wealth, with little shame; (4) making trouble unreasonably, creating disputes; the most hateful are those who colluded with the enemy and puppets, selling out the country for personal gain; judging their actions, their crimes are unforgivable! We propose that the first type of people above should be commended by the central government (according to the Political Department of the Third War Area, this is currently under investigation), and the worst types should be investigated and punished thoroughly in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. If we indulge and forgive national scum, society will never be peaceful, and the country will find it difficult to get on the right track of the rule of law.

This column takes the lead in launching the "Reviving the Moral Movement," sweeping away the haze of the past where black and white were indistinguishable, and right and wrong were confused, welcoming the righteous spirit of heaven and earth, and returning to the path of light, and hoping that the government will formulate a "National Covenant" based on the New Life Movement so that the public has something to follow, only then can we talk about reviving morality. We hope that all readers will rise up and promote this movement. Society will be fortunate (Readers are welcome to send letters expressing their opinions, which will be published if appropriate).

### On Behalf of Sending Out Free Medical Consultation and Medicine Vouchers
