### The National Government Announced Emergency Measures on Commodity Prices Yesterday; Speeches by President Chen and Ambassador Gu

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to implement wartime economic policies, strengthen control of commodity prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government authorities have decided to take decisive measures and have formulated emergency measures on commodity prices. Price evaluation committees in various regions are charged with strengthening their organizations and strictly evaluating prices. Local competent authorities should implement registration for major commodities according to the law and strictly crack down on hoarding. Those who arbitrarily raise prices without approval will be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, major commodities not registered by members of various trade associations, and large quantities of materials purchased and stored by ordinary citizens exceeding the amount for personal use, will be strictly cracked down upon. These emergency measures are in fact aimed at addressing the causes of rising commodity prices in various regions and are a direct response to those hoarding and manipulating prices. It is expected that commodity prices will tend to stabilize in the future, and people's livelihoods will be secured. President of the Executive Yuan Chen issued an important statement yesterday, reiterating the government's determination to control commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, and expressing his deep hope that businesspeople and citizens nationwide would earnestly comply. Ambassador Gu, representing an Allied nation stationed in China, also issued a statement, expressing his full support for the National Government's measures. The full text of the measures and the original speeches of President Chen and Ambassador Gu are recorded below:

Emergency Measures on Commodity Prices

(1) In order to implement wartime economic policies, strengthen control of commodity prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has specially formulated these measures.

(2) Major commodity trade associations should truthfully report the local wholesale and retail prices of their commodities as of February 5, 1945, to the competent price evaluation committee. Thereafter, prices may not be arbitrarily increased without approval, otherwise they will be severely punished according to the law. The price evaluation committee may investigate and verify the reported prices and re-approve them.

(3) Price evaluation committees in various regions should strengthen their organizations and strictly evaluate prices.

(8) Financial inspection organizations should be strengthened, and financial operations should be thoroughly inspected.

(9) When implementing these measures, local competent authorities should strictly prevent the evasion of major commodities.

(10) These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

Speech by President Chen

Enhancing combat power, the most important thing is to stabilize people's livelihoods. The fundamental policy is to increase production and establish security, while the immediate solution is to control commodity prices and regulate materials. In order to achieve practical results quickly, both fundamental and immediate solutions should be adopted, and both the underlying principles and practical applications should be implemented simultaneously. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the government has been continuously striving to increase production and establish security, and controlling commodity prices and regulating materials has been one of the key tasks. Over the past three years, the arrangements and facilities have all been based on this principle, always studying and balancing them, so that market transactions gradually become rational, people's livelihoods can be stabilized, and the country can be restored. However, recently commodity prices have remained high, affecting people's livelihoods greatly. The reason for this, although due to the imperfect supply and demand of materials, is mainly due to the greed of a few unscrupulous elements, which is the main reason for the soaring commodity prices. In order to implement wartime economic policies and stabilize people's livelihoods, emergency measures on commodity prices have been promulgated today, designating the price on February 5 as the standard market price, and implementing them first in Beijing and Shanghai. Thereafter, the prices of major commodities may not be increased without authorization, but if there is a real need for adjustment, the government will take into account the actual situation and re-approve them reasonably. Those who hoard and speculate, intending to manipulate prices, or who use financial means to fuel hoarding, will be severely punished. As for the source of materials, we will also try to dredge them to meet the current needs. I hope that businesspeople and citizens will earnestly comply, and the future of people's livelihoods will depend on it.

Speech by Ambassador Gu

The National Government of the Republic of China has previously formulated three major policies of establishing security, rectifying ideology, and increasing production, and is striving to realize them. The increase in production is not only necessary to enhance combat power in the Greater East Asia War, but also the most important prerequisite for stabilizing people's livelihoods. Since its implementation, it has overcome all difficulties and vigorously promoted various policies, which is deeply gratifying. The Japanese government also firmly believes that the stability of Chinese people's livelihoods is a prerequisite for China's restoration and an indispensable condition for the revitalization of Asia. We are willing to provide maximum cooperation and assistance to the National Government in these policies. Our determination is also stated in the wartime economic establishment countermeasures announced before the war, which further clarifies that since the government announced its new policy toward China, it has always maintained an unwavering determination to cooperate in the advancement of various Chinese policies.

However, although the National Government has the above-mentioned policies, there are still some people who fail to understand the government's intentions, and are dedicated to pursuing private interests and desires, rampant with corruption, hindering increased production, and threatening the lives of the majority of the people. Such dregs have not yet disappeared. In his inaugural address, Chairman Chen of the National Government expressed his determination to realize the clean government of the late Chairman, and strongly stated that those who poison the people and endanger the country, no matter who they are, will be regarded as national traitors, and the National Government is determined to jointly expel the harmful thieves with the people. Recently, Mayor Zhou of Shanghai also clarified that he would not show any leniency to corrupt officials and opportunistic merchants, and would severely punish them. Now, the National Government, in order to promote the combat power of China's economy and stabilize people's livelihoods, has decided on emergency measures on commodity prices as part of its economic policy, resolutely suppressing the improper rise in commodity prices and suppressing hoarding and speculation before the upcoming Lunar New Year. It is believed that the people of China will be extremely welcome.

The Japanese government not only expresses its heartfelt support for the above policies, but also decides to adapt to the requirements of the Chinese side, and all military and civilian personnel in China will provide cooperation and assistance to the Chinese side. During the promotion of this policy, there will be no discrimination or unfair treatment between the Chinese and Japanese people. Japanese residents who engage in improper business operations will also be strictly investigated and punished according to the law. It is hoped that the Japanese residents in China will understand the National Government's policies and cooperate with the Japanese government to promote this policy.

### Japanese Artillery in Burma Destroys Multiple Enemy Ships

Burma Front Base, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A portion of the British-Indian 36th Division, which was moving rashly opposite Myitkyina, in order to coordinate with the 50th Division launching an offensive in the Menglong area of northern Burma, attempted to cross the Irrawaddy River at the bend of the Kawlin River at 3:00 PM on the 1st, using 20 boats to attack the Japanese army's south bank positions under the support of superior artillery firepower. However, after being intercepted by the Japanese garrison there, all of their boats were destroyed. The enemy personnel in the boats, after being attacked by the Japanese, fled in a scramble. The boats in the Shweli River also retreated together. Also, at 2:00 AM on the 2nd, they attacked the Japanese position again, but after being intercepted by the Japanese army at the waterside, 80 enemy soldiers who had landed were annihilated, and 6 of their boats were destroyed. In addition, great damage was inflicted on other enemy troops, and they were repelled.

### European War News

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Havas reports that a military spokesman said: The Soviet army, which had advanced to Steinau northwest of Breslau, between Liegnitz, was unable to move freely, and the fighting near Liegnitz would reach its most intense stage.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: The characteristic of the development of the Western Front is that the anti-Axis forces continue to make systematic preparations for a large-scale offensive. General Rundstedt, commander-in-chief of the German army on the Western Front, expects very fierce fighting to occur soon. The German military authorities are aware that the enemy has concentrated a strong tank force on the entire Aachen line in the past few weeks, so the fifth battle for Aachen will be launched, sacrificing an unprecedented amount of material. All German troops know that the time for the decisive battle has arrived, and the enemy will encounter even more fierce resistance and suffer greater losses than before.

### German Army Strengthens Operations in Italy

Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: London Radio reported on Saturday that the anti-Axis headquarters in Italy said that the German resistance on the US Fifth Army front was becoming stronger and stronger. Anti-Axis reconnaissance units have been constantly active in an attempt to probe German strength, breaking into German lines at many points. However, the German forces at all points were prepared and determined to put up a more resolute resistance.

### 15 Enemy Aircraft Attacking Kanto Shot Down; Damage Inflicted on Other Enemy Aircraft

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 11th: When about 90 enemy aircraft attacked the Kanto area on the 10th, the Japanese air force shot down 15 of them. In addition, damage was inflicted on a considerable number of other enemy aircraft. In this battle, the Japanese side lost 7 aircraft that self-destructed and did not return.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 10th, about 90 enemy B-29s attacked the northern Kanto area of Japan. The Japanese air defense forces immediately and bravely intercepted them in the fierce and cold high altitude, surrounded the enemy aircraft, and shot down 15 of them, inflicting heavy damage on a considerable number of enemy aircraft. The actual number of enemy aircraft heavily damaged, if calculated by interception area, or the number of enemy aircraft shot down or heavily damaged by another Japanese aircraft after one Japanese aircraft damaged them, may inevitably have duplicates. Therefore, the exact number is difficult to determine. Therefore, the Japanese General Headquarters will not specify the number of enemy aircraft damaged in the future, but will generally announce it according to the following standards: If only less than 30% of the attacking aircraft are heavily damaged, it is considered to have damaged a small number of aircraft; 30% to 60% is considered a considerable number; and more than 60% is considered a large number. Therefore, in this attack, of the approximately 90 enemy aircraft that attacked, 15 were shot down, and approximately 30 to 50 were heavily damaged. Furthermore, if half of the heavily damaged aircraft cannot fly back to base, the total number of aircraft shot down means that the enemy lost 30 to 40 aircraft in this air raid, and the number of personnel killed reached 400 to 500. The Japanese side also sacrificed 7 valuable aircraft. However, even though the enemy suffered such heavy losses, their intention to repeatedly attack should not be underestimated.

Editorial

### The Three-Headed Conference and the European Situation

The recent evolution of the European war situation has greatly impacted the complex relationship between the Allied countries of Britain and the United States. To cope with the special situation under the new war situation and review the various problems to be solved, the Allied leaders, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, held another conference in early February in an area of the Black Sea. This was their second joint meeting since the Tehran Conference at the end of November 1943.

Their talks have now been going on for several days, and the content is unknown. However, based on the current reality, the information revealed by all parties, and based on speculation of their subjective intentions, the center of the talks will roughly be: (1) how to deal with the current war situation, (2) how to deal with Germany, (3) how to divide spheres of influence, and (4) how to establish international relations after the end of the war.

This conference was based on their subjective ideas—that Europe is about to end. Due to the complexity of the relationships between them and the deep-seated fundamental contradictions, it is inevitable that they will blush and have many disputes in the talks, so it is unlikely to have good results.

Regarding the first issue of how to deal with the current war situation, there seem to be several contradictions here: First, the accelerated progress of the Soviet army has aroused the jealousy of Britain and the United States. This was the case when the Soviet army approached Warsaw last time, and it is even more so today when the Soviet army approaches Berlin. This jealousy may affect their organic coordinated operations on the east and west sides. Second, the three countries want to end the war as soon as possible, but on the other hand, once the war ends, the political contradictions between them will immediately unfold deeply, and may be more difficult to deal with than combat, so they hesitate again. As the Spanish newspaper ABC reporter said: "The Allies now fear peace as they feared war before, because the political problems that have been delayed for many times are now becoming urgent." Third, whether the war ends early or not cannot be determined by their ideals. Even if the Soviet army captures Berlin and the war shifts westward, Germany can still continue to fight with western Germany as the center, north from Norway and Denmark to Italy in the south, so it is too early to think that the European war can be ended after capturing Berlin.

Regarding the second issue of how to deal with Germany, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have repeatedly declared that Germany must surrender unconditionally. However, due to the strong military power of Germany and the firm will of the German people, it is really too difficult for Germany to surrender unconditionally. The more the war goes on, the more difficult it becomes, and the greater the sacrifices. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are now strong on the outside but weak on the inside. In order to maintain some vitality as much as possible, they are reluctant to make excessive consumption again, so they want to use political means in addition to military means to make Germany submit and disintegrate Germany from the political aspect. The joint declaration that the three countries will issue to the German people, announced by London and Cairo, declaring the so-called conditions and forms of "unconditional surrender", has a very subtle effect. It is said that the three countries have hinted that their purpose is to overthrow Hitler's National Socialist Germany, but not to destroy the German people. This is a trick used by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to induce the German people to surrender. However, the restrictions imposed on Germany by the Allied powers after the last war have been enough for the German people. This time, the German people will not be fooled again.

The third issue is how to divide spheres of influence, which is simply the most complex issue. This issue mainly targets the small countries in Europe and distributes spheres of influence. First, each small country must maintain its independence on the surface, and second, the distribution of power must be balanced, which is really not easy to handle. At present, the military power of the Soviet Union extends from Finland in the north, along the Baltic Sea through the three small countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and then through Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary, to most or all of Romania and Bulgaria in the Balkans, plus Germany, which is under attack, and Austria, which has recently become the target of attack, covering more than ten countries of all sizes, and political influence extends to Greece, Turkey, and even France. The military power of Britain and the United States now only extends to France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the border of Germany in Western Europe, and Italy and Greece in the Mediterranean. Britain and the United States are very afraid of the strong military and political power of the Soviet Union in Europe, so recently not only has there been fierce infighting, but also open strife has often been revealed. Some countries have two governments after the Germans withdrew, and the contention between the London government-in-exile, relying on Britain and the United States, and the local temporary government supported by the Soviet Union, reflects the struggle between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The situation in Poland is even more obvious. For example, the internal strife in Greece, with the left-wing ELAS resisting Britain, is actually a conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union. Obviously, the struggle for power and profit between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will become more and more intense as the war evolves. Moreover, there are many contradictions not only between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, but also between Britain and the United States, and even between Britain, the United States, and France.

The fourth issue is how to establish international relations after the end of the war, which is closely related to the third issue. Since the contradictions between the countries, especially Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, are so deep, it may be difficult to establish a new international organization that can truly coordinate after the war. At the same time, cooperation between countries in the economic field may not be completely successful. Furthermore, the so-called liberation of the coerced small countries is bound to be a deceptive trick of empty promises and no substance.

In summary, it can be predicted that this three-headed conference will not have much results. Even if there are any results, it is doubtful whether everyone will be able to fulfill them in the future. However, their new conspiracy cannot but be taken note of. The evolution of the European situation will affect the Far East at any time, and we must pay attention to its development.

### Yesterday's Economic Bureau Convened Representatives of Various Industries for Talks: Emergency Measures Have Been Taken to Suppress and Stabilize Prices

Recently, the general price level in this city has continued to rise, which has a serious impact on people's livelihoods. The economic authorities have repeatedly issued notices to merchants and the public, requiring them to strictly comply with the assessed and limited prices. However, some merchants, taking advantage of the Lunar New Year holiday, have arbitrarily raised prices without limit. The Municipal Economic Bureau has long been determined to suppress and stabilize prices. In order to take emergency measures, it convened representatives from various industry associations in the city at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 11:00 AM yesterday for a temporary emergency meeting. Representatives from over one hundred units attended, including those from the following industries: dried goods, tea snacks, local produce, general merchandise, Chinese and foreign department stores, hot water, ham, fresh meat, restaurants, staple grains and pastries, hardware, rickshaws, sliced noodles, [illegible character] production, cloth factories, raw silk, Western medicine, leather manufacturing, local tobacco, rubber, fruits, department stores, pickled vegetables and bean sprouts, woolens, woolen textiles, industrial oils and fats, tires, firewood. The Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, Mr. Xu Jiang, arrived on time to attend the meeting in person and gave a speech, explaining the severity of the high prices in the city and announcing the decision to take emergency measures, hoping that various industry associations in the city would assist the government in jointly suppressing and stabilizing prices. Finally, the Chief of the Third Section of the Bureau, Tang Shaochuan, explained the main points of the emergency measures. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.

Director Xu's Speech

From the beginning of my tenure as Director, I have considered suppressing and stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods to be the top priorities, and I strive to achieve them without empty talk. During this time of war, imbalances in the supply and demand of goods are unavoidable, and price fluctuations are therefore an inevitable trend. However, arbitrary and excessive price increases are unreasonable. I have sought detailed strategies to balance prices, and rapid implementation is especially important. I am determined to address both the root causes and the symptoms, and to strengthen both war effort and people's livelihoods. In recent days, I have been reorganizing the Price Assessment Committee and issuing notices to various industry associations, setting a deadline for submitting the cost of goods to serve as a standard for assessing prices. Within the scope of suppressing and stabilizing prices, we will still take into account the profits of merchants and the public to show fairness. However, it is regrettable that some have not yet complied. The day before yesterday, I was summoned to Beijing by the Minister of Industry and Commerce. Minister Chen has emergency measures in place to address prices, and these measures have been coordinated with the Allied nations and municipal government authorities. I will now state the main points of these measures to you: (1) The industry associations of all major commodities should truthfully report the local wholesale and retail prices of their commodities as of February 5, 1945, to the Price Assessment Committee. (2) Hereafter, prices that have not been approved must not be arbitrarily raised; violators will be severely punished according to law. (3) The Price Assessment Committee may investigate and re-approve the reported prices. (4) The industry associations of all major commodities should promptly and accurately report the quantity of their commodities in stock as of February 5 of this year to this Bureau, and thereafter submit monthly reports. (5) Severe crackdown on hoarding. (6) Implement registration of major commodities according to law. (7) Eliminate unscrupulous brokers. I hope you will pay attention to the above points and strictly comply with them. I will act according to my words and am willing to work with all industry associations to overcome difficulties and move forward together.

### Water and Electricity Company Hopes Users Conserve Electricity: Do Not Exceed Limits to Avoid Penalties

Previously, the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company in this city, in order to conserve electricity, stipulated that the time for electricity users to use lights would be uniformly from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM. It is now learned that the company, in view of the power supply and transmission lines for important facilities in certain areas, must continue to supply power even after 10:00 PM. It is hoped that those who intentionally use electricity without authorization outside of the restricted hours, violating the purpose of conserving electricity, will quickly comply and not exceed the limits to avoid penalties.

### Police Bureau Chiefs Rectify Police Affairs

The Municipal Police Bureau has carefully adjusted the selection of branch chiefs and their powers in order to reform police administration. All section chiefs must be under the command of the branch chiefs and handle all affairs. Therefore, after the branch chiefs took office, they strictly rectified police affairs. Yao Benyuan, the chief of the Changning Road Branch, found that the surveillance posts in his jurisdiction had a very close relationship with the public. Therefore, after taking office, he earnestly instructed the police officers that they must not extort or harass merchants along the way. Yesterday, he personally inspected the surveillance posts at Zhongshan Bridge, Changan Road, West Railway Station, and Hongqiao Road. The situation was generally satisfactory, but the bad practice of black market tickets at the West Railway Station has not yet been stopped, and it is being thoroughly investigated.

### Mayor Zhou Recovers from Illness: Will Attend Meetings

Mayor Zhou's condition has been improving daily and he is expected to fully recover in about one or two days. He is scheduled to personally attend the Police Bureau's administrative meeting on the 14th.

### Announcement of the Postponed Drama Script Competition

Due to the enthusiastic response and the considerable time required for reviewing and judging, the announcement date has been slightly postponed. We hope that all contributors will understand.

### Rickshaw Fare Increase

Since the adjustment of rickshaw fares in this city on the 16th of last month, it has not yet been a month, and due to the high cost of living, a request has been submitted to the Municipal Government authorities for another fare increase starting yesterday (11th). The new fares are: 450 yuan for a double-seat rickshaw for a minimum of 30 minutes, with an additional 75 yuan for every 5 minutes thereafter, or 900 yuan per hour. The other single-seat rickshaws cost 300 yuan per half hour, with an additional 50 yuan for every 5 minutes, or 600 yuan per hour.

### Special Ration Application Procedures

Since the Shanghai Special Municipality Goods Rationing Office implemented special rations for civil servants of various agencies, the second phase of special rice rations has been implemented. Recently, the authorities of various agencies have been enthusiastically applying to the Bureau for special rations. However, some agencies have not yet understood the application procedures and have therefore been unable to receive them. According to the authorities of the Bureau, for special rations for agencies under the Municipal Government, it is necessary to first apply to the Secretariat of the Municipal Government for approval. For special rations for central agencies stationed in Shanghai, an official letter of certification from the central competent department or a direct designation of application for approval from the central competent departments is required before special rations can be approved.

### Person in Charge of the Municipal Consultation Committee Talks About the Collection Process for Low-Priced Rice

According to the person in charge of the Municipal Consultation Committee, the Municipal Government purchased low-priced rice for distribution to various new middle class people. The committee was consulted about the purchase process beforehand. Because the payment was due within a limited time and required cash, they negotiated to pay half in cash and half in immediate remittance orders due to the short time. This was not approved. Therefore, the Fuxing Bank, which collected the rice payments, had to comply. During this short time, the bank's collection was extremely busy, especially because it was near the Lunar New Year. The service personnel were unexpectedly busy and are very thankful. However, the outside world felt that the cash was insufficient and expressed dissatisfaction with the bank. But in fact, the bank was only complying with orders. Therefore, the process is described in the hope that all parties will understand the truth.
