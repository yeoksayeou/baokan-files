### Southern Okinawa Kiyan Cape: Japanese Army Completes New Deployment, Air Force Continues Fierce Attacks on Enemy Ships

Central News Agency, Tung Tung, 6th: Intense fighting continues in the southern part of Okinawa Island. On both the eastern and western coasts, the battle lines have not changed significantly due to fierce Japanese counterattacks. However, in the central region, enemy forces are gradually advancing, crossing the Kokuba River, which flows east-west three or four kilometers south of Shuri, and approaching the Japanese army's southern defensive positions. The Japanese forces are fighting valiantly to intercept and halt the enemy's advance. Furthermore, Japanese special attack units continue to brave adverse weather conditions, launching fierce attacks on enemy fleets near the island from the 1st to the 3rd, and are currently expanding their successes.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Japanese garrison forces in southern Okinawa Island are utilizing skillful tactics and an indomitable fighting spirit, continuing to fight bravely. It appears that since the night of the 29th of last month, the Japanese army has gradually begun to withdraw towards the Kiyan Cape area, completing the deployment of new defensive positions, and preparing to launch a counterattack against the enemy. Currently, the enemy continues to advance southward. Around 6:00 PM on the 1st, the enemy's front line advanced from the road south of Sashiki Village to the Shinazato, Osato, Nakama, and Miyahira road, reaching the Shinpo Bridge line. Since the 1st, under the intense cover of naval artillery fire, they have attempted to advance further towards the Japanese army's new positions on the Kiyan Cape. By the 3rd, a portion of the enemy forces had made some local advances. Currently, the contact line between the Japanese and American forces extends from the Inamine area in the north to the Tomoyose and Nagamine Nezasu areas. The enemy's progress has gradually slowed, and there have been no major changes since.

Central News Agency, Nansei Base, 6th: The weather around Okinawa has not yet recovered as of the 5th. During this period, enemy transport convoys have made some movements. The Japanese army's ground forces, having completed their new deployment, are engaging in fierce battles against the overwhelming enemy forces. On the morning of the 5th, the enemy appears to have landed 400 to 500 new infantry reinforcements on the western coast of Oroku.

Central News Agency, Ryukyu Islands Base, 6th: On the night of the 4th, air force units attacked enemy fleets in the Sakishima Islands sea area, daringly attacking one enemy transport ship and one vessel of unknown type with torpedoes. Another unit sank one enemy transport ship around the main island. Subsequently, Japanese air force units repeatedly launched fierce air raids on enemy ships around the main island on the night of the 5th, inflicting significant damage on the enemy.

### The Army Ministry Announced Yesterday: Kogatani Unit Awarded Citation for Great Contribution to Current Operations

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Army Ministry announced on the 6th that the Kogatani Unit and its affiliated units (including a portion of the naval artillery unit) have established great feats in the battles on Okinawa Island. The commanders of each unit awarded citations. Furthermore, it was reported to the Emperor and citations were bestowed. The Kogatani Unit and its affiliated units, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Kogani Kokichi, intercepted enemy forces landing and advancing southward on the west coast of Nakagusuku Bay on April 1, Showa 20 (1945). Since engaging in offensive and defensive battles around the Isahuku District, they have fought in various locations such as Yaibaru, Osato, and Bukkami Haru. Their tactical skills in both offense and defense were appropriate, and they have inflicted great damage on the enemy, blunting their advance. They also defended the front line of the main defensive position together with friendly units around Nishihara, and with close cooperation from the artillery unit, they fought day and night against superior enemy forces, killing over 4,000 enemy soldiers and destroying 1,000 enemy tanks. As a result, the enemy's attack was ultimately repelled. Afterwards, while defending the vicinity of Maeda, when a major offensive and defensive battle unfolded there on April 24th, although the casualties among officers and soldiers were significant and the battlefield was rough and rugged, they were still able to strategize and fight bravely for more than ten days, injuring more than 25,000 enemy soldiers. The main defensive position was completely secured, and their contribution to subsequent operations was significant. The achievements are commendable, due to the unit commander's effective leadership, the well-trained soldiers, and their unified solidarity. Therefore, a citation is awarded.

### US Navy Department Announces: Two Destroyers Sunk, Operations in Okinawa Failed

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 6th: The US Navy authorities have been routinely downplaying the losses of warships in the Okinawa waters. According to a dispatch from Washington, the US Navy Department announced on the 5th that the US destroyers "Morrison" and "Massen" were recently sunk in the Okinawa sea area. Both ships have a displacement of 2,100 tons. Based on the US Navy Department's statement that the crews suffered significant damage during their sinking, it can be inferred that the crew members have likely all perished.

Central News Agency Report: According to a New York broadcast, American commentator David Troman has recently written an article in the conservative New York Sun, pointing out that the US military's Okinawa operation was a major failure. The article stated: "The Okinawa operation can truly be called a major failure, proving the incompetence of the US military, even more so than the Pearl Harbor air raid. The truth about the island operation can be proven by the number of US troops involved. Judging by this figure, it further proves that this war is the greatest failure in our Pacific operations. I propose that a commission composed of impartial officers and congressmen be organized to investigate the truth of the matter." Furthermore, American military commentator Hansen Baldwin, in an article published in the New York Times on the 4th of this month, pointed out that "The Okinawa war was a bitter battle. The northern war has revealed to the Allied forces what kind of situation they will encounter when invading the Japanese mainland. The cost of attacking Okinawa, the gateway to the invasion of the Japanese mainland, was enormous. In the amphibious operations, the navy suffered more casualties than the army and marines, and this is unprecedented."

### Japanese Troops Fight Fiercely in Tarakan, Still Holding Main Positions, Suicide Squads Launch Surprise Attack on Enemy Airfield

Central News Agency, Southern Front Base, 6th: The Japanese garrison forces on Tarakan Island have repelled enemy forces day and night, inflicting significant damage on the enemy, and are still holding their positions. The suicide squad led by Lieutenant Nodachi, from the 26th of last month until the eve of the 1st of this month, infiltrated the enemy airfield. Under the enemy's night-time illumination and searchlights, all members separately advanced to their destinations, destroying five enemy barracks and two material stockpiles, killing ninety-five enemy soldiers. During this attack, Seaman Kamimura and two others from the Japanese side bravely charged into the enemy barracks with explosives and died a glorious death. At the time, the entire squad, including the commander, completed their mission on empty stomachs with grass roots and tree bark, for lack of sufficient food. Their fighting spirit is truly admirable. In this surprise attack, all but three of the Japanese, who died bravely, returned safely to their original defenses.

Central News Agency, Southwest Pacific Base, 6th: In the battle situation on Tarakan Island, both sides are currently confronting each other at extremely close range. The enemy has not launched a large-scale attack. Japanese aircraft have launched fierce attacks daily, greatly boosting morale. The Japanese army garrison on the island continues to carry out strong suicide attacks, destroying enemy positions and enemy encampments, achieving significant battle results. A group of assault troops led by Technical Lieutenant Noda braved the enemy's severe vigilance and launched a fierce suicide raid on enemy positions near the airfield on the 1st of this month, destroying three enemy barracks and one material warehouse before returning safely. Another suicide squad also destroyed a large enemy barracks on the 1st, killing over 45 enemy soldiers. Japanese soldiers bravely sacrificed themselves, and the active performance of suicide assault squads is demonstrating their power everywhere.

Central News Agency, Ryukyu Base, 6th: On Tarakan Island, the enemy's advance speed is being severely hampered by the fierce fighting of the Japanese garrison. After burning the Japanese front-line positions with their intense artillery fire, they gradually attempted to penetrate deeper into the positions, echoing the bombings of the past few days. On the morning of the 5th, they launched an attack. The Japanese forces sent powerful suicide attack squads deep into enemy lines to disrupt them, and at the same time engaged in luring and fierce fighting in front of the ruined positions, finally repelling them and still holding the main positions. The battle results included killing or wounding 291 enemy personnel, destroying three field guns, one heavy weapon, three cargo trucks, nine barracks, three material warehouses, one light machine gun, and a large quantity of automatic rifle ammunition.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in Various Locations in Luzon

Central News Agency, Philippine Front, 5th: In the Baguio area of Luzon Island, 500 enemy infantrymen carrying more than ten mountain guns advanced 12 kilometers north of Baguio on the 3rd, and are currently facing off against Japanese forces in the area. The enemy's actions are not aggressive, but fierce fighting continues between Japanese and American forces near Kitaseiteff on the east coast of Barret. In addition, the Japanese garrison forces in Bakba on the main highway of San Saiyan are attacking the American and Filipino forces in the area and are still fighting bravely.

### Guangdong Provincial Police Department Establishes Pistol Squad

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th: In order to strengthen public security in the urban area and prevent bandits from infiltrating the city, the Provincial Police Department has specially established two pistol squads, stationed at the boundaries of the urban and suburban areas. The members of the pistol squad are selected from special agents and police officers, all equipped with new-style special weapons, possessing substantial strength. After the team was established on the 1st, they were immediately dispatched to serve.

Editorial

### A New Observation of the Chongqing-Communist Relationship

Recently, Japanese newspapers have frequently carried news about the worsening relations between Chongqing and the Communists, especially the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) criticisms of Chongqing in various aspects. The CCP's offensive against Chongqing started with the CCP's Seventh National Congress in late April, proposing the so-called advocacy of building a coalition government. In this congress, the CCP representatives were filled with arrogance. In contrast, the Chongqing Kuomintang's Sixth National Congress (only one week away from the CCP's Seventh National Congress) did not have any clear expressions on the CCP issue. Of course, this does not mean that the Chongqing Kuomintang's attitude towards the CCP has changed, nor does it mean that the Chongqing Kuomintang is confident in suppressing the CCP, so they remain silent. We feel that Chongqing's silence towards the CCP implies a serious crisis that could erupt at any moment.

The CCP's offensive against Chongqing today is manifested in military, political, diplomatic, economic, and cultural aspects. Particularly noteworthy is the military aspect. According to news published in the Japanese-language Continental New Daily News in Japan, since the Japanese army's operation in Henan last May inflicted a major blow on Chongqing's First War Zone, part of the CCP army under the command of He Long has gradually used the gap between the Japanese army and the Chongqing army to move south. By late January of this year, they declared the so-called completion of the connection between North and Central China.

In the political aspect, they are working hard to carry out propaganda and organization work among intellectuals, youths, and students, focusing on the so-called coalition government movement. For example, the declaration on the current situation issued by the Kunming Women's Congress on May 19, calling for the speedy convocation of a genuine National Assembly and the establishment of a coalition government of national unity, are merely re-editions of the CCP's advocacy. In addition, Southwest Associated University on May 14 and Zhejiang University, among others, had similar declaration activities.

In the CCP's new offensive against Chongqing, two points are particularly noteworthy, which are different from the past attitude:

First, openly declaring opposition to Chongqing and Chiang: In the past, all propaganda in Yan'an still took the overall situation into consideration to some extent, and nominally respected Chongqing and Chiang, but now it has begun to directly slander the Chongqing Kuomintang and the government.

Second, openly criticizing Britain and the United States, and opposing the great powers' operations on the Chinese mainland! Not long ago, the CCP issued the slogan of "cooperating with the Allied forces in landing operations," but this time Mao Zedong declared at the Seventh National Congress: "The Chongqing Kuomintang government is borrowing the power of the United States, and after repelling Japan, will kill our compatriots like Britain in Greece." Liu Shaoqi, the political commissar of the New Fourth Army, also said: "The United States is currently supporting the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation to strengthen the war against Japan. We must be very cautious and observe the intentions of the United States. We will never be used by the United States." This fully reveals the CCP's abandonment of its pro-American attitude and indicates that the United States has a tendency to invade China and undermine Chinese national unity.

This attitude of the CCP is clearly a reflection of the recent contradictions and conflicts between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in China. The news that Soviet envoys and experts have rushed to Yan'an further proves the complexity and seriousness of the Chongqing-Communist problem today. In this time of crisis, on the one hand, we must make a final warning to Chongqing, abandon meaningless procrastination, and complete comprehensive peace. On the other hand, we especially hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities can think far ahead and quickly resolve all difficult problems in the peaceful areas today with the utmost sincerity to maintain the people's vitality.

### Along the Huangpu River

— Zhicheng

Urgently Awaiting Agricultural Loans – Dujia Village

Dujia Village was originally an insignificant small town, about one mile away from the Huangpu River. After the Incident, commerce declined, but it became a major rice market because it was the only way for rice from Fengxian and surrounding area to transport to the north. From morning till dusk every day, it is very bustling and lively. The merchants come here to buy rice and transport it to Shaolou, Zhoupu and other places. Some also cross the river to Shanghai. The greatest pain of the villagers is the numerous barriers and excessive taxes. The large number of troops is countless, and most of the hard-earned income of farmers is consumed here. As for the agricultural loans, it was once handled, but after being transferred by the township head, the money directly received by the farmers was very little. Recently, during the busy farming season, the general tenants are in great need of money. They dare not learn from the high interest loans. The rural loans are eagerly awaited. It is hoped that the authorities will actively promote agricultural loans to achieve the goal of increasing production.

Market is Average – Shaolou Town

Shaolou Town is located in the middle of Dujia Village and Zhoupu, and the transportation is inconvenient. There are only rowing boats going back and forth once a day. Because there are not many institutions, the people's burden is relatively light, but wealthy families still dare not stay in the town, so it can be called a calm corner of the Jiangpan. The market is average, and there are the most grocery stores. There are many empty houses in the suburbs, most of which are inhabited by wealthy households. Prices are cheaper, and daily necessities are slightly more expensive.

Full of Worries – Zhoupu

The biggest worry is donations. At present, Zhoupu has convenient water and land transportation. The town belongs to the area of the security team and the Central Police Corps. In the suburbs, there are activities of the New Fourth Army, the Loyalty and Salvation Army and other troops, so people are heavily burdened. Some have to pay to five parties. Various donations and local office expenses are all borne by the merchants. In the previous session, the proportions were first distributed by the various guilds, and then the guilds collected the corresponding amount from each member shop, according to the history and scope of each shop. For example, this spring, the New Fourth Army requested a donation of 1,500 stones of rice, which is 150 million yuan based on 100,000 yuan per burden. A certain soy sauce garden was established before the war, and its scope is relatively large with abundant capital. This time, it needs to donate more than 100,000 yuan. So far this year, the total amount of donations made has been 3-4 million yuan. Even one store is like this, so the amount donated by the entire town can be seen. The donations are transferred from the township head to the hands of various troops. Those who extract them dare to deduct them, so every new township head looks like a wealthy man after taking office for two or three months. If the donation cannot be paid, the only way is to stop business.

The second is the rental fee for the Bureau of Housing. The cost is so high that it is widely heard. The upper and lower shops of the police station cost 1.5 bushels of rice per month, and the larger ones cost 1.7 bushels of rice. According to the current rice price, the single room rent costs hundreds of thousands of yuan. Recently, the trend of discounting in the silver and money industry is very popular. The interest rate for those with good credit is 12-13 cents per yuan every ten days, otherwise it is 15-20 cents, which is 45-60 cents per month. Such high interest is shocking to hear, and the borrowed money has no collateral, and the interest is deducted first. Suppose someone borrows 1 million yuan from Bank B at an interest rate of 10 cents, Bank B first deducts 150,000 yuan of interest, so he only gets 850,000 yuan to hoard or speculate in other places. After two months, including principal and interest, a total of 2 million yuan must be repaid. If the speculation fails and the money is not repaid on time, or they refuse to meet, or run away. Recently, there have been five or six bankruptcies due to such situations, and the numbers are huge. It is said that there are still five or six bankruptcies before the Dragon Boat Festival. This can be a big lesson for the general "loan sharks."

Among the charitable organizations in Pudong, the Zhuanhua Charity Association in Zhoupu is the largest. It was established in the 28th year of Guangxu. The association's affairs were originally handled by the board of directors. However, after the Incident, most of the directors took refuge at sea, so the actual persons in charge were the director-general and deputy director-general under the board of directors. Under them are divided into three departments: academic affairs, temple affairs, and relief, each with a director. The charitable deeds undertaken include charity schools, medicine distribution, medical consultation, relief, coffin loans, rice distribution, ping-ji, clothing distribution, and spring blindness, nine kinds. The first five are held throughout the year, and clothing and rice distribution are held in winter. The charity school is located in the association, and there are two teachers and 154 students, which is a complete elementary school. The subjects taught are slightly different from ordinary elementary schools. Generally, they are designed to cultivate poor children who cannot go to school and need to learn a profession after leaving school, so the homework is practical. The relief is fixed at 250 people, but must meet the prescribed conditions, and after passing the examination, they can receive 6 kg of boxed rice per month, which is doubled at the end of the year. For the coffin loan, the cost is huge due to the soaring cost of timber. A part of the cost of 15,000 yuan is charged back, and the poor are exempted. The spring relief was already completed this year, and hundreds of stones of rice were distributed. It is said that the association has no funds, but because of its long-standing reputation, people are very enthusiastic about donating, and each time a charity event is held, members often temporarily engage in raising donations from the outside world. If there is not enough, the directors and persons in charge of the association will find ways to make up for it. The association is good at relief, and its merits are immeasurable for local public welfare.

Survival After a Robbery – Yangsi Bridge

Before February, around 10 o'clock every night, it was the time for local bandits to be active, robbing every household without exception. The targets, in addition to cash and jewelry, were materials such as rice, cotton, oil, and wheat. Therefore, the residents all screamed to the sky and moved out together. Recently, after Japanese troops were stationed in the town, it began to be peaceful, but the market is deserted and has become a small village. There is no news of guerrilla teams collecting donations, and the general prices are the same as in Shanghai, or even higher. Since the opening of the Shangnan Road, this place has also become a branch station, so the market is gradually recovering.

### Inside Story of Chongqing Appointing Song Ziwen as President of the Executive Yuan

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The change of the President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, decided at the third meeting of the Sixth National Congress of the Chongqing Kuomintang on the 31st, was an important event in Chongqing's major reorganization after the Stilwell incident in January last year. This reorganization in Chongqing is related to the San Francisco Conference externally, and to the implementation of constitutional government this autumn internally. Song Ziwen's appointment as President of the Executive Yuan is based on the demands of the United States, using economic assistance to Chongqing as a sign. Song is currently attending the San Francisco Conference and is Chongqing's American spokesperson and the highest leader of Chongqing's financial community. To overcome the current serious economic difficulties, there is no better plan than waiting for American assistance. To smoothly accept American economic assistance, it is most appropriate to have Song Ziwen, an American comprador, and since Nelson's arrival in Chongqing, Chongqing has established a wartime production bureau with Weng Wenhao, indicating cooperation with the United States. This is purely based on the US policy towards Chongqing. With such important figures of US-Chongqing economic cooperation serving as Vice Presidents of the Executive Yuan, it can be seen that Chongqing has actively strengthened its reliance on the United States. In short, US-Chongqing cooperation has gone beyond the stage of political cooperation and progressed to the stage of handling affairs. In other words, US-Chongqing cooperation has now fully entered the right track. Song Ziwen has actually served as President of the Executive Yuan in the past five months, which was the hope of the late US President Roosevelt. However, Song is a selfish element who would sell his country for his own benefit, and this is a dangerous figure in China. This kind of danger was encouraged by Roosevelt, who wanted to use him to realize his ambitions. Now, although Chiang Kai-shek has resigned from the post of President of the Executive Yuan, he still maintains his position and authority as "national leader" and "highest military commander of Chongqing," and is not bound by the fear of the voices of the various departments in the Executive Yuan after resigning from the post of President of the Executive Yuan. When dealing with domestic problems, he has greatly increased his freedom of action. At the same time, because the highest government lineup maintains Changxiong, it can be seen that the preparation for constitutional government is gradually being promoted. Kong Xiangxi was regarded as the number one corrupt official by the domestic and foreign media, especially Yan'an, when the Chongqing government was reorganized last November. Therefore, his resignation was inevitable, and his departure this time greatly satisfied the country.

Twenty Times Increase in Civil Servant Pensions Passed by the Executive Yuan

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: The Ministry of Personnel believes that prices have risen recently, and although the original civil servant pensions have been increased threefold in July of last year, the amount is still very small. It is still insufficient to pay for coffin and funeral expenses, let alone to provide for the bereaved. Moreover, civil servants generally have no savings during their lifetime. Once they die, they are extremely desolate and their families lose their support. Therefore, the Ministry of Personnel specially requested the Executive Yuan to increase the various civil servant pensions to show the government's sincere care. The request was passed by the 254th meeting of the Executive Yuan. According to the number of pensions, the number will be increased by twenty times.

### Truman Admits: The Japanese Air Force is Strong, American Attacks and Bombing Face Many Obstacles

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a special dispatch from the Mainichi Shimbun in Stockholm, Truman previously stated in Congress that he was determined to implement the four major strategies against Japan to force Japan's unconditional surrender. However, the situation for American attacks and bombing against Japan is different from the previous war against Germany. Most experts comment that there are many obstacles. For example, the aviation reporter of the London Times said that the most difficult aspect of the American strategy of attacking and bombing Japan is approaching the Japanese mainland. Among the accessible areas, there are no air bases that have the mission of large aircraft carriers as during the war against Germany. He also said that although the area of the Philippines is similar to that of the British mainland, the distance and terrain are different. Since acquiring the Mariana Islands as a base, the United States has been forcibly implementing strategic operations against Japan with B-29 aircraft, and is now planning to launch fierce attacks from the large air base in Okinawa. According to the Times reporter, there are many unpredictable points, so it is extremely difficult to predict how the strategic attacks against Japan will unfold in the future. It depends on how operations proceed from Okinawa and the acquisition of new bases. Enemy strategic bombers and amphibious units are gradually becoming active, but at any time, the British and American allied forces must be fully aware and prepared to sacrifice a large number of ships and air force personnel. Truman also pointed out that the Japanese air force is still extremely powerful, and the production of aircraft and fighter planes is also very high, which should not be underestimated, and the British side also holds the same view.

American Magazine Discusses the Difficulty of Operations

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New York, the American magazine Time, in an article titled "The Future of Combat," stated the following: "We must concentrate all our ships, aircraft, tanks, trucks, rockets, and bombs in our operations against Japan, but this is by no means an easy task for the United States and the United Nations. Before concentrating all combat power against Japan, we must transfer European troops and materials to the Pacific theater. What is more difficult is obtaining suitable bases for these troops and materials. The distance to the Japanese mainland is more than 2,160 kilometers, and there is too much water in the war zone, from the Kuril Islands in the north to Java in the south, and extending from the Caroline Islands to central China. Furthermore, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies form a single world, and we must engage in combat with them. The greatest difficulty in the Pacific War must be borne by the United States. A large part of the British fleet has already arrived in the Pacific and is also transporting troops. Canada also claims to be transporting volunteers, while the Australian army is fighting hard in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Borneo. The Netherlands cannot make a significant contribution to this war. The Dutch navy was severely defeated by the Japanese army three years ago. Today, France is very concerned about Vietnam and is only sending small mobile units to the Pacific. The Chongqing government has been continuously fighting since 1937, and its army and military industry are still weak, only able to maintain its territory. From this perspective, the United States must fight alone in the Pacific theater, so we must launch the largest navy, air force, and seven million troops to complete the operation against Japan."

Three British Liners Chartered by US to Transport Troops

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - Washington dispatch: U.S. President Truman sent a special message to Congress on the 1st, explaining the U.S. strategy against Japan. The message stated that Britain chartered three of its largest liners to the United States: the Queen Elizabeth (85,000 tons), the Queen Mary (81,235 tons), and the Aquitania (47,786 tons), to transport American troops from Europe to the East Asian front.

### Preparations for the Opening of the Jiangsu Northern Provincial Delegates' Congress

Yangzhou, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Jiangsu Northern Party Affairs Guidance Committee, in order to comply with the Central government's intentions and in accordance with legal regulations, supervised the election work of the party departments in each county under its jurisdiction. Subsequently, it sent personnel to supervise the elections in each county. Currently, the election work of party departments at all levels in the fourteen counties of Jiangsu Northern has been completed as scheduled, and preparations are underway to open the Jiangsu Northern Provincial Delegates' Congress. Recently, the work of the Jiangsu Northern Party Affairs Guidance Committee has been very intense, and preparations are being made for all matters.

### The United States, El Salvador, and Guatemala Merge

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Mexico City: Guatemala and El Salvador have merged into one country. The borders between the two countries have been abolished, and the border guards have been completely withdrawn. The presidents of the two countries will resign soon, and a federal president of the Central American Republic will be reappointed through elections. According to reports, the implementation of the Central American Federation movement by the Central American countries, the merger of Guatemala and El Salvador is the first step. It is feared that Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica will also join the Central American Federation in the future.

### The City of Nanjing Issues Gold Certificates for the Past Two Days; Gold to be Redeemed Next Month

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - Since the Central Reserve Bank issued gold certificates in Shanghai, the results have been quite good. Starting from the third phase, it has also begun to issue them widely in Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and other places. In this city, certificates were issued continuously for two days, the 5th and 6th. Merchants and people went to purchase them automatically and enthusiastically, and the situation was very good. It is scheduled that gold can be redeemed with the certificates from the 5th of next month.

### 1.5 Million People Died in Bengal

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, a report by a special committee of the British government stated that 1.5 million people died in Bengal in 1943.

### Four Countries Sign Agreement to Manage All of Germany; Demand that Germany Fulfill All Terms

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Moscow Radio's broadcast yesterday: The four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France have signed a "Joint Agreement," and the four countries will henceforth hold all power over Germany. Currently, the border of Germany should retreat to where the German border was on December 31, 1937, when Austria and Czechoslovakia had not yet been annexed by Germany. Since Germany declared its defeat, all power to manage Germany has been in the hands of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, the United States of America, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic. The German army, navy, and air force have all been defeated, so they have no choice but to unconditionally surrender to the United Nations. Now, defeated Germany, which should bear the responsibility for the war, cannot act against the will of the victorious countries. Germany now has no central government or central power to be responsible for maintaining order, managing the country, or fulfilling the demands put forward by the victors. Under this situation, Germany cannot order its army to cease hostile actions against the United Nations, nor can it declare that Germany should have the right to necessities. Representatives of the four major countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France will henceforth be called "United Nations Representatives," and they will each rely on the power of their own government and act in accordance with the

Joint Declaration

Currently, the four countries have issued a joint declaration, the main contents of which are as follows: The Provisional Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, the United States of America, and the French Republic will henceforth hold the highest authority in Germany, as well as the authority of the German government, the highest command, and all other temporary governments or municipal governments in Germany that have been handed over to our United Nations. However, holding this authority, rights, and power for the aforementioned purposes should not be regarded as an act of annexing Germany. The four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France will henceforth formulate the borderlines of Germany and determine the status of Germany, as well as all provinces that make up German territory.

Requirements

Based on the highest authority, rights, and powers of the four governments, the United Nations Representatives put forward the following requirements: Since Germany has been completely defeated and unconditionally surrendered, Germany must fulfill the requirements we put forward.

(A) - Germany and all German army, navy, and air force authorities and armed forces under German control shall immediately cease operations in all theaters of war against the land, sea, and air forces of the United Nations. All German troops and troops under German control, regardless of their location, including the army, navy, anti-aircraft artillery, air force, and other military organizations, shall be completely disarmed and surrendered. Their weapons may be handed over to the United Nations Command and Administration, which is locally appointed as the United Nations Representative.

(B) All military organizations and groups stipulated in item (A), if they obey the orders of the German commander-in-chief of the relevant region, will be declared war criminals, and at the same time, they shall comply with any conditions and instructions formulated by the United Nations Representatives.

(C) All German troops stipulated in item (A), regardless of their location, shall remain at their current location and await instructions from the United Nations Representatives.

(D) All German troops stipulated in the above items that have withdrawn outside the current borders of Germany, up to the area of the German border delineated on December 31, 1937, shall move in immediately when the United Nations Representatives issue instructions to move in.

(E) Police officers or dispatchers who can carry small weapons to maintain public order must wait for the instructions of the United Nations Representatives.

(F) All types of army, navy, and civilian aircraft of any country, in Germany or German-occupied areas, or in German-controlled territories and territorial waters, must remain in their original locations, whether on land or on ships, and await instructions from the United Nations Representatives. All German aircraft and aircraft under German control, regardless of whether they are in any territory or territorial waters not controlled by Germany, shall obey the separate instructions of the United Nations Representatives, or move to German territory or other places.

### Shanghai Branch of the News Association Welcomes Minister Shimada; Encourage Each Other to Strengthen Propaganda Through Unity and Consistency

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association held a tea party at the Majestic Hotel yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to welcome the newly appointed Minister Shimada of the Shanghai Army Department. The Minister arrived on time with Lieutenant Maehara, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Ensign Iijima, Maeda, Ejo, and Koike. They were received by Chen Binhe, the chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, and Chen Ripin, the managing director. Representatives of various member newspapers attended, including Osaga Yoichi, Hidaka Kiyomasa, Moriyama Takashi, Kim Ung-baek, Yang Jiong-lang, Lu Feng, and more than a hundred Chinese and Japanese reporters. First, Chen Binhe delivered a welcome speech, followed by a reply from Minister Shimada. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, and the meeting ended around 4:00 PM.

Chen Binhe's Speech

"Lieutenant Colonel Shimada has recently come to Shanghai to serve as the Minister of the Army Department. Today, we colleagues in the news industry are holding a tea party to express our sincere welcome.

Although we are newly acquainted with Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, our relationship with the Army Department is very close, because the Army Department is our guiding agency. In the past, the Shanghai news industry has received a lot of guidance and assistance from the Army Department, and the ministers in the past have been able to interact sincerely. I believe that they will continue to provide us with more enthusiastic guidance and more practical assistance.

We have said many times that Shanghai is a place with the most rumors, and it is also the place where people are most likely to believe rumors. Therefore, we who are engaged in reporting and propaganda work feel particularly responsible. Because most of the manufacturers of rumors are due to the enemy's strategic role, how should we report the correct current events at any time, how should we analyze the trend of the current situation at any time, on the one hand, to instruct citizens to understand the truth of the current situation, on the other hand, to crush the enemy's rumors, is really an extremely difficult task. And how to promote and complete this work requires us in the news industry to unite and work together under the guidance of the reporting authorities. Today, on behalf of my colleagues in the news industry, I express my welcome with sincerity, and at the same time state the purpose of my work, and hope that Lieutenant Colonel Shimada will give us guidance."

Shimada's Reply

Minister Shimada replied, saying: "I was ordered to come to Shanghai to take on the reporting work, and I arrived the day before yesterday. Now the war situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the responsibility of those engaged in propaganda work is also increasing. Especially the reporting work centered on Shanghai is even more important. Not only in East Asia, but also in the world, the greatest propaganda effect in the future will be in Shanghai. Just as Mr. Chen Binhe said just now that the enemy is carrying out strategic propaganda against Shanghai, our countermeasure should be the unanimous unity of both Chinese and Japanese relations to crush the enemy's strategic propaganda. I am flattered by Mr. Chen's praise just now, but I have been to Shanghai several times in the past, and I also know many people in the press in Shanghai. In the future, when promoting work in various aspects, I hope to get more guidance."

### The Security Corps Office Held a Joint Police-Security Meeting Yesterday, Deciding to Increase Security Corps Funding

The Municipal Police Department's Security Corps Office, in order to promote the efficiency of future security corps work, held a joint police-security meeting on the afternoon of the 6th. Director Gu of the Security Corps Office and Deputy Director Da Chuan both personally presided over the meeting. Also present were Second Director Pinggang, deputy directors of the Security Corps Office's district offices, section chiefs of various district police stations, chairmen of various security corps districts, and chief joint security chiefs, totaling more than one hundred people. Director Gu served as chairman of the meeting.

Reported Items

Each district should excavate air raid shelters, paying close attention to underground water pipes and gas pipes to avoid damage, and report damaged locations, as well as repair and clear accumulated water in air raid shelters. The "Strengthening Air Defense Facilities Week" has been implemented. Each security corps district is actively excavating family air raid shelters. An order has been received to replenish police defense materials and raise air defense funds. Nine districts have not yet submitted budgets; it is hoped that they will be compiled and reported as soon as possible, with a deadline of the end of June for completing the collection.

Discussion Items

Due to rising prices, it is proposed to increase security corps funding to cover expenses. It was resolved that, starting in July, households will be charged 300 yuan, primary households 600 yuan, and businesses 1,000 yuan. Special households will be reassessed by the chairman, chief joint security chief, and branch director, and implemented after approval. Regarding expenditures, the funding for each level of joint security will be 100,000 yuan per security corps, 200,000 yuan per joint security unit, 400,000 yuan per chief joint security unit, and 200,000 yuan per district branch, to be implemented after approval. The evacuation of the population of this city will commence on the 11th. Each district should report the addresses of the branch offices as soon as possible for coordination. It was resolved that each district branch office will commence operations on the 7th and submit supplementary information on staff and locations. A roster of personnel above the rank of 'Jia' chief in each district must be created and reported by June 15th. The Huashan and Changning districts requested that, before special rice is allocated to full-time security corps personnel, they be allowed to request a loan from the banking group to purchase rice from the interior and request the Security Corps Office to negotiate with relevant military and police agencies for assistance; this proposal was approved. It was decided to commence training for self-defense cadres on July 1st. In the future, changes in security corps personnel will be based on democratic elections. The detailed rules were approved and submitted for approval and implementation.

### The First Phase of Gold Certificates Will Be Cashed Out Starting Today

The third phase of gold certificates, which continued to be issued starting on the 4th of this month, reached its expiration date yesterday (the 6th). The sales volume remained the same as before. However, financial institutions were the largest purchasers of the first and second phases of gold certificates, while merchants and civilians were the largest purchasers of the third phase. The sale of gold certificates by the Central Reserve Bank in Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou also reached its expiration date yesterday. It is reported that the first phase of gold certificates will begin to be redeemed for gold today (the 7th), the second phase is scheduled to be redeemed for gold starting on the 21st of this month, and the third phase of gold certificates will be redeemed for gold starting on the 4th of next month.

The Central Reserve Bank Tightens Credit

The Central Reserve Bank authorities, in view of the recent surge in prices and the prosperity of speculative activities, in order to curb the rise in prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, have tightened credit. The money supply for banks and money houses also tightened simultaneously starting on the afternoon of the 5th. It is understood that this move by the Central Reserve Bank, in addition to having significant implications for prices and speculative activities, is also related to the purchase of materials such as silk, rice, wheat, oil, and cotton, as well as the preparation of necessary cash.

### The Finance Bureau Adjusts Property Tax in the Old City Area

The Municipal Finance Bureau stated that the property tax in this city, except for the old Districts 1 and 8, which have already been adjusted, has not yet been adjusted in parts of the old city area, such as Nanshi, Xucao, Wusong, and Pudong districts. It is now proposed to adjust the property tax in accordance with the old Districts 1 and 8, starting from this summer, using the property rent assessment standard of the 26th year of the Republic of China. The collected property tax will be uniformly collected at a tax rate of 14% based on 250 times the original amount. The assessment standards will be divided into residential, commercial, flat, multi-story, Western-style, factory, and warehouse categories, based on the quality of construction and market conditions, with the rental amount of each building assessed in sections. The above methods have been approved by the municipal government for implementation.

### Training Time Regulations for the 18th Air Defense Day

The 9th of this month is the 18th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will, as usual, implement various air defense training activities and expand publicity on the meaning of air defense. The time for this air raid alarm training has been stipulated as 8:00 AM for training for alert alarms, 4:00 PM for training for air defense alarms, 5:00 PM for training for the lifting of air raid alarms, 9:00 PM for training for air raid alarms, 10:00 PM for training for the lifting of air raid alarms, and 10:30 PM for training for the lifting of alert alarms. However, the issuance and lifting of training alarms will not involve the sounding of sirens. If the sirens are heard, it is a real alarm, and citizens should pay attention to it.

Thoroughly Strengthen Family Air Defense

The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters is implementing "Air Defense Facilities Strengthening Week" from the 1st to the 9th of this month. With the assistance of various police stations, family air defense facilities will be thoroughly strengthened, and air defense equipment will be increased as much as possible. In particular, air defense lampshades, window curtains, door drapes, and the like for lighting control must be complete, and no light should leak out during regular lighting control. The headquarters has dispatched personnel to various districts starting on the 6th to conduct random checks and inspections together with police and security personnel, and those found to be inadequate will be corrected.

Districts Are Actively Digging Small Air Raid Shelters

Furthermore, in order to ensure the quantity and completeness of air raid shelters, the headquarters instructed each branch bureau to supervise each security corps district to organize and arrange the existing air raid shelters, and to urge citizens in each joint security unit and security corps district to automatically excavate small air raid shelters (the designs have been published in various newspapers, and various patterns can be used as references). This is to provide a place for refuge in case of emergency and to protect the safety of citizens' lives. Each district's enthusiasm for the excavation of these small air raid shelters is very high.

Three Cases Were Pronounced Yesterday

The Shanghai Branch of the National Government's Special Court, having received from the National Government for trial the cases of Lu Shuiquan's sale of office, Wang Shuxun's intimidation, and Song Guiren et al.'s malfeasance, has completed the trial.

If he is unable to pay the fine, it will be commuted to labor at a rate of 1,000 yuan per day. The 5,000 yuan obtained is confiscated.

If they are unable to pay the fine, it will be commuted to labor at a rate of 1,000 yuan per day. The 30,000 yuan in bribes received is confiscated.

### The Construction Bureau Repairs and Surveys Bridges and Docks

The Municipal Construction Bureau stated that most of the city's bridges and docks are old and in disrepair, which hinders traffic.

### Postal Remittance Limits between Shanghai and North China

Postal remittances between Central China and North China will be restricted starting this month. The authorities have also approved remittance limits between Shanghai and North China. The amount for this month shall not exceed 1.3 million yuan in Federal Reserve notes, equivalent to more than 7 million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. If the remittance quota is reached, remittances may be temporarily suspended. Furthermore, the market price of Federal Reserve notes in this city has been rising sharply in recent days, which has significantly affected the financial sector. According to sources in the banking and money industry, the exchange rate between Federal Reserve notes and Central Reserve Bank notes has not changed. However, the exchange rate of 10 Federal Reserve notes for 100 Central Reserve Bank notes is the result of speculation outside the industry for profit.
