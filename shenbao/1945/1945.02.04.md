### Intense Fighting on Luzon Island: Japanese Elite Forces Bravely Counterattack, Firmly Defending the Front Line to Stop Enemy Advance

Luzon Front, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese army has been using blitz tactics to penetrate the flanks of the American bridgehead in Lingayen Gulf. On the 28th and 29th, they reportedly killed or wounded 72 enemy soldiers, captured one tank, ten machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and 1,600 rounds of ammunition. On the 31st, they engaged in a seesaw battle in the Kompu area near Los Baños and the eastern Batangas Pass. Simultaneously, the Japanese army in the central Luzon plains echoed this effort, repelling the American forces attacking Manila towards Kalumpit by evening, pushing them back to the Guiguinto area. At the same time, a 500-man Japanese suicide squad launched a surprise attack on an American mortar battery six kilometers southwest of Muñoz, destroying several mortars. Japanese elite forces also attacked the Clark Air Base area, disrupting the flanks of the American forces advancing on San Fernando and engaging in fierce battles with enemy troops in their rear. The Americans, after utilizing Leyte, Mindoro, and other locations, are now urgently constructing airfields in Lingayen, Bauang, and other places, intending to use the air power from these bases and the carrier-based aircraft of the naval mobile forces to implement a covering operation, with tank-led ground forces advancing south. On the evening of the 29th, the enemy attacked San Fernando with two tanks and 200 soldiers, but were ultimately repelled by the Japanese army. By the 31st, five American battleships, 35 destroyers, and 25 transport ships had approached the waters west of Batangas. On the morning of the same day, the enemy also landed a significant number of troops on the Subic Bay area in the northern Bataan Peninsula, making the Luzon war situation increasingly tense.

Philippine Front, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Newly landed enemy forces near Subic Bay and the west coast of Batangas continue to attack fiercely, attempting to invade Manila from the northwest. The enemy armored units previously advancing south from San Fernando have moved through Caloocan and entered Bulacan Province, advancing to within 40 kilometers of Manila. Japanese forces in the Batangas west coast area are engaging the enemy near Aka, ten kilometers east of Nasugbu, where the enemy landed, and fierce fighting is ongoing. In the Clark Field area, Japanese elite forces have been conducting heroic attacks against an enemy armored division since the 25th. Up to the 30th, the enemy's losses include 293 enemy bodies left behind, 14 tanks stranded and on fire, and the capture of five automobiles and numerous other artillery pieces and heavy weapons. The morale of the Japanese soldiers is increasingly high, and they are currently fighting bravely. In the Cabanatuan area, the Japanese army has blocked the enemy's advance along the Manila highway, firmly defending the Cabanatuan front line. As for the Japanese forces in the Rosales-Agat area, they are still fighting fiercely in close combat, forcing the enemy to yield. The enemy's movements are extremely inactive, and their advance has been blocked. To break through this difficult situation, the enemy is intensifying its attacks with the aid of the air force, using the four airfields in Lingayen, San Fabian, Dagupan, and Manaoag to assemble approximately 300 B-25s and other types of aircraft in an attempt to operate.

Luzon Front Base, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the battles on Luzon Island, the American forces have no clear objectives, indiscriminately bombing everything, regardless of cities or forests, and recklessly attacking under the cover of tanks. To achieve this goal, the American forces not only use these inhumane methods but also bomb hospitals, schools, and churches. On January 30th, six enemy B-29s indiscriminately bombed the Pope's residence and a hospital in Babatngon, 60 kilometers east of Baguio, injuring five nuns and many hospitalized patients. Enemy aircraft even dared to fly at low altitude, repeatedly bombing hospitals clearly marked with the Red Cross. The weather that day was clear, and even from a very high altitude, the distinct markings on the ground could be clearly seen. The fact that the American enemy carried out such atrocities has aroused the indignation of the local people.

During wartime, the authorities should share political responsibility. I deeply hope that everyone will be self-aware, diligently fulfill their duties, and strive for the interests of the nation and the people. The current government is determined to promote politics based on the constitution and under the principles of democracy. Therefore, officials and military personnel should frankly express their opinions, and I will fully respect their opinions. I myself am willing to make any sacrifice for Thailand and the Thai people and hope that everyone will abandon their personal positions and accomplish great things.

Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Following the reorganization of the Burmese wartime cabinet, the first cabinet meeting was held on the 1st, issuing a statement urging 16 million Burmese to rise up and making various agreements regarding the current extraordinary situation. After the cabinet meeting, National Representative Ba Maw announced the establishment of a Supreme National Defense Council and national defense propaganda, with the following main points regarding various policies: (1) A Supreme National Defense Council will be established soon, with Prime Minister Ba Maw as the chairman, to promptly implement various policies related to the war.

(4) New intelligence agencies will be established in areas close to the enemy to carry out local propaganda and reporting, as well as to contact the Japanese army on the front lines, crush enemy schemes and propaganda, and educate the general public.

Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – National Representative Ba Maw issued a statement on the 1st after the end of the first cabinet meeting: Today, the country of Burma is facing a major situation that will determine the fate of the nation, and the enemy British army is attempting to counterattack Burma. They are now continuously invading Burmese territory. In order to uphold our glorious independence and protect our homeland, we must do everything in our power to stop the enemy's invasion. The establishment of the new cabinet is to bear the responsibility under this major situation. Hereby, in the position of the wartime national cabinet, I solemnly vow to the Burmese people: First, the new cabinet is the national government that represents the Burmese people and will faithfully serve the people. Second, the new government is determined to cooperate with the Great Japanese Empire and the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to complete the war for Burmese independence. Third, with the assistance of Japan, we will strive to improve the political, social, and economic status of the people. At the same time, we ask all Burmese people to cooperate with the government. This war is the war of Great Burma. Therefore, all Burmese people must cooperate with all their strength in the war. Our independence is the independence of Great Burma. The victory of the Greater East Asia War is the victory of Burma. Only then will Great East Asia have peace and prosperity, and we will be able to realize a Burma for the Burmese.

Weekly Commentary

### Preface to the Japanese Book "Analysis of the Chongqing Regime"

— Yoshida Toyu

Someone said to me: "As the saying goes, nothing lasts forever. You have been painstakingly studying the political trends in China in Shanghai for ten years. Surely you have some unique insights that you can share for those who are concerned about current affairs?" Others often say that the longer you live in China, the less you understand it. People who come to China for the first time form a general view of China within two or three years. After that, no matter what Chinese problem they encounter, they always try to explain it with this concept, that is, they try to adapt to the ever-changing phenomenon with unchanging prejudices. It is okay to think this way in their own minds, and it is even okay to use it to impress newcomers and boast about being an expert on Chinese issues. However, when dealing with Chinese people in a practical manner, they suddenly become clueless and encounter obstacles everywhere. Then they feel that their previous understanding of China has been completely overturned and they cannot cope. They dismiss the phenomena they do not understand as absolutely "unknowable" and leave it at that. There must be many people who have had this experience while living in China. I think the reason is as follows:

The majority of the Chinese people are farmers, and their lives remain largely unchanged. Seeing only this aspect, and then saying that "China is the medieval Europe of today," or "The Chinese are a nation living in the seventeenth century in the twentieth century," is correct. Then they hastily draw a dogmatic conclusion. They believe that since the Chinese are economically two or three centuries behind, they will not go wrong if they deal with them politically based on this "brilliant idea." Based on this view, they make various "efforts" towards the Chinese. However, the result is like "scratching an itchy shoe," a futile effort. China is only as gentle as a sheep, as silent as an ox, listening to the torrent of explanations from the Japanese, but never expressing the kind of mental reaction that the Japanese expect. Then the Japanese should conduct another self-examination. Why do the Chinese not have a mental reaction? Isn't our "effort" expressing opposition through silence? Assuming that this is unfortunately true, how do the Chinese acquire this ability to discern? If we research forward based on this question, we will reach enlightenment on the China issue. In short, ninety percent of the Chinese population is illiterate and cannot even write their own names. However, those who guide them politically are intellectuals with thirty years of experience in national revolution and a broad political vision. They do not live a stable political life like the Japanese, but have grown up under the oppression and deception of many foreign powers that the Japanese have never experienced. Therefore, they have a level of political sophistication that the Japanese cannot imagine. They have experienced democratic revolutions and even proletarian revolutions. It is these progressive intellectuals who are guiding the backward masses and forming the "Chinese nation" of today. Thinking of this, we can feel the complexity of the issues involved. However, if we think about this complexity further, we will realize that the complexity of the China issue is not simply composed of domestic factors, but reflects the struggles and compromises of various countries in the world, and is constantly changing. Therefore, the China issue cannot be understood without constant effort and research. Especially recently, the China issue has become increasingly difficult to fathom because the interests of various countries in the world are intertwined like a tangled mess. Even though it is extremely Machiavellian and complex, the one who can untie the "tangled mess" of East Asia must be Japan. Let me say something that others may consider unprofessional: Japan's main enemy is currently attacking from the east, but Japan's main sword is stabbing westward. This is truly puzzling. Just as Alexander cut the "tangled mess" with a quick sword before launching his eastern expedition, if Japan can untie the "tangled mess" of East Asia with decisive action and then shift its troops eastward, the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be assured.

Based on this view, I have been immersed in studying Chinese issues, especially the Chongqing regime issue, for the past half year. The results of my research have been published in the Shen Bao. However, I have received an unexpected response. Not only did the Shen Bao publish them, but the New China Daily, the Mainland New Daily, the New People's Daily in Beiping, the Great Chu Daily in Hankou, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Daily in Jinhua all competed to publish them one after another. This may be the most impactful work by a Japanese in the past decade. However, I myself know better than anyone that these essays are not outstanding works. The only merit is that I observe Sino-Japanese relations with an objective attitude and want to sincerely discover a solution to the Greater East Asia War with the Chinese. In another sense, this can be said to be a self-criticism by the Japanese regarding the Sino-Japanese Incident. The ultimate victory of a war, to be honest, is the victory of the war's guiding theory. Mencius said: "To conquer is to rectify. Each wants to rectify himself. What is the use of war?" Therefore, I believe that the greatest task of cultural figures today is to constantly engage in self-criticism regarding the nature of our current war and to gradually improve our war guiding theory.

### Japanese Troops on the Yuehan Railway Line Advance Towards Nanxiong

Central News Agency dispatch from the Yuehan Front, 3rd: Japanese troops, in two contingents north and south of Shaoguan, are fiercely attacking Nanxiong, a wing of the Suigan airfield 100 kilometers east of the Yuehan Railway Line. They are expected to capture it in one fell swoop soon. Afterward, they can coordinate with each other to complete the strategic encirclement of the Suigan airfield. The American forces stationed there will be on the verge of collapse.

Enemy Suffers Heavy Blows

Central News Agency dispatch from a mainland base, 3rd: As a result of the Japanese army's fierce offensive, Suichuan, the central hub of the American Air Force's forward base in Chongqing, has finally fallen. Consequently, the so-called Suigan area airfield cluster is gradually collapsing under the heavy pressure of the Japanese army. The enemy's coastal defense is also losing ground accordingly. It is reported that the American air base in the Suigan area, centered on Suichuan, 200 kilometers southeast of Hengyang, is composed of Ganzhou, 70 kilometers southeast, Xincheng, 100 kilometers south, Ji'an, 100 kilometers north, Zhijiang, and other important areas, plus mobile airfields in Jian'ou, Fujian Province, and Nanxiong, Guangdong Province. This configuration aimed to bomb the South China coast and Taiwan, and disrupt sea traffic routes. However, due to the Japanese army's Guangxi campaign, the enemy feared being cut off from its rear supply lines and temporarily retreated, destroying the expansion work, which was half-completed, at the Xincheng and Jian'ou airfields and rarely using them afterward. The Suichuan and Ganzhou airfields still relied on air supply, and activities became more intense. Especially when the enemy invaded the Philippines, the area actively engaged in supplying fuel and ammunition with large aircraft. At the same time, enemy aircraft in the area often operated with about 100 fighter-bombers. Moreover, when the enemy mobile fleet appeared in the South China Sea a month ago, it also provided support and implemented diversionary operations. Originally, the enemy fighter squadron stationed there was a considerable nuisance to the American Air Force on the mainland. It had exerted its final effectiveness in the previous diversionary operation. Its importance in the war cannot be ignored. Therefore, the fall of the Suichuan forward base was a very deep blow to the enemy.

US Admits to Weak Defenses

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 3rd: According to a dispatch from Chongqing: General Wedemeyer, commander of the American forces in the China theater, met with a group of reporters on the 1st and spoke about the Japanese army's new operation to complete the clearing of the Yuehan Railway and sweep away the remaining air bases in that area. He also believed that most of the American air bases east of the Yuehan Railway would soon be occupied by the Japanese army operating in South China. He stated that the defenses in this area were very weak and that the Japanese army's action was foreseeable because the American forces stationed in Chongqing had used it as a base to cover the operations in the Philippine Islands, given that the Japanese army had not occupied it initially.

### Ministry of Health Formulates Smoking Cessation Methods for Smokers

Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd: In order to provide smokers in various regions with a unified method of smoking cessation and accelerate the process, the Ministry of Health has formulated methods for smoking cessation and examination. These have been printed and distributed to hospitals兼理戒烟醫院 (concurrently managing smoking cessation) in various counties for compliance.

### Eastern Front Mobile Warfare Enters New Phase: Soviet Offensive Encountered at the Warta River

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Transocean News Agency reports: The focus of General Zhukov's offensive is on the strongly defended cities of Schneidemühl and Posen, in the entire Warta River area. The mobile warfare north of the Warta and Warthe rivers has entered a new phase. Since the Soviet vanguards reached various points on the Warta River, the Soviet army is now forced to deploy its troops on a large scale. The changing climate requires the pursuing Soviet forces to continue advancing on the Warta and Warthe rivers, which is completely different from fighting on frozen ground. In addition, the transportation of all supplies is facing extreme difficulties. Therefore, the war has temporarily become calm, giving the German command an opportunity to implement countermeasures. The Warta River line will become an obstacle to the Soviet army's future, which was not anticipated by the Soviet command. The Soviet's fierce offensive has been stopped here. The fact that Zhukov's troops encountered strong German resistance in the Küstrin area proves that the German countermeasures have also been effective there.

Soviet Right Wing Forces Close to Schwerin

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: According to a German military reporter: The extreme right wing of Zhukov's army has approached a point 47 kilometers from Schwerin.

Fierce Fighting in Silesia

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Transocean News Agency reports: In Silesia, the Soviet army has once again attempted to break through the Moravian Gate, but most of the attempts have been repelled. The main force is advancing between Beuthen and Pleß. Before the attack, the Soviet army bombarded with artillery and aircraft. The Soviet troops who broke into Diedersdorf were forced to withdraw from the outskirts after hand-to-hand combat. The Soviet army launched local offensives at the Küstrin bridgehead, and fierce fighting also occurred at the bridgehead west of Stalau. As a result, the German army is in an advantageous position.

German Army and Civilians Cooperatively Defend Berlin

Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 3rd: According to a Berlin broadcast on the evening of the 2nd: Berlin is now full of barbed wire. The National Storm Troopers defending the city are fiercely training day and night. The noise of tanks and mechanized units shakes the streets. Another report states that the outer defense line of a certain city is now ready. Young and capable commanders trusted by Führer Hitler are personally leading stormtroopers and elite members of the Hitler Youth to await battle.

### Alsace Warfare Turns Fierce

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Transocean News Agency reports: The fighting in Alsace is now becoming more intense. There is also fierce fighting north of Strasbourg. The American Seventh Army launched a new offensive east of Bitche and in the direction of Mouterhouse. At the same time, the anti-Axis forces are also increasing pressure on the German salient in Upper Alsace. The enemy wants to break into the Rhine River between Achenheim and the Colmar Canal to separate the German bridgehead. The enemy clearly has the intention of encircling the city of Colmar from the northeast. Most of Eisenhower's troops are now concentrated in the central and northern routes, especially in the Aachen area, where it appears to be the focus of a major future anti-Axis offensive.

### Site of the Three-Headed Conference Not Revealed

Central News Agency dispatch from Bern, 2nd: German News Agency reports: According to United Press news from New York, the Three-Headed Conference began on the 2nd, but the location of the meeting has not been announced.

A dispatch from Stockholm states that, according to a New York correspondent for the "Daily Mail," news from London and Cairo carried by American newspapers confirms that the Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt conference is underway. The correspondent also confirmed that within hours of the start of the conference, a joint declaration will be issued to the German people, announcing the terms and form of "unconditional surrender." The correspondent continued, stating that former U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles gave a speech explaining that the Three-Headed Conference is in progress and expressed his belief that the decisions made by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin would answer the question of whether to organize an international organization to replace the League of Nations. In light of the various political failures since the start of the "liberation" of Europe, Welles believes that such an international organization must be established as soon as possible.

Polish Issue Included on the Agenda

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 3rd: The Polish issue, which was the spark for the European war, is reported to be included as a major agenda item at the Three-Headed Conference. Currently, there are two regimes in Poland. The London-based government-in-exile claims to be the legitimate Polish government. Until the end of last year, before the Lublin government received Soviet support, the Polish government-in-exile was confident that it was supported and protected by Britain and the United States. However, after the birth of the Lublin government, this confidence was fundamentally diminished. Britain and the United States, fearing a deterioration in relations with the Soviet Union, have taken a non-committal attitude towards the two Polish regimes. At the same time, the Lublin regime has consolidated its position by seizing the opportunity to infiltrate Warsaw and other reasons. From any point of view, it is necessary to recognize that the issue of Poland's legitimate government may be the focus of discussion.

### American Ships Mostly Used in the Pacific

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 2nd: German News Agency, Washington: Britain and France have recently sent a note to the highest American military authorities, strongly protesting against the American military's dispersal of combat power in the two oceans. The biggest objection in the protest letter is the American military authorities' decision to use a large portion of ships in the Pacific theater. Officials in Washington expect that a secret understanding has been reached on the new allocation method for ships.

### Japanese Interests in Turkey to Be Managed by Switzerland

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: The Japanese Foreign Ministry announced on the 2nd: Following the exchange of notes between Japan and Turkey, the representation of Japanese interests in Turkey, Iran, and Iraq has been officially entrusted to the Swiss government.

### Municipal Government Issues Temporary Relief Bonds to Adjust Rice Prices and Supplement Charitable Funds

The draft regulations and repayment schedule for the issuance of temporary relief bonds by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government have been approved and retroactively recognized by the 144th meeting of the Central Political Committee. To clarify the contents of the bond regulations and the repayment method, a Central News Agency reporter visited the municipal government to obtain details as follows:

Amount and Use of Issuance

In December of last year, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, based on a recommendation from the Municipal Advisory Committee, decided to issue temporary relief bonds. The purpose was to adjust the city's rationed rice prices and supplement the city's charitable relief funds. The bonds are named "Shanghai Special Municipal Republic of China 34th Year Temporary Relief Bonds" and have a total value of 150 million national currency. They will be issued in one batch, with two-thirds used to adjust rationed rice prices and one-third used for various charitable relief funds throughout the city. The bonds are scheduled to be issued on New Year's Day of this year. The denominations are 1 million, 500,000, 200,000, 100,000, 50,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 1,000 yuan, all unregistered.

Interest Payment and Repayment Method

The annual interest rate of the bonds is set at 1.2%, with interest paid twice a year on May 31 and November 30. The bonds will be repaid in five years using a lottery method. Interest will be paid in the first year only. From the second year (i.e., the 35th year of the Republic of China), principal will be repaid in two tranches per year, with 15 million yuan repaid each tranche, fully repaying the bonds in five years. The aforementioned repayment will be held at the Municipal Government on May 10 and November 10 each year. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit will be dispatched to supervise. Bondholders and citizens are free to observe the lottery. Payments will begin at the end of each month. The bonds are designated to use the city's special consumption tax revenue as the repayment fund. The Municipal Finance Bureau will allocate monthly average amounts according to the principal and interest schedule, depositing them with the Central Reserve Bank and the Shanghai Special Municipal Fuxing Bank, crediting them to the account of the Bond Fund Management Committee for disbursement. In the event of a shortfall in a certain month, the Municipal Government shall immediately allocate a sufficient amount from other revenue items to make up the difference, without delay.

Fund Management Committee

The Bond Fund Management Committee will be jointly organized by one representative each from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Audit, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Finance Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Money Shops Association, and the Central Reserve Bank, as well as two members of the Advisory Committee. The bonds can be freely bought and sold, mortgaged, and used as guarantee deposits, public reserve funds, and for market transactions. The matured principal and interest tickets can also be used to pay municipal taxes.

### Chinese Company Passenger Ship Indiscriminately Bombed by American Aircraft

The repeated indiscriminate bombing of unarmed ships and Red Cross ships by American aircraft has aroused public indignation around the world. However, such inhumane acts by American aircraft have recently become even more frequent. It is reported that the ×× ship of the Shanghai Chinese Shipping Company was bombed by American aircraft in broad daylight, resulting in over seventy passenger deaths and injuries. On the afternoon of January 16, the ship was carrying over 220 passengers, sailing upstream on the Yangtze River somewhere. However, when it reached ××, four enemy aircraft suddenly attacked from the north, strafing with machine guns at low altitude before flying west. An investigation revealed that 31 passengers and 3 crew members were killed, and 43 passengers and 2 crew members were seriously injured. Captain Zhu survived unharmed. According to Captain Zhu, the ship had hundreds of bullet holes, with slight damage to the wheelhouse, passenger cabins, and steam pipes. Since the ship had no weapons on board at the time, they could only await death. We will never forget such inhumane actions by American aircraft and will surely take revenge.

### Press Conference of the Propaganda Department: Education Issues Raised, Director Dai of the Education Bureau Attends to Answer

The Municipal Propaganda Department convened its second regular press conference with reporters from various newspapers in the city at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 3rd). Dai Yingfu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, along with Secretary Dai Wangren and Chief Supervisor Pan, arrived on time. Liu Dexuan, Director of the Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. Dai answered various questions regarding tuition fees, teacher salaries, and public education. The meeting adjourned after two hours. Excerpts of the Q&A are as follows:

Question Regarding Teachers in Public Elementary Schools

(Q) Can the municipal normal school students be assigned as volunteer teachers to the city's public morning schools, with a small allowance for transportation expenses? This would not only solve the teacher problem but also provide practice opportunities for normal school students.

(A) The establishment of public morning and evening schools in this city and the flexible use of the system are to provide general public with the opportunity to receive education, which is undertaken by the school teachers of the affiliated morning schools for the purpose of saving expenses. As for assigning normal school students as voluntary school teachers, the time and transportation costs are uneconomical. Normal school students regularly have teaching practice, and if they are assigned to public education work, it may not be easy to carry out.

Cotton Cloth Rationing Has Been Submitted to the Executive Yuan

(Q) The teachers are excited to hear that cotton cloth rationing will be arranged for teachers and staff. What is the progress?

(A) The priority rice rationing for teachers and staff has been completed. Teachers and staff are in great need of cloth, so a special rationing request has been submitted to the Municipal Government, which has forwarded it to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan should instruct the Bureau of Commerce and Trade to handle it. As for the rationing method in the future, relevant agencies will be requested to handle it jointly to prevent abuses.

(Q) Teachers are supposed to receive rice rations twice a month, totaling three dou (a unit of dry measure), and have never been delayed. However, only one ration was issued in January, and the second has not yet been issued. What is the reason for this, and will it be re-issued in the short term?

(A) I asked Director Liu of the Materials Distribution Office yesterday, who said: "The rice rations have not yet been received. Once they arrive, they will be distributed immediately."

(Q) The new semester is about to begin, and it is said that it is difficult for students to purchase nationally standardized textbooks. They have to resort to the black market, which increases the burden on parents. Does the Education Bureau know about this, and how will it reduce this black market?

(A) In order to save resources, the Ministry of Education instructed the Education Bureau to draft regulations for the management of textbooks, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for record. The distribution of textbooks is handled by the China United Publishing Company entrusted by the Ministry of Education and is not related to this bureau. The pricing is also set by the Ministry. I have investigated the black market situation, but bookstores deny it. It may be that wholesalers are illegally profiting from it. We are currently trying to eliminate this phenomenon.

Handling of Non-Compliant Fee Collection

(Q) Currently, many private schools are charging registration fees that do not comply with the Education Bureau's regulations. What strict enforcement measures does the Bureau have? The Bureau announced that private school tuition fees are to be paid in two installments, but some schools are not complying. What measures does the Bureau have to deal with this?

(A) Regarding the tuition fee issue, the Bureau has discovered that many schools are not complying with the regulations. The persons in charge of these schools have been summoned for discussions and ordered to refund the fees. However, some schools are still doing so. I will personally urge the persons in charge of each school to comply with the municipal government's orders. At the same time, we are preparing to use 20 million as subsidies for private schools. Although this estimate has not been approved, it is being prepared. If any school continues to collect tuition fees in violation of municipal government orders, it will be investigated and reported to the Mayor for action. If there is a reason why tuition fees must be increased, as long as the Bureau sends someone to investigate and it is true, it may be permissible. However, the atmosphere in Shanghai is too bad, and they often imitate each other. The tuition fees charged by private universities in this city are very high, and the Education Bureau cannot manage them (because it is managed by the Ministry of Education), but it indirectly affects the amount of fees charged by primary and secondary schools. We are currently trying to deal with it.

(Q) Is the small collection of tuition rice by various schools to meet the needs of rural areas considered a flexible measure? Will teacher salaries still be based on rice prices, or will a half-rice, half-salary system be adopted?

(A) The Ministry of Education has not permitted it.

### Key Points for Increased Agricultural Production in Various Regions in the 34th Year (2)

(Continued from the first page of this newspaper on January 30)

(3) Construction of Demonstration and Contracted Farms: 1. Demonstration Farms: This year, for cooperative societies and branches that have already been established and are newly improved, a subsidy of 2,500 yuan per mu (a unit of area) is planned to enrich their equipment, so as to provide farmers with on-site observation and to collect excellent seeds. 2. Contracted Farms: This year, for mutual aid societies and farms established by farmers under contract, a subsidy of 1,500 yuan per mu is planned to expand their scope and enrich their internal resources, so that under the guidance of cooperative societies and promotion associations, they can plan the cultivation, improvement, and collection of excellent seeds for rice, wheat, oil, vegetables, and sugarcane.

(4) Guidance, Encouragement, and Assistance in the Cultivation of General Major Food Crops: 1. Rice Cultivation: The improvement of rice cultivation practices should be fully understood and universally adopted by farmers. This year, in order to concentrate efforts and achieve the greatest effect, 100 townships are specifically selected within experimental counties for implementation, and close cooperation is established with village construction service centers. Cooperative societies actively provide guidance and promotion to achieve the goal of improving agricultural techniques. The methods are as follows: 2. Improvement of Cultivation: According to the rice cultivation regulations, village construction service centers assist cooperative societies in guiding seed selection, sowing, fertilization, and improvement, and hold seed appraisal meetings and rice product appraisal meetings in various counties. Those with good results are given commendations and rice cultivation improvement awards. A subsidy of 100,000 yuan is given to each township for this work. 3. Prevention and Control of Rice Stem Borers: According to the growth period of rice stem borers, village construction service centers assist cooperative societies in mobilizing villagers and elementary school students to engage in the prevention and control of rice stem borers by appropriate methods. A subsidy of 800 yuan is planned for each township for this work. 4. Wheat, Rapeseed, and Utilization of Fallow Land: The superior wheat seeds planted by cooperative demonstration farms last year should be distributed to contracted farmers and core farmers this year. Farmers should be guided and encouraged to implement strip sowing methods. Furthermore, the improved methods of fertilization, cultivation, weeding, etc., for wheat should be promoted by promotion associations and core farmers to general farmers and implemented in various experimental counties. Efforts should be concentrated and specifically implemented.

Utilization of Space Land: This year, it is planned to utilize 15,000 mu of vacant land, with a subsidy of 600 yuan per mu, to actively promote the increased production of crops such as sugarcane, rapeseed, and wheat.

(1) Rectification of Experimental and Research Institutions: The Central Agricultural Experimental Institute was originally the highest institution for agricultural experimentation and research. This year, personnel should be strengthened, equipment should be expanded, and reorganization should be carried out to become a model for agricultural experimentation and a center for agricultural technology improvement.

(2) Establishment of Seed Collection and Demonstration Work: The agricultural improvement experimental areas established by the Ministry of Industry in various locations originally numbered more than 30. Last year, in order to concentrate funding and manpower, they were merged and consolidated to enrich their content. The Yanziji Model Experimental Area of the Ministry should be used as a model experimental area and activity center. Furthermore, the agricultural improvement experimental areas established in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai are planned to receive a subsidy of 360,000 yuan each this year to promote seed collection and demonstration work.

(3) Enrichment of Mutual Aid Societies: Mutual aid societies are organizations of village self-governance and are the most important cells for the implementation of agricultural technology improvement and agricultural production increase. Last year, as a result of the active organization and promotion by cooperative societies, promotion associations, and the China Cotton Production Improvement Association, approximately 4,200 societies have been formed. This year, in order to actively engage in activities and achieve the expected results, it has been decided to focus on enriching the mutual aid societies that were established last year. Only 270 new societies need to be established in the designated counties and districts for increased production implementation, for a total of 4,500 societies, with each society receiving a subsidy of 2,000 yuan.

(4) Enrichment of Mutual Aid Societies: More than 5,000 people have been trained last year, and another 1,000 will be trained this year, mostly in the designated counties and districts for increased production implementation. The training method is the same as last year, divided into three times in spring, summer, and autumn, with each training lasting 10 days. The training key points are to make farmers understand the meaning of agricultural production increase and the knowledge and skills necessary for agricultural production increase, to make them the core cadres of promotion associations and mutual aid societies, and the vanguards of agricultural production increase, with a subsidy of 1,500 yuan per person for training expenses.

(B) Regarding the Development of Wasteland and Utilizers of Idle Land: Encouragement of Wasteland Reclamation: This year, it is planned to reclaim 8,000 mu of wasteland, with cooperative societies, mutual aid societies, and other relevant organizations as the main promoters, with a subsidy of 1,200 yuan per mu, to actively promote the increased production of sweet potatoes and wheat. (To be continued)

Reader's Scholarship News

### This Newspaper Collects One-Yuan Bills: Key Transportation Points, Zonal Collection, Turning Small Amounts into Large Sums, Transferring for Educational Assistance

This newspaper published Mr. Chen Shao-wei's proposal on January 19th, "Collecting One-Yuan Bills to Aid Education." The original letter stated: "Recently, prices have soared, and one-yuan bills and fractional notes are almost useless. Using them, no one is happy to accept them. Discarding them casually is a pity! How about placing a small box at the entrance or by the wall of your esteemed organization, allowing people to put small notes in it? Waiting for the accumulation of sums to be used as aid money, the number may be quite considerable..." Mr. Chen is an economist, and his proposal is very appropriate. Just looking at the above few words, it feels very commendable. After careful consideration by the colleagues in this newspaper who are dedicated to aiding education, it has been decided to adopt his valuable proposal. The methods are: (1) Select key transportation centers throughout the city to set up several "One-Yuan Bill Collection Silver Boxes" (locations will be announced later) to facilitate citizens to put in bills at any time. (2) All fractional notes below one yuan, considered useless by citizens, are welcome. (3) If any enthusiastic ladies collect small notes worth over one hundred yuan and wish to have their names published, they can wrap the collected one hundred yuan with paper, marking their name and the number of bills. This newspaper will publish it accordingly after inspection. Other odd amounts will be published collectively. (4) This newspaper will send staff to collect small notes from various locations before 6 PM every evening, check them clearly, and publish them publicly the next day for credibility. In addition to collecting small notes, accumulating small amounts to make large sums, and turning small amounts into whole sums to enrich the educational assistance fund, the main purpose of this initiative is to create a universal atmosphere of aiding education, extending it to make all Shanghai citizens have the mentality of "cherishing material resources" and "being good at giving generously." In the past, people who donated to scholarship funds were limited to a very small number of middle-class people. Wealthy people were unwilling to donate money, and poor people were unable to donate money. Only this initiative, regardless of wealth, is a force for donating and helping others. Small notes below one yuan, no matter who or which family, can be said to be everywhere. If everyone in Shanghai donated one yuan, then the total of four million yuan could very likely become a reality.

Opening Ceremony Money Transferred to Aid Education

The Four Sisters Café Music Hall wrote: "Regarding the opening of our café music hall, we were honored to receive generous gifts from prominent figures in society and friends from all walks of life. A total of 155,600 yuan was received in gift money. 50,000 yuan has already been allocated to the Zhongshan School for the Deaf and Mute. The remaining 105,600 yuan will be donated to your newspaper and the News (Xinwen) Newspaper's scholarship funds. Attached is a check for 52,800 yuan. Please verify and acknowledge receipt."

Welfare Association Allocates Funds to Aid Education

Chen Fukang, Director of the Shanghai Hunnan Citizens Welfare Association, wrote: "Regarding the attached report on the revenue and expenditure of the Association's previous garbage disposal, which has been reviewed and verified by accountant Shen Hao, we hope that it will be published in the social service column of your esteemed newspaper to show credibility. Also attached is 30,000 yuan in national currency, which is donated to your newspaper for educational assistance purposes. Please verify receipt and issue a receipt."

Movie Stars and Singers to Perform Today and Tomorrow

The Four Sisters Café Music Hall at the Pudong Building on Great Shanghai Road will hold a movie star singing concert on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, starting at 2 PM and 8 PM. Gong Qiuxia, Chen Qi, Zhang Fan, and Chen Juanjuan will be the main singers, combining music, song, and dance in one place to earn a percentage of the business, which will be allocated to the News (Xinwen) Newspaper and the Tai (Great) Newspaper's scholarship funds. Yesterday, both day and night performances were sold out, with outstanding performances. The music hall predicts that today and tomorrow will be even more enthusiastic. It is truly a grand event of entertainment that does not forget to aid education. Furthermore, there are many programs scheduled, and it may be necessary to exceed the prescribed business hours. It is said that the authorities of the two newspapers have already obtained special permission.

Various Schools Set Up Free School Places

(1) Alumni of Jiaotong, Daxia, St. John's, Soochow, and other universities, in view of the high tuition fees charged by various schools recently, which has caused many young students to lose their opportunity to study, jointly founded Shengyi Middle School at Dehua Elementary School, No. 42, Lane 1218, Daxing Road. Temporarily, there are four classes of the first and second grades of junior high school, starting in the spring and autumn, with 40 places in each class. In addition to responding to the "Rescuing Students Who Lost Educational Opportunities" movement of the Shen (Shenbao) and Xin (Xinwen) newspapers and requesting them to guarantee the admission of 10 students in each class, there are still places available. The school is purely voluntary in nature, with all tuition and fees waived, and is exclusively for poor and needy children. Class time is from 5 PM to 8 PM every day. Registration will begin on February 1st, with registration time from 2 PM to 6 PM. The entrance examination will be held on February 10th, and school will begin on February 15th.

(2) Wanlan Middle School, No. 560, Caishi Road, has always been based on the principle of giving preferential treatment to outstanding students from poor families. Therefore, teaching and management are serious, and tuition fees are especially low. It is now planned to continue recruiting several male and female transfer students in the first and second grades of junior high school. Students with excellent grades and from poor families can request preferential treatment. The method is: if the total score is above 70 points and there are supporting documents, the tuition fee will be reduced by 2,000 yuan according to the original regulations (the original amount was 10,000). Furthermore, the school has already started on the 2nd of this month, and classes began on the 5th.

(3) The private Daode Elementary School at the intersection of Huashan Road and Wukang Road, in order to sponsor poor students, in addition to the original fee reduction and free places in each grade, the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association will generously provide 30 free and half-fee places each. Students whose families are indeed poor and who have excellent character and academic performance can apply for free admission.

(4) Jingxian Elementary and Middle School on North Shansi Road, in order to promote compulsory education and reduce the burden on parents, has specially added a number of half-fee and free students in each grade of elementary and middle school. Excellent students must be selected and sent by this newspaper. Classes will begin on February 5th.

### Finance Bureau Strictly Prohibits Private Solicitation of Fees

Since Commissioner Luo assumed office at the Municipal Finance Bureau, he has actively reorganized tax collection and severely admonished subordinates to be honest and self-disciplined. Now, as the Lunar New Year is approaching, fearing that unscrupulous personnel may still solicit fees from taxpayers, he has dispatched personnel to conduct detailed investigations. Once verified, he will severely punish them according to the law to rectify discipline and clean up officialdom.

### A Record of the Painter Jiang Hanting

— Huang Xuanweng

Changshu, with its beautiful scenery and flourishing literary style, has long been a haven for poetry and painting among the Su townships. For example, Qian Muqi and Jiang Tingxi were all elegant in diction and superb in brushwork. My friend Jiang Zihanting was born with extraordinary talent and a reclusive nature, and he loved painting from a young age. He painstakingly studied and traced the famous works since the Song and Yuan dynasties. From childhood to youth, and from youth to adulthood, he seemed to be reading in paintings.

I first met him at the home of painter Li Zuishi in Wumen. He had a sincere and simple expression, stuttering as if he could not speak. Zuishi said to me, "This is my painting friend Jiang Hanting, whom I fear." Zhang Zuishi's high imitations were rarely satisfactory to anyone in the world, but he respected Hanting so much that I admired him in my heart. Over the past twenty years, the world has changed repeatedly. In the year of Xin Si, I suddenly encountered him at the Daguan Art Garden in Shanghai. Hanting had reduced his youthful vigor, and I was already old and gray. I then learned that he had been playing with painting with Zhang Zizhong Yuan every day in recent years and gradually presented his "Hundred Birds Picture" for inscriptions. The strange and diverse birds seemed about to come alive, and he had become a master of realistic painting.

He recently opened a painting exhibition at Daguan Garden. All the paintings were exquisite. They were all sold out within a day, which shows that everyone appreciates them. Even a small piece of silk or paper becomes a treasure. Jiang Zi is almost worthy of it. In this turbulent time, when many people are treacherous and greedy, and painting is often no exception, Hanting can be quiet and self-possessed. Is he not one who "chews on the root and is not stained by the mud"?

Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, the municipal administration of this city has presented a new look. The citizens are united in their expectations for the revitalization of the municipal administration, and the authorities have repeatedly declared their determination. The goals of the officials and the people are exactly the same. However, how to further enable the officials and the people to cooperate and achieve the goals as soon as possible is indeed an essential step. This newspaper, on the one hand, will do its best to contribute, and has specially set up a "Shanghai Municipal Administration" column, publishing the authorities' intentions for municipal administration measures, the citizens' demands, the citizens' suggestions for municipal administration measures, and the authorities' demands. In order to communicate opinions, understand each other, and then cooperate together. It will be published every Saturday starting next week. We respectfully hope that the municipal authorities and citizens will write and send articles to this publication based on what they have heard, seen, and what they want to say. At present, the problem of dispersing the population is extremely important. We hope that readers will study and write articles on how to plan and how to promote it. Once published, we will send a small remuneration.

### Lieutenant Commander Shioda Talks About Three-Dimensional Naval Warfare: The Japanese Navy Presents a Completely New Look and Achieves Significant Results in the Philippines

Recently, the highly capable elite air force of the Japanese Navy has repeatedly demonstrated great power on Luzon Island in the Philippines, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces. The number of enemy ships lost is increasing daily, truly opening a new chapter in naval warfare. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Lieutenant Commander Shioda of the China Fleet Press Department to inquire about the process of the Japanese Navy strengthening its organization and expanding its power. He graciously provided the following item-by-item answers:

Recent Situation in the Philippines

(Q) What is the latest situation in the evolution of the Philippine battle situation?

(A) The Pacific war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and the center of operations is in the Philippines. Recently, the Japanese Army and Navy fought fiercely against the enemy and achieved significant results, and the battle situation has already been reported, so I will not repeat it. However, the recent battles are slightly different from the past. The Japanese Navy has recently focused on its elite air force to fiercely attack the enemy. Therefore, the current operations are actually battles with the air force as the primary principle.

(Q) Although the Japanese Navy in the Philippines has achieved significant results, it has not yet been able to completely destroy the enemy's ships. Some people think that the Japanese Navy has not been active enough. Why is that?

(A) The Japanese Navy in the Philippines has not yet achieved very significant results. This is a matter of time. It is not entirely true to say that it has not been active enough. It should be known that the Japanese Navy, in addition to ships, also has the most powerful air force, which attacks the enemy day and night. At the beginning of this year, Prime Minister Koiso said: "The current Japanese Navy is not the navy of the past, but a powerful force jointly composed of the sea and air." Based on this point, it should be known that the power of the Japanese Navy is even greater than before.

New-Style Navy

(Q) Could you tell us about the outline of the composition of the modern navy?

(A) The power of the modern Japanese Navy lies in its ability to exert the maximum power of its air force. In the past, in the Russo-Japanese War and the Battle of Jutland between Germany and Britain in the First European War, naval operations relied solely on main battleships and cruisers. Therefore, the weapons used by both sides were limited to various types of ships, and the outcome was determined by the extent of fleet losses. Even in recent years, the naval issue at the Washington Conference focused on the naval power of various countries. As for modern naval warfare, it has gradually become three-dimensional. The organization of the old-style navy has really become useless. The so-called new navy must possess a strong air force in order to be able to control the victory.

(Q) What is the new look of the Japanese Navy?

(A) In order to adapt to modern naval operations, the Japanese Navy has a completely new look. In addition to possessing the powerful power of giant ships and giant guns, it has also participated in the air force with superior power, and its organization is truly complete. Recently, in operations, ships are used to protect sea lanes, and on the other hand, the air force is the main force to launch attacks on the enemy, exerting great power.

Future Outlook

(Q) What are your thoughts on the outlook for the Japanese Navy?

(A) The construction of the new navy, with air force power as the primary task, has already been described above. As for the construction of aircraft carriers, although it is also needed, it will still need to be limited in the future in terms of facts. The US Navy originally focused on giant ships and giant guns, and is now also strengthening its air force power. However, its concept remains unchanged, thinking that it can exclude Japan from the world by possessing a huge navy. This kind of arrogance is not worth laughing at. It should be known that the strength of the Japanese Navy is constantly consolidating. Even if the United States uses all its strength to build ships and attack Japan, the Japanese Navy will definitely deal with it and does not need to be afraid. The fact that the Japanese Navy has repeatedly exerted its power in various places in the Pacific recently and gradually destroyed the enemy's ships can be a clear proof. The Japanese Navy now possesses powerful ships and air force power, and it will be as easy as breaking bamboo to destroy the enemy in the future. (Grace)

### The Glorious Achievements of the Kawashima Guerrilla Unit

The guerrilla unit, composed mainly of the Gaosha tribe, under the command of Major Kawashima Takenobu, waited for the US military to attack on Morotai Island. This guerrilla unit made use of the battle training of Guadalcanal, Az, and Saipan, trained quickly and fiercely, and with the determination to make the enemy shed the greatest amount of blood even if all of them were killed in battle, risked the bombing of enemy planes, unloaded ammunition and food, moved people into the dense forest, and completed the guerrilla posture. The hardships and bravery of fighting in the dark, night-like dense forest area of the island is self-evident.

At dawn on September 15, a US military transport fleet escorted by aircraft carriers suddenly appeared near the east and west banks of the Cape of Gila, and immediately began frantic naval gun fire, followed by the sudden landing of about one division of enemy soldiers, who immediately began construction of the Darha airfield.

The time to exert the true meaning of vanguard attack warfare finally arrived. A part of the Kawashima guerrilla unit immediately attacked the enemy's airfield construction team, and within five days up to the 20th, the enemy army left behind 200 dead and more than 200 wounded, and finally drove the enemy soldiers out of the Darha airfield.

On the other hand, the Japanese Army Headquarters in the Halmahera Island area dispatched the 1st Assault Europe commanded by Lieutenant Nakajima and the 2nd Assault Team led by Lieutenant Iwasaki, as well as the 3rd Assault Team commanded by Lieutenant Kushi to land on Morotai in order to assist the Kawashima guerrilla unit.

After receiving the reinforcements, the Kawashima guerrilla unit, from 1 to 8 October, first destroyed the enemy's positions and facilities near the Rotararamo airfield, and then rushed into the enemy's camp, crushing its intentions. After that, the headquarters again dispatched the first reinforcement unit, which, together with the main force of the Kawashima guerrilla unit, began to attack, posing a great threat day and night, especially after the successful surprise attack on the enemy's encampment near the Piro village 10 kilometers south of Huaxiabobra on the night of October 20, the use of the enemy airfield became increasingly restricted.

In this way, from October 20 to 25, the damage suffered by the enemy army was: at least 600 casualties, 17 barracks destroyed, and more than two covered positions destroyed.

At this time, the newly arrived Morita unit of the Japanese army was waiting at the base to assist Morotai Island. Finally, on November 16, they landed under cover of darkness, and as a result, without losing a single soldier, they joined forces with the Kawashima guerrilla unit, which was outnumbered and continued to fight.

### Song of the Japanese Army Air Force in the Philippines

"You are the Divine Sky Attack Force"

(1) Cherry blossoms compare to men
The butterfly is a virtuous wife
Splendid cherry blossoms
Eight corners under one roof praise famous flowers

(2) Tomorrow leads the charge
The military sword reflects the moonlight
Splendid cherry blossoms
I am also generous like fallen flowers

(3) Japanese cherry blossoms sprout
Blooming in Asia
Splendid cherry blossoms
Play the triumphal song to welcome the dawn

(4) Invincible storm petrel
Coldly ride the long wind
Splendid cherry blossoms
You are the Divine Sky Attack Force

The author of this song is Luo? Unknown. But it sounds very good when sung. In the decisive battle in the Philippines, the young warriors of the Japanese Air Force Special Attack Team, every time they departed, from the unit commander down, sang the above lyrics together with generosity, smiling as they boarded their planes and flew away from the base.

"You are the Divine Sky Attack Force." What a great feeling these warriors must have as they sing a homemade heroic song and go on the expedition! The tune of this song is the prelude to the "Camping Song." But in the last verse, the melody goes down instead of up. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun on the 14th)

Map of the War Zone in Southern China

In mid-last month, the Japanese army in Southern China launched a fierce offensive against the southern section of the Yuehan Railway with a surprise attack, and occupied Zhaoguan on the 24th. At the same time, another part of the Japanese army occupied the Suichuan Airfield and important places such as Chen County and Lechang. At this point, the Yuehan Railway was completely under the control of the Japanese army. This time, the Japanese army's opening of the Yuehan Line not only had the effect of assisting the silkworm in the consistent warfare on the mainland, but also directly enhanced the defensive transportation capacity of the coastline along the South China coast, and made it more active. The Japanese army will be able to deal with the enemy's landing attempt more easily.

### Meat

— Hou Qianli

A'bao, carrying a vegetable basket, returned from the market with his mother. As soon as they entered the door, he shouted:

"Come and see, Mom bought meat today!"

So the children, like a gust of wind, all squeezed into the kitchen. The four children surrounded the table, their eyes wide, staring at the basket. Their mouths were chattering.

"We're eating meat today!"

"Mom, how are we going to cook it? How about braising it?"

The mother's anger flared up.

"Haven't you ever eaten meat before in your previous life? Go away! Hasn't anyone ever seen meat? Why are you making such a fuss?"

Then she dragged a thin strip of meat from the basket and threw it hard onto the table with a "thud!"

The children didn't dare to speak, but still stared unblinkingly at the strip of meat.

"All of you, get lost! If you stand here, you won't get any to eat later!"

But the children still didn't move, as if they already knew this was just a threat.

"Did you hear? — Hey! Bingyan, come and scare these little worms!"

Mr. Dong Bingyan was lying in bed reading the newspaper, so he stood up.

As soon as the children heard their father's footsteps, they all ran inside in a puff of smoke.

The father went to the kitchen instead.

"How much is this?" he pointed to the strip of meat on the table.

"Half a catty. Three hundred dollars! Really, what's there to eat?" His wife was cutting the meat into small pieces.

If it weren't for the fact that today was Sunday, and also Mr. Dong's birthday, she really wouldn't have spent three hundred dollars to buy half a catty of meat. Even this time, it was Mr. Dong who suggested it first.

"Here's five hundred dollars." Last night, just before going to bed, Mr. Dong suddenly took out a few bills. "Buy some meat tomorrow for everyone to eat. The children haven't had any meat in a long time."

"Don't bother eating it." His wife didn't agree. "Didn't you say you wanted to buy a pair of socks?"

But Mr. Dong's mood was particularly good because it was his birthday.

"The socks can wait. Besides, this is extra money. We closed the books late, and everyone in the bank got a bonus. Buy some meat, and something else too, braise it, perfect."

And so, when she went to the market today, the wife, unusually, cut half a catty of meat.

The children were greatly excited. Even though they weren't allowed in the kitchen, they still stood at the doorway with great curiosity, secretly watching how their mother was preparing it, their mouths still chattering:

"Oh! It's already half past eleven!"

"Mom, what time is lunch?" Mao Tou asked.

"There won't be time to braise the meat!"

"Nonsense! There's plenty of time. It's okay to eat a little later, what does it matter?" The little sister said like an adult.

"Mingming is starving to death," A'bao said.

"I'm not starving," Mingming said, showing he did not care: "What's so special about eating?"

But after a while, he couldn't help but ask:

"Little sister, guess how much meat there is today?"

"Three catties!" Little sister guessed.

"Half a catty!" A'bao shouted. "Three catties? What are you dreaming of?"

"A'bao, what do you like to eat?" The older brother, Mingming, asked. "I like to eat meat skin!"

"Meat skin." A'bao disagreed. "It's awful! I want to eat the fatty part!"

"I want to eat the lean part," the little sister said. "Lean meat is better than fatty meat. Fatty meat is all oil, what's the point?"

"I want to eat big pieces," Mao Tou also chimed in.

"Oh, it's not ready yet!" Mingming became anxious. "It's already twelve o'clock."

Waiting and waiting, they finally made it to lunchtime. The children were busy again, busy setting the table, serving the rice, and running back and forth. Letting the adults know they were busy helping with the meal.

The mother brought the meat over, and Mao Tou and his little sister followed behind, shouting like messengers:

"Oh! The meat is here, the meat is here!"

The whole family sat down around the table. On the table, placed in front of the father, was a bowl of braised pork.

"Mom, how many pieces does each person get today?" A'bao asked hopefully.

"Eat, eat, eat!" The mother scolded. "Just eat! Don't look so poor. … It's better to be poor in life than to look poor! I hate this kind of look, as if you've never eaten meat in your entire lives!"

The children looked at their father and mother, only caring about eating their rice mouthful by mouthful, not daring to reach for the meat.

Mr. Dong Bingyan, seeing this, really didn't feel very good. Things were expensive, making the children look so pitiful, they didn't even dare to eat the vegetables.

He picked up a piece for each of the children and put it on their rice.

Mr. Dong suddenly remembered when he was little, how happy he was. He ate meat every day, and his mother made it especially for him. He remembered that he wasn't like these children now.

"Meat is so rare now," he said to his wife and children. "Back then, we didn't even want to eat meat. I often said, 'Mom, let's eat something else, don't just eat meat.' The next day, the family would kill a chicken. Meat, no one really wanted to eat it. It was for the servants to eat."

The children listened enviously to their father's good fortune, thinking, I wish I had been born back then.

Suddenly—

"Ah, ouch!" A'bao shouted.

"What's wrong?" His father looked at him.

"Mingming hit me!" A'bao looked at the brother who was only one year older than him.

"He already ate one piece of meat." Mingming recounted A'bao's crime. "He wanted to take another one."

"I didn't take any meat." A'bao defended himself. "I went to get 　　."

"You're still lying, I saw it with my own eyes." Mingming even made a face. "Shameless."

"What do you mean shameless? You yourself!"

"Stop arguing!" The mother threw the bowl onto the table, her face darkening. "Listen to yourselves, what are you like?"

The children didn't dare to speak again.

Mr. Dong suddenly felt a wave of sadness.

He felt that it was all his fault as a father, making the children so greedy. But who could he complain to? A few years ago, although his salary wasn't this high, he could still buy some meat every Sunday. During the New Year and holidays, he would let the children eat their fill. And they never made such a fuss about eating meat, as if they were eating some kind of delicacies.

"Really," he thought, "what does eating such a small amount of meat even matter? It's not like we're eating anything good."

The wife was stirring the dish, picking out the few pieces of meat from the bottom of the bowl, piling them in front of him, and then looking at the children.

The children immediately lowered their heads and ate their rice heartily.

"What is this even supposed to be?" Mr. Dong thought, feeling truly sad. "These days, not only are the children greedy, but the adults have become stingy too."

So he picked up the meat slices that his wife had piled in front of him and gave each child another piece on their rice bowl.

"Dad, you've had enough. We don't want to eat it," Mingming said sensibly.

"You eat it!" Mr. Dong was tearing up inside. "I eat at the bank every day, and I can still eat a piece or two."

The wife smiled bitterly beside him.

The children were delighted. Mingming immediately swallowed the piece of meat in one gulp. A'bao, as he always did, bit it into many small pieces, eating them one piece at a time. The third one, the little sister, buried the piece of meat at the bottom of her bowl, planning to swallow it in the end. Or maybe she could keep it in her mouth, until she had to swallow it.

As for Mao Tou, the youngest boy, he took a bite of rice, put the piece of meat in his mouth, licked it, and then spit it out. Then he took another bite of rice, put it in his mouth, licked it again, and spit it out…

Because of this, laughter erupted at the table.

"It's so dirty!" A'bao said. "He even licked the snot into his mouth."

But Mr. Dong wanted to cry when he saw it. He thought about how cruel he was being to his children, just like the people in this world were treating him. He was giving the children meat, like a philanthropist. But he wasn't even letting them eat their fill. Poor things! Each person only got such two tiny pieces, and they had to look at their mother's expression so many times.

Thinking of this, he really wanted to hug his children and cry, or immediately buy another ten or eight catties of meat and let them eat their fill.

Wasn't that so? After finishing the meal, Mao Tou ran up to him and asked seriously:

"Dad, when are we going to eat meat again?"

The father picked up the child, his eyes a little wet.

### Sand Grain

— Ye Ma

Walking through the wind-swept street, I felt weary of life.

People all raised their sleeves, blocking the sand in front of their eyes, afraid that the sand would cloud their vision.

I dragged my tired feet, opened my sore eyes, and after a day of life's battles, walked through the sand-swept street at dusk, returning to my place of rest.

A grain of sand blew into my eye, catching me off guard.

I felt a slight sting, rubbed my eye with my finger, and tears came out. The sand grain still stung my eye.

So, I had to stop at the intersection, rubbing my eye hard with my finger, trying to squeeze the sand grain out with tears. But it was no use, my eyes were instead blurred by tears.

"I can't stay here, I have to go."

Night had already spread into the heart of the street, if I didn't leave, it would be even later. I rubbed my eye, ignoring the stinging of the sand grain, and walked back onto the path of life.

The street was swept by a sky full of sand.

### Plum Blossom

— Mo Zhi

The street is swept by a sky full of sand.

Mo Zhi

I wish to be a plum blossom,

Bones like ice,

Fragrant and rich,

In this harsh winter day,

Sparse shadow stands alone,

Striving to welcome the new year.

Snow flies,

Putting cotton wadding on the plum blossom,

Increasing the cold,

Strengthening its courage,

Its heroic posture is even more vigorous.

However,

Snowflakes are calm,

Flying over,

Only a moment of warmth,

Quietly saying goodbye.

The plum blossom remains firm,

Bones and branches rugged,

Pitying its own shadow.

The cold fragrance is permanently released,

Red petals are all withering,

Wishing to transform into spring water, and disappear with the snow.

### Three Basketball League Matches, Excitingly Presented: A Discussion of Tonight's Great Battle Between Zhongbei and Hualian; Commentary on the Hualian-Shantou Match

— Mei Jie

The Zhongbei and Hualian teams are jointly ranked champions in the Shenbao Cup basketball A group. Therefore, the question of which of the two teams is truly stronger is of great interest to the general fans. Now, the last match of the first round of the A group in the third basketball league will be held tonight at the Xiqing Gymnasium. Both Zhongbei and Hualian will meet with the honor of having won all three of their previous matches. Thus, this highly anticipated competition is bound to be an unprecedented spectacle. To maintain order more easily, the authorities have significantly increased ticket prices, which is a necessary measure and not something to be criticized as going against the general principle. To increase interest, I will briefly describe the recent situations of both teams, as well as the lineups and tactics they should adopt. This is for the reference of both teams and to provide talking points for the fans.

Bao Songyuan Helps Zhongbei's Lineup Complete, Recent Condition Good

After Zhongbei defeated Hualian in the Shenbao Cup, their enthusiasm for basketball doubled. As they joined the third league, they practiced very diligently. Therefore, the recent condition of each team member is said to be good. After the temporary suspension of the Huaying team, Che Yaoan and Tan Yongzhan successively joined Zhongbei. Now, Huaying's main player, Bao Songyuan, recently came to Shanghai from Suzhou and also returned upon hearing the news. It is felt that Bao's style is very compatible with the Northern style. Thus, Zhongbei's lineup can be said to be complete. Zhongbei currently has sufficient energy in its players, so they have mastered the art of targeting opponents with their tactics. Their positioning is familiar, and their movements are habitual. Therefore, they should still have an outstanding performance in this battle. Considering the arrangement of their lineup, I think it should be as follows:

Zhuo Guorong Bao Songgang Chen Xuesong Shen Yugong Li Zhenzhong

The reason I advocate for this lineup is that, on the one hand, it is indeed the most ideal. On the other hand, it also has the effect of restraining the opponent's players. Except for Yugong's left forward position, which cannot be changed, Xuesong should be the center. This is because Hualian's center, Wu Chengzhang, has the talent to lead and assist, is young and strong. With Xuesong's sufficient stamina and experience, he can fight him to the end, with at most mutual sacrifice. This would actually benefit Zhongbei and cut off the opponent's connections. Zhenzhong guards the black player Bert, and has had exceptional results. However, if Hualian uses Jiusheng as a left forward, then Bao Songyuan can be tried. Bao's ball skills are skilled and his body is agile, so he may also be able to suppress Jiusheng. Furthermore, with Zhenzhong as the forward and Qian Shang as another main brain, the offensive can be increased considerably. Zhuo Guorong should be given a heavy responsibility, as the opponent's right forward, Bert, is good at dashing and is brave. If Binzhong guards him, he will inevitably suffer from fouls. A-Zhuo is short and can easily stop his dashes. Therefore, I think we should definitely start with this lineup. If it goes smoothly, so be it. If not, Baozhong and Yalin can be substituted at any time. Fortunately, with Captain Wang and Instructor Dai's good strategies, we can definitely see their attempts at adapting to the situation.

Hualian Will Definitely Seek New Developments in This Opportunity to Avenge Their Defeat

Hualian is eager to avenge their defeat in the Shenbao Cup tonight. Team leader Zhang Weixiang believes that man-to-man marking must be adopted, otherwise it will be difficult to win. However, using man-to-man marking requires players with abundant stamina to cope to the end, so he suddenly tried a new lineup. Apart from center Wu Chengzhang, all other positions have been adjusted. This proves that Zhang's mind is clear and he is not comparable to those who are conservative. On the other hand, it can also be seen that Hualian has many talents. Otherwise, without talent despite the intention to adjust, one would feel at a loss. As for the lineup they will use today, I can propose two lineups:

(1)

Fan Qinggong

Zhang Liangxiong

Wu Chengzhang

Xu Jiusheng

Bert

(2)

Bert

Qu Xilin

Wu Chengzhang

Xu Jiusheng

Fan Qinggong

The so-called first lineup is what the team used when fighting the Shantou team, which felt flawless in terms of cooperation and control. It is necessary to continue using it. However, I believe that to fight Zhongbei, considering the opponent's talents and playing style, I dare to contribute the so-called second lineup. Wu's center position is not discussed. With Yugong's experience and unpredictable moves, although Liangxiong's recent condition is acceptable, his height, elasticity, and familiarity with Yugong's playing style are not as good as using Xilin. Using Bert as a left guard is to restrain Zhenzhong. Lan Zhenzhong has worked hard to suppress Bert, so who says Bert cannot fight Zhenzhong? An eye for an eye, this is the time. Using Jiusheng as a forward is because Jiusheng has improved. Even if the opponent is Bao Songyuan, there is no reason to give up eating because of choking. Moreover, Jiusheng's angled shots are a threat to Bao's strength. Using Fan Qinggong as a right forward is because Zhuo Guorong may not be familiar with Qinggong's playing style, which may lead to unexpected success. In conclusion, the so-called lineup (1) is generally what Hualian is likely to use. The so-called lineup (2) is what I hope for. What will team leader Zhang Weixiang do? But I believe he will definitely have newer developments to satisfy us.

Commentary on Hualian's Tense Victory Over Shantou

In this past Wednesday's match between Hualian and Shantou, they performed incredibly. Both sides used tight man-to-man marking, so the battle was tense every minute. It was truly a rare good game in recent years.

Zhang Weixiang's Keen Eye Recognizes Heroes

The focus of the commentary is to first admire Zhang Weixiang's keen eye. We can recall that when Beixing远征沪上 [This likely means the Beixing team made a long journey to Shanghai], Zhang recruited Fan Qinggong. At that time, Fan's performance was not outstanding. After joining Hualian, he did not have any special achievements either. But in this battle with Shantou, Zhang had Fan guard Lin Weiting. Since Lin was the source of Shantou's points, Zhang entrusted him with this important task. Lao Fan played to his full potential, causing Little Lin to be tightly bound. The main reason for Shantou's crushing defeat was the lack of scorers. Thus, Qinggong is a basketball hero, and Zhang is truly a man with a keen eye for recognizing heroes, a fact that must be trusted by the public.

Xu Jiusheng Has Made Significant Progress

Jiusheng has not been heavily used in recent years. In the previous league, he was always listed as a reserve. This time, after Zhang tried him out officially, he worked hard and diligently, improving rapidly day by day. He has regained the heroic spirit of his prime. His angled shots rarely miss, which is similar to Shen Yugong's right-handed magic. Shantou failed to find a way to stop him, so Jiusheng was able to do as he pleased, scoring repeatedly and securing the victory. However, Jiusheng is easily impulsive when guarding people, which leads to fouls. Therefore, in the match with Shantou, he could not escape the disaster of being penalized four times. He should use his intelligence to avoid this.

The above two points are the main reasons for Hualian's victory over Shantou. The rest can be attributed to the spirit and effort of the whole team, which does not need to be repeated.

Shantou's Defeat Was Due to Lack of Experience

Although Shantou lost, their sudden use of man-to-man marking was a successful attempt. Moreover, they used a lot of bumping, which is also commendable. There is a reason why they were able to pose such a threat to Hualian. The key to their failure was still a lack of experience. At the beginning of the match, everyone except Ma Canxi seemed flustered. Therefore, they lost a lot of points in the first half. They gradually calmed down later, catching up step by step. In the end, they lost by a small margin due to the greater points they had lost previously. This result is enough to be proud of. Given more time, I dare to say that Shantou's rise to prominence is beyond doubt.

Record of the Boxing Battle

Last Sunday's Sino-Western boxing match unfolded a stimulating and astonishing blood battle scene. Before the match, each boxer stood in one corner of the ring, and the announcer loudly announced the names, nationalities, and weights of both sides. Afterwards, the referee introduced both sides with a very polite handshake and checked for any concealed objects in their leather gloves. As the bell rang, the peaceful stage immediately became a narrow alley for close combat.

Li Peigen Knocked Down

The most unexpected thing about this boxing match was Li Peigen's being knocked down. This greatly disappointed all the Chinese spectators. Beforehand, it was said that he was working very hard to train. However, in the first round, he was hit in the head by his opponent, Victor, and shook before collapsing on the ropes. At the same time, he experienced strange spasms in his limbs, staring blankly with disappointment, looking like an idiot. Li's attacks were quite swift and powerful, but he was brave but lacked strategy. He did not know how to guard his weaknesses, especially his head, which was too fragile and could not withstand a sudden attack. We know that he is an amateur performer, but such a weak blow leading to a fall was really unexpected, because Victor is known to be a mediocre and low-energy fighter.

"Knockdown" results in the most point deductions in boxing regulations. Unexpectedly, three groups of people created "knockdown" records in this boxing match. Li Peigen is one example. Another group is Wen Nuogu knocking down Italian-Overseas Chinese Danili Sheni. Judging from Danili Duni's past record, he can be said to be a "long-term loser." It is rare to see his outstanding fighting posture. Perhaps the weather was too cold that day. As soon as he took to the ring, before he could show a few moves, he sprained his foot, and the pain brought tears to his eyes. It seems to be a cause and effect relationship with the "knockdown." However, the name Danili Sheni will soon be forgotten in the boxing circle. Li Peigen is no exception to this common rule.

It took Rohanstein a lot of effort to defeat Hyvisoff. They fought for six rounds. Neither side was willing to give in, and the battle was wonderful. The competition between Huang Mao Gao Lopif and Filipino Overseas Chinese Shi Weiya was very comical due to the difference in their heights; one tall, one short, their styles were incompatible. The tense atmosphere became unusually relaxed because of the strange sight of the difference in height. Alex Ishf also defeated Seventeen’s He Wei after six rounds of hard work, showing some intense bravery in the process of the battle.

The first battle of the day was between Lin Zhongfu and German Overseas Chinese Xiang Hai. Both of them worked very hard. In the first three rounds, Lin Zhongfu had the upper hand. In the last round, he was almost knocked down, resulting in a draw. The performance was very satisfying to everyone.

The Climax Was Quite Tense

The climax of the great battle was the performance of Polish Overseas Chinese Gada Tandi. With the residual power of his past victories, he knocked down German Overseas Chinese Sam Liugu. Liugu also persevered to the end with his indomitable spirit, which was worthy of admiration by every audience member in attendance. Because they fought a total of ten rounds, which are usually two minutes per round, the climax required three minutes per round, and could not be achieved without considerable strength. In the first two rounds, both sides had their wins and losses. In the third round, Tandi used extremely clever moves to hit Liugu, who fell to the stage. After the referee counted to "nine" (according to boxing rules: after falling to the ground, the referee counts from one to ten. If one cannot stand up after ten, one loses), he stood up again, full of energy, and continued to fight. After such a bitter battle for five or six rounds, Liugu's nose bled all over his face, and Tandi's messy hair fell on his forehead. They completely forgot about humanity and imagined only the consciousness of fighting, fighting and punching. Only the sound of the end bell stopped them. The assistant poured cold water on his head to awaken his confused thoughts. The smell of ammonia rushed into his nostrils, chasing back his forgotten reason. The bell rang again, and the battle resumed. At this point, the division of strength and weakness can be clearly seen. Sure enough, in the final tenth round, Tandi retreated and then advanced, forcing Liugu into the corner, hitting his head with a punch, and he fell to the ground with a bang. This time, Liugu managed to gather the courage to stand up again. Tandi finally won the victory, worthy of the honor of being the Chinese Walter-grade boxing champion.

I heard that the person in charge of this boxing competition stated that Tandi will next fight with Iwamoto to determine who will ultimately win the Walter-grade championship.

### Tidbits from the Sports Scene

There are many standard fans in the public league basketball hall, who come to every game, such as Le Maokang of Wanguo Pharmacy, and Wang Wanggan, an executive of the Green Team track and field team.

The strange screams of cheers and accusations against the referees from countless fans have become increasingly serious, a rare phenomenon.

Bao Songyuan's fancy moves are the most capable of winning fans' support.

The wives of 鐔福楨 [Could not determine English alternative], Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuesong, and Ma Canxi must come to cheer for their husbands whenever they have a game. It is said that they also monitor their actions.

Xie Yiqin sometimes comes to the arena in uniform, because he is the new head of the local self-defense force.

When Wang Yinlan of the Green Team got married, the whole team jointly presented her with a silver basketball, which was extremely unique.
