### Burmese-Japanese Forces Cross the Xi Dan River, Capture Two Important Fortresses, Cutting Off the Enemy's Supply Artery

Mandalay Frontline Base, 31st (Central News Agency) – The forces holding the area near Hlegu, Burma, have been containing the enemy for quite some time, and have been monitoring the two major supply arteries of the Rangoon-Prome highway, hindering the transportation of enemy military supplies. This time, they crossed the Xi Dan River and attacked, capturing the two fortresses of Louga Hill and Myitkyo, coordinating with the advancing western forces, preparing for a pincer attack. In order to strike a heavy blow against the enemy in the Xi Dan River basin, they have now begun to advance, cutting off enemy supply routes along the Burma Road south of Toungoo, causing heavy losses to the enemy. After the Japanese forces began their new movements, the enemy bombed the bridges most vital for transportation at a point fifteen kilometers north of Toungoo, creating a state of great chaos. In order to reverse the course of the battle, the enemy withdrew the heavily damaged 15th Division to the rear and redeployed the 7th Division to replace it, also dispatching air support for the operations.

Editorial

### Reflections on Restoration Day

Today, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the National Government, with the assistance of allied nations, took over the Shanghai Concessions, and the concessions in other places such as Tianjin have also been recovered one after another. From now on, the term "concession" has become a historical term throughout China. The concessions, which have always been the biggest obstacle to China's independence and freedom, and which have always been the biggest basis of unequal treaties, no longer exist. Therefore, the authorities have designated this day as National Restoration Day, so that the people of the whole country will never forget this most glorious memorial day for the nation. In this year's celebration of this day, commemorating the recovery of the concessions has an even more important significance.

For a hundred years, imperialists have used unequal treaties as amulets, relying on all the special rights of the concessions to fuel the internal strife in our country. Due to the existence of the concessions, Chinese troops could not pass through; Chinese law could not protect and punish its own people; China's national industry and commerce could not develop, causing the national economy to fall into the distorted form of comprador capital; and inducing capital from all parts of China to concentrate in the concessions, accelerating the collapse of our rural economy.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to revolutionary struggle, listing the abolition of unequal treaties and the recovery of concessions as the most important and fundamental revolutionary tasks. In his later years, his position on this issue was even more resolute. In his speech at the welcome banquet held by various organizations in Kobe on November 28th of the 13th year of the Republic of China, he sincerely expressed his hope that Japan would help China abolish unequal treaties and recover the concessions. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "If Japan is truly sincere in being friendly with China, it must first help China abolish unequal treaties, regain its position as master, and allow the Chinese people to obtain their freedom. Only then can China be friendly with Japan. After abolishing unequal treaties and escaping the status of slavery, China and Japan can then be brothers again." These words are forever etched in the hearts of concerned people in both China and Japan. After this Greater East Asia War, the entire situation in East Asia changed dramatically. Although the National Government was in a state of war and the people were uneasy, it still tried its best to abolish unequal treaties. And the Allied governments, while focusing on expelling the forces of British and American imperialism, did not forget their original intention to help our country lift its slave destiny. Finally, two years ago today, they helped us recover the concessions, realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong unfulfilled ambition. This further enhanced the mutual understanding between the two major nations of China and Japan and can be said to be the most brilliant page in the history of East Asian nations.

However, when we celebrate the recovery of the concessions today, there are still some things we cannot help but regret. First, the Greater East Asia War has entered its final decisive stage, and our cooperation in the war has not yet reached a satisfactory level of spontaneity. Second, most leaders and patriots in China and Japan with far-sighted vision know that the two countries should join hands closely and strive together to build an East Asia for East Asians. However, some people in Chongqing still cling to the "benevolent assistance" of British and American imperialism and continue to drag out the war, resulting in the painful reality of brothers killing each other in China at this critical juncture. Third, Chongqing is still singing the praises of a general counter-offensive, allowing British and American imperialist troops to come to China to fight. What could be more heartbreaking than this! Therefore, on this Restoration Day, we cannot help but hope that the people of the whole country will face reality with calm reason, and for the sake of the thorough liberation of our Chinese nation and for the sake of building an East Asia for East Asians, we will work with the allied nations for further cooperation, so as to complete our common mission as soon as possible and usher in the day of celebrating the restoration of the whole country and the whole of East Asia!

### President of the Control Yuan, Gu Zhongshen, Passes Away from Illness

Wuxi, 31st (Central News Agency) – Gu Zhongshen, a native of this city and President of the National Government Control Yuan, passed away at the age of sixty-six. In his early years, he followed the Father of the Nation and devoted himself to the revolution. After the National Government moved its capital, he served as President of the Control Yuan as a revolutionary elder, and made many contributions to clarifying official corruption. However, due to his advanced age, his old illnesses recurred from time to time. After the news of the death of former Chairman Wang was confirmed last year, President Gu was saddened by the passing of an old friend, and his illness worsened. He originally resided at No. 133 Shanghai Road, Nanjing, but returned to Wuxi for recuperation on June 29th of this year. He went to Hengshan Villa near Meiyuan for recuperation for a period of time. After being diagnosed and treated by famous doctors from this city, he ultimately succumbed to old age and weakness, and medical treatment proved ineffective. He then moved to the city, and at around 10:00 AM on the 31st of this month, he finally fell into an incurable state. He instructed the county authorities to urgently request Governor Su of Jiangsu Province to come to Wuxi to meet with him and make a will. However, it was too late, and at 11:50 AM on the morning of this day, this national founding father passed away. It is reported that Gu's remains are scheduled to be placed in a coffin on August 2nd.

### Celebrating the Second Renaissance Day, Government and People Cooperate to Overcome Difficulties - Mayor Zhou Delivers a Speech Encouraging Citizens to Cooperate

Today is the second national Renaissance Day. Mayor Zhou delivered a special speech as follows:

### Possesses Epoch-Making Significance

Today is the second Renaissance Day of the Republic of China, and also the second anniversary of the recovery of the Shanghai concessions. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we feel excited on the one hand, and on the other hand, we feel the importance of our own responsibilities even more. Since the Opium War, our country has signed many unequal treaties, opening five ports for trade and establishing concessions, which has fragmented territorial sovereignty and created various abnormal systems. In the past, Shanghai, due to the existence of the concessions, was full of an atmosphere of enjoyment, decadence, extravagance, and evil, and completely became a breeding ground for filth and dirt. For a hundred years, the main reason for the poverty of the people's livelihood and the inability to develop economic construction was the shackles of unequal treaties. The failure of politics to fully enter the right track was also influenced by the concessions. Dr. Sun Yat-sen saw the decline of China and believed that it was necessary to first seek freedom and equality for China. To obtain freedom and equality, it was necessary to first abolish the unequal treaties. This was the lifelong aspiration of the Founding Father dedicated to the revolution, and it was also what all revolutionary comrades strived to achieve.

Since August 1st two years ago, with the special cooperation of our ally Japan, the French Concession and the International Settlement of Shanghai were gradually recovered, and extraterritoriality was abolished. The long-cherished wish of the national revolution was partially realized, the territory was once again complete, and sovereignty was once again unified. Therefore, the central government stipulated today as the Chinese Renaissance Day. The liberation of the nation, the independence of the country, and the autonomy of politics all began with this, and it is indeed of epoch-making significance.

### Shanghai Municipal Administration Completes Unification

After the recovery of the concessions, the diplomatic issues have been resolved, and what follows are domestic political issues. For a hundred years, under the control of Britain and the United States, all the inherent customs and habits of China have changed their original appearance, deeply rooted and difficult to reverse. Governance is particularly difficult. Shanghai, under the management of former Mayor Chen, following the intentions of the late Chairman Wang, first changed the International Settlement into the First District and the French Concession into the Eighth District, in preparation for the unification of the municipal administration. Because the two concessions had been under the control of foreign forces for many years, all systems and habits were different from the city government itself. Instead of abruptly merging them, only gaining superficial unity, it was better to gradually improve and strengthen administrative efficiency in practice, proceeding step by step. After a year, they were merged into the municipal government. All advancements were rapid and smooth. The Shanghai municipal administration truly reached an unprecedented level of unity. This is naturally due to the efforts of former Mayor Chen and all parties, the assistance of our allies, and the cooperation of the citizens, which laid a solid foundation.

### Economic and Security Efforts to the Utmost

On January 15th of this year, I was ordered to come to Shanghai to take over the municipal administration, knowing that the environment was difficult and the task was arduous. But for the sake of the country and the people, I can only do my best to shoulder this heavy burden. At the beginning of my term, I expressed my determination in the "Proclamation to the People of Shanghai," no matter how severe the situation or how difficult the environment, I and my cadres will work hard with confidence, without being perfunctory or concerned about praise or criticism, and make our greatest efforts to reduce the suffering of the citizens and seek their welfare. First, we will eliminate redundant personnel and downsize the organization to simplify administration and strengthen efficiency. On the one hand, we will eradicate corruption and promote integrity. I gave a very detailed report on various reforms at the plenary meeting of the Municipal Advisory Committee on February 18th. In the past six months, many improvements have been made, reaching the expected results. Although we have not been able to succeed in one fell swoop and satisfy the citizens, the municipal authorities will never shirk their responsibilities and are constantly studying effective countermeasures to solve the problems of municipal administration. Now the situation has reached its most serious stage, and enemy air raids are intensifying day by day. Our work is also becoming more and more heavy. In the future, the focus of our administration will be on economic and security aspects, and we will do our utmost. We hope that Chinese and foreign citizens will cooperate as one.

### March Forward in Unity

The recovery of the concessions is the starting point of China's renaissance and the first step in the process of nation-building. However, domestic peace and unification have not yet been realized, and the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. The advancement of municipal administration and the renaissance of the country depend on the dedication of civil servants and the efforts of the people. Everyone must step up their efforts to overcome the current difficulties. The more complex and severe the situation, the closer the connection between the citizens and the government. The government must govern according to public opinion in order to gain the support of the people. The people must be able to understand the situation of the authorities so that national policies can be smoothly implemented. We must only march forward in unity, complete the great cause of reviving China and defending East Asia, so that we will not fail the meaning of the central government's determination to make today Renaissance Day.

### Shanghai Police Department's Recent Police Facilities - Deputy Director Man's Talk on Renaissance Day

August 1st, 1945, is the second anniversary of the recovery of the concessions in Shanghai. To understand the police department's recent facilities, the reporter specially visited Deputy Director Man, who gave a talk on the following points:

### Future Security Issues

Since the recovery of the concessions, the city's police administration has been unified, and security has been increasingly consolidated. All constructions have made progress. However, at this decisive stage, it is even more necessary to ensure security. In addition to emergency cooperation with allied troops, we also strive to improve the quality of our medical officers and intensify academic training in order to fulfill our responsibilities. At the same time, we will strengthen the members of the self-defense corps so that the government and the people can work together and jointly maintain security.

### Crime Prevention Policy

The main point of crime prevention lies in preventing crime, which is crucial to politics and customs. Shanghai is an important city in our country with a special environment and complex people, resulting in endless criminal incidents. Crime prevention work is a very important task. When the bureau promoted it, it made a crime prevention film "Turning Back is the Shore" to be shown in various places. In addition to making people at all levels have a progressive understanding of crime prevention work, it also achieved the effect of cooperative promotion. Now criminal behavior has been greatly reduced.

### Air Raid Protection and Rescue Countermeasures

Recently, enemy planes have been bombing Shanghai for days, and there have been many victims. Rescue and relief work is an urgent task that cannot be ignored. The municipal government recently convened a temporary meeting of bureau chiefs to discuss air raid rescue and relief countermeasures, such as rewarding rescue workers for their courageous rescue, cracking down on hospitals charging high prices for medical treatment, increasing the number of rescue hospitals, planning for disaster relief shelters, and using the city's medical personnel and medical equipment. In addition, people from all walks of life in the city organized the Shanghai Air Raid Relief Committee to coordinate the financial and material resources needed for rescue and relief. In the future, the rescue and relief countermeasures will focus on how to strengthen the existing work to achieve consistency between name and reality.

### Discipline and Discipline Issues

Since Director Zhou took office, in addition to issuing various improvement work plans, he has also paid attention to implementing discipline and discipline, and improving treatment. Now the work of officers and police has been well received by all sectors of society. However, there are still a few people who secretly accept bribes, but once they are found out, they will be severely punished to show a warning. Now we are still ordering the supervisory office to continue to strengthen the supervision work, so as to conform to the police's passive work of not disturbing the people and the active work of ensuring security.

### Treatment Improvement Issues

Since Director Zhou took office, he has focused on reforming personnel, disciplining the police, improving treatment, and strengthening the institution as the goal of his administration. In particular, improving treatment is the only condition for eliminating abuses and disciplining the police. Although the city's finances are tight, he is still working hard to seek the stability of the lives of police officers. Since March, he has increased salaries by more than four times, and each person is given 2.5 to 6 dou of rice per month for free. Officers above the level of shareholder are given confidential expenses or office expenses according to their rank. At the same time, he expanded the police welfare society and strengthened the procurement work as much as possible to distribute cheap daily necessities. Later, in view of the sharp increase in prices, he increased the salary again from July, which was more than eight times higher than in June, and the lives of ordinary police officers were stable.

### Strengthening Traffic Control Personnel Completed Yesterday - Hope Citizens Abide by Traffic Order

In order to thoroughly rectify traffic order, the Municipal Police Department implemented a strengthened traffic control week from the 5th to the 31st of this month. Together with the military and constitutional authorities and the Baojia self-defense corps, it cooperated in directing traffic and cracking down on vehicles and pedestrians violating regulations at major and minor intersections every day from 8:30 AM to 10:30 AM and from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Since its implementation, road traffic has been improved day by day, and the task was completed at 7:00 PM yesterday. The bureau expressed its special thanks to the military authorities and the Baojia self-defense corps for their cooperative spirit, and at the same time sincerely hoped that citizens would strictly abide by traffic regulations in the future to maintain traffic order and ensure safety.

### Traffic Control Day Every Wednesday

The bureau has also stipulated that every Wednesday in the future will be "Traffic Control Day," and the methods will be the same as those implemented during the strengthened traffic control week. The police corps will cooperate in the duty, and the Shan Baojia self-defense corps will assist. The traffic section of the Second Division of the General Administration will organize patrol teams to inspect and guide and supervise the work of various branch offices.

### Yangtze River Reopens to Navigation

The liners sailing on the Xigang, Xinshenggang, and Zhanghuanggang ports on the Subei line of the Yangtze River have recently been stipulated by the China Shipping Company to be dispatched by the agency to resume navigation. They will run in shifts from today, carrying both passengers and goods. The import of agricultural products from various places in Subei to Shanghai has always relied on shipping as a means of exchange. The resumption of navigation will greatly facilitate the source and transportation of materials in Shanghai and benefit people's livelihood.

### Air Raid Relief Association Subsidizes Injured Patients; Disbursements Begin Immediately Through Medical Team

Following repeated air raids on the city, injured refugees are seeking treatment at various hospitals, facing extreme financial difficulties. The Medical Team of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association's Air Raid Relief Association, after its first meeting, immediately dispatched personnel to various hospitals to investigate the actual conditions of relief efforts. As of July 28th, it is reported that the total number of hospitalized injured patients in various hospitals is approximately 300. To ensure that donations reach the injured promptly and to assist hospitals, the Medical Team will provide a daily cash subsidy from the Welfare Association for each hospitalized air raid victim. Those who have undergone surgery will receive 50,000 yuan, while others will receive 20,000 yuan, starting from the day of admission. However, this subsidy does not apply to patients in first or second-class wards. Furthermore, the association will not provide subsidies to those who receive subsidies from other sources or who voluntarily decline assistance. These subsidies will be distributed by the Medical Team immediately, and detailed procedures are being finalized. The method of subsidizing injured outpatients is also being determined in the detailed procedures. Hospitals are requested to apply to the Medical Team immediately after receiving injured patients. If Medical Team personnel visit the hospital for investigation, they should be provided with necessary facilitation.

### Money Shop Increases Interbank Lending Amount

The United Reserve of the city's money shop industry has been handling interbank lending operations for its major member money shops to timely address the urgent needs of the industry. The amount per shop has always been very low. Subsequently, due to the actual needs of the industry, it has been repeatedly increased, from one million to two million yuan, and then to three million yuan per shop. However, with the current increase in demand and the vast scale of business operations, the interbank lending limit in the district seems too small. Therefore, the Money Shop Association recently requested all member money shops to increase the amount to protect the smooth operation of the industry and meet current needs. The Money Shop has already followed the association's notification and passed the decision through the Board of Directors and Supervisors. Starting from August 1st of this year, the lending limit per shop will be increased to ten million yuan. The increase will be strictly controlled, and the basic amount will still be three million yuan per shop.

### Mr. Chen Gongbo Donates Book Proceeds to Support Education, Named "Cold Wind Collection Team"

Mr. Chen Gongbo has been extremely enthusiastic about donating to this newspaper's scholarship fund in the past. He has generously donated the proceeds from the sale of his new book, "Cold Wind Collection," totaling 10 million yuan, to establish the "Cold Wind Collection Team" honorary team. Mr. Chen previously established a scholarship to support university and vocational students, with remarkable results. This time, he has again generously donated a large sum to benefit impoverished students and cultivate talent for the country, which is truly admirable.

### Compensation for Losses Donated to Scholarship Fund

A letter from Ti Yanliao Raw Material Store states: "We are writing to inform you that on March 26th of last year, our store purchased one load of Non-Fading BB Ocean Blue dye from Yongda Yanliao Store's Jiang Yongguang. Later, it was discovered that the weight was short by eight pounds. After notifying Mr. Jiang, he verified and acknowledged the shortage and agreed to compensate. However, the matter was delayed until now, more than four months later. After mediation, he finally compensated our store 196,000 yuan at the original purchase price. However, at the current market price, each pound is worth nearly one million yuan, resulting in a significant loss for our store. We are donating this amount to the scholarship fund to contribute our meager efforts. Please publish the original letter in the newspaper."

### Inspired to Support Education After Reading Fundraising Appeals

A letter from Wei Lidui, a clerk in the dye industry, states: "Every time I read the articles in your newspaper advocating for various industries to support education, I am deeply moved. However, I am just a small clerk in the dye industry. With the savings from my usual frugality, I am making an effort to donate 100,000 yuan. If this can inspire the big bosses in our industry, those with significant positions and abundant resources, to rise up and generously donate to support education, it would be like a novice showing off before experts. I dare to say that I am casting a brick to attract jade, and I am willing to be a cheerleader for your newspaper."
