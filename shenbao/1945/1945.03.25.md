### Prime Minister Koiso Encourages the Nation

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso addressed the hundred million citizens as follows: "The enemy, America, has broken into our front gate. This is a great calamity unprecedented in history. The current situation can be described as the juncture of the Empire's survival. Therefore, the total mobilization of our compatriots is also today. Based on the principle of military and agriculture as one, and all citizens as soldiers, the hundred million citizens should arm themselves to defend the divine land to complete the great task of the eternal and boundless Empire. To break this critical war situation, we can only rely on the inherent strength of our country's thousands of years of tradition. Therefore, unless the nation unites to strike the enemy, there is no better solution. The government has decided to organize a National Volunteer Corps and adopt measures to strengthen defense and increase production based on the principle of serving the country with our lives. At the same time, in an environment of urgent circumstances, we are prepared to take up arms to kill the enemy and defend our homeland. Through this organization, all citizens stand as one to carry out the war, serve the country with their lives, and establish a system of certain victory. Of course, defending the homeland is not just about taking up arms to kill the enemy. We should also redouble our efforts in military production, food production, transportation, and other rear-area tasks. The effects gained in defending the homeland in this way are also significant. As long as the entire nation steps forward to complete the country's urgent tasks, no enemy is to be feared, and great combat power and strong defense capabilities can be generated. I have great faith in the steadfast spirit of the people to overcome this difficult situation. If the entire nation contributes all its abilities to the country to the maximum extent, it can fulfill the mission of protecting the Empire. In short, all hundred million compatriots, regardless of gender or age, should unite and be members of the defense, sacrifice personal interests, engage in production, and bear the heavy responsibility of defense to eliminate selfishness and serve the public, and then the combat power of certain victory will be enhanced, and the road to victory can be expected soon."

### If the Enemy Attacks Again, We Will Surely Deal a Head-On Blow: Director Kurihara's Statement

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Navy Press Department Director Kurihara, after the announcement of war results by the Imperial Headquarters on the 23rd, issued the following statement: "The Japanese military's strike on the enemy's mobile task force was extremely significant. This result was bestowed by the Emperor and the result of the brave fighting of the front-line soldiers. I am grateful beyond words. From the perspective of modern warfare, it can also be said to be the result of the total power of one hundred million citizens. However, the enemy mobile task force that attacked today is not the enemy's full strength, and although the strike we inflicted on the enemy was significant, it was not decisive. Judging from the current situation, the enemy will attack again in the future. If the enemy attacks, we can only unleash the total power of one hundred million people to deal the enemy a major blow. Currently, the morale of the front-line soldiers is high, from the highest commander to the lowest soldier, all are fully capable of seizing the opportunity to deal the enemy a head-on blow."

Comparable to the Taiwan Sea Battle Results

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The enemy mobile task force that appeared in the southeastern sea area of Kyushu was subject to a preemptive attack by Japanese special attack units and air forces, and then continuous strong attacks day and night for four days, achieving significant results, which have been separately announced by the Imperial Headquarters. Unconfirmed results are still a significant number and are not included. The enemy mobile task force that attacked this time was composed mainly of several aircraft carriers, with considerable strength. However, by the time the enemy mobile task force began to retreat on the 21st, the number had dwindled, which shows that the war results achieved by the Japanese side were actually beyond the scope of the announcement. In fact, the majority of its forces have already been annihilated. On the one hand, approximately 180 enemy aircraft were shot down, which does not include carrier-based aircraft carried by aircraft carriers. Therefore, the number of enemy aircraft that shared their fate with the aircraft carriers must be numerous, needless to say. The results achieved this time in sinking five regular aircraft carriers are comparable to the results of the Taiwan Sea air battle last autumn, and it is a head-on blow to the enemy's reckless attempt to approach the mainland.

### Enemy Carrier Aircraft Continuously Attacking Okinawa

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – An enemy mobile task force appeared in the southern waters of the Japanese mainland on the 23rd, and again at dusk. Approximately 230 enemy carrier aircraft attacked the Okinawa area. On the 24th, carrier aircraft continued to attack the area again from around 7:00 AM.

### Japan Fully Utilizes Hydropower Generation

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of Munitions has designated March to June as the period of abundant water volume. In order to supply the current needed by important industrial sectors and enhance combat power, it recently formulated the "Showa 20th Fiscal Year Increased Production Plan for Self-Generated Current During the Abundant Water Volume Period," specifying important industrial factories to concentrate on consuming residual current. Recently, the water conditions have reached a record high. If abundant hydropower can be sent to various places, it can save important strategic resources such as coal, gas, and other fuels.

### Based on the Three Major National Policies at the Time of Returning the Capital: Seeking Survival in Struggle: President Chen's Instructions to Personnel of Various Institutions in Zhejiang Province

Hangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) – During his inspection of resistance efforts, President Chen gave instructions to the working personnel of Zhejiang Province's institutions. The original text is as follows:

"Governor Xiang, fellow comrades, I am here in Hangzhou today for inspection. After inspecting the party, government, and military institutions, and listening to the reports of various leaders, I am now talking to you all, and I feel very gratified.

It is only a few days away from the fifth anniversary of the return of the national government to the capital. Today, I will simply talk to you about the national government's policies and the direction of future efforts.

. The National Government's Policies Remain Unchanged.

The situation is now very urgent. Let us recall the national policies of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building that Mr. Wang Jingwei revealed five years ago. In simple terms, the content of these three principles is to take peace to obtain China's freedom, to use anti-communism to achieve China's unification, and to use nation-building to consolidate China's independence. These three principles have not changed to this day, and will not change in the future until the completion of China's freedom, unification, and independence, and then undertaking the task of East Asian construction.

In the five years since the return of the National Government to the capital, comrades have worked hard to strive for these three major goals and have achieved considerable success. This is something to be proud of. Do not be discouraged by the fact that it has not yet been completed. If there had been no such five years of effort since the return to the capital, what would China look like today? The vitality of the regions, the people's perception, and the consolidation of the national foundation would not have the situation they have today. Although there are still many things that have not been fully realized, for example: the alliance treaty has been established, concessions have been recovered, and unequal treaties have been abolished. This has been the desire of China for a hundred years since the Opium War, but because full peace has not yet been achieved, the troop withdrawal issue in the alliance treaty has not been implemented, which is a great pity. However, the efforts of comrades in the central and local governments in the past have created today's situation, which is very glorious and a great achievement. We must not belittle ourselves. We must understand our position, recognize the value of our efforts, cater to the urgent situation, and strive for China's freedom, unification, and independence.

. The Direction of Future Efforts.

Secondly, I want to talk about the direction of future efforts. How should we proceed? We still need to be based on the three major national policies at the time of the return to the capital, seeking survival in the old struggle. The method of struggle:

First, we must rebuild the Kuomintang. This time, I am also serving as the Minister of the Central Organization Department, and I want to improve the party's organization. In the past, we advocated the unification of party, government, and military, because the party is an organization with doctrines, and politics and military affairs are the means to implement the doctrines. If the party's organization is empty, the government and military cannot cooperate, and the party will not have power. Although there are political programs, politics and military affairs will be separated. Since the Kuomintang stopped electing and appointing representatives, it has been unhealthy, becoming a dysfunctional organization, divided into personal factions, citing private individuals, resulting in a disintegrated organization that cannot command politics and military affairs. Now we must reorganize the divided party, knowing only the comrades of the party and not the private individuals. Therefore, we are now conducting elections, establishing the party's headquarters, and jointly participating in the organization. Only with unity can there be strength, can we command politics and the military, and can we complete peace, anti-communism, and nation-building.

Second, the Communist Party is now very rampant. The New Fourth Army is causing trouble everywhere. Communism is the Soviet Union without a motherland, which is an organization without a motherland. Now that the war is getting longer, the Communist Party is expanding even faster. Anti-communism is our highest principle. To unify China and stabilize people's livelihood, we must be anti-communist.

. Seeking Liberation, Independence, and Freedom.

Third, our country's participation in the war is voluntary and is not influenced by other countries' attitudes, because for a hundred years, British and American imperialism has reduced China to a semi-colony, resources have been plundered, and the people have been enslaved. To seek liberation, we must wage war against the imperialists. Even if our strength is weak, as long as our will is strong, our participation in the war is to overthrow British and American imperialism. We must wage war against all imperialists who have reduced China to a colony. Even if Britain and the United States land in China, our policies will not change. We will fight them to the end. Even if we fail, there will be our second generation and third generation. We cannot seek liberation, independence, and freedom without such a decisive battle.

Fourth, since the return to the capital, I have repeatedly said that the country is built on the people. The survival and development of the country depend entirely on the efforts of all our people. No country can be independent and autonomous by relying on other countries. To revitalize China, we must rely on ourselves. Many people believe that there is no hope for the future, living one day at a time, without invigorating their spirits, nor working for the country. Therefore, there are few achievements in revitalization. When we were young, we looked at history and saw that Fan Zhongyan often took 'the world as his responsibility,' which means that even ordinary people must have a sense of responsibility to the country. Now there are very few people with such a will, wandering around all day long. We must understand that we have policies and doctrines. In such an urgent situation, there is much that can be done. Each of our units, each of our individuals, must unite wholeheartedly to overcome difficulties and overcome the difficulties of the times. The central government and the local governments trust each other and work together for the country.

Comrades, we must understand the national government's policies and how to do things in the future, muster up our courage, and invigorate our spirits. There is great hope for China's future."

### War and Crime

— Omori Hirota

"Punishment is the hope of no punishment," this well-known saying is difficult to realize as an ideal, but all those who administer justice always take this as the highest goal. Hoping for a reduction in crime is a sincere prayer in any era, but in today's unprecedented war, before defeating the current stubborn enemy, in order to win victory, eliminating criminal behavior as much as possible is a major event that everyone agrees on. If there are criminals, in addition to implementing numerous procedures such as prosecution, trial, and execution, they also give people an uneasy feeling. Now is the time to mobilize the total strength of the nation and dedicate everything for the purpose of certain victory. Isn't it despicable to waste time and effort due to crime?

The current security situation in Japan is the most stable among the warring countries, especially compared to the enemies Britain and the United States, there is a huge difference. There are too many examples to mention, but consider that the virginity of Japanese women can be called the best in the world. In contrast, the education of women in Britain and the United States is very poor, so in the rear, concerning the issue of virginity, ugly things are fully exposed, and the inability of Britain and the United States to win will also sow the seeds here. This war, Japan achieved a great victory, on the one hand, it can also be said to be the victory of chastity, this glory of Japanese women will be immortalized in history. In addition, enemy countries' wartime thefts in factories have increased without end. We can imagine that their losses are astonishing, because Britain has had a particularly high number of thieves for a long time. Of course, there are many people who only see the gentlemanly facade of the British and do not know the internal truth, but to be honest, the British are indeed rich in thieving habits. British maids do not steal valuable items from their masters, this is almost never seen. So the most painstaking thing for housewives every day is to be wary of servants. The ancient British records of theft and robbery are really full of pages and endless. In its legal history, what everyone knows is that Britain's decision on the punishment for theft is very strict. Stealing more than five shillings (worth 2.50 yen in today's currency), outdoor robberies, stable horse thieves, and fish thieves in fish ponds were all sentenced to death. This law was enforced for a long time, and it was still implemented even after entering modern times. The very existence of this long-term effective explicit provision, without looking at the number of actual reports, can clearly understand that there are a lot of British thieves. As for the United States, it has long been known as a famous criminal country and a source of evil, which is by no means a groundless accusation. The number of those who have been sentenced accounts for a very large proportion of the total population, far exceeding that of other countries. In addition, the incompetence of the judicial police, the antics of political parties, the arrogance of financial groups, and the opposition between political clans have all become major obstacles to eliminating criminal behavior. The criminals who are shamelessly exempt from the law are known to people all over the world, and in cities they are like carp crossing the river. It was already like this before the war, so in wartime, when life is getting harder, the endless emergence of crimes inside the United States, the shake-up of security, and the embarrassment of the authorities can be imagined.

When two countries use total power against each other, needless to say, the first to meet face-to-face is naturally war. But in addition to military warfare, there is also economic warfare, ideological warfare, and a competitive war to maintain domestic security. To achieve victory, it is necessary to maintain security at a high level with an orderly attitude. A country that can maintain security at a high level is a country that is likely to win. Therefore, as mentioned above, the current security situation in Japan is far better than other countries, but in order to strengthen the firm belief in certain victory, domestic security must be further improved. This means that security should be stable and continue to seek stability, preventing crime before it happens with a bold and careful spirit. Therefore, I respectfully present my humble opinion to the people of the whole country, hoping to encourage each other.

First, do not be misled by rumors and gossip. The longer the war lasts, the easier rumors and gossip become. Even people who are slightly rational may sometimes be deceived by baseless rumors. The enemy Britain and the United States were good at spreading rumors in the last World War. Now, of course, they will still use all their schemes to deal with Japan. The most important thing for the Japanese people is to firmly believe in their beliefs, not to give the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of, and to build a solid Great Wall of psychology to prevent rumors and gossip.

Second, do not abandon yourself in daily life. It is appropriate that life is difficult in such an earth-shattering war. However, recalling the past, our daily life was too luxurious. It would be a big mistake to only be obsessed with the past extravagance and be dissatisfied with today's simple clothes and food. Enduring hardship is also the way to win victory.

Third, you must be open and honest with each other. To unite sincerely and face the outside world together requires internal harmony. In other words, the open and honest and unquestioned opinions in the rear are indispensable elements for winning victory. Enduring suffering together with composure will lead to the bright and brilliant victory in the near future. A chaotic mind will contribute to the crime's stronghold, so it is most necessary to guard against.

Although the above three battles are the most ordinary clichés, they are of great significance in preventing criminal behavior in war. Please think twice about it.

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – The 30th of this month is the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital.

The international position has become more and more elevated, becoming a powerful member of safeguarding East Asia. The capital is launching a week of important promotional events from the 25th to the 31st of this month to commemorate this auspicious festival of the National Revolution's re-departure, so that the people can be more motivated in the midst of enthusiastic excitement, so as to complete the great task of returning to the capital.

### The People Seek Ways to Save the Country Based on Spontaneous Enthusiasm: The People's Representative Conference Is of Great Significance

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since the people of all walks of life in the capital have been worried about the times and suggested that a wartime people's representative conference be convened in various provinces and cities, in order to jointly study national affairs and provide the government with adoption, after the release of this suggestion, the people in various provinces and cities across the country responded enthusiastically with spontaneous enthusiasm, and immediately elected representatives to prepare to attend the meeting. The preparations are now actively underway, and the meeting is scheduled to open in Beijing for three consecutive days from the 28th. At the time of the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, this epoch-making meeting in the history of our people's movement is of great significance. The convening of this conference is purely out of the people's awareness, because the country has the responsibility to protect the people, and the people have the obligation to defend the country. At this extraordinary juncture, the people, in order to take responsibility for the country, and the appeal of their own suffering, rise up in time, and work together to accomplish great things, which is indeed an unshirkable duty. We deeply know that the Greater East Asia War is the last war for the liberation of East Asia. The solution to the Chinese problem and the liberation of the Chinese nation can only be obtained in the Greater East Asia Liberation War. Today, the people can deeply understand the significance of the Greater East Asia War, promote the determination to fight the war, and seek solutions to the Chinese problem based on spontaneous enthusiasm. Therefore, the government authorities have high expectations for this meeting. The representatives of various provinces and cities are all people of high social standing. It is deeply believed that they will be able to understand the difficulties of the times, study carefully, contribute all that they have, and live up to the trust of the people and the expectations of the government. Here we have to say that the problem of China's unification has become increasingly urgent, because the division of power does not help the difficult times internally, and does not seek the way of independent autonomy externally. Therefore, how to promote the realization of national unification is an urgent matter. Also, since the beginning of history, external aggression and internal troubles have stemmed from political corruption. Today, the government is already fully promoting clean politics, but it still needs the assistance and supervision of the people to complete the task of eliminating corruption and building the country.

The licenses of some rickshaws of the company were immediately revoked as a warning. At the same time, the investigation of this matter is still continuing.

In order to thoroughly eliminate the evil practice of gambling, the Municipal Police Bureau has cracked down on the private gambling den of the "Russian Overseas Chinese Association" at No. 147 Weihaiwei Road, and the criminals have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. It is now learned that the bureau has found that some lawless elements often open inns or borrow book dens to gather crowds for gambling, profiting from extracting commissions, and even engage in public gambling, commonly known as "scalper dens," in streets and alleys, which is illegal. Therefore, it has ordered all branches to strictly investigate and suppress gambling and maintain public order. It is also reported that the third unit of the Laozha Branch recently arrested a "scalper den" gambling case.

### Ministry of Education Revises Regulations on Private Universities and Schools

Therefore, Article 10 of the Regulations on Universities and Article 32 of the Regulations on Private Schools have been revised. The Executive Yuan approved an increase of ten times the original amount, and to facilitate the schools' fundraising, they may still refer to the Method for Simplifying the School Establishment Fund promulgated in the 29th year of the Republic (1940) and allow fundraising in installments to provide guidelines for those who run private schools.

### Chiang Shih-yen's Case of Beating a Passenger to Death: The Murderer Has Been Arrested, and the Deputy Station Master of the North Station Has Also Been Arrested

In the sensational case of Hua Tie (China Railway) employee Chiang Shih-yen beating passenger Hsu Pei-wen to death, the municipal government and the Ministry of Construction authorities ordered the police bureau and Hua Tie to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice after the murderer fled in fear of punishment. A few days ago, according to the confession of the concubine's mother of the captured murderer, the police branch of the North Station, led by the branch chief and several detectives from the third unit, went to Hupu Town in Changshu County. After searching for three days, they arrested the murderer Chiang Shih-yen in a certain family's house. He has now been extradited to Shanghai and is being temporarily held at the North Station Police Bureau, and will be transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation and sentencing. It is also heard that Zhang, the deputy station master of Hua Tie North Station, was arrested and interrogated for suspected leniency towards the criminal.

### Port Authority Handles Registration of Civilian Ships

It is also learned that the registration matters are handled by the General Affairs Section of the Bureau. Civilian ship merchants can pay the fees directly, and there are no other extra fees.

### Oil Transported into Shanghai Must Have Proof

The Shanghai District Edible Oil Trade Association was ordered by the Oil and Grain Control Committee to strictly enforce the "Shanghai District Edible Oil Inventory Sales Registration Rules." In addition to the inventory that was completed before August 26 of last year, the sales registration was immediately continued. All registered materials will be issued with a sales registration certificate so that they can be shown to the military and police along the way as proof of legal sales between the same industry. For oil transported into the Shanghai area, such as from Wusong, Liuhe, Chongtai, and Jiangbei ports, it is especially necessary to go through the procedures for obtaining a certificate from the association.

### Readers' Scholarship News: Reminder to Collect Book and Supply Fees

Deadline Set for the Last Two Days, the 29th and 30th

In order to remedy the previous shortcoming of limiting donations and failing to increase the amount of scholarships, the newspaper's Readers' Scholarship Committee decided to issue supplementary book and supply subsidies to scholarship students. From the 12th to the 24th of this month, thousands of scholarship students, from elementary schools to junior and senior high schools, to vocational colleges and universities, were able to receive their subsidies on time. However, there are still a few students who have not yet received them, especially those in the second grade of senior elementary school. It is hoped that the teachers of each school will urge the students to pay attention. The office has now set the supplementary issuance for the afternoon of the 29th and 30th of this month from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. After the deadline, it will be considered a voluntary waiver.

Bargain Market to Be Held Soon: After the charity sale market for relieving out-of-school children, which was organized by four organizations, ended, the remaining goods were decided by the four organizations to be handed over to the YMCA and YWCA for student life relief. The YMCA and YWCA have now decided to sell all the remaining goods at bargain prices, and all the income will be used for student work-study loans. The date of this bargain market is set for April 2nd and 3rd, and will be held in the gymnasium of the YMCA at Baxianqiao. The prices of all goods will be 20% to 50% lower than the market price. In order to give preferential treatment to enthusiastic people from all walks of life, a kind of preferential coupon has been issued, which is sold for 500 yuan, and the coupon can be used as 600 yuan in cash in the market. The coupon can be purchased from the YMCA and YWCA information desk from now until the end of this month. In addition to the above-mentioned preferential coupons, cash will also be accepted at the bargain market.

### Promoting the Qingxiang Work to Ensure Local Security: Director Su Reports at the Regular Press Conference

The ninth regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Department was held in Room 139 of the City Government on the afternoon of the 24th. Director Su Chengde of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau attended to answer various questions raised by reporters from various newspapers regarding the Qingxiang work. After the Q&A session, reporters from various newspapers raised discussions on the poor conditions of blockade management in various places, which Mr. Su explained one by one. The details of the Q&A are recorded as follows:

Policy Guidelines: (1) (Question) What are the current policy guidelines of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau?

(Answer) Qingxiang is a national policy of the government. The current policy guidelines of this bureau are to firmly grasp the good security in the areas that have already been Qingxiang, and further ensure that the local security is effectively guaranteed and becomes more consolidated. For areas where the security situation is poor, the Qingxiang work will be resolutely implemented within this year. Regarding this point, there is already a considerable plan, which will be realized soon. As the Greater East Asia War is approaching the decisive stage, the war effort is becoming more and more important, and the establishment of local security is a prerequisite for increasing production. Therefore, the Qingxiang work is already a part of winning the Greater East Asia War. This bureau can only abide by the national policy and strive to complete our mission under the leadership of the mayor.

(2) (Question) It has been a long time since the end of the third phase of the Qingxiang work in Shanghai. However, it has been found that there are still a few areas that have not undergone the Qingxiang work. What are your plans?

(Answer) Regarding this point, it has been briefly mentioned above. The selection and detailed plan content of the Qingxiang areas in this phase cannot be disclosed to the public at present.

Scope of Work: (3) (Question) The task of the blockade offices in various places where the Qingxiang work is carried out is all the responsibility of the Qingxiang Bureau, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the Qingxiang work. Why is the work of the blockade office in this city established independently?

(Answer) The Blockade Management Office of this city used to be under the jurisdiction of this bureau. Since February of this year, it has been ordered to be directly under the municipal government. Recently, in order to simplify the administrative structure, the municipal government ordered it to be transferred to the Security Command and set up a blockade section. This kind of structural and affiliation change does not affect the promotion of Qingxiang work. The scope of Qingxiang work includes various affairs such as economic blockade. This bureau has the responsibility to plan and deliberate on the above-mentioned various affairs, regardless of how the funds are allocated.

(4) (Question) What is the progress of the political work task of the Qingxiang work in this city?

(Answer) Regarding the organization of political work groups, this bureau was previously ordered by the municipal government to forward the organizational rules of the Qingxiang political work groups in various provinces and cities issued by the Executive Yuan, ordering compliance with them in order to promote the Qingxiang work. After detailed research and discussion, we are ready to start drafting various organizations and budget estimates, which have now been completed and will be submitted to the government for approval soon.

(5) (Question) The Qingxiang work in this city has been completed, but why have the blockade points in various places not been removed? What is the reason?

(Answer) Regarding the existence or abolition of the blockade lines and inspection stations in the Qingxiang areas, it is an entire national issue, and the local authorities should implement it in accordance with the orders.

Eliminating Malpractices: (6) (Question) The obstacles of the blockade lines in various places have long been completely removed. The remaining blockade points seem to have lost the meaning of blockade. All the staff stationed at the blockade points are nothing more than collecting passage fees when materials pass through, which is simply equivalent to the previous "likin," engaging in disturbing the people. Does the authorities know this, and what are the measures to deal with it? Moreover, according to reports from various parties and the reporter's own eyes, at each blockade point, passage fees are openly demanded for non-contraband materials, such as 500 to 700 yuan per pig, otherwise they will deliberately make things difficult, and the people are miserable. On the contrary, if it is indeed contraband, it can still pass through as usual if passage fees are paid. Why does the Standing Committee turn a blind eye to this situation?

(Answer) Regarding the above-mentioned issue, the mayor mentioned the "improvement of the Blockade Management Office" at the plenary session of the Municipal Advisory Committee last month, saying that "the extortion of the people in the past was more than the likin in the past, with heavy exploitation and no standards. The villagers have grievances, but there is no way to complain. We originally planned to completely abolish the blockade, but the negotiations with the relevant parties have not yet been completed. Now we want to reduce the personnel of the blockade office to the lowest limit and increase their salaries, and strictly supervise them. If there are lawbreakers, they will be imprisoned if they are minor, and executed if they are serious, in order to reduce the suffering of the people." The municipal government has now ordered the Blockade Management Office to be transferred to the Security Command and set up a blockade section. At present, we can only follow the mayor's intention and work hard to eliminate the malpractices to alleviate the people's difficulties.

### Small Newspapers in This City Actively Improve Content

In order to actively improve the content and increase the coverage of wartime news, domestic events, and municipal news, small newspapers in this city must publish at least one-eighth of the full page every day, and must publish one-quarter of the page every Monday. For social news, they must follow the model of the Municipal Propaganda Department to select materials, and absolutely strictly prohibit the publication of erotic, abusive, and supernatural content. A preparatory committee for the Small Newspaper Federation has now been established, with Tang Xiumei, Wang Xuechen, Deng Yin first, Wu Bingyong, Mei Youhan, Hu Ligen, and Hu Xiongfei serving as members of the preparatory committee. Tang Xiumei was publicly elected as the chairman. Under the association, a content review committee was formed for improving the content of small newspapers, and Wang Xue. Wu Bingyong. Zheng Mei were elected as review members to be responsible for supervising and reporting violations, and to formulate implementation guidelines. And designated each newspaper to assist in daily cyclical content inspection to improve work efficiency, and submitted it to the Municipal Propaganda Department for record.

### Free Elementary Textbooks: Continued Collection from All Sectors, Gratitude Expressed to Teachers and Students of Donating Schools

The ten free elementary schools established by our office have finalized their locations through negotiation, and employment contracts are being issued to teachers. Enrollment will begin in the coming days. We are also collecting textbooks from all sectors because the students of the free schools are truly poor, out-of-school children. We plan to distribute the donated textbooks to the students to avoid increasing the burden on their parents. This is the true purpose of "free education." In the past few days, our office has received donations from Qicheng Elementary School (500 books), Ningbo Shanghai First Elementary School (1,700 books), Western District Higher Elementary School (over 600 books), Ningbo Shanghai Sixth Elementary School (500 books), Hua Guang Yi Elementary School (224 books), and Mr. Li Yanling (241 books). We express our deepest gratitude to the teachers and students of the schools that have donated textbooks. However, with an estimated total of over 1,000 students in the ten schools, the need for textbooks is still significant. We hope that people from all walks of life will continue to donate nationally designated textbooks for lower and higher grades in Mandarin Chinese, arithmetic, general knowledge, and senior Mandarin Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, nature, etc. Old or new, either is welcome. Books are the spiritual food of children. Those who donate books will find peace of mind, and those who benefit will be eternally grateful!

### Celebrating with Education: Sponsoring Free School Funds

(1) Messrs. Bao Jiu, Ning Wu, Song Yu, Chen Jixiang, Li Qisheng, Lu Shirong, Gu Bingzhang, Tang Minfu, Zhu Yongkang, et al. wrote: "On March 25th, our dear friend Mr. Lü Qizhuang and Miss Hu Xingjue celebrated their engagement. We wanted to celebrate, but considering the current turbulent and difficult times, we dare not be extravagant. We have respectfully gathered 44,000 Central Reserve Bank notes and ask that they be donated in the name of Lü Qizhuang to the "Free School Fund" organized by your newspaper, 'Celebrating with Education.'"

(2) Students Yang Weiqi and Weimei wrote: "We have seen your newspaper's initiative for the Free School Fund and are very sympathetic. We are especially touched by the enthusiasm of many children to help. We are also two very fortunate elementary school students, and we think of how painful it must be for children who cannot afford to go to school. Therefore, this Free School Fund movement is truly needed and urgent! So we also want to do our part. Today is the anniversary of the untimely death of our third sister, Weichun. In remembrance and sorrow, we asked our parents to save the unconscious expenses and put together 5,000 National Currency dollars to donate to your newspaper's "Free School Fund" to commemorate our third sister Weichun. Although this small amount is not powerful, if everyone responds, it will be considerable!"

(3) Mr. Qi Weizhuan wrote: "My son Jinhua is studying at Hua Guang Free Elementary School at 284 Taikang Road. Yesterday, when he came home from school, he told me with great interest about the donation of money and books at his school in response to your newspaper's initiative to establish free elementary schools. After listening carefully, I was deeply moved. Because I was also a person who suffered greatly from being out of school when I was young. Because I could not read, I had to work as an old clerk in a rice store to barely maintain my life. And my son Jinhua had no one to take care of him. Fortunately, the old boss was kind and let Jinhua live in the store. But the problem of schooling was still unresolved. Fortunately, Hua Guang Free Elementary School specializes in accepting poor students and was able to enroll him for free.

But in Shanghai today, life is so difficult, and there are more than tens of millions of out-of-school children. Therefore, your newspaper's initiative to establish free schools is of great significance. Although my ability is weak, I would like to do my part and save 2,000 dollars from the breakfast money of me and Jinhua and donate it to the "Free School Fund" to express my sympathy."

### Free School Fund Donation Report (6)

Yang Weiqi and Weimei jointly 5,000 yuan, Mr. Zhou 1,000 yuan, Lü Qizhuang (engagement celebration gifts transferred to aid) 44,000 yuan, Ma Aqing 2,000 yuan, Wang Zhu family 2,000 yuan, Qi Weizhuan 2,000 yuan, Li Guozhang, Wang Gendi, Wang Xingzhang, Cheng Juying jointly 10,000 yuan, totaling 66,000 yuan. Combined with the previous balance of 1,143,650 yuan. (The donation from all students of Hua Guang Free Elementary School on the previous day, "Hua Guang" was mistakenly printed as "Hua Lao", corrected and apologies.)

### Record of the Japanese Air Force Unit's Operations Against Enemy Submarines

Attacking submarines is not an easy task. Our base is always defending the ocean day and night to prepare for the activities of the American task force. Whenever transport convoys go out to perform replenishment tasks and return, the air force units of our base are breathless with work. In addition, whenever enemy submarines are discovered, pursuing and killing the murderous enemy submarines is truly a modern scientific undertaking. After receiving the telegram discovering the enemy submarine, we immediately dispatch enemy planes to all directions. However, finding it is not an easy task. Because sometimes the enemy submarine implements submerged navigation, and sometimes the weather is bad and it is impossible to search for the enemy.

However, once the enemy submarine is discovered, victory always belongs to us. We carry out lightning-fast bombing and summon our own fighter planes, and hand over the work of destroying the enemy submarine to the maritime defense ships and submarine chasers. Discovering the enemy submarine and determining its location is truly a difficult battle. This mainly relies on radio wave detectors and other machines. The squadron leader of the air force unit often says:

"Our battle must not be blind. If the radio wave detector malfunctions, it is worse than an engine failure. If the radio wave detector malfunctions, we have no choice but to return to base."

Submarine Cemetery

In the coastal waters near our Japanese homeland, there are several places called submarine cemetery seas. The route most frequently traveled by Japanese transport ships is also where enemy submarines most often appear.

At one location, six submarines have been sunk since the second half of 1943, at the second location four submarines have been sunk, and at the third location three submarines have been sunk. At other locations, the number of sunken submarines is also not small. The number of sunken submarines is not only based on eyewitness accounts during the attack, but also on investigations at the sinking location and careful judgment of the enemy's ship type before being announced.

Regarding the special mission of our unit, night flying is especially important. On the dark ocean at night, we use radio wave detectors to detect enemy submarines floating silently.

Attacking Enemy Submarines

Second Lieutenant Arai is an air force reserve student who graduated from Hiroshima Higher Normal School. On the morning of January 24, black clouds covered the sky, and on the sea surface with white waves surging, he discovered a floating enemy submarine. It was a large submarine with a periscope that can be used day and night, and three radio wave detector antennas erected. The enemy was negligent because of the rain, but after realizing that it had been discovered, the stern of the submarine stood up like a rod and immediately began a rapid dive, disappearing from the sea surface in less than twenty or thirty seconds. We then bombed the sinking area and monitored it for an hour, but unfortunately, due to a leak in the fuel tank, we had to reluctantly return to base.

Chief Flight Petty Officer Omukai used to protect convoys at a base in the South Sea. As soon as he left port, he discovered three enemy submarines attacking. He immediately began to attack the enemy submarine that had dived to a depth of fifteen meters. At that time, he used radio to summon Japanese planes that were about to return to base from all directions, and always attacked with bombs whenever the enemy submarine entered or exited the water. At the same time, Japanese submarines also participated in the battle, and finally a large amount of oil floated on the sea surface, which confirmed that two enemy submarines had been sunk.

Chief Flight Petty Officer Murakami once discovered the oil slick of an enemy submarine. The so-called oil slick is the seepage of lubricating oil, etc. In the direction of the submarine's movement, there is an oil slick with a diameter of two or three meters, intermittently floating for ten meters. However, it is very difficult to discover when the waves are large. After discovering this kind of oil slick, the Chief Flight Petty Officer immediately bombed it. Under the sunlight, the shimmering oil slick stopped, but gradually expanded again.

Escorting Convoys

Escorting convoys is a daily task of our base units. In addition to the direct escort by maritime defense ships and anti-submarine ships, there are also planes from base to base, taking on aerial escort like a relay race. On a vast expanse of ocean, it is difficult to find a convoy without being pointed out, but the pilots hover in the sky searching for the convoy that is as small as a bean. On the transport ships, tiny humans wave their hats and wave their clothes to express their gratitude. On the sea where enemy submarines come and go unpredictably, encountering the buzzing Japanese planes often brings tears to the eyes of the sailors. (Translated by Lin from the Asahi Shimbun, March 9)

### Map of the Situation of the Islands in the Southeastern Sea of Japan

From Tokyo to the waters of the Ogasawara Islands, many linear archipelagos are densely distributed, such as the Izu Islands, Torishima, etc., no less than a dozen islands, and the Tanegashima Island, Yakushima Island, Ryukyu Islands, Okinawa Island, Miyako Island and other islands from Kyushu to Taiwan. The Japanese army has established defenses everywhere, taking every step carefully, and the co-defense is as solid as a copper wall and iron fortress. On the 18th and 19th of this month, the enemy American fleet created disturbances in the southeastern sea of Japan. After the courageous attack by the Japanese air force, the enemy suffered many losses. The surviving ships have retreated to the south, and the Japanese army is currently pursuing them.

### A Journey to Dongshan

— Zhao Yishan

On a chilly spring morning, I set out with a pleasant feeling to the station, intending to take a slow train to Suzhou and then transfer to Dongshan. The station was packed with people, all crowding at the ticket windows, so tightly packed that they could barely breathe. The black-capped staff wielded their rattan whips like raindrops, striking anger into the hearts of every traveler, who glared with hatred at the face beneath the black cap, a face revealing fangs and wearing a cannibalistic grin. It was a scene of unimaginable sorrow. I waited like this for a full two hours. The railway bureau then posted a temporary notice stating that the slow train was suspended for the day. The excited hopes of the crowd plunged into the abyss of disappointment, and they dispersed, each carrying a sense of frustration. I learned that the railway bureau's slow trains had been running irregularly these past few days, with no certainty. As I was eager to get to Dongshan and also wanted to see the situation along the highway to Suzhou, I decided to take a bus instead. At the northern end of the New Rubbish Bridge, there were small car companies specializing in passenger transport. Upon making inquiries, I found that all the cars were fully booked for the day. Only a cargo truck could take a few passengers in addition to its cargo. So, for the price of 23,000 yuan, I sat on a truck loaded with cigarettes at 9:30 AM, embarking on my journey to Suzhou like a piece of merchandise.

On the Shanghai-Suzhou Road

The highway to Suzhou had suffered damage along the way due to the war. In particular, there were nearly a hundred wooden bridges leading to Suzhou. Because no one was responsible for repairing them, they were in very poor condition. Some were simply impassable, and even those that could be traversed were extremely dangerous. Most buses to Suzhou took the Jiaotong Road – Yangjia Bridge route, then turned onto Zhennan Road, and directly reached Suzhou via the Kuntai Road. Not far from Suzhou, at Waikuatang, a section of the highway had been impassable a few days earlier, so buses had to take the Xihu Road to Changshu and then to Suzhou. On the day I went, that section of the highway was passable, but when we reached that place, the truck's rear wheels got stuck in the mud. Passengers all had to get out and temporarily act as laborers, unloading the cargo one piece at a time. We practically pushed the truck for a distance before we could reach Suzhou. This delay cost us three hours. I departed at 9:30 AM and didn't arrive in Suzhou until 11:00 PM. It took a full thirteen and a half hours, passing through Zhenru, Nanxiang, Jiading, Waigang, Taicang, Kunshan, Zhengyi, Weiting, and Suzhou. Along the way, there were checkpoints for passengers and goods from various organizations, including the Ministry of Finance's Inspection Office on Zhongshan Road, the Jianghai Customs Zhongshan Road Branch and Surveillance Post, the Ministry of Finance's Inspection Office in Waigang, the Jiading County Hujiaqiao Grand Inspection Station, the Taicang Grand Inspection Station, the Kunshan Grand Inspection Station, the Suzhou Grand Inspection Station, and many other smaller inspection offices. It was literally a checkpoint every three steps and a barrier every five. Cars had to stop at every checkpoint, and the length of the delay depended on the negotiation skills of the person handling it. Along the way, rice prices gradually decreased from Shanghai to Suzhou: 100,000 yuan in Shanghai, 90,000 in Zhenru, 70,000 in Taicang, 60,000 in Kunshan, and 50,000 in Suzhou. There were many "danbang" individuals (carrying poles with goods on each end) traveling between Nanxiang and Shanghai, mostly transporting rice to Shanghai, each carrying about five dou (a Chinese unit of dry volume). Some rode bicycles and could carry a full dan (two loads, one on each end of a carrying pole). According to these "danbang" individuals, they were doing it merely to make a living. The security along the way was good.

The Current Situation in Suzhou

"Above is paradise, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou." This is a saying that everyone knows. Although Suzhou after the incident is not as much of a paradise as it used to be, the fact that rice prices in Suzhou were only between 40,000 and 50,000 yuan per dan when rice in Shanghai was selling for 100,000 yuan per dan cannot but be said to be still maintaining the bliss of paradise. The recent situation in Suzhou seems very lively. Just look at the several cafes that have hired female singers from Shanghai to sing a couple of popular songs in front of a "microphone." A cup of plain tea costs nearly a thousand yuan, yet the seats are still packed. Ordinary teahouses like Wuyuan and Hongxing are also full every evening. Elderly people and young children alike are leisurely passing the time with teapots in hand. People and horses throng Guanjian Street, and the noisy, bustling scene is no less lively than Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Hotel business is booming, and even the most ordinary rooms cost over a thousand yuan per night. Renting a house has become quite difficult recently. Good houses are impossible to find, and even if there are any, they require a "key money" just like in Shanghai. Rent is mostly calculated based on rice prices, usually around one or two dan per month. Recently, due to power restrictions, there has sometimes been no electricity at night, which has somewhat affected the night market. "Horse carriages to Tiger Hill!" are still being called out on the streets. Although there are fewer tourists than before, the carriage drivers can still make a minimal living. In Xuanmiao Temple, there are still many people playing with yellow birds, releasing them with one hand and feeding them with the other, their contented expressions making you forget that this is a world ravaged by war. The leisure and contentment of the people of Suzhou truly make the saying "Above is paradise, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou" ring true.

A Glimpse of Dongshan

Dongshan is an island in Taihu Lake, under the jurisdiction of Wu County. The entire mountain is about 60 kilometers in circumference, with a pleasant climate and fertile soil. The trip from Suzhou to Dongshan involves taking a boat outside Xumen. The boat is towed by a charcoal-powered motor launch, which is not very fast but travels smoothly. The boat company previously only had one company called Baoxing Steamship Bureau, with one round trip between Dongshan and Suzhou each day. The ticket price is 1,200 yuan per person, with 1,500 yuan for meals and tips. Each boat can seat about 300 people. The boat departs at 9:00 AM. Sitting on the boat moving with the waves, the scenery on both sides is beautiful, passing through Hengtang, Xishang, Muli, Hengjing, Pujing, Shitang, and Ducun before reaching Dongshan. At Shihu behind Hengtang, and Baiyang Bay past Muli Bridge, there are two mouths of Taihu Lake. They are vast and boundless, with blue waves stretching as far as the eye can see, but banditry is rampant, endangering travelers. So, it is a little dangerous for boats passing through here. In the past, there had been incidents involving boats here. Recently, when boats pass through, several armed comrades patrol the shore with guns for protection, so there have been no accidents. In Hengjing, there is the Hengjing Inspection Station, but the inspection procedures are not very troublesome. The boat arrives at the front of Dongshan around 5:00 PM. The entire mountain of Dongshan is divided into front and back parts, with Mogan Peak as the boundary. The south is the front mountain, and the north is the back mountain. The total population of the mountain was originally 26,000, but has recently increased to over 30,000. The highest administrative institution is the former 12th District Office, and the current district head is Mr. Zhao Shimin. There are also police stations and security teams. The security situation has been quite good recently. Most of the empty houses on the mountain have been demolished, or only a small part of them remains. There is a lot of vacant land, especially arable land. The busiest streets are East Street and West Street, which can be said to be the commercial center of the entire mountain. The largest business is the rice industry, with several companies such as Tongtaisheng. Next is foreign goods, with several companies such as Jishunxing. Small industries are still lacking. There is no electricity, and telegrams cannot be sent directly. There is one post office, which forwards letters. Rice and grain are entirely dependent on imports from nearby Hengjing, Wujiang, Pingwang, Huzhou, and other places. The quantity is not very sufficient. The current rice price is about 40,000 yuan per dan, meat is over 800 yuan per catty (a Chinese unit of weight, about 500g) by market weight, vegetables are 150 yuan per catty by old weight, and fish is over 600 yuan per catty. Most of the residents on the mountain mainly raise fish and grow fruits. They used to have some good days in the past, but the current situation is not as good as before, so life is very hard. The annual production of the entire mountain includes March tea leaves, with a yield of about 5 dan, May loquats with about 3,000 dan, June waxberries with about 6,000 dan, July ginkgo and chestnuts with about 1,500 dan, and fish and shrimp with about 2,000 dan throughout the year. There is also a famous type of mutton that is very delicious. The production of bamboo and wood is quite abundant, making it very suitable for building houses. There are schools such as Wenchang, Wuben, Zhongxiu, Moli, Xiwu, and Liaoguo on the mountain, but only a small number of mountain residents receive education. The front mountain is more lively than the back mountain, which is a bit more remote. The mountain residents are diligent, thrifty, hardworking, and very kind to outsiders. If some small industries and scientifically managed farms could be established here, it would be a very promising undertaking. After staying on the mountain for several days, the reporter, after observing the situation, very much agrees with Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's proposal to make Dongting Mountain a destination for evacuation.

Evacuation Issues

Just as Mr. Xiang said, it must not be taken as an expedient measure for wartime refuge, but should be approached with a long-term plan. Even after peace is restored, it should continue to be developed and expanded. Instead of taking Dongshan as a temporary place of refuge, it would be more appropriate to take it as a permanent enterprise. Dongshan has abundant production and a good environment. Especially in this time of war, Dongshan, isolated in Taihu Lake, can be considered a secluded paradise. If managed properly, it can easily become a scenic residential area. But before any immigration, there must be a detailed plan to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Currently, there are about 30,000 residents in Dongshan. If, as Mr. Xiang proposed, 100,000 people go there in the first wave, then an average of twenty people would live in one flat, requiring 5,000 flats. The number of empty houses in Dongshan now is very small, so simple flats must be built in advance to accommodate 100,000 people. There is definitely no problem with the vacant land on the mountain for building 5,000 flats. A permanent power supply should be established throughout the mountain, and creating more small industries can solve the daily needs of the immigrants. Cooperating with local residents to run large-scale farms and aquaculture companies can increase the mountain's production. These can all be done as investment methods, which are easier to implement (in fact, this type of investment is reasonable and effective). Currently, most of the residents of Dongshan are engaged in planting and selling. Industry is very scarce, but in terms of the environment, it is definitely not absolutely impossible. Among the 100,000 people, there must be five public hospitals and twenty schools of varying levels. The organization of the post office must be expanded. These must be built with the assistance of the authorities. As for the expansion of administrative institutions and the assurance of security, that, of course, must also be assisted by the authorities for it to be successful. The organization of a civil affairs consultative council is indispensable. Under such a massive new construction, the consultative council has the power to coordinate and promote. A cooperative is an organization that needs to be established. Utilize the differences in the qualities of immigrants to achieve a state of mutual cooperation and mutual development. Currently, the lives of the mountain residents are quite difficult. A method must be devised in advance to coordinate the economies of the mountain residents and the immigrants to avoid friction (historically, large-scale immigration has caused all sorts of misfortune with the existing residents, and this is definitely not something that can be solved with pressure). The food supply on the mountain is not very sufficient, so sufficient supplies must be secured in advance. Fortunately, neighboring counties produce abundant rice. Exchanging materials to obtain sufficient food is not difficult, but the detail and rigor of the planners and executors must not be ignored. As for transporting immigrants and their belongings, a dedicated ship must be determined. Each time, at least 3,000 people should be in a large group, and each ship should have 300 people as a team. A team leader should be assigned to manage the necessary matters during the journey. The ship should sail directly from Shanghai to Dongshan, be equipped with self-defense weapons, and contact the inspection agencies along the way in advance to avoid unnecessary delays and troubles. The travel expenses should be allocated by statistically dividing the along the way expenses, which would be fairer.

In short, because the residents of Dongshan have not improved their production technology, they will become increasingly degenerate. If they borrow the power of immigrants, increase capital, and improve technology, then the production of the entire mountain will definitely increase. Therefore, the main purpose of immigrating to Dongshan is definitely not passive refuge, but active construction!

### Group Walking Evacuation

— Li Ende

At a time when rice is as precious as pearls, firewood as expensive as cinnamon, and all goods are rising in price, coupled with the threat of air raids, evacuation from Shanghai is truly necessary. However, although there are many who are preparing to evacuate and return to their hometowns, many are hesitant due to inconvenient transportation and lack of vehicles and ships.

In view of the lack of transportation and the large number of people who urgently need to evacuate, it would be better to stipulate that women, children, and the elderly have priority in using vehicles and ships, while the general young and strong should automatically return to their hometowns in groups on foot. In the past, during the evacuation from Hong Kong, many people walked in groups, taking detours to reach Shanghai. Therefore, this action is not entirely impossible. But it is inconvenient to walk alone, and there is a lack of care along the way, so it must be done in groups. Here is a brief description of the method:

(1) The Evacuation Committee and various hometown associations should jointly register those who volunteer to evacuate on foot.

(2) Form teams of 50 to 100 people, divided by hometown and county. Each team should have a captain, filled by a capable person. The organization can refer to the travel team method of ordinary school groups.

(3) The Evacuation Committee or the hometown association should send personnel to lead and be responsible for negotiation and protection.

(4) The Evacuation Committee or the hometown association should contact public places, schools, temples, ancestral halls, etc., in advance in important towns along the way to serve as places for rest and lodging. If necessary, temporary reception centers may be set up to receive them.

(5) Those returning to their hometowns should give a certain amount of money to the Evacuation Committee or the hometown association for expenses, the amount to be determined as needed, with thrift as the principle.

(6) Prepare meals along the way in advance, or bring dry food, which each person will take care of themselves.

(7) Bring as few items as possible, but multiple people can jointly hire porters to carry the load, so that they can walk empty-handed, which is more convenient.

(8) Taking the journey back to Ningbo on foot as an example: To go from Shanghai to Ningbo, you can go through Hangzhou, cross the Qiantang River, and go through Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Yuyao to Ningbo. But you can also go from Minhang to Zhapu or Ganpu, cross Hangzhou Bay to Yuyao, Andong, or the upper reaches of the boundary, but the latter is more convenient. However, when crossing Hangzhou Bay, there are places where robbers prey, so military protection is necessary. Along the way, if Minhang is the first stop, Jinshan or Zhapu is the second stop, and Yuyao across the river is the third stop, the lodging places can be determined based on the distance, and Ningbo can be reached in about four or five days.

### The Flute Player

— Sha Ou

My small room faces a noisy street, where there is clamor all day long; children sing, housewives scold on the street, peddlers solicit customers with hoarse voices, and beggars desperately plead… the sounds of the city interweave into a symphony of life. Whether sad or happy, the days always flow by faintly, and naturally a part of me is swept away in it.

In the morning, the apprentices remove the door panels, and the bustling market pours out. In the evening, they put up the door panels, and the sounds of the market are shut inside. At this time, on the dimly lit streets at dusk, an old man selling flutes and huqins plays music.

The loud flute sound resonates in the twilight. Have you ever been alone in your small room and unintentionally heard a girl humming Peking opera tunes along with the music? The lingering echoes make you uneasy in your loneliness, and even worse, they seduce your fantasies. Soon, I declared: I want to be a wandering flute player, I want to play the flute alone in the small streets and alleys. I want to seduce young boys and girls, to make them uneasy in their loneliness, just like that old man, luring children to wander the streets after me.

My grandmother laughed at me for being unambitious. She told me: Many young people love the flute, that clear sound. They play it all year round, and they become thin and weak, withered… If you doubt it, you should split open the flute in their hands, and inside there will be only blood—the heart's blood of young people.

But my grandmother could not suppress my passionate exuberance. Finally, on a street at dusk, I caught up with the old man playing the flute, and I bought a flute from him. I said:

"Give me the best one!"

"Every flute is the same," he replied indifferently. He picked one at random and gave it to me.

After that, the flute consumed my time. I pursed my lips and blew, and I puckered my lips and blew. I inhaled deeply and blew hard, and I let the air out slowly. But the flute remained silent. I began to get angry—surely the old man had deceived me.

So, I chased after him again on the street at dusk. I said agitatedly:

"You're lying. Only your flute can play!"

He didn't answer, but slowly put my flute to his lips; every flute played loudly, and my flute could indeed move people like his.

I felt humiliated. I took back my flute, returned to my small room, and in the twilight, I pursed my lips and blew, and I puckered my lips and blew; I inhaled deeply and blew hard, and I let the air out slowly—I didn't bother the old man again.

By the time I had learned the flute, and people began to feel uneasy because of my flute music, the old man selling flutes and huqins no longer appeared on the streets at dusk.

I played in the twilight, sending the loud flute sound throbbing into the eardrums of young boys and girls… People began to get thin, and people withered! My grandmother's words were indeed true. Finally, I got sick, and in the twilight, I could only hear someone else's flute music resonating.

I caressed my flute, wondering if it could absorb the heart's blood of the flute player?

### Pear Blossom and Crabapple

— Shufang

(I)

Yue, facing the sun, was knitting a woolen thread in front of the window. The school clerk pushed the door open and handed her an invitation card. She took it and saw that the signature on it was: Xin Wancheng.

She quickly recalled a memory. Last week, at the principal's fiftieth birthday, she was introduced to a wealthy businessman, that old man who paid close attention to her. He wasn't too old, but he was approaching fifty.

She couldn't help but feel a little strange. They had only met once, and he was already sending her an invitation. She smiled to herself, thinking, why not! It's a good opportunity. Perhaps this could be the realization of her long-held dream—to establish an orphanage. She happily put the invitation in the drawer.

The next day, she went to the address to attend the banquet. She pressed the doorbell, and a servant respectfully led her to the reception room. Strangely, it was very quiet and there wasn't a single person there. The reception room contained a set of solemn and heavy mahogany furniture, a chestnut-colored carpet, chestnut-colored sofas, and chestnut-colored window curtains. The room lacked sunlight, and the corners were filled with shadows. Yueheng involuntarily shivered. Words like "gloomy" and "somber" rose in her mind like soap bubbles.

She returned to school after having dinner, her expression a bit excited. Bi and Hui, who lived with her, asked her where she had gone, returning so late. Yueheng smiled and held out a hand, a dazzling diamond ring on her finger. Bi and Hui were startled and more urgently asked her what was going on.

"I'm getting engaged soon, to that overseas Chinese businessman Xin Wancheng. In two weeks, I'll treat you to the engagement banquet," Yueheng said calmly and easily.

Bi and Hui had also met Xin Wancheng at the principal's birthday. Although his appearance wasn't necessarily repulsive, he seemed a bit eccentric. And it was said that he was very stingy. Despite being so wealthy, he had never donated a single cent. The principal seemed to have mentioned that he became like this after his wife died. Based on this, Bi strongly advised Yueheng not to be too careless about her life's important matter. The age difference between them was so great that there wouldn't be happiness. Moreover, such an engagement was too sudden and too fast. But Yueheng said that Xin Wancheng had promised to provide the money for her to set up an orphanage. Her long-held wish had been fulfilled, and even if it meant sacrificing her lifelong happiness, it was insignificant.

After getting engaged, Yueheng didn't let up for a moment, urging Wancheng to prepare for the orphanage. Wancheng rushed about, finding a building and buying supplies for her. He hired many people to help prepare for various matters. Finally, three months later, the orphanage officially opened. Yueheng was appointed as the director, with Bi and Hui as her right-hand assistants, managing important affairs. Initially, there weren't many orphans, but later the number gradually increased, showing a thriving spirit. At this time, Wancheng proposed marriage. Yueheng, in line with her consistent style since the engagement, agreed without hesitation.

Having just finished the orphanage matters, she was now busy with the wedding. Yueheng felt that she had lost a lot of weight, but a naturally beautiful person is always beautiful, whether she's thin or fat. If she's fatter, people say she's "plump" or "full." If she's thinner, descriptions like "piteous," "unable to bear silk garments," and other such adjectives are even more pleasing to the ear. Now that Yueheng was thinner, Wancheng said she was more charming and lovable than before.

The night before the wedding, Yueheng felt a bit melancholy. Tomorrow, she would marry a man twice her age. In many ways, she and Wancheng were mismatched and incompatible. She herself wasn't unaware of this, but she was too enthusiastic about her career. It seemed that only today did she have time to think about it. Bi had said that her marriage to Wancheng was just like the line in the poem, "A pear blossom branch pressing down on a crabapple." She thought that everyone would definitely have this feeling tomorrow. She sadly shed tears.

The next day, Yueheng dressed up like a fairy. She heard nothing but words of praise. Wancheng was also beaming with joy, blushing and paling as he was teased by his friends. Yueheng pretended to be very happy. She wondered if she was the center of a comedy now, or the protagonist of a tragedy in the future.

(II)

Because Yueheng disliked the gloomy and lifeless appearance of that house, Wancheng bought a new set of teak furniture, replaced it with colorful carpets, and green curtains. The new house was even more colorful, dazzling to the eye. Yueheng loved flowers by nature. Now, in this residence, there was a vase of flowers here and a vase of flowers there, which indeed made it more lively.

In the past, Wancheng was the emperor in this palace. Now, Yueheng was the empress. Her authority was even above the emperor's, and even the emperor had to accommodate her. Two weeks passed quickly. Yueheng was so leisurely that she was starting to get bored. She decided to go to the orphanage every day to handle affairs.

Most of her married life was peaceful and hazy. She put everything out of her mind and focused her energy on the orphanage. She watched the children read, play, and rest, and she felt unparalleled joy.

In recent days, they had hardly talked about personal matters. It was like pointless small talk, saying one thing here and another thing there, making it embarrassingly boring. Yueheng was deliberately indifferent, while Wancheng was still the same as before they got married. Yueheng didn't care at all. He was just chewing on the taste of loneliness.

Yueheng had a bad habit, which was "knowing full well yet still doing it." She had done many things like this. She always wanted to change, but she could never change. Just like now, she knew very well that Wancheng loved her very much, and as long as she showed one point of love, she could get ten times the reward. But she just wouldn't do it, and she couldn't even say why. Until it was her birthday, Wancheng happened to be feeling a bit unwell, but he still cheered himself up to invite guests for her. He got up early in the morning and spent half an hour shaving his beard himself. He didn't forget his shortcomings and tried his best to hide them in order to win Yueheng's favor. Yueheng was very touched. That morning, she also went to the barber shop and combed her curly long hair into a bun. Thus, the gray soul between them was lifted by the power of the beard and hair, revealing a vast moonlight.

After the guests dispersed, they were the only two left in the house. Yueheng realized her mistake and didn't want to make it again. She could love the orphans of the world, so how could she not love her husband? She thought that she shouldn't leave Wancheng, who was more than twenty years older than her, to be alone again. She decided to love him well in the future.

During that minor illness, Yueheng took care of him very meticulously. After he recovered, she personally took care of his diet and daily life, unknowingly changing Wancheng's bossy temper towards the servants. Needless to say, Wancheng was extremely grateful! People say that marriage is the tomb of love, but they only began to fall in love half a year after their marriage.

(III)

It was New Year's Eve. The house was decorated with a completely new look. It was snowing, and the weather was really cold. After dinner, Yueheng and Wancheng sat around the brazier, warming themselves. They were planning for next year. Next year would bring them a little baby. The thought that they would soon be a father and a mother brought smiles to their faces. Yueheng planned that the orphanage would add a handicraft class next year so that the orphans would have the opportunity to practice their skills. Wancheng planned to work hard on his career next year because he would have a child. The child was still very young!

Despite the howling north wind and heavy snow outside, they were living a spring life in winter. Originally, Wancheng was selfish, tyrannical, and stingy because he was lonely and no one cared about him. He had no joy in life, so he was jealous of other people's happiness. He lost his temper with his subordinates and cursed them harshly. He didn't get other people's sympathy, and he didn't pity other people. He wouldn't take out a single penny to do good deeds. Yueheng, needless to say, was selfish, insincere in everything she did, and her bad habit of "knowing full well yet still doing it" was very obvious. But now they had both become good. Wancheng was moved by Yueheng's enthusiasm for the orphanage and gave up his stinginess. Yueheng, because of Wancheng's love, dedicated her sincerity to the marriage. In the nurturing of love, they corrected their shortcomings.

"True affection" and "sincere love" are two hot springs. They can wash away your trauma, encourage you to improve, and even more so, clarify your bad dregs. Now, this old husband and young wife, Wancheng and Yueheng, may seem mismatched and incompatible on the surface, but who can say that they are not happy?

### Traces and Other Things

— Wang Shu

Traces

They were all young companions. After several years of wandering, they had the opportunity to reunite and tell each other about their feelings of separation. It was really rare. As I held his warm hand, I noticed the yellowish-brown, scorched traces on his fingertips. There was no other reason for this than that he smoked a lot of cigarettes. Surprised by his change, I naively asked him:

"How did you get addicted to this habit?"

But he didn't answer immediately. Instead, he grabbed my hand and found traces on my fingers that were the same as his, the obvious marks from long-term burns caused by cigarette butts, revealing everything.

Two lines of melancholy and ashamed gazes intertwined, forming a reminder of the vicissitudes of the world. A faint smile appeared, and we remained silent. Both of us were probably sighing: This turbulent and ever-changing era is a training ground for young people.

White Hair

This time, it was my new discovery. At the edges of my friend's unkempt hair, numerous strands of white hair had been added. The lively and clever "little sparrow" of the past had actually become like this, turning into an "old man with white hair"?

White hair should be a symbol of aging, but he was clearly still a student studying. According to general imagination, this should be the golden prime of a young man's life, full of youthful vigor, a time to be envied and envied.

Now, my friend was actually facing the mirror, stroking those patches of white hair on that withered face with black-rimmed glasses, and just murmuring softly: "It's not a big deal. Who in the world can avoid setbacks? Who can resist fatigue and decay? If someone says that other people's youth is spring, then spring has gone far away from me, leaving only the desolate mood of late autumn."

"Why are you saying such decadent things? You're still young, your spirit is still gestating, and the bright and magnificent era is still beckoning to you. Why be self-deprecating? You should jump out of this depressing personal circle. There's always sunshine outside that can restore your youth."

A resolute voice was telling him, and also telling me the same thing. I didn't know if this voice was mine or his.

In short, he nodded and extended a warm hand. In exchange for my encouragement to him, there was still a burning power.

Spring

We were still wandering on the street, experiencing the season of spring that had not been long in coming.

We strolled slowly, and the rare and warm sunshine dragged out our shadows. The spring breeze brought a gentle charm, soothing our breathing. Looking up at the clear blue sky, without saying a word, it also strengthened our new hope.

At the intersection, we temporarily said goodbye. Once again, we firmly grasped our reluctant hands. I pointed to the new buds sprouting on the branches, the street trees spitting out green, and still sincerely blessed:

"In the spring breeze, I'll give you a heart of spring, driving away the autumn desolation of the past. This is exactly the right time!"

### International Cup Football Tournament Contribution of the Chinese Team Authorities

In this International Cup Football Tournament, the number of units registered to participate is seven. They are China, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Jewish, Nordic, and Russia. The matches that have already been played are Nordic winning against Russia, one to zero. Italy winning against Japan three to one, and yesterday Portugal won against Jewish with two to one. Here is a brief list of the situation:

Recent situation

Commentary on yesterday's battle: Portugal wins against Jewish

Yesterday at 3:30 PM, there was a scene, Portugal against Jewish. The former is proud in the league. However, in this International Cup, because Fuen Pantoson and others all belong to the Nordic countries, and Bauxu脱·柯莱脱 and others are also unable to participate due to nationality relations. Therefore, the strength is far from comparable to the Portuguese merchants in the league. The Jewish team is a mediocre team. There was originally no hope of winning the championship. However, the spirit of the team is very good, putting victory or defeat behind them, which is also worth mentioning. The lineup of the two teams is as follows:

Although Portugal is weaker, it was expected that they would win against Jewish. Therefore, after the start of the game, it seemed that they were not very energetic. Unexpectedly, the Jewish team was enterprising and aggressive. Although there were not many offensive, the defense was just right. The Portuguese team had to cheer up. There was a change of atmosphere. Ge Quli was young and promising. Taking advantage of the opportunity of M Gelinbao's chaotic road, he went straight in and fulfilled his mission, winning the first city. After the fall of the Jewish team, there was no discouragement, and they made a concerted effort. S Gelinbao raised troops on the right, and immediately returned the color, making it a tie. Afterwards, the situation was entirely in a tug-of-war situation. The Jewish team did their best, and the Portuguese team could not help it. Until 40 minutes, Luo Chailiao got the supply of 奥列维拉, and went straight in, and swept his foot at fifteen places near the door, which was very skillful. The device of 勃孟 was helpless. The Portuguese team exceeded again with two to one, and it was also the only goal of this reality, laying the victory. The first half ended with two to one. In the second half, the Portuguese team had a steady victory in mind, and made progress. V苏君's repeated cold arrows, unpredictable, the Jewish team had an unyielding spirit and strict defense. Gai 勃孟 saved a dangerous ball, and his credit cannot be erased. Therefore, until the end of the game, they still gained nothing. Portugal finally won Jewish with two to one, and will compete with the Nordic team for the final qualification. And the other group of China and Italy also meet in the battle for the final. In the future, all countries will win with surprise and seize the International Cup with international honor, which will present a warm situation and exert the best ball skills to feast the eyes of our fans.

Predicting that the future situation will be a dispute between China and Italy

Looking at the strength of the teams, China and Italy are the most promising. The Portuguese team's lineup is not strong enough. The Nordic team is mainly composed of German merchants, and with the help of Fuen w Pantoson, the lineup is still good. But it feels that their contact is still difficult to be satisfactory. When they meet the Portuguese team, they can be said to be evenly matched, but when they play against China or Italy in the final, it seems that it will be difficult to avoid. According to this, the semi-final between China and Italy can also be said to be the final, and both teams must have made some plans before competing.

Hope that the Chinese authorities should prepare for the future

Looking back on the past, whenever the Chinese team participates in the International Cup, it must be established as early as possible and practiced. However, recently the author always feels that it is only a "star system" to select the army with the most famous, but there is no need to wait for the study before the event, and even during the competition, it is mixed into a straight up, winning or losing is another matter. To ask for a satisfactory record, I have not seen it. Therefore, I have to hope that the Chinese team should prepare for the future and add more training. I hope that I can succeed in defeating the enemy at a few hours, and be a Chinese team. Moreover, this time, 幼良韩龙海李祥 are all in the list of no qualification to attend China, and the donation loss is very large. I dare to this time, and then select the lineup, which is also what should be taken to deal with Italy.

Two goalkeepers should be taken, and each can play half the game. If the situation in the first half is still good, then it is not necessary to adjust. The recent situation of Zhuang Youren is very good, and he can be competent, and Chen Xiaojun also has the most normal training, and he will surely live up to people's expectations. The center guard line Zhu Lingsheng and Li Tiansheng live on the left, and can be expected to have a tacit understanding. Meng Yiliang and Zhang Lingen all have a fluttering situation. Since the left and right of the forward are lacking, they have to 重许文奎费春华, 刘麟, and in the middle 麟策, and the left and right two forwards, Li Yiju and Sun Jin are rich in pulling the door, reflecting each other and shining brightly. The harvest must be considerable. See this, I hope that the authorities will adopt and improve it, and do not let the International Cup related to international honor be taken away by the 胡儿, then the football world is fortunate.

### Shantou Team Celebrates 3rd Anniversary Wonderful Basketball Friendship Match

In order to celebrate the 3rd anniversary of the establishment of the Shantou Team Basketball, the Shantou Fellow Association specially invited the two teams of the Central North and the Fat Team to play friendly matches with the A and B groups of the Shantou Team at the Youth Association on Baxian Bridge yesterday from 7:00 PM, and the program can be called wonderful. Also, because the good show of basketball has been suspended for a long time, the decisive battle between Hualian Central North has not had a definite date, and fans have taken this good opportunity to go to appreciate it. However, in this performance match, the Shantou team is purely to entertain fellow villagers, in order to arouse the attention of fellow villagers to amateur sports, the meaning is very profound, but for countless enthusiastic fans, I feel regret. Yesterday, the four weeks of the court were full of people, and Lin Zuo poem's hard work was rewarded, no wonder he was full of spring breeze, triumphant and triumphant. The introduction of sports, such as achievements, is worth admiring, and the two battle strategies are on the left:

Fat Team wins Shantou Team B 35——23

Central North and Shantou Team A 27——27

The reason for the failure of Shantou B is that it is too cautious

The defeat of Shantou B is entirely due to being too cautious. When they get the ball, they do not dare to use high-speed offense, which is too eager to win. And the guards still use five-man zone defense, which is relatively outdated. The Fat Team has made great progress in ball skills recently, and the center Wang Rongsheng is worthy of being a latecomer, advancing by leaps and bounds, and is a promising talent. The only shortcoming is that the turning is still too slow. The little fat man Yan You is lively and active, and the performance is quite well received. The victory of the Fat Team is by no means a fluke. The result in the first half was 21 to 13, and the overall result was 35 to 23, with the Fat Team leading.

Central North and Shantou Team A fulfill the purpose of carnival

The battle between Central North and Shantou Team A gave the audience a boost. Because Shen Gong's foot injury has not healed, Central North added the famous player Yin Huanwen, who came from the north, to help out, and it is still neat. At the beginning of the game, both sides used man-to-man. Shantou team relied on the spirit of the foot, and achieved nine points in one breath. Central North got nothing. Seeing that the players were a little bit powerless, Central North suddenly changed to a five-man zone defense to wait for work. I don't know how, Shantou team also changed to a five-man zone defense, which made Li Zhenzhong frequently shoot wonderful shots. In the first half, Central North finally reversed the defeat and won with 17 to 12. In the second half, Shantou team tried its best to counterattack, and observed the biggest mistake in the first half, which was to try Du Weicong as a defender, and the forward got less points. In the second half, Lin Yi changed to the front line, which made Central North's threat very strong and caught up. In the last two or three minutes, the Shantou team exceeded with 27 to 25. Fortunately, Central North relied on Chen Xuesong's last shot to make each 27 draw and shake hands to make peace.

In summary, this competition is because of the nature of friendship, so both sides can play as much as possible in terms of ball skills, and allow countless balls to get the best impression, which is really commendable.

A glimpse of the court

After Jin Botao was accused in the Hualian Shantou team match, he took the blame and resigned, and he has not been seen as a referee for a long time. He appeared again yesterday, and he was very energetic, and he is still a progressive basketball referee.

Yesterday, in addition to the fellow villagers from Shantou, there were many basketball comrades, including Chen Zuoliang, Chen Liuzhen, Wu Zibin, Huang Mingyuan, and Zhang Jinlong.

The cheers of the fellow villagers from Shantou were unprecedented.

The order on the court was entirely the responsibility of the Shantou team, which was very well organized. (Sow)
