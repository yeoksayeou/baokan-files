### The Japanese Air Force Continues to Pursue and Attack Everywhere: Enemy Mobile Forces Retreat, Aircraft Carriers and Ships Sunk or Destroyed Number Twelve

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 21st: The enemy mobile force has been retreating southward since the morning of the 20th. Japanese air units are urgently pursuing the enemy, and the battle results are expanding. Among the battle results obtained on the 20th, those that have been confirmed so far are as follows: one regular aircraft carrier sunk, and one regular aircraft carrier destroyed.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the morning of the 18th, Japanese air units have completely repelled the enemy mobile force that appeared in the sea east of Kyushu. Since the dawn of that day, they have launched a bold preemptive strike, sinking one enemy regular aircraft carrier and destroying eight aircraft carriers. After the Imperial Headquarters announced these battle results, the attacks continued. From the 19th to the present, in addition to the battle results already announced, the air units have sunk one more regular aircraft carrier and one cruiser. On the afternoon of the 20th, special attack units were dispatched to launch attacks with guaranteed death and guaranteed hits, causing major fires on two large aircraft carriers, one of which has definitely sunk. Subsequently, Japanese air units continued to carry out night attacks. According to reconnaissance reports, the attacked sea surface was covered with oil and many other floating objects. In the continuous attacks since the 18th, there are still four unidentified ship types that have been destroyed. Therefore, the current overall battle results total at least twelve aircraft carriers and other ships sunk or destroyed. The Japanese Air Force launched continuous and fierce attacks on the enemy mobile force on the night of the 20th and throughout the 21st, and the battle results are highly anticipated.

### Attacking the Enemy Mobile Force: War Records of Japanese Army and Navy Aircraft - Advancing Side by Side to Achieve Preemptive Goals

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The war record of a base unit in Kyushu attacking the enemy mobile force is as follows: After receiving intelligence that the enemy mobile force was approaching the mainland from the southeastern ocean, the base's spirit to destroy the enemy became tense. The enemy had a powerful force composed of three supply ship units, clamoring to attack the Japanese mainland. The enemy had already revealed its claws, following the landing in the Philippines and the fierce defense of Iwo Jima. The Japanese base unit, which had long gritted its teeth in unbearable anger and had achieved great feats in the Taiwan Sea in the past, and a certain naval air unit with indomitable fighting spirit, now had boiling blood and filled chests with anger. Based on the constant stream of intelligence, a concise operational plan was drawn up under dim lights, and a bold decision was made to preemptively strike the enemy. A few commanders, flight leaders, chiefs of staff, and other key personnel all grasped their swords, determined to concentrate on one goal, and departed from the airfield under a waning moon and sparse stars. Thanks to the hard work of the maintenance personnel, they were fully prepared to launch an attack. New advanced aircraft such as the Galaxy, the Tenzan, and the Comet advanced in unison, and the roar of the engines stirred the heartstrings of every warrior. The brave soldiers lined up in front of the command post, respectfully listening to the commander's instructions. The brave soldiers were deeply moved by the commander's encouraging words, and then received the final instructions from the squadron leader. The brave soldiers, with red Hinomaru flag headbands wrapped around their heads, displayed high morale and a hundredfold of courage. They calmly boarded their beloved aircraft and, in the faint light of dawn, accompanied by the roaring engines, gradually disappeared towards the southeastern direction of dawn. Dozens of naval aircraft led the way, searching for enemy aircraft. Advancing side by side with army aircraft, the highly skilled brave soldiers had full confidence. The commanders and others in the command post were all hoping that the army and navy aircraft would quickly thwart the enemy mobile force. Soon, they received the first report of discovering the enemy mobile force at a certain time and minute, followed by the report of the start of the attack. The anticipated preemptive strike had achieved great results, which would soon be revealed. The command post was filled with joy, and spirits immediately relaxed. At that moment, the fierce battle scene on the ocean, dozens of nautical miles to the southeast, surged into their minds. The Japanese aircraft, skillfully avoiding the enemy's naval defensive barrage and the enemy's ship-borne fire nets, were fighting bravely, and everyone was praying for their success. Suffering from our army's preemptive strike, the enemy was extremely anxious. At noon, when the sun was high in the sky, we had long seen through the enemy's intentions. Therefore, we sent the second and third naval aircraft squadrons to follow the first attack squadron to inflict heavy damage again. At the same time, they broke into the airspace above the enemy mobile force. Even under enemy air raids, they still insisted on launching attacks. Such fighting spirit could not be stopped by the enemy. Sparks rained down on the battlefield. In addition, there were also reports of several desperate close-quarters combat encounters. Even in the busy command post, the brave figures of the fighters floated in everyone's minds.

### A Large Squadron of Enemy Aircraft Attacks Kure Port Unsuccessfully - Forty Aircraft Shot Down

Dozens of Japanese naval air force aircraft bravely took off and engaged in fierce air combat over the western Seto Inland Sea. Enemy fighters and bombers became the targets of Japanese aircraft attacks. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack, achieving the result of shooting down 40 enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft were ultimately unable to withstand the attack and fled. Only a few Japanese aircraft failed to return.

### The Way Out for Light Industry in Wartime

In the past, we have repeatedly argued for the necessity of industrial dispersal. In the future, factories must move to the sources of raw materials and to the sales markets. Because transportation difficulties are increasing day by day, without sourcing materials locally, it will be impossible to continue production. Without selling locally, the stagnant turnover of funds will also make it impossible to continue production. To maintain production and establish a foundation for future development, the only way is to disperse the factories concentrated in Shanghai to small cities to find a way out.

The trend of light industry development in wartime is completely different from peacetime:

First, in peacetime, production is conducive to concentration and large-scale operations. Everything from the refinement of the division of labor, the wholesale purchase of raw materials, the supply of power, the repair and purchase of machinery parts, the financing of funds, the convenience of exports, and the employment of labor is advantageous when concentrated in locations with convenient transportation such as seaports, rivers, and railways, and with large-scale operations. In wartime, transportation is blocked, power is reduced, raw material procurement is difficult, labor prices increase with grain prices, and exports are suspended. The sales target has to shift to the interior, which is all advantageous to dispersal and small-scale operations.

Second, peacetime production moves towards high industrialization. In wartime, because heavy industry turns to military industry, the import of machinery stops, and the supply of fuel and electricity becomes difficult, it moves in the opposite direction, even degenerating into handicraft or semi-mechanized industry.

Third, in peacetime production, the goal of improvement is to produce products of excellent quality and sophistication. In wartime production, because purchasing power decreases and raw materials are scarce, the goal of improvement must be to reduce production costs and find substitutes for raw materials.

In order to adapt to the environment and meet current needs, the development of light industry in the interior is a definite and unwavering principle, and it is also an inevitable trend. However, when we look around the industrial circles of Shanghai today, very few are able to adapt to environmental needs, meet the trends of the times, and prepare for relocation. It is an undeniable fact that the industrial circles have failed to pay attention to their future crisis.

Analyzing this phenomenon, there are two reasons that can explain it: The lack of organization in Shanghai's industrial circles is the first reason. In peacetime, they cannot seek the welfare of the industry or cooperate with each other. In wartime, they do not move in unison, lack leadership, and observe each other. Second, the government has not provided active and sufficient rewards and assistance, which is also an important factor. Although Huaihai Province and Jiangsu Province have expressed their welcome to relocation, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been studying countermeasures, the measures to reward and assist relocation have not yet been promulgated, and there are rumors of buying up small yarn factories. We believe that in order to promote the Shanghai industrial dispersal plan, the government must immediately promulgate reward and assistance regulations at this time, providing convenience to those who relocate first to dispel doubts and turn passive observation into active action.

Industrialists with long-term vision must rise up and lead this movement, making long-term plans for the country and for themselves. We place infinite expectations on this.

### Iwo Jima's Highest Japanese Commander, Lieutenant General Kuribayashi, Serves the Country with His Life - Personally Leads All Personnel in a Heroic Final Attack at the Front Lines

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at noon on the 21st: (1) The Japanese troops on Iwo Jima have continued to fight bravely for a month since the enemy's landing. After March 13th, they were still able to hold the outer defensive positions near the northern settlement and Mount Suribachi, continuing to fight bravely, but the battle situation eventually reached a final impasse. A telegram from the island stated that at midnight on the 17th, the highest commander personally led all his personnel at the front lines, praying for the victory and peace of the Empire, and daring to launch a heroic final attack. Contact has been lost since then. (2) From the enemy's landing on the island to March 16th, the enemy suffered approximately 33,000 casualties on land.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The highest Japanese commander on Iwo Jima, Lieutenant General Kuribayashi, after taking the lead, sent a final telegram to the rear, which read as follows: The battle situation has reached its final stage. I am standing on the front lines, praying for the victory and peace of the Empire. I have resolutely launched a final all-personnel attack on the night of the 17th. We are under the fierce attack of the enemy's sea, land, and air forces. We will bravely kill the enemy with our hearts of loyal service to the country. The fighting spirit of my subordinates is truly deeply moving. However, due to the enemy's superior attacks, our troops have died in succession, and we have been forced to lose our defensive positions. I am truly terrified and beg for forgiveness. If this island falls into enemy hands, the Empire's territory will not be secure. Therefore, we look forward to the Imperial Army's return to recapture the lost territory. However, at present, ammunition and soldiers are exhausted, and we have decided to make a desperate gamble, smashing our bodies to repay the Emperor's grace. I respectfully lead the soldiers in shouting "Long live the Emperor!" and bid farewell forever.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy forces that landed on Iwo Jima consisted of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Marine Divisions, totaling 45,000 men. Their losses accounted for a strong 73% of the total. The fact that important areas in southern Japan are now in enemy hands is truly unavoidable. However, overcoming various difficulties on an isolated island in the ocean, fighting fiercely for a month, causing the enemy to delay their advance and suffer heavy losses, and demonstrating the true essence of the Japanese army, their immortal military achievements will always be remembered by future generations.

### Japanese Troops in the Philippines Continue to Fight Bravely

Philippines Front, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the 18th, enemy troops in the Philippines have gradually increased their forces in front of the central defensive position east of Manila. Fierce battles are currently taking place on the high ground east of San Mateo and near the southeastern part of Bayangbayang. This battle is extremely fierce, with both the Japanese and American armies using all their strength. This can truly be called a typical battle of defense and attack, but the battle situation is becoming more serious and the trend is becoming greater. In order to adapt to the battle, the Japanese army gradually jumped out of the defensive positions on the right flank and adopted an offensive stance. At the same time, they carried out close-quarters combat attacks everywhere, throwing the enemy into a state of confusion. A large fire and explosion occurred at 15 locations near Mandaluyong, and the Japanese army achieved great battle results. On the other hand, the American army attacked the Japanese army's second line of defense in the Antipolo area on the left flank. However, the Japanese army on the first line of defense continued to fight to the end under the heavy encirclement of the American army, firmly guarding important positions, continuing bloody battles, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, shrinking part of the battle line in recent days, reorganizing the defensive positions, and starting a counterattack since the 16th, and carrying out close-quarters combat attacks. One cruiser, fifteen destroyers, forty transport ships, and one hospital ship. The American troops ashore are currently carrying out mine-sweeping operations and repairing Manila...

### Prospects for the Recent International Situation - Speech Broadcast by Minister Matsudaira -

Matsudaira, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, delivered a radio speech yesterday (the 21st) at 7:20 PM from the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, entitled "Prospects for the Recent International Situation," lasting approximately 20 minutes. The original text is recorded as follows:

(1) Overview

The recent world situation, along with the anti-Axis counter-offensive operations in both the Greater East Asia and European battlefields, has brought about various political changes. In the Greater East Asia region, although the war is intensifying, the political situation is relatively simple because of the small number of countries involved. In Europe, the enemy is provoking the final decisive battle, and the interests of various countries are intricately intertwined, presenting an extremely subtle international situation. I will now explain each separately.

(2) American East Asia Policy

Japan's enemies in the Greater East Asia war zone are Britain, America, and Chongqing. Japan's allies are the emerging countries and ethnic groups in various regions of Greater East Asia other than Chongqing, but almost all military power rests on Japan's shoulders. Within the enemy camp, the United States is also showing a tendency to gradually dominate Britain and Chongqing's operations.

The United States' current goal is to destroy Japan's war capability. Another major goal is to attempt to place a part of Greater East Asia, including China, under its own influence. This is Roosevelt's ultimate goal in his heart. Why? In this war, the United States has mobilized huge resources to lend arms to Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. In return, it has obtained rights and interests to some islands in the Pacific from Britain, but has gained nothing from the Soviet Union. The United States has sent troops to Europe, and has suffered more than 400,000 casualties, but it has gained nothing in terms of territory or resources in Europe, only expanding its influence to Iran, Iraq, and North Africa.

Americans are expanding their influence to other regions of the world, and this is the Americans' deliberate intention. American industrialists and legislators are increasingly revealing their ambitions in this regard. Let us first look at Chongqing. On the surface, the United States says it is helping Chongqing to develop wartime production, but secretly it is extending its influence. According to the plan drawn up after Nelson's visit to Chongqing, the US War Production Board announced that it would take five to seven years to realize basic industries such as developing war materials, expanding hydropower generation, ironmaking, transportation, and increasing agricultural production. The necessary materials and manpower are also being sent to Chongqing in batches, but the United States hopes to end the war as soon as possible and is advancing aggressively at all costs. Why is it desperately promoting the realization of important industries that will take five to seven years to succeed? It goes without saying that the United States intends to manipulate all of China's basic industries in the future, which is its true East Asia policy.

(3) US-Chongqing Relations

The United States currently wants to make as much use of China's manpower and material resources as possible to resist Japan, so it is doing its best to make Chongqing and the Communists compromise, instill American ideas in the Chinese people, and attract a large number of soldiers, give them American-style weapons, and provide them with American-style training. Its ultimate goal is to permanently dominate China, so for basic industries, whether large or small factories, all are controlled by Americans, and even Chiang Kai-shek is not allowed to interfere. All aircraft also belong to the US Air Force. Almost all of Chongqing's air force consists of ground maintenance personnel and laborers, and they are not qualified to board aircraft. According to a telegram sent by an American journalist stationed in Chongqing, the Wedemeyer Command has requested Chongqing to supply 800 young women to serve as translators and typists, making it extremely difficult for Chongqing to cope. Today's Chongqing has become a dependency of the United States. However, the people of insight in the Chongqing area have not lost their spirit. The younger generation is cultivating a spirit of independence and freedom, and national patriotism seems to be gradually becoming widespread. I remember that last autumn, when representatives of the Sichuan Province people gathered, they elected Zhang Lan as their representative and issued a letter of advice to Chiang Kai-shek, which stated, "Mr. Chiang, please do not be a running dog of the United States, respect China's autonomy and independence, and alleviate the suffering of the people." Speculating on the people behind the scenes, the main ones are Bai Chongxi and Sun Ke. The United States is using both hard and soft tactics to win over pro-American factions in Chongqing, but the more it wants to win them over, the more patriotic and concerned people rise up in resistance. As a result, ideological conflicts are bound to occur between Chongqing's people of insight and the United States. Chiang Kai-shek's famous book "China's Destiny" also concludes that China's independence and autonomy are the trend, so Britain and the United States regard it as having an "anti-foreign" nature and demand deletions. This proves that there is a wide gap between the ideas of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing. (To be continued)

### The Closer the Enemy Gets to Japan, the Greater the Damage: Statement by Minister Matsushima Yesterday

Colonel Matsushima, the Press Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, issued a statement yesterday, asserting that the closer the enemy gets to Japan, the greater their damage will be. The original text is as follows:

Enemy Attempts to Fail Completely (1) Looking at the movements of the enemy's mobile units in the sea south of Japan, it is clear that the enemy wanted to scout the power of Japan's naval and air forces and avoid losses, but this attempt failed completely. Not only were Japanese ships undamaged, but the damage on the ground was also minimal. On the other hand, the enemy suffered heavy losses, including eight aircraft carriers sunk, two carriers damaged, and 183 aircraft shot down. However, because the enemy still has considerable remaining forces, they are bound to make some more moves. Recalling the situation in the Philippines last year, it is even clearer that this action may also be related to the enemy's transport convoys in other areas. In addition, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is relying on enemy mobile units to carry out its moves, so we must also be vigilant, and the Japanese army is taking more strict precautions.

Heavy Casualties in the Attack on Iwo Jima (2) The Japanese army on Iwo Jima, on March 7th, with the spirit of a whole army determined to die, broke into the enemy's lines, which is truly regrettable for the soldiers who have bravely killed the enemy for the past month. However, the American enemy, in order to attack the small area of Iwo Jima, mobilized the entire Pacific Fleet, with more than three marine divisions. In land combat, the enemy has admitted that it is the most difficult battle since the establishment of the Marine Corps. In less than a month, casualties have reached 33,000, an average of more than 200 people per day, and more than 50 people per hour. According to the enemy's air transport unit, an average of 300 seriously wounded soldiers are transported to the rear by plane every day, which shows the extent of the damage. Furthermore, the enemy's army commander, General Smith, Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz, Marine Corps Commander Smith, etc., also said that the closer the American army gets to Japan, the stronger the Japanese army's resistance will be, and the greater the American army's sacrifices will be. They also hinted at the bravery of the Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima. In short, Iwo Jima is only a small island, and the enemy may win temporarily due to their war of attrition, but in future decisive battles, the enemy's sacrifices will inevitably be even greater.

### U.S. Troops on the Rhine Adopt Pincer Movement

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Haltung Telegraph Agency reports: The situation between the Naji Saar and the Rhine River remains unstable. The numerically superior American troops continue to advance, with two objectives: (1) The goal of a large-scale pincer movement is to cut off the German salient in the Saar Palatinate. This plan has not yet been achieved. (2) An attempt to encircle from the west has achieved partial success, that is, dispersing the German defense line. The recent battles have forced the German army to make considerable withdrawals.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Haltung Telegraph Agency reports: Eisenhower's forces are working hard to threaten the middle reaches of the Rhine River, between Coblenz and Pingen. American troops have made progress. The U.S. Third Army in the south has crossed the Hengsruck Mountains. The U.S. troops in the directions of Nacht and Olmu have reached the road from Mainz to Ulstadt. The pressure from the American troops advancing northeast from the Remagen bridgehead is strong. The American troops on the right bank of the Rhine River have broken into the southwest of Bien. American troops advanced southeast and southwest from the Kreuznach area across the Hengsruck, but were blocked by German counterattacks. The focus of the battle in this area has shifted to the Meisenheim area and the Pudal Road. The American attempt to encircle the German troops in this area failed, and the American troops in Saarbrücken were blocked.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Actively Reorganizing Public Associations; Some Associations Will Be Reorganized and Merged

The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau believes that the public associations of various industries in the city are poorly organized, and their affairs are very disorganized. Moreover, there are many associations with the same nature and industry, which not only cannot maintain the honor and development of the industry, but even lead to disputes from time to time. In order to promote wartime economic policies, the Bureau has formulated a comprehensive plan to actively strengthen the organizational structure of public associations in various industries and has begun to take two steps: reorganization and management. Regarding the reorganization work, forms have been issued to conduct a comprehensive survey of the internal organizational system, the actual situation of association affairs, and the economic conditions of public associations in various industries. It is now learned that the associations of various industries have filled out and submitted the forms in accordance with the requirements. Some associations have not yet submitted the forms, and they are being urged to do so. At the same time, the competent department of the Bureau is supervising and reviewing whether the information filled in the survey forms submitted by the various associations is accurate, and listing the order of associations with the same industry with opinions, in order to study and determine the reorganization, merging, or restructuring. Associations that are not necessary to exist will be ordered to be abolished, so that the organizations of public associations in various industries of major commodities, secondary commodities, and ordinary commodities in the city will be more sound, and management will be facilitated, in order to conform to the wartime economic system. It is heard that the reorganization and merger of some associations will soon be implemented.

### Self-Installed Generators Must Be Registered and Only Allowed to Be Installed After Passing Inspection

The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that after the reduction of current, factories and entertainment venues in the city have been installing generators on their own, but they do not comply with the regulations and endanger safety. Therefore, in order to unify management, it has specially formulated registration regulations. All factories and entertainment venues in the city that have self-installed such engines must apply for registration at the Second Section of the Bureau on Hankou Road in accordance with the regulations. Only after passing the inspection by the Bureau will they be allowed to install them, in order to ensure safety.

Since the Bureau launched the registration of advertisers in the city, there are still many who have not applied for registration. It is hereby ordered that all advertisers in the city must register with the Second Section of the Bureau before April 15, otherwise, all the advertisements they operate will be banned.

### The City Prepares to Celebrate the Return to the Capital Anniversary

The 30th of this month is the 5th anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The Municipal Propaganda Department and the Municipal Party Department, in order to prepare for the celebration, have jointly convened relevant groups and organizations in the city to hold the first preparatory meeting at 2:30 pm today (the 22nd) in the conference hall of the Municipal Propaganda Department on Jiangxi Road to discuss the progress.

### Port Bureau Protects Unloading in the Huangpu River

The Port Police Department under the Jianghai Customs Port Bureau believes that recently, major commercial firms have been unloading passengers and goods in the Huangpu River without reporting to the Department or requesting protection in advance, which inevitably leads to unexpected events. In order to protect the safety of passengers and goods, it is now ordered that major commercial firms, etc., must request the dispatch of police for protection in advance when unloading goods in the Huangpu River, in order to ensure safety.

### Entertainment Venues Operating Overtime Receive Warnings

Entertainment venues in the western part of the city often operate overtime in violation of police regulations. Yao Benyuan, the head of the Changning Road Sub-bureau, has repeatedly received secret reports and personally investigated the venues. He found that several venues, including the Argentina Ballroom, the Country Restaurant, and the Yuyuan Cafe, were indeed operating overtime. He summoned the owners of the venues to the bureau to inform them and, with the approval of the General Bureau, gave them written warnings. If the above situation occurs again, they will be suspended from business.

### Municipal Propaganda Department Revises Drama Censorship Rules

In order to strengthen drama censorship, the Municipal Propaganda Department has revised the previously promulgated Shanghai Special Municipal Drama Censorship Rules and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. Regarding future drama censorship work, all past practices will be abolished, and all matters will be handled in accordance with the revised rules. If there are any violations, they will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations, without any leniency. The Department plans to convene the persons in charge of various theaters, cinemas, and troupes in early next month to discuss the improvements in drama censorship.

### Cotton Control Commission Undertakes Organizational Adjustments

The Cotton Control Commission has drafted a plan to strengthen the organization system of the Commission and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval, which is expected to be implemented in the shortest possible time. It is learned that the affiliated institutions under the Commission were previously the Cotton Purchase Industry Association and the Temporary Management Committee for Cotton Yarn and Cloth, but now it is planned to include the affairs and business of the two associations within the Committee. It is planned to set up two departments within the Cotton Control Commission: the General Affairs Department and the Management Department. The General Affairs Department specializes in administrative matters, and the Management Department specializes in business matters. It is also planned to set up five sections under each of the two departments. The original cotton organization and cotton yarn organization will be placed under the Management Department.

### Silk Industry to Raise Funds for Spring Cocoon Purchases; At Least 2.25 Billion Yuan Needed

The Silk Industry Joint Association is actively promoting this year's spring cocoon purchase for silk weaving industries in three provinces and two cities, in accordance with the predetermined plan of selecting seeds, increasing production, and unified purchase. According to the Association's budget, at least about 20,000 dans of dried cocoons can be purchased according to the increased production quantity. In addition to the cocoons stored last year, at least 15,000 dans of dried cocoons can be purchased this year. If calculated at an estimated price of 150,000 yuan per dan, then at least 2.25 billion yuan needs to be borrowed for the purchase of spring cocoons to cover the expenses. The loan amount for China Silk Company's cocoon purchase this spring is not yet included.

### Minister Izubuchi Exposes Enemy's Conspiracy to Invade China; Has Long Coveted the Mainland

The Japanese Army Press Department of the Allied Nations held a routine press conference at the Hamilton Building at 1:00 PM yesterday. Minister Izubuchi and trustee Yoshio Egosaka attended. More than a dozen Chinese journalists also attended the meeting. Minister Izubuchi reported on the situation of the enemy's mobile units appearing in the southeastern sea off Kyushu, Japan, and being severely attacked by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Force, as well as the United States' plan to turn China into a colony. The talk is as follows:

Strategic Significance of Bombing Japan

The enemy's naval mobile units appeared in the southeastern sea off Kyushu, Japan. On the 18th and 19th, they attacked the southern part of Kyushu, Shikoku, and the Kinai area with carrier-based aircraft. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Force launched a very fierce attack on these enemy mobile units and achieved a major victory that has rarely been seen recently. We anticipate that this attack by the enemy air force is the first step in a new operation by the United States, and it is different from the significance of the Iwo Jima operation. We are paying close attention. The enemy's actions are clearly aimed at attacking Japanese air bases. Based on the experience of fighting on Iwo Jima in the past month, the U.S. military fully understands how solid Japan's mainland defense facilities are. Moreover, they feel very dangerous and terrified of the special attack forces' sacrificial tactics. Therefore, the enemy attempts to adopt a method of first weakening Japan's war power. However, it would be too early to consider this attack by the enemy as a prelude to a landing operation on the Japanese mainland. It would also be equally wrong to regard it as a sign of changing the direct landing on the Japanese mainland and instead operating from the Chinese mainland. In short, the enemy's attack on the Japanese mainland will continue fiercely, and at the same time, the enemy cannot forget the landing operation on the mainland.

Conspiracy to Colonize China

According to enemy Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz, in order to attack the Japanese mainland, it is necessary to occupy many islands around Japan that can be used as air bases, and the mainland is also a backup point for establishing bases. From our common sense, a landing operation on the mainland will inevitably be realized in the future. However, this attempt is not based on strategic needs, but to expand political and financial influence in China. The U.S. military's further landing in China and the plan to turn China into a colony has long been determined. Regarding the examination of this matter, it can be understood from the political and financial relationship between the United States and Chongqing, as well as the content of weapons assistance. For example: (1) The U.S. loan of 500 million US dollars to Chongqing is aimed at financially binding the Chongqing regime; (2) Making U.S. Military Commander of the China Theater, Wedemeyer, the Chief of Staff of the Chongqing military, is aimed at interfering in command authority; (3) Seizing control of the Wartime Production Bureau and the Wartime Transportation Bureau to manage the lifeline of the economy; (4) Making Ambassador Hurley mediate the KMT-CPC disputes to interfere in China's internal affairs.

The People Should Rise Up to Defend Their Homeland

Looking at the American strategy, the enemy is determined to land on the mainland in order to make the invasion of China more effective, and plans to permanently station troops in China. This is their long-established plan. How should China respond to the U.S. military, which will inevitably land on the mainland? This is the question that we should examine. Looking back at the situation after the U.S. military landed in North Africa, Italy, and France, it is the only answer for us. The current situation of the people in the areas occupied by the U.S. military, as far as we can see and hear, is unemployment, hunger, deprivation of freedom, moral chaos, and the suffering of innocent lives. China can use this precedent as a warning. The Chinese people should carefully consider this matter, and as a result of the consideration, they should strengthen defense measures. The Chinese people should first take responsibility for defense in order to protect their homeland and maintain their own lives and property. There are more than one million Japanese troops in China who will launch a fierce attack on the U.S. military landing. The Chinese people should also bravely fight to defend their country. This is the only way for China to strive for independence and autonomy.

### A Glimpse of Qibao

— Liu Feng

Not far past the blockade line, I saw the archway with the three large characters "Qibao Town" facing me. Turning into Shanghai, it became lively. The streets were full of restaurants, butcher shops, department stores, and tofu shops, whose scale and equipment were several times higher than those in Zhoujiaqiao and Hongqiao.

We first visited the San Shan Primary and Secondary School in Songjiang County. The tuition and salaries of this school are calculated in rice. The tuition for the lower grades is five sheng of rice, and the tuition for the higher grades is six sheng. In addition to food and lodging, the teachers and staff can also get about two dou of rice per month.

After crossing the bridge, it is the territory of Qingpu County. Then we visited the Qibao Town Office and learned the following points:

(1) Population—Qibao, under the jurisdiction of Qingpu County, has about 18,000 people;

(2) Production—Cotton, soybeans, grains, and vegetables are the main products;

(3) Land tax—22 catties of grain per mu are collected. Because rice is not produced locally, it is collected at a discounted price;

(4) Public security—The 5th District Police Station of Qingpu County and the 1st Battalion of the Provincial Security Team maintain public security.

We casually asked some shopkeepers about prices and found that they were not very cheap: meat was 1,200 per catty, sliced noodles were 800, and even spinach was 300. The relatively cheaper commodity was rice, which was only over 80,000 per shi. The streets and alleys were crowded with rice carriers from different routes. They gathered in groups to discuss prices, holding empty pockets. It seemed that the rice boat had not yet arrived.

The rice in Qibao comes from the areas of Sijing, Fenghuangshan, and Tianmashan. The price of rice in Sijing is 60,000, while in Qingpu County it is only 50,000.

In short, the further west you go, the cheaper the rice price is, and the closer you are to the city, the more expensive the price is. From Qibao east to Hongqiao, Beixinqiao, Zhoujiaqiao, and even the city, the distance is only ten or twenty li, but the price of rice per li is different.

Rice traders mostly transport rice from Qibao to Hongqiao or Beixinqiao, and then resell it to a group of people from Zhoujiaqiao. At Zhoujiaqiao, they resell it to vendors in the city. They transport it in sections, like a relay race. Their interest is very small, and they earn at most one or two thousand yuan per dou of rice. Each trip does not carry more than one dou of rice. They work hard and run around, and Shanghai relies on this little rice to support the food supply of two or three million people in the city.

This group of rice carriers risks danger all the way. In order to save money on expenses at the "checkpoint," some try to cross the blockade line and climb bamboo fences, but they often lose their lives as a result—as for being beaten and having the rice confiscated, they are still lucky!

### Police Station Detains Vagrants and Sends Them to Labor Camps for Vocational Training

The Crime Prevention Section of the Third Division of the Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to detain vagrants and send them to vagrant labor camps for vocational training in order to thoroughly eliminate undesirable elements in society and maintain public security. The section, together with the judicial police officers of the Huangpu, Hongkou, Changning Road, Shanghai Road, and Laoza Sub-bureaus, went to the ferry terminals and train stations to detain scalpers and unemployed vagrants in their respective jurisdictions. The first batch of more than 60 people were interrogated by Zhou Zhihui, director of the Crime Prevention Section, and Detective Zang Xiaomei yesterday. After confirming that they were unemployed vagrants, they were escorted to the Vagrant Labor Camp on Penglai Road in Nanshi for vocational training. On the one hand, the detention continues.

Crime Prevention Research Association to Be Established Soon

The Third Division of the Municipal Police Bureau convened a judicial liaison meeting a few days ago and agreed to organize the Shanghai Special Municipal Crime Prevention Research Committee, inviting judges from courts at all levels in Shanghai, prosecutors from prosecutorates at all levels, and prison directors and judicial police officers to be members to study crime prevention work and promote the significance of crime prevention. It will be announced soon.

### Finance Bureau to Dispatch Personnel to Investigate Business Tax

The deadline was the 20th of this month.

### Respectfully Requesting Local Schools in the City to Lend Vacant Classrooms During Free Time

Regarding the free primary schools, we are actively preparing for them. Currently, the most fundamental and urgent tasks are four: (1) raising funds; (2) borrowing school buildings; (3) collecting textbooks; (4) selecting and hiring teachers. For the first task, since Mr. Xie Lilin initiated the "Free School Fund," we have received enthusiastic responses and donations from readers every day, which has increased our confidence and determination. The second task is to borrow from various primary schools. Yongguang Primary School on Carter Road has already sent a letter agreeing to lend two classrooms without charging rent, which is deeply appreciated. We plan to initially establish ten schools, distributed in various districts. If public and private schools in all districts of this city can utilize their free time (two hours designated from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM daily) and agree to lend two classrooms, please send a letter directly to the "Shen Bao Compulsory Education Committee," so that we can send personnel to negotiate promptly. We respectfully hope that the authorities of all schools will uphold the purpose of serving education and provide as much assistance as possible. The third and fourth tasks are also being planned and carried out. We are preparing to start school on April 1st, and the time is pressing. We hope that virtuous individuals from all walks of life will provide guidance and assistance at any time. We will sincerely accept all suggestions.

Enthusiastically Supporting the "Free School Fund"

(1) A group of elementary school students, Xu Dingwen, Jin Yuexian, Shi Renjun, Li Gen, Yuan Kekai, Mao Lunbao, Ying Hongye, Xiang Chun, Lin Yupei, and others, wrote a letter saying: "A few days ago, we saw that your newspaper wanted to help students who are out of school and planned to establish ten free primary schools. Later, we also saw that Mr. Xie Lilin initiated the establishment of the 'Free School Fund.' This matter is very meaningful because there are too many students who are out of school. We think that we are very fortunate to be able to continue our studies, but we should also think of those unfortunate students and do our best to help them. Now, we have accumulated our pocket money for these few days, totaling 5,000 yuan, and donated it to your newspaper as the Free School Fund. Although this amount is very small, we hope that all students in Shanghai can save their pocket money and help students who are out of school, then the amount will definitely be considerable, and more students will be helped."

(2) Mr. Zhang Yifan wrote a letter saying: "Regarding the lottery for souvenirs during a recent gathering of classmates, entrusted by Ms. Chen Yanhua's group, the prize won (valued at 5,000 yuan) is transferred to the 'Free School Fund.' Please disclose it in the social service column to clarify credibility."
