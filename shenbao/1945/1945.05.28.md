### Japanese Special Attack Aircraft Form Three-Dimensional Formation, Launching a General Offensive Against Okinawa; Fierce Land Battles Between Naha and Shuri

Nansei Islands Base, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the night of the 24th until the morning of the 25th, the Japanese Army Air Force has launched a special general offensive against Okinawa Island with all its might, employing superior and effective three-dimensional mobile tactics. The substantial replenishment of Japanese military strength, the grand scale, and the vigorous fighting spirit are unprecedented since the start of the Okinawa operation. Consequently, the effects of the offensive are extremely remarkable. Since the enemy landed on Okinawa, two months have passed. The Japanese land forces have repeatedly used small numbers to resist large enemy forces, inflicting enormous damage. Since the 18th, the main battlefields between Naha and Shuri have been completely filled with artillery fire and smoke. The ground battles are extremely fierce. The enemy's vanguard troops have gradually approached Shuri and the outskirts of Naha.

On the 24th, the enemy's naval strength consisted of six battleships, ten cruisers, fifty destroyers, one hundred and fifty large transport ships, and one hundred and forty small ones. Compared to the enemy's strength around the 20th, this represents an increase of approximately two times in destroyers and six times in transport ships. Also, on the afternoon of the 24th, an enemy mobile task force based on nine aircraft carriers appeared in the Tokunoshima area in two groups. The traffic of enemy ships near the island became increasingly frequent. At the same time, the severe low pressure along the coasts of the archipelago gradually intensified. This situation hinders the activity of the Japanese air force, while this unfavorable weather benefits the enemy. As a result, the situation in the Okinawa battle becomes increasingly perilous. At this time, the powerful aerial special general attack by the Japanese forces, centered on the "Shinto Brave Corps," is of profound significance. The various flight units, having conserved their strength and awaited their opportunity, launched simultaneous attacks when the weather cleared, fiercely approaching the Okinawa battlefield.

Waved Attacks on Three Airfields

In the first half of the night of the 24th, the Flying Dragon Bomber Squadron, under the cover of fighter squadrons, bravely deployed and launched a surprise attack on Iejima and the three airfields in the central and northern parts [of Okinawa]. Throughout the night, a small number of aircraft continued to carry out wave attacks to contain the enemy's three bases. Simultaneously, the Giretsu Airborne Unit, commanded by Captain Oyama, immediately began operations, forcibly landing at the two airfields in the central and northern parts [of Okinawa]. After jumping from the transport planes, the Giretsu Unit members immediately dispersed, targeting enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft had no camouflage or cover. The Giretsu Unit members then deployed the new weapons they carried. In a short time, enemy aircraft burst into flames, and the enemy troops were at a loss due to the sudden Japanese attack. The Japanese Giretsu Airborne Unit and the Flying Dragon Bomber Squadron wantonly ravaged the enemy airfields in the darkness, rendering the central and northern airfields completely unusable. At dawn on the 25th, the Japanese Flying Wing Special Attack Unit continued its assault, launching a heroic attack against enemy ships shelling the Japanese army off the coast of Kadena. The bombs carried by the Flying Dragon Special Attack Unit were irresistible to any ship. At that time, the enemy destroyers guarding the battleships fled in panic, some even colliding head-on with fleeing transport ships.

Shinto Brave Corps Using New Tactics

At the same time, the "Flying Swallow," "Broken Blades," "Yamabuki," "Kudan," "Hidden Light," "Eternal," "Demon Subduer," "Heavenly Punishment," and "Cherry Blossom" units of the Shinto Brave Special Attack Force, etc., all took off from [their] bases, forming several echelon formations, maintaining effective distance intervals and altitudes with each other, and fearlessly engaged in melee combat with a massive three-dimensional formation. This type of three-dimensional formation with multiple aircraft engaged in wave-like melee combat is a new tactic that [we] have never used before. The enemy forces were completely overwhelmed by the Japanese military might. The Shinto Brave Corps suffered no resistance from enemy fighters or anti-aircraft fire from enemy ships and were able to reach the target airspace. This was a first. The Flying Dragon Bomber Squadron and the Flying Dragon Special Attack Unit achieved significant battle results. From Kadena to Itoman and Awakawa, enemy transport ship wreckage was scattered everywhere. The great terror of the battle results achieved by the blood of Japanese youth exceeded Taiwanese expectations. As a result of this special general offensive, the enemy, relying on material resources, lost their combat power in an instant and became utterly disorganized. The tragic situation of the enemy forces is imaginable.

Japanese Giretsu Airborne Unit Achieved Great Battle Results; Nimitz Acknowledges Intense Attack

Forward Aviation Base, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the great battle results of the Giretsu Airborne Unit's surprise attack on Okinawa Island, the Okinawa field army has reported to [this] base that over 150 locations at the northern airfield were bombed, and fires were still burning as of 6:00 AM on the 25th.

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The landing of Japanese special attack aircraft on the airfields, causing the enemy to fall into a state of confusion, was only confirmed by a United Press dispatch from Guam until the 26th. The report also described the attack as follows: "While Japanese air force aircraft strafed at extremely low altitude, multiple Japanese twin-engine aircraft forcibly landed at the northern airfield. The Japanese soldiers all jumped out of the aircraft and ignited fires, bathed in moonlight." Meanwhile, a public statement from Admiral Nimitz's headquarters on the 27th stated that "Japanese land and sea forces have launched the most intense attacks on American forces on Okinawa Island over the past few weeks. The attacks by Japanese special attack units are the most intense since the start of this war," reflecting the fighting spirit of the Japanese special attack units and air force.

### Commemorating Navy Day; Governor Hao's Speech

Xuzhou, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Today is the 40th Navy Day of [our] allied nation, Japan. To arouse the public and encourage his subordinates, and to foster a thorough understanding and awareness of Navy Day in order to uplift the spirit of decisive battle and complete the mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia, Governor Hao delivered a speech, the gist of which was: "Today is the 40th Navy Day of our allied nation, Japan. On this day of the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, as we commemorate the Navy Day of our allied nation, Japan, we should develop a new attitude and new goals, strengthen China's naval defense lines, accelerate the development of youth naval units, and instill in the public knowledge of naval warfare. With scientific intelligence, patriotic fervor, and the united strength of the entire nation, we should mobilize all of our manpower, resources, finances, and intellect, to pool our collective wisdom and efforts, sweep away the past corruption of our nation's navy, and complete the iron wall of participation in the war. All of my compatriots should be aware of the great significance [of this day], encourage each other with our allied nation, Japan, and quickly complete the era's mission of revitalizing Asia and defeating Britain and America."

### U.S. Eighth Air Force Commander Transferred to Pacific Theater

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Washington, Doolittle, former commander of the U.S. Eighth Air Force stationed in Britain, returned to Washington yesterday. It is reported that he will receive a new appointment and be sent to the Pacific Theater.

It is reported that this adjustment has been approved by the concurrent chairman and will be implemented from June 1st and reported to the central government for record.

Editorial

### The Urgent Need to Solve the People's Food Problem

We are currently in a decisive period of war. Everything should prioritize the victory of the decisive battle. Therefore, in the process of the decisive battle, in the process of striving for victory, we must concentrate all our strength. Under this major premise, we cannot help but raise the most serious issue of people's livelihood: the people's food problem. The price of rice on the black market has already risen above 20 [yuan per dou], and the prices of other essential goods for people's livelihood have followed suit. Not to mention that the majority of ordinary people are already on the verge of financial ruin, even highly paid salary earners are also stuck in a dire situation. Moreover, there are two major characteristics of this round of price increases that deserve concern: First, spatially speaking, this time, unlike in the past, the price fluctuations were not led by large cities. On the contrary, it was the soaring rice prices in rural areas and small cities that led the price surge, which spread to all regions. Second, in terms of timing, this round of skyrocketing prices, centered on food, began in the early stages of the lean season, which is different from regular cyclical price fluctuations. Instead, it is a continuous and increasing surge in prices. From these two perspectives, we cannot help but worry that: First, the scope of the population affected by price manipulation is extremely broad, almost covering the Jiangzhe and the Pacified Regions, and affecting various salary and wage earners. As a result, it will clearly affect the "combat effectiveness of materials in the Chinese [Occupied] Territories," and inevitably affect policies such as "concentrating national strength to cooperate with Japan to complete the war."

Therefore, we must loudly appeal: if we do not urgently seek to solve the problems of people's livelihood in the Pacified Regions, especially if we do not urgently seek to solve the food problem in the Pacified Regions, then any "cooperation in participating in the decisive battle" and any "material combat effectiveness" policies will lose their practical significance. Today, anyone who speaks of completing the Greater East Asia War must first seek to solve the problem of people's livelihood!

In fact, the problems in the Pacified Regions today cannot be solved by the strength of any one party alone. This has already been proven by the political and economic realities of the Pacified Regions over the past four or five years. Therefore, as we demand the rapid resolution of the food problem today, we must request that the responsible authorities on both the Chinese and Japanese sides, view the situation from a broad and long-term perspective, and consider the common goal of China completing the war. They must investigate and research, without any concealment, exactly how the food problem in the Pacified Regions today arose. After thorough investigation and research, they will inevitably discover the root cause of the problem, and then seek solutions in a "pragmatic way" (we must especially emphasize these four words) and devise practical relief measures. We constantly speak of grasping people's hearts and Chinese-Japanese cooperation. Now, solving the food problem is the most important test of this common aspiration. If we can solve this increasingly critical food problem today, then the issues of grasping people's hearts and Chinese-Japanese cooperation will all be readily resolved, achieving satisfactory success.

While the Chinese and Japanese authorities are investigating, researching, and devising thorough solutions, we first hope that the municipal authorities will quickly formulate partial and palliative countermeasures. As far as we know, Huaihai Province has had bumper harvests of miscellaneous grains and has considerable surpluses. The authorities may consider finding ways to purchase these [grains] and quickly distribute them to the general public in Shanghai, in order to slightly alleviate the immediate crisis. We believe that the current soaring grain prices are mainly due to the fact that the supply routes are blocked, and, on the other hand, that the distribution of food is inadequate, leading to market speculators manipulating the market. This cannot be ignored. If the amount of miscellaneous grains distributed per household can be increased first, it can somewhat alleviate the severity of the food shortage problem, while waiting for the most appropriate solution through the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.

### Small Number of B-29 Aircraft Attacked Kyushu Yesterday; Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Intercepted at the Kanmon Straits

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Starting at 0:20 AM and lasting until 1:20 AM on the 27th, approximately eight enemy B-29 aircraft, in formations of one or two, infiltrated via the Bungo Channel, operating in the Kunisaki Peninsula of Oita Prefecture, the western sea area of Yamaguchi Prefecture, and the Kanmon Straits area. They dropped naval mines, and from 1:20 AM to about 2:30 AM, they gradually departed via the Bungo Channel. Another group of approximately eight enemy aircraft infiltrated the southern part of Kagoshima Prefecture from 0:50 AM to 1:50 AM, heading north from the western sea area of Kagoshima Prefecture, circling over the western sea area of Nagasaki Prefecture, the northern coastal area of Saga Prefecture, and the vicinity of Hakata in Fukuoka Prefecture. After dropping naval mines, they headed south through the central part of Oita Prefecture, and departed via the Bungo Channel from 1:20 AM onwards. Japanese aircraft fiercely intercepted [them] in the skies over the Kanmon Straits, confirming the downing of two B-29 aircraft. In addition, one B-29 aircraft infiltrated the southern part of the Osumi Peninsula at 4:50 AM, heading north along the eastern coast of Kyushu, operating in the Kunisaki Peninsula of Oita Prefecture and Yamaguchi Prefecture, and departing southward from Hiroshima Prefecture at around 5:50 AM. Furthermore, one B-29 aircraft infiltrated the Bungo Channel at 11:00 AM, circling in the Kunisaki Peninsula of Oita Prefecture and the Kanmon Straits area, then operating in the Sea of Japan, and subsequently departing through the western part of Yamaguchi Prefecture. It dropped bombs in Oita Prefecture, but there was no damage on the ground. In addition, two enemy B-29 patrol aircraft operated near the Goto Islands in the Korean Strait for approximately two hours starting at 11:00 AM, then departed southward.

### Airstrikes on the Japanese Mainland as a Diversionary Operation

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy air force stationed in the Marianas continued its attacks on the night of the 23rd. On the night of the 25th, 250 enemy aircraft raided Tokyo again, dropping incendiary bombs, causing considerable damage on the Japanese side. It is observed that the enemy's intention in this raid is to divert the Japanese side's continuous aerial attacks on Okinawa since mid-April. Therefore, they are using their main force to carry out tactical bombing of the Japanese air bases in the Kyushu and Chugoku regions. According to the consistent operational mission of the enemy B-29 bomber squadrons, strategic bombing of the mainland is almost at a standstill. However, due to the heroic fighting of the Japanese army and air force on Okinawa Island, they know that attempting to divert the Japanese army by carrying out localized tactical bombing of the Kyushu and Chugoku regions is impossible. Therefore, they are returning the B-29 aircraft to their original operational mission, taking strategic bombing against Tokyo and other major cities in Japan. The two strategic bombing raids against Nagoya on the 14th and 17th were the first steps in this reconversion. Their conversion aims to destroy the Japanese production capacity, so as to shake the war will of the Japanese people. The result is that the diversionary operation for the decisive battle of Okinawa is very clear. The Japanese and Americans will take a decisive approach to this desperate war, and the very cruel battle must unfold, and in the current stage of the decisive battle, the conflict will not be limited to one small area. The enemy's offensive will be targeted at all means and methods to attack the Japanese mainland. Because the enemy is making a last-ditch effort, the conditions and strength of the B-29 in the Marianas are reinforced on the base, and it is highly likely that there will be a 24-hour bombing run.

### University Students and the Special Attack Corps

Dialogue: Fleet Reporting Department: Lieutenant Matsumoto; This Newspaper: Reporter

Starting with University Student Life at Tokyo Imperial University

Reporter: Today, we are delighted to celebrate the 40th Navy Day of Japan. Remembering the glorious victory of the Japanese Navy forty years ago, and recalling the current brave fighting of the naval officers and soldiers, we feel very excited.

The current Special Attack Corps of the Japanese Navy embodies the "spirit of the Japanese Navy." Most of the members of the Special Attack Corps are graduates of various universities, many of whom are classmates from Tokyo Imperial University. Lieutenant Matsumoto is a senior from Tokyo Imperial University and is now responsible for naval reporting. He must have a deep understanding of the special attack spirit of his former classmates. Please share your thoughts on this aspect.

Matsumoto: Tokyo Imperial University is indeed something to be missed. The two rows of ginkgo trees lining the Akamon Gate and the main gate are now full of new green leaves. Recently, we have often heard the names of our classmates who used to visit us under the green shade of those ginkgo trees in newspapers or on the radio. It turns out that they have joined the Special Attack Corps, which naturally makes me deeply respectful of them, and also strengthens my determination to serve the country.

Their decisive actions, transcending the threshold of life and death, can be said to be inevitable. In student days, people might say that current students are not passionate enough, or they need to study harder, etc., because they always feel that there are shortcomings in domestic affairs and world issues at that time, so they doubt and think. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the shadow in the hearts of university students has been swept away. Everyone has discovered a grand direction, and everyone has embarked on this passion, which can be said to be a belief that forgets the self. This is a driving force, and it has developed more and more with the progress of the war. They are not afraid of facing difficulties, because they are fighting for the motherland, so they see it very plainly.

Reporter: The spirit of Japanese youth is truly admirable, but the general Chinese youth may not fully understand the spirit of the Special Attack Corps. Please explain it in more detail, Lieutenant Matsumoto.

Matsumoto: The special attack spirit of Japanese youth is nothing beyond the ordinary. Those who did not work hard in coaching classes in student days, when they were called up to the military, did not need any explanation. They were happily determined to completely dedicate their lives to His Majesty, and sacrifice themselves for the great righteousness of the country. How was this will cultivated? Although there are various factors, in a nutshell, it can be said that because the Japanese Emperor is supreme, the spirit of martyrdom of the Japanese nation to defend Japan and protect East Asia is combined with the original enthusiasm of the youth, which creates the spirit of the Special Attack Corps. Therefore, the first to propose attacking with the Special Attack Corps were also young people. After the Battle of Solomon, although the extensive battle results continued, to defeat the enemy's material quantity, it was necessary to use special attacks of "one plane, one ship," and "one death kills a hundred." Therefore, there were suggestions from the Special Attack Corps, which were implemented.

The Special Attack Spirit and the Traditional Spirit

Reporter: We believe that the spirit of Bushido still flows in the blood of Japanese youth. Now, at the juncture of the rise and fall of the nation, this latent spirit of Bushido has naturally reappeared. I think this spirit is in line with the spirit of "Seven Lives to Repay the Country" of Kusunoki Masashige. The authority on Bushido in medieval Japan, "Hagakure," once said: "The so-called Bushido is to find the place to die. In places of life and death, it is better to die early. There is nothing to consider in detail. You must move forward with a firm will." The general idea is that you must find the place to die. The spirit of the Special Attack Corps members today, who sacrifice the small self to contribute to the greater self, is in line with the spirit of Bushido in "Hagakure." Individuals transcend the threshold of life and death, and contribute their individual death to the life of the nation. This is the attitude that youth should have. Please also explain the connection between the special attack spirit of Japanese youth and the traditional spirit, Lieutenant Matsumoto.

Matsumoto: The so-called Japanese spirit is difficult to explain simply and clearly. However, to summarize, the Japanese spirit is based on the spirit of protecting Japan. When we read the history of the Japanese gods, we feel that there is a thorough theory of human beings and the world, as well as the truth of the universe. Later, although Japan was influenced by Chinese Confucian culture after the Sui and Tang Dynasties, and indirectly influenced by Buddhism from China, it absorbed the essence of Confucian and Buddhist culture. Therefore, Japan's view of the universe, the world, and life was enriched. By the time of the Warring States period in Japan, it encountered a great trial, and completed the seamless Bushido. Of course, it can be said that the Japanese special attack spirit inherits the traditional Japanese spirit.

Reporter: Lieutenant Matsumoto's description of the Japanese spirit has the very specific spirits of "sacrificing oneself to achieve benevolence" and "giving up one's life for righteousness." I think this is also in line with the spirit of the Special Attack Corps. Furthermore, in Buddhist thought, there is a kind of "impermanence" that transcends life and death. Because this kind of Zen practice is very common in Japan, it probably also has an influence on the spirit of the Special Attack Corps. In short, the spirit of the Special Attack Corps can be said to be the highest manifestation of the strong vitality of youth, which is close to the Chinese saying "If I hear the Dao in the morning, I can die in the evening."

Matsumoto: Not only is it related to the spirit of Confucianism and Buddhism, but Lao Tzu's idea of non-action but non-inaction also has an impact on the Special Attack Corps spirit. (To be continued)

### Responding to Long-Term War: Japan Has Ample Strength, says Director of the U.S. Foreign Economic Survey Bureau

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to the Washington Gazette, Mr. Grau, Director of the U.S. Foreign Economic Survey Bureau, said yesterday that Japan has sufficient resources to cope with a long-term war, as within the so-called "inner regions" of Japan proper, Taiwan, Korea, and Manchukuo, they possess a large number of resources and manufacturing plants. The area currently occupied by our Allied forces is less than 7% of the area Japan occupied in the East Indies, Malaya, and the Philippine Islands in 1941-42. Furthermore, if we consider the air war against Japan, Japan began its large-scale and extensive industrial development decades ago. Japan's various "inner regions" certainly contain large industries capable of producing enough material to supply consumption for months after the war, and possess abundant basic resources that can sustain large-scale production indefinitely. In addition, Japan has a large production of synthetic oil and possesses a large number of tungsten, lead, zinc, and other various metals. Most importantly, Japan has enough food to feed its people.

### Pétain Scheduled for Trial

### Czechoslovakia to Demand Cession of German Territory

Bern, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch): News received indirectly from here: Circles in London believe that the Czech government will soon demand the cession of 1,000 square kilometers of German territory inhabited by people of the Lusatian Wends and Winter districts to Czechoslovakia. Prague Radio broadcasted that Chairman Stalin had exchanged memorandums with President Beneš on the matter, and that a temporary headquarters of the "Wendish National Committee" has been established in Prague. At the same time, the radio station informed the Soviet commander that it hoped to distinguish between Slavic and Germanic peoples in the Lusatian Wendish and Winter districts. The Lusatian Wendish and Winter districts extend from the Czech border directly north of Prague, through the city of Bautzen in Saxony (50 kilometers east of Dresden), all the way to Cottbus (100 kilometers northeast of Berlin).

### The Ministry of Industry Orders the Economic Bureau to Actively Adjust Valuations and Strictly Enforce Price Controls with Relevant Authorities

Recently, commodity prices have skyrocketed, and all parties are paying close attention. The Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that past valuation work has been mostly passive, relying on applications from trade associations for review, and that meeting times are often far apart, resulting in valuations that rarely reflect reality, making compliance difficult for both sides, has learned that in order to rectify this measure, it has stipulated a new valuation method, ordering the Economic Bureau to actively adjust valuations to make them reasonable, and to strictly enforce price controls with relevant authorities. Key points:

*   The cost of major commodities should be investigated at any time. In addition to applications from trade associations for review, price limits should be drafted based on the results of the investigation and submitted to the Valuation Committee for deliberation and implementation.
*   For major edible agricultural products, in order to align with the actual situation, the competent authorities may first assess and implement price limits, and then submit them to the Valuation Committee for retroactive approval.

Furthermore, major commodity trade associations originally bear the responsibility of supervising the business of their members, but in fact, only a few trade associations can implement supervision. In order to prevent members of various industries from illegally manipulating market prices, the Ministry also ordered the Economic Bureau to earnestly supervise the business of trade association members and strictly prohibit non-industry personnel from illegal trading, in order to suppress the sharp rise in commodity prices.

### Valuation Committee to Meet Today

In view of the sharp rise in commodity prices in this city, which is even worse than in the past, the Municipal Economic Bureau, after sending investigators for covert investigation, found that while there are bound to be special circumstances, there are still general illegal merchants who are hoarding and manipulating market prices. Therefore, stricter measures will be taken to crack down on and punish hoarding merchants and will be strictly enforced. Furthermore, in accordance with Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry's order to strengthen the valuation of commodities, the Municipal Commodity Price Valuation Committee has been instructed to re-evaluate prices as soon as possible. It is learned that the committee is scheduled to convene a committee meeting today (28th) to evaluate and approve new price limits based on the latest market conditions. In addition to evaluating and approving the prices of major commodities, price limits will also be approved for minor commodities.

### Japanese Navy Day Lecture Continued Yesterday

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of Japanese Navy Day, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Press Association held a second lecture yesterday (27th) at the Dahua Theater. General Jiang Xiyuan, Principal of the Central Naval Academy, gave a lecture, and the Municipal Propaganda Department also sent personnel to attend. No less than a thousand students from major middle schools in the city attended the lecture. The meeting was chaired by Chen Riping, Managing Director of the Press Association Branch, who first reported on the significance of commemorating Allied Navy Day, followed by General Jiang's lecture, which lasted 45 minutes. Afterwards, the Hua Ying film "Don't Forget Tonight" was screened, and the meeting adjourned at 12 noon.

### Chairman's Address

In his address, Chairman Chen Riping said, "Today is the 40th anniversary of Allied Japanese Navy Day. Forty years ago, in the 38th year of the Meiji era in Japan, the Russian and Russian armies fought fiercely in the Sea of Japan, and Japan destroyed the Tsarist Russian fleet. The Japanese Navy has always had the belief of certain victory and fought bravely. Since defeating Tsarist Russia, the Japanese Navy has become increasingly stronger. Now, in this Greater East Asia War, it is particularly characterized by the spirit of special attacks, annihilating the British and American navies and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. We deeply admire this traditional spirit of Japan."

### General Jiang's Speech

In his speech, General Jiang Xiyuan said, "Everyone is deeply aware of the Greater East Asia War situation, and the Allied news agencies have also published many reports on the war situation. The current development of the war situation can be described as ever-changing. Allied General Takahashi has explained the future of the war situation in detail, so there is no need to repeat it. The First World War had a close impact economically. In this war, whether on land, sea, or air, it includes both political and economic aspects. Therefore, we cannot regard the Greater East Asia War as a combat. This is a war of the entire nation.

In the national war, history and geography are closely linked, so China and Japan can never get rid of this point. In the future, we should not only cooperate with the Former Opportunity and work together, but also unite in the rear to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. In Pan-Asianism, the concept of the unity of the East Asian nations has long been clear, such as 'Each loves its own country, loves its neighbors, and defends East Asia together.' Therefore, the Asian yellow race must be closely united. Otherwise, if China and Japan do not cooperate sincerely and deviate from their positions, they will be subject to the dictates of fate in the future. Although brothers have quarreled in the past, they must jointly resist foreign insults today. Therefore, we should review the past and create the future. I hope that we will deeply understand this and strive for the fate of the entire nation."

### Two United Police Officers Executed Yesterday

Police officers Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping of the Huashan Road Branch of the Police Bureau, who used their authority to extort money from the people and then pushed the victims into the river, were found guilty by the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court, sentenced to death, and approved for execution by Chairman Chen of the National Government. The execution was carried out at the "Stone Arch" in the Racecourse Jie Xiaofang Square on the morning of the 27th. The crowd was extremely crowded. In order to maintain order, the police bureau maintained strict security around the racecourse. Supervising Judge Gao Weiqu, Clerk Xie Jingsong, and senior officials of the Supervising Police Bureau arrived at the scene one after another. At 9:40, the two criminals, Li and Du, were slowly driven to the execution ground from the New World entrance of the racecourse by judicial police. The prisoners were escorted down.

### Commodity Prices Soared Suddenly Last Week

The financial and commercial conditions in this city have fluctuated drastically in the past week. Speculators are very active, and the relevant authorities are paying close attention to this serious issue concerning people's livelihoods and public order. After the Central Reserve Bank issued gold certificates, the gold market tended to stabilize, and trading was not as rampant as before. The first four days of last week were still in a state of calm, but on Friday, a surprising surge occurred, jumping by forty to fifty points. People were agitated, and purchases became more intense. Silver followed suit and rose, and public prices also rose in step. Since the beginning of the week until Friday, Hua shares have been rising steadily, with smooth sailing. The three popular stocks of Meiya, Wing On, and the cotton mill all rose to saturation points every day. Small and medium-sized stocks, whether industrial stocks, textile stocks, real estate stocks, cultural stocks, chemical industry stocks, or pharmaceutical stocks, mostly reached their daily limit. The daily turnover increased by more than double compared to the past, with a strong demand exceeding supply. The prosperity was unprecedented. On Saturday, the market saw a slight setback in the half-day, but the market was firmly grounded and the money supply eased, with more floating capital. As for industry and commerce, prices are soaring across the board. Rice prices have more than doubled compared to the previous week, and the rise in miscellaneous grains is also severe. Oil and sugar have both soared, and purchases are still difficult. Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and candles have all risen in unison, and the factory selling prices have been raised significantly, especially the price tags on cotton textiles, socks, and undershirts have changed even more. The lives of ordinary citizens have reached the most critical juncture. It is hoped that the economic and related enforcement authorities will quickly take effective measures to suppress commodity prices.

### Japanese Education Research Institute Officially Established Yesterday

The Japanese Education Research Institute of Shanghai Special Municipality held its founding ceremony yesterday afternoon at the Kangle Restaurant. Zhou, the mayor, was represented by Dai Yingfu, Director of the Bureau of Education, and Secretary Dai Buheng, and Minister Tsuchida was represented by Investigator Takayama.

### Preparations

The chairman, Dai Yingfu, first reported on the preparations, saying: "This association has been preparing for more than a month, and has finally achieved it. I am extremely grateful for the assistance of Mr. Ueno and Investigator Takayama. The significance of the Education Bureau hosting this institute is that anyone who wants to study Japanese will be able to conduct further research. Whether they are teachers from public or private universities or middle schools, regardless of their Chinese or Japanese nationality, they are all members of this institute. Among them, not only teachers can participate, but also those who are interested in Japanese studies can join. The Education Bureau contacted various parties based on this proposition and began preparations. With the enthusiastic support of people from both countries, it finally succeeded."

### Mayor's Admonition

Next, the Education Bureau Director Dai Yingfu gave an admonition on behalf of Mayor Zhou, saying: "In the Eastern region, there is the great existence of Eastern culture. We must promote the spirit of this Eastern Wangdao culture, and only people from China and Japan can work together. Japanese people are very focused on studying Chinese culture, and at the same time, there are quite a few Chinese people who are willing to study Japanese culture. The research institute is formed by the gathering of people from China and Japan. Chinese and Japanese comrades can introduce Japanese culture to China as much as possible in this research institute in the future, and Chinese culture can also be introduced to Japan. At the same time, its advantages can be promoted even more. This is the second point. Comrades from the two countries have been working together on the Sino-Japanese Century Plan for seven years. During this period, we can say that there are still many shortcomings to be reviewed. To make up for this defect, it is only with the efforts of educational people from both countries that this will not be in vain. I hope that the research colleagues will not only think about creating a new Eastern culture, but also work hard for the future of China and Japan, and create lasting peace in East Asia. The significance of establishing this institute will be great. I hope that everyone will redouble their efforts to complete the mission of this institute."

Subsequently, Investigator Takayama delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Tsuchida, with many words of encouragement. Then, the rules of the institute were discussed and passed, and finally, Chinese and Japanese teachers from various schools expressed their opinions one after another. The meeting adjourned after about an hour.

### Ocean Art Exhibition

— Yaxin

The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, in commemoration of Japan's 40th Naval Day, is holding an Ocean Art Exhibition at the Dalu Gallery on the fourth floor of No. 17 Wai Street. Over sixty works are on display, categorized as: watercolor, oil painting, pastel, and sketch. These were selected for exhibition by outstanding Chinese and Japanese artists after deliberation and appraisal by the Ocean Art Exhibition Committee. Therefore, the displayed works are all masterpieces of the time.

When the reporter visited the venue on Naval Day, the guests were unusually crowded, each focusing their attention on appreciating these vibrant works.

The subjects of these paintings mainly popularize ocean ideas and related production, transportation, and fishing. Japanese artist Isao Ishioka's three watercolors – "Fishing Boat," "Jianghai Customs," and "Naval Bricks" – depict ocean life. His brushstrokes are very vigorous, expressing the complex situations on the ocean surface with simple colors, which is truly commendable.

Komitsu Oki's "Riding the Long Wind" uses somber colors to enhance the tragic atmosphere. The entire painting uses varying degrees of dark blue, with a faint yellow hue revealing the outline of a mountain, especially highlighting the desolation of the night. Yoshihide Matsubayashi's "Sichuan Road Bridge Scenery" is a realistic work that shows the many aspects of Shanghai life. On the bridge, there are a dozen or so pedestrians of various types, rickshaws, and two tricycles, one of which is being pulled across the bridge by a military coolie, with a porter helping him push from behind. The painter's use of multi-colored brushstrokes emphasizes the complexity of the painting, which cannot but make us admire the artist's talent and skill.

What surprised the reporter was a sailboat painting called "Evening Wind," painted in light ink by Yoson Miyamura. It is very close to the style of Chinese painting, light and free, almost like a work by a Song Dynasty artist. However, "Junks" (the Chinese translation is帆船 sailboat), entirely in the Western style, by Ichigyo Ogawa, is different from the previous painting. The parallel sailboats are expressed in varying shades and a variety of colors, and even show the fabric texture on the sails. From this delicate technique, we can see how carefully the artist handled his subject.

Paintings depicting ocean and battle scenes include: Komitsu Oki's "Great Air and Sea Battle off Okinawa Coast"; Asanosuke Tanoue's "Fighting Spirit"; Kazuyoshi Asai's "Majesty"; Kenji Ito's "Battleship," "Annihilation," and "Raising the Warship Flag"; Mansheng Xue's "Battleship Locks the Four Seas," and so on. These are all very powerful works. Saburo Saigo's "Sea" displays the beauty and magnificence of the ocean with bright and somber colors. Kazuyoshi Asai's "Morning of the Pacific" has beautiful colors, with the red sun peeking through the clouds, implying profound meaning.

Chinese artists participating include Erqiang Lu, Meisun Zhang, and Ziyu Wang. Erqiang Lu's large-scale oil painting "Preparations Before Going to Sea" has excellent subject matter, color, and technique. In the picture, several fishermen are knotting nets facing the sea, showing their anxiety and anticipation. This clever method shows the author's extraordinary accomplishment. Another pastel painting by the same author, "Roar," has successful color and composition. Meisun Zhang's three watercolors, "Huangpu River," "Xuanwu Lake," and "West Lake," show how well the author uses color to express the subject matter, from the commotion of the first painting to the tranquility of the latter two.

This art exhibition opened on the 25th and closes on the 30th. Exhibition hours are from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. If citizens want to learn about the ocean scene, come and visit early to avoid missing this rare opportunity.

### Naming Ceremony for Planes Donated by Chinese and Japanese Citizens Held Yesterday; Japanese Naval Minister's Representative, Naval Attaché Minato, Names Planes

The naming ceremony for planes donated by Chinese and Japanese citizens was solemnly held at the Shanghai Shrine in Hongkou yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. Attendees included Naval Attaché Minato, representative of the Japanese Naval Minister, Chairman of the Naming Committee Colonel Matsushima, representatives of the donors from the Chinese side, including Chen Binhe, President of this newspaper, and from the Japanese side, Kaoru Toyota, Chairman of the Shanghai Xingya Patriotic Society, and Chuzaburo Nakajima, Head of the Shanghai Resident Group, as well as guests and students from the Japanese Fifth National School, totaling several hundred people. At the beginning of the naming ceremony, the Japanese Navy Band came to the venue to play music. After the ceremony was performed as prescribed, Chuzaburo Nakajima and Chen Binhe, the two national donor representatives, delivered speeches successively. Naval Attaché Minato, representing the Naval Minister, named the planes and issued letters of appreciation. Then, Chairman of the Naming Committee Colonel Matsushima delivered a speech, stating: "Thanks to the sincerity of the Chinese and Japanese people, we are able to hold this naming ceremony for the donated aircraft, and I am extremely pleased. I would like to express my deepest gratitude here." Finally, the whole venue shouted "Banzai," and the ceremony concluded at about 10:00 AM.

Speech by the Japanese Representative

Chuzaburo Nakajima, representing the Japanese donors, said: "Today, at the naming ceremony for the donated aircraft, I would like to offer a word to His Excellency the Naval Minister's Agent on behalf of the donors. The aircraft named today are the crystallization of the sincere patriotism of us people in the rear. The increasingly fierce and critical war situation and the announcement of each battle result have left us endlessly grateful. But thinking about the damage to our aircraft and ships in the previous battles, we sincerely wish to do our best to supplement them with one more plane and one more ship. Today, we have the honor of holding this naming ceremony. Receiving this honor, we are determined to consolidate it further and are willing to join the soldiers on the front line as special attack forces, guarding our duties, strengthening our combat power, working hard, and fighting bravely with the great belief of certain victory, and not stopping until the destruction of our old enemy."

Speech by the Chinese Representative

Chen Binhe, representing the Chinese side, said: "Today is the 40th Naval Anniversary of our ally, at a time when the Greater East Asia War has reached its most urgent and decisive stage. We look back on the glorious victory of the Japanese Navy forty years ago, and the brave and great achievements of the Japanese Navy in the Greater East Asia War, and we cannot help but admire them. However, the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more intense, and the mission borne by the Japanese Navy is becoming more and more important. Standing in the position of allies, standing in the position of sharing the same boat, we cannot personally go to the front line to cooperate in combat. We should do our utmost to cooperate in the rear.

What is most urgently needed in the Greater East Asia War is the belief in victory in terms of spirit, and air force aircraft in terms of materials. The special attack spirit of the Allied naval warriors is the highest expression of the belief in victory. The spiritual aspect is already fully equipped, and the material aspect especially needs to supplement the air force's combat power and increase aircraft production. The Allied authorities and people are fully promoting it, as evidenced by the recent meeting convened by Prime Minister Suzuki with representatives of aviation companies to hold a reception and encourage them to serve the country through production. We truly share this feeling. Therefore, on this Naval Anniversary, we are presenting aircraft donation money to express the cooperation of the people for the war and jointly strive for victory in the war."

Thank You Speech by Naval Attaché Minato

The thank-you speech by Naval Attaché Minato, representative of the Naval Minister, is as follows:

"Today, on the 40th Naval Anniversary under the decisive battle, I am extremely pleased that the naming ceremony of the Patriotic Aircraft donated with enthusiasm by all of you is being held.

The current Greater East Asia War has reached an unprecedentedly critical situation at a time when the rise and fall of the empire are at stake. The battle between the enemy and us in the Okinawa area is unfolding in a white-hot manner. Our aviation units are responding to the brave fighting of the ground defense forces, fighting to the death day and night, and defeating the enemy. The outcome of the Greater East Asia War will be determined by this battle. The success or failure of the air war is an even more important factor. Our Navy keenly feels that air power is absolutely indispensable for destroying invading enemy forces. We are now overcoming all difficulties, such as enemy aircraft attacking the mainland, and striving to improve quality with the belief of certain victory and diligently strengthening.

At this critical juncture, all of you have enthusiastically donated many excellent aircraft, which can directly strengthen the combat power of the Imperial Navy. I am truly grateful. Before long, these aircraft will be active on the front lines together with the soldiers, and I am confident that they will be able to appreciate the enthusiasm of all of you. Here, on behalf of the Navy, I express my deepest gratitude."
