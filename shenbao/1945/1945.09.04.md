### Celebrating Victory, the Whole World Rejoices: Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Address; Announces Domestic Policy Guidelines to Advance Towards National Construction

Chongqing, 3rd â€“ Chairman Chiang, in his address at the victory celebration ceremony on the 3rd, stated in full:

Fellow countrymen! Japan has formally signed the instrument of surrender to our Allied nations, and the world's anti-aggression war has now come to a complete end. Our China's eight years of arduous resistance have, today, finally achieved the ultimate goal of victory. Today is a day of rejoicing for the whole world, and it is also a day for all our countrymen, after enduring hardship and experiencing pain, to celebrate and be encouraged. We offer our respects to the Founding Father of our nation, and console the spirit in heaven of the mentor who founded the Republic of China, and also console the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs and the military and civilian martyrs who generously sacrificed themselves during the War of Resistance.

### Forever Preserve Glory

Our national military and civilians, after eight years of unparalleled suffering and sacrifice, have finally reaped the glorious fruit of today. This glorious fruit is something that every compatriot in the country should fully respect and preserve, only to promote and expand it, and never to allow it to be damaged or even lost. Chiang Kai-shek personally feels grateful for the past struggles of the whole country. Considering the current devastation, I feel even more emotional, and I don't know what to say. At this crucial juncture from war to peace, we are working with our allies to end the perilous situation created by Japanese aggression over the past fifty years, and jointly create universal and lasting peace and security in East Asia and the world. We must also, amidst amicable relations with our neighbors and stability within our borders, clean up the aftermath of the war, restore order, provide relief to our compatriots in the recovered areas, console the families of deceased and wounded soldiers and civilians, resettle refugees, and heal suffering.

Moreover, in order to make past sacrifices truly worthwhile, it is necessary at this time to create a framework for democratic constitutionalism and consolidate the foundation of national unity. Our fellow countrymen were united in the past to support the War of Resistance and strive for victory, and in the future, we will surely be able to unite to ensure that democracy and unity are both achieved, so that the policies and plans of the Principle of People's Livelihood can be thoroughly implemented in a peaceful and stable social environment.

Therefore, on this day of universal joy and celebration of victory, I would like to present the most important and concrete policies of the National Government regarding domestic affairs to all my fellow countrymen for common planning.

### Reduce the Burden on Farmers and Workers

First, the purpose of our revolution and resistance is not only to defeat the enemy, but also to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. During these eight years of the War of Resistance, our national military and civilians have endured all kinds of hardships. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, all our fellow countrymen should have the opportunity to recuperate. Our China is a country that is established on agriculture, and the majority of the national population is farmers, followed by workers. The replenishment of troops in our fighting forces is mainly from farmers, and the production of weapons and civilian supplies in the rear is based on workers. During the long years of this War of Resistance, most of the industrial and commercial cities have been devastated, so the replenishment of troops and the burden of national war expenses have largely fallen on the shoulders of farmers. Now, as the War of Resistance comes to a victorious end, farmers who have served in the military and workers who have engaged in production should be allowed to reduce their obligations and burdens as soon as possible. The National Government is mindful of this and has decided to issue a clear order today: national military service will be postponed for one year from today, and the demobilization of soldiers currently in active service in the national army will also be implemented in stages by military and political organs. The National Government has also, in accordance with the program decided by the Sixth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, gradually formulated and implemented the method of granting land to soldiers. All provinces that have been occupied by the enemy will be exempted from land taxes for one year this year, and provinces in the rear will also be exempted from land taxes for one year next year. Moreover, the competent authorities and local governments will be instructed to formulate rent reduction methods in accordance with the principle of 25% rent reduction, taking into account local conditions, and submit them to the National Government for approval and implementation before November 12 of this year. We believe that only when farmers and workers have a chance to breathe can society have hope of recovery, and only when rural life has a way to improve can industrial and commercial cities have a foundation for revitalization. Therefore, the National Government must focus on reducing the burdens on farmers and workers and improving their lives as the minimum measure for all fellow countrymen to recuperate. As for other positive aspects, the implementation of the policies and programs of the Principle of People's Livelihood will naturally be regarded by the National Government as the primary task of realizing the Three Principles of the People and will be the government's greatest responsibility in the future.

### Implement Constitutional Government Early

Second, after the end of the War of Resistance, democratic politics cannot be delayed any longer. The highest ideal of the National Revolution is politics for all the people, and the most important key to realizing this ideal is to return power to the people. The National Assembly is a necessary stage for the National Government to return power to the people, and it is also an important procedure that the National Revolution must complete. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, we expected that victory in the War of Resistance and the implementation of constitutional government would be accomplished in one fell swoop. Now that the War of Resistance has ended victoriously, we believe that the sooner constitutional government is implemented, the better. Therefore, the convening of the National Assembly cannot be delayed any longer. I sincerely hope that all fellow countrymen and representatives from all parties can sincerely and genuinely assist the government in this policy for the sake of the country and the people, and promote the early convening of the National Assembly in order to seek the early completion of democratic politics, which must not be delayed any longer. Because the end of the War of Resistance is precisely the time when the great cause of national construction begins, the government's policy-making will be based on the highest principles, with the utmost sincerity. As long as the highest principle of revolutionary nation-building, the Three Principles of the People, is not shaken, and the legitimacy of the National Government of the Republic of China is not disturbed, all issues can be discussed openly and honestly, seeking reasonable and legal solutions. In particular, I hope that leaders from all sectors of society and from all parties can participate in the government and jointly plan the century-long plan for peaceful nation-building. Before the convening of the National Assembly, the government sincerely wishes to seek opinions widely and comprehensively, so as to avoid any shortcomings. Even the number of representatives to the National Assembly and other related issues can be reasonably increased and legally resolved in accordance with public sentiment.

### Freedom of Speech and Association

As for the issue of protecting the people's freedom, in addition to the National Government having already earnestly implemented the Law on the Protection of Personal Freedom, it has also decided to abolish the system of press censorship in the near future, so that the people have the freedom of speech, and will formulate and announce the Law on Political Associations, so that the people have the freedom of association, ensuring that all political parties have a common track and a legal status. In this way, people's livelihood politics can follow the examples of Britain and the United States to establish a model of five-power constitution. In short, if we want to realize democratic politics, we must base the administration of punishment on the rule of law and constitutional government as the guarantee of civil rights. The bad habits of the warlord era, in which military force was used to conduct politics and territory was used for self-consolidation, have long since passed and are not what a modern democratic country should have, nor are they permitted in an era of peaceful national construction. All domestic issues must be resolved through political methods, and all opinions must be restored to the track of law as a goal. Only then will the fundamental law jointly sought by our revolutionary martyrs and all fellow countrymen for the past fifty years not repeat the mistakes of the early years of the Republic of China. This is the only policy of our government and the most urgent need of the people of the whole country.

### Armies Must Be Nationalized

Third, national unification is an absolutely necessary element for modern nation-building. After the end of the War of Resistance, national unification must be guaranteed by the sincere cooperation of the entire people. We know that national unification is the only basis for democratic constitutional government. Only a unified country can maintain the fruits of the final victory, and only a unified country can guarantee the democratic system, promote public opinion, concentrate people's strength, maintain the independence of sovereignty, complete the great plan of national construction, and contribute to international peace and world prosperity. The only prerequisite for us to achieve national unification is that our national army must be nationalized. Within the territory of our country, there will no longer be private armies, nor will there be armies of any one party. Only when the army is not subject to personal private interests or the prejudice of one party can national unification have a solid foundation.

Today, on behalf of the government, I specifically declare that all armies that are part of the national organization and that obey military orders will be treated equally and will not be discriminated against in any way. Moreover, the KMT party organization within the army, which has been in place for 20 years, has now been completely abolished to set an example for the nationalization of the army. We hope that all fellow countrymen will recognize that the unification of military orders and political orders is the lifeline of the survival of the nation and will work together to realize it, maintain it, and sincerely make an earnest appeal for the future of our country and the welfare of the people.

### Jointly Shoulder the Burden of National Construction

The above three points are our current minimum facilities and most urgent requirements. As long as fellow countrymen review the history of the revolution and accept the lessons of the War of Resistance, they will be able to understand that construction must follow destruction, and then the pain and sacrifice suffered during the period of destruction will be considered a valuable price paid. For eight years, my fellow countrymen in the Chongqing area have either been displaced in foreign lands or impoverished and sick. The widows and orphans of the deceased have not yet been consoled, and our fellow countrymen in the rear, who have served in the military, have forgotten their families for the country, and those who have engaged in production have shouldered heavy burdens. Thinking of this, I cannot help but tremble with fear. Therefore, our future work is not only to restore wartime to peacetime, but also to transform unemployment into employment. Our country's foundation is weaker than that of any of the Allied countries, and our time of resistance is longer than that of any of the Allied countries. We must not only, on the ruins of war, sincerely unite and build a modern country with one heart and one mind, but also strengthen our national power and jointly assume the responsibility for international peace and world prosperity with the United Nations. Having deeply experienced the pain after destruction, and facing the long-term task of national construction, I deeply feel the arduousness of the work and the weight of the responsibility. I sincerely hope that all fellow countrymen will actively promote the above-mentioned minimum facilities and most urgent requirements with one mind and one heart, in order to complete them. Our past work was military first and victory first. Our future efforts will focus on national unification and political democracy. We can only complete the task of national construction by following the road of unification and democracy. Only by implementing the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father can we jointly enter the realm of abundant national power and people's prosperity and happiness. The aspirations of the fifty years of the National Revolution and the wishes of the eight years of the War of Resistance lie in this greatest and final success. In short, we must face the reality of the country's devastation over the past eight years with a spirit of harmony, kinship, mutual assistance, and mutual aid, and lead the country to recovery. We must also use a spirit of perseverance, hard work, self-awareness, and self-encouragement to make our China stand among the ranks of equal and free modern countries, in order to comfort the expectations of international friends. Today, I recall the original intention of the War of Resistance, pay tribute to the loyal and courageous martyrs, thank the aid of friendly countries, and remember the suffering of the people. I truly feel infinite emotion. I especially announce this domestic policy to the national people, hoping that we will be sincere and frank, and jointly pledge our sincerity and take responsibility to realize the urgent demands of our country and nation, and achieve the mission of common struggle and common construction of our entire nation.

### The Capital Celebrates with a Grand Rally; Chairman Chiang Tours the City; The People Cheer and Their Spirits Are High

Chongqing, 3rd â€“ The 3rd was the first day of the capital's victory celebration. The whole city was decorated with flags, and the streets and alleys were packed with people, causing traffic to be cut off for six hours. Millions of citizens were intoxicated in this once-in-a-millennium joy. At 9:00 a.m., the capital's various sectors held a victory celebration rally at the school grounds in the central district. The "Voice of Peace" and a hundred salutes were fired at the same time. At 11:20 a.m., Chairman Chiang rode in a car from his official residence to tour the city and receive the citizens' greetings. The Chairman, wearing a grass-green military uniform, a long sword, and gloves, sat in a black-green convertible car with a smiling face, kind and amiable, giving the millions of citizens standing on the side of the road a sense of warmth, and they could not help but cheer for the Chairman. The Chairman also frequently raised his hand in response. Soon, the Chairman went to the Military Affairs Commission to rest for a while. At that time, the square in front of the Military Affairs Commission was already filled with countless citizens waiting for a long time. When they saw the Chairman, they waved small flags, applauded enthusiastically, or shouted "Long live," and their joy and encouragement were beyond description. At 11:54 a.m., the Chairman took the convertible car again from the Military Affairs Commission to tour the city. This was the first time in eight years. Chief of Staff Cheng Dai sat next to the Chairman. The Chairman's car was led by three motorcycles, followed by a jeep with a flag officer holding a large flag that read "Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission." Next came the Chairman's car. The heads of the three branches of government, Ju Zheng, Dai Jitao, and Yu Youren, as well as Wu Tiecheng, Feng Yuxiang, Bai Chongxi, Wu Dingchang, Lu Chao, Chen Lifu, Chen Cheng, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Guozhen, Gu Zhenggang, Wang Yizhi, Mo Dehui, He Guoguang, Fang Zhi, He Yaozu, and Kang Xinru followed in cars. At 12:00 noon, the Chairman arrived at the central intersection, and the military music played loudly. The honor guard paid their respects with rifles, and the citizens cheered and applauded. The Chairman's car slowly passed through the Victory Gate, took the school ground entrance, and turned to the People's Rights Road, and turned toward Guo Jie Lou and Lin Shen Road. The streets that the Chairman passed were crowded with people, and traffic was blocked, leaving only a single path for the Chairman's car to pass. The citizens who were close to the Chairman were no more than nine feet away. The impression that the Chairman gave to the citizens was naturally amiable and approachable, and it had never been as deep as it was today. At 12:40 p.m., the Chairman returned to his official residence.

The Grandeur of the Parade

At 12:30 p.m., the grand parade of all sectors began, with 50,000 to 60,000 participants. By 3:30 p.m., the parade gradually dispersed, and traffic in the city began to recover.

Enshi, 2nd â€“ The troops of General Sun Dingchao, under the command of our Commander Sun Weiru, officially took over Yichang and Tumen at dawn on the 2nd.

Central News Agency, MacArthur Headquarters, 3rd â€“ An American Broadcasting Company reporter broadcast from Yokohama that MacArthur will go to Tokyo tomorrow to discuss with senior Japanese officials the best date for the Allied forces to enter Tokyo. It is generally believed that they will be able to enter Tokyo in a week or ten days.

According to Tokyo Radio on the 3rd, Supreme Allied Commander MacArthur has decided to set up his headquarters in Tokyo and will come to Tokyo around the 10th.

Central News Agency, MacArthur Headquarters, 2nd, United Press â€“ Personnel at MacArthur's headquarters said that Admiral Nimitz planned to complete the occupation of Japanese territory as soon as possible without using naval infantry to land on the beaches.

### Legal Tender and Customs Gold Units Circulate in Beijing, Value Soars

Nanjing, 3rd â€“ In the past, counterfeit currency was abundant here, and legal tender was extremely difficult to find. But since personnel from various central government agencies and advance units of the national army have successively arrived in Beijing, legal tender and customs gold units have been circulating in the market. A small number of merchants inevitably discriminated against the legal tender because they were unaware of the situation. Now, after the explanation of various relevant agencies, it is generally accepted. Last month, one yuan of legal tender could buy goods worth one hundred yuan. In recent days, the concept of merchants and the public has changed greatly, and they value the legal tender extremely highly. Therefore, the value of the legal tender is soaring, and each yuan can now buy goods worth two hundred yuan.

### Land Taxes in Occupied Provinces Will Be Exempted This Year; National Government Issued a Clear Order Yesterday

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd â€“ The National Government's order on September 3rd: For many years, the Japanese warlords have used their violence to exploit China in various ways. After September 18th, they intensified their efforts, including our provinces in the Northeast. By July 7th, they even launched a challenge at Lugou Bridge, and their ambition to annex our country was clearly visible. In order to defend national independence and survival and establish lasting world peace, the National Government had no choice but to lead our entire military and civilians to rise up in resistance to maintain the glory of the nation and uphold international integrity. It has repeatedly declared to China and foreign countries that the time and the situation, although the forms of strength and weakness were vastly different, the justice of right and wrong was clear. Our government followed the teachings of the Founding Father and the revolutionary strategies, adhered to a consistent national policy, and gained the sympathy of the world. Together with our allied nations who uphold justice and love peace, we launched a concerted attack. Since Italy and Germany were defeated one after another, Japan became isolated. Now, its power is exhausted and it has surrendered unconditionally to our Allied nations. The war has ended from this, and the national foundation has been laid. After eight years of enemy atmosphere, it has finally cleared up. It has washed away the national humiliation of fifty years, restored the rivers and mountains of twenty provinces, and liberated the whole country. The whole country is celebrating, and it is difficult to restrain the emotion. Since the beginning of the war, much land has been ravaged, lives have been tragically murdered, and property has been subjected to horizontal losses, even to the point of soldiers going to justice and the people bearing heavy burdens, and the suffering of the people in the occupied areas is painful and sad. Now, I especially issue a clear order that all provinces that have been occupied by the enemy should be exempted from land taxes for one year. Other provinces in the rear, which are relied upon for military food and civilian food this year, will also be allowed to exempt from land taxes next year. The rest of the rent reduction and light interest, as well as all resettlement matters, will be the responsibility of governments at all levels and competent authorities to formulate methods in accordance with the 25% rent reduction and other relevant provisions of the political program and policies related to people's livelihood by November 12 of this year, and implement them in sequence. Our national people are in a time of great difficulty, the beginning of recovery and restoration, and we must remember the lesson of being humiliated, and not neglect the warning of drought. The War of Resistance is difficult to end, and nation-building is just beginning. The task is heavy and the road is long. It is hoped that the whole country will be united in one heart and one mind, and that we will be more diligent and advanced, using the spirit of loyalty, courage, perseverance, and perseverance of the War of Resistance for the sustained and unremitting efforts of nation-building. Then the victory that has been achieved can be guaranteed, and the great cause of restoration can be completed. This is a special announcement, and we must encourage each other.

### The Central Government Held a Remote Sacrifice Yesterday - President Chiang Led the Ceremony

Chongqing, 3rd â€“ With the Allied victory, world peace, universal celebration, and shared joy throughout the world, the central government held a remote sacrifice eastward at 8:30 AM in the National Government Garden to the mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China.

The task is arduous and the road is long, and he hoped everyone would work hard. After the speech, the assembly shouted slogans and the ceremony concluded.

### Open Letter to the Nation from the Kuomintang (Part Two) - Hoping for Unity of Purpose to Complete the Great Task of National Reconstruction

Consistent Policy in Handling Domestic Affairs

That is, the guiding principles for our compatriots in handling domestic issues remain unchanged. The policy during the period of the 17th year of the Republic [1928] was, "Whether or not the Party can live up to the mission of revolution and national construction, and whether China can be saved through the National Revolution, all depend on actual deeds and require long-term, arduous efforts. Any narrow-minded insistence on one's own views that aggravates the difficulties of the revolutionary environment is unacceptable, except for the firm adherence to all the teachings left by the Founding Father, which cannot be shaken in the slightest. Everything else can be reconciled and tolerated." As we celebrate the victory of the War of Resistance today, we must deeply understand that this wisdom and guidance of the Party's President not only determined the victory of the War of Resistance but is also essential for the success of national construction. Ultimately, complete success depends on the joint efforts of all compatriots. As early as in the Alliance Society's declaration, the Founding Father explained the meaning of the National Revolution, that everyone should bear the responsibility of the revolution, and the government is merely the leading agency. The government's achievements are the people's achievements. Later, in his will, he instructed the Party to awaken the masses to fight together. The Party has not dared to forget these teachings while leading the War of Resistance. Our compatriots, too, have contributed money and effort without complaint during the long War of Resistance of over eight years, creating today's victory. After the fall of the capital, the Party asked our compatriots to concentrate their will and strength to resist the war and build the country at the same time. Our compatriots, in various levels of people's representative bodies, discarded prejudices, broke down barriers, and contributed everything to benefit the war and national construction. When the international situation was unfavorable to us, the Party asked our compatriots to uphold the spirit of self-reliance in resisting the war and prepare to face the most adverse circumstances. Our compatriots dutifully followed this advice and did not lose heart due to the perilous situation. When the unequal treaties were abolished and friendly nations offered sincere assistance, the Party urged our compatriots not to be complacent or lax, but to strive even harder, recognizing that only self-strengthening can achieve true freedom, and only self-reliance can achieve true independence.

Sacrificing and Fighting to the End to Achieve Victory

Our compatriots were able to encourage and respect themselves, avoid harboring any thoughts of seeking luck or relying on others, and avoid the mistakes of complacency and relaxation. In particular, the compatriots in the occupied areas, although constantly subjected to the whips, killings, rapes, and plundering by the enemy and puppet regime, were often able to secretly receive orders from the Supreme Commander, sincerely obey the Party's principles, report the enemy and puppet regime's plans, and destroy their arrangements. Furthermore, they were able to resist the enemy and puppet regime's coercion, refuse to be utilized by them, and sacrifice their families and lives under irresistible circumstances, never compromising their national integrity. As for the millions of soldiers and civilians across the country, all were compatriots known for their loyalty and courage. No matter how arduous the fighting or how insufficient the supplies, they were able to accept the demands of the Supreme Commander and the entire nation, sacrifice themselves, and fight across thousands of miles, resisting a superior enemy with inferior equipment for as long as eight years, ultimately achieving today's victory. Overseas Chinese, despite facing great calamities, either remained in their original locations to fight against the enemy and puppet regime, or abandoned their businesses and returned to the country to serve loyally in the War of Resistance. All these rare and valuable aspirations and achievements are due to our compatriots' ability to recognize the meaning of the National Revolution and fulfill their responsibilities in the National Revolution. The Founding Father's teaching that "the revolutionary cause is initiated by the people and also accomplished by the people" has been realized in this War of Resistance. The Party, mindful of its roots, wishes to sincerely express to our compatriots that all the strength comes from our compatriots, and all the success belongs to our compatriots.

### Welcoming Mr. Du Yuesheng

Mr. Du Yuesheng arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday afternoon. People from all walks of life gathered at the station to welcome him upon hearing the news. Standing from the perspective of Shanghai citizens, we also express our heartfelt welcome.

We welcome Mr. Du and, at the same time, have three expectations for Mr. Du:

First, Mr. Du is a social leader who has made many contributions to Shanghai's local public welfare and the welfare of its citizens in the past, especially through acts of chivalry and justice that have been widely praised. At the beginning of the Shanghai Battle, Mr. Du, in his capacity as the president of the Shanghai Local Association, led the people in dedicating themselves to supporting the war effort, enhancing the strength of the National Army in fighting against the enemy. His contributions were remarkable. Later, when the National Army withdrew to the west, Mr. Du did not care for his personal property and business in Shanghai and resolutely left Shanghai to continue his efforts in supporting the war in various rear areas. This spirit of sacrificing oneself for the country and taking righteousness over profit is truly admirable, and his trustworthy actions are especially appreciated.

Second, although Mr. Du has been separated from the people of Shanghai for eight years, the people of Shanghai know of Mr. Du's diligence in serving the country during these eight years. Therefore, Mr. Du's return to Shanghai has further enhanced his reputation in the eyes of the citizens. Shanghai's social undertakings are in urgent need of rectification and revitalization. The responsibility is arduous, and we firmly believe that Mr. Du will contribute his efforts and make further contributions to local public welfare and the welfare of the citizens to meet the aspirations of the citizens.

Third, in the process of future revival and construction, the demand for a clean and transparent local government is a prerequisite. Especially in Shanghai, which has always been an important city with international attention, it is even more necessary to promote revitalization and construction in an excellent political environment. The creation of an excellent political environment depends on wise and enlightened municipal officials. At the same time, there must be wise and fair social leaders to assist and cooperate to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, our expectations for Mr. Du will naturally be even more sincere.

All of Mr. Du's past achievements are evident to the people of Shanghai. Rather than offering words of praise, we would rather directly contribute the sincerity that the public expects. At the same time, we firmly believe that all of this will be gladly accepted by progressive social leaders.
