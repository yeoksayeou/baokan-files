Details of the Surrender Signing Ceremony

Special Dispatch from the Reporter at the Chinese Army Headquarters in China, Sent from Nanjing on the 9th: The Japanese surrender signing ceremony in the China Theater, which has attracted worldwide attention, was successfully completed today in the auditorium of the Chinese Army Headquarters in 20 minutes. The location of the signing ceremony was the site of the auditorium of the Central Military Academy, the cradle of our revolutionary soldiers. Huangpu Road was filled with military police and troops of the New Sixth Army transported here by air, serving as security. Every ten steps along the road from Xuan Gate to the auditorium, the flags of the Allied nations were erected. Between each flag stood a guard soldier with modern equipment, dressed in green autumn uniforms, steel helmets, and leather boots, spirited and awe-inspiring. The signing ceremony began precisely at 9:00 AM. Foreign and Chinese guests began entering the venue at 8:30 AM. At 8:52 AM, General Yasuji Okamura and other Japanese surrender representatives arrived in three cars, led by Colonel Wang Wu of the Chinese Army, to the Chinese Army Headquarters. As they alighted from the cars in the plaza, Chinese and foreign reporters scrambled to take photographs. Colonel Wang then led the Japanese surrender representatives into the lounge. By this time, all attendees were seated according to their assigned places. The surrender seat was located in the center of the auditorium, with a smaller long table in front of it for the Japanese surrender representatives. Behind them stood twelve neat and solemn soldiers. The surrender seat and the surrender seat were surrounded by white silk. To the left were the seats for senior generals and Chinese reporters, and to the right were the seats for Allied officers and foreign reporters. A total of one thousand people attended. At 8:56 AM, General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, accompanied by four officers participating in the surrender acceptance, entered the venue. Chinese and foreign officers and guests stood up to greet them. Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin sat in the center of the surrender seat, with Admiral Chen Shaokuan of the Navy to his left, Colonel Zhang Tingmeng of the Air Force, and General Gu Zhutong of the Army to his right, and Lieutenant General Xiao Yisu of the Army. A clock and a set of Chinese stationery were placed in the center of the surrender seat. At 8:58 AM, Lieutenant General Wang Jun of the Chinese Army led the Japanese surrender representatives into the venue. They first stood at attention in the designated position and bowed 45 degrees to Commander-in-Chief He. Commander-in-Chief He nodded in acknowledgement and instructed them to sit down. The Japanese surrender representatives then sat down in the designated seats at the surrender seat. General Yasuji Okamura, Supreme Commander of the Japanese forces in China, sat in the center, facing Commander-in-Chief He, and looked up at the flags of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union hanging in the venue. Lieutenant General Saburo Kobayashi, Chief of Staff of the Japanese forces in China, Major General Takeo Imai, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese forces in China, and Lieutenant Colonel Gensaku Ogasawara, Staff Officer of the Japanese forces in China, sat to the left of General Okamura in order. Vice Admiral Ryosuke Fukuda, Commander of the Japanese Naval Fleet in Chinese Waters, Lieutenant General Haruki Takihyama, Chief of Staff of the Taiwan Army, and Colonel Tatsuo Misawa, Chief of Staff of the 38th Army, sat to the right in order. The Japanese delegation consisted of seven people, all in military uniform but without swords. The Japanese translator, Hideo Motomura, was still wearing the gray plain clothes he wore during the surrender negotiations, standing at attention behind General Okamura. When Okamura sat down, he placed his military cap on the table, and then held it in his hand throughout the ceremony. After the Japanese representatives were seated, Commander-in-Chief He announced to the Chinese and foreign reporters (five minutes for photography). Chinese and foreign reporters became busy, capturing the graceful demeanor of our surrender acceptance officers and the somber-faced Japanese surrender representatives in their lenses. At 9:04 AM, Commander-in-Chief He ordered General Okamura to present the credentials. Okamura then ordered Chief of Staff Kobayashi to hand them to Commander-in-Chief He. After inspecting them, He kept the credentials and handed two copies of the Chinese text of the Japanese surrender document to Chief of Staff Xiao for delivery to Okamura. Okamura stood up, accepted the documents with both hands, hastily read through the surrender documents, and signed both copies, placing his seal under the signature. After Okamura signed and sealed the documents, Chief of Staff Kobayashi held both copies of the surrender documents to the surrender seat and presented them to Commander-in-Chief He with both hands. After inspecting them, He signed and sealed the Japanese surrender documents with a calm and composed demeanor. He then ordered Chief of Staff Xiao to deliver one copy of the surrender documents to Okamura, who stood up to accept it. Commander-in-Chief He then handed Order No. 1 from Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Supreme Commander of the China Theater, together with the order receipt certificate, to Okamura through Chief of Staff Xiao. Okamura signed and sealed the receipt certificate and ordered Chief of Staff Kobayashi to present the receipt certificate to Commander-in-Chief He. At this point, Commander-in-Chief He announced the Japanese representatives' withdrawal. Lieutenant General Wang Jun led the Japanese representatives from their seats and bowed respectfully to Commander-in-Chief He before leaving the auditorium. Commander-in-Chief He stood up in response. After the Japanese representatives left the venue, Commander-in-Chief He delivered a broadcast speech, announcing to the country and the world that the Japanese surrender signing ceremony had been successfully completed in Nanjing. Upon completion of the speech, the entire venue erupted in applause. Deputy Section Chief Bao Jingan then translated it into English. As soon as the translation was finished, the entire venue applauded again. Commander-in-Chief He then led the surrender acceptance personnel out of the venue, taking with him the writing brush he used to sign, to be kept as a permanent memento. Chinese and foreign guests flocked to Commander-in-Chief He, shaking his hand to congratulate him, and took photos in front of the auditorium to commemorate the occasion. The final act of the greatest tragedy in human history thus came to an end.

The mausoleum avenue stretched from Zhongshan Gate to the foot of Zijin Mountain, with lush green foliage on both sides and the sound of pine trees whispering. Nanjing, scarred by war, was unique in that this area retained its former scenery. Ten minutes later, they arrived at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, climbed the steps, and entered the memorial hall where the mausoleum was located. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's statue sat solemnly amidst several gardens. Viewing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's remains with infinite excitement on this day, his nobility and sanctity felt even greater than in the past. He and his entourage paid their respects and presented flowers, then entered the inner hall to view the coffin under candlelight. They left the hall at 4:40 PM and briefly viewed the surrounding scenery, only to see a vast expanse of pine forest at the foot of the mountain, with no trace of the former residences. Most of the magnificent buildings had been reduced to ashes during the eight years of war.
