Editorial

### Maintaining Social Order: Reflections on Reading the Statements of Chiang's Representative and Deputy Mayor Wu

Since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, ostensibly willing to surrender unconditionally, our compatriots throughout the country, with the ultimate realization of the eight-year War of Resistance, have been overjoyed and invigorated. In particular, the compatriots in the occupied areas, who have long been mired in darkness and suffering, have rediscovered the light. The knots of emotion have since loosened, and they cannot help but dance for joy.

However, during this transitional period when the Japanese army has surrendered but not yet been fully disarmed, and the Central Government has achieved victory but has not yet formally taken over the political power of the occupied cities, all our citizens must be especially vigilant and self-respecting to prevent patriotic motives from leading to national errors. Those agencies and responsible personnel of the Central Government who have arrived in the occupied areas must, at this time, serve as models for the people, prioritizing the maintenance of social order and the guidance of the normal life of the masses. The actions of their staff must be restrained by strict discipline so that compatriots in the occupied areas may witness and be convinced, thereby generating sincere gratitude to the Central Government and its affiliates, and moreover, generating sincere love and support for the central leaders. Only then can all major policies be gradually and smoothly advanced. This applies not only to one locality or one city but to all occupied areas, so that not only will treacherous elements have nowhere to hide, but also the perception of our country by the allied nations will surely increase its level of respect.

In terms of the actual dynamics of this city [Shanghai], to speak frankly, there have been some phenomena in recent weeks that cannot but cause concerned individuals to worry. However, given the complexity of the situation in Shanghai and the uniqueness of the environment, fortunately, no serious incidents have occurred. We cannot but admire the wise leadership and the arduous struggle of the special envoys of the Central Government. Reading the statements issued by Mr. Jiang Bocheng, the representative of Chairman Chiang, and Mr. Wu Shaoshu, the Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, further increases our admiration and gratitude.

Representative Chiang stated that the military period has ended, and all actions must follow the right path. Deputy Mayor Wu first advised the citizens to abide by Chairman Chiang's exhortation to eliminate hostile sentiments towards the Japanese military and civilians, which is the attitude that a great nation should have and is also essential for maintaining order today. Secondly, Deputy Mayor Wu warned all parties that the punishment of traitors is governed by the laws of the nation, and free action is not allowed. Even accusations, investigations, trials, and judgments have a set procedure. At the same time, the severity of the crimes and the balance of merits and demerits must be considered, and no rash measures should be taken. The property of traitors should also be handled in accordance with the law and should not be arbitrarily disposed of. All of this is necessary to maintain social order. Otherwise, the free actions of various agencies and individuals may result in true traitors being able to speculate again, and a sense of fear may spread throughout society. Deputy Mayor Wu further hoped that all agencies and representatives in Shanghai would abide by the instructions of Mr. Jiang Bocheng, the representative of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and register with the representative's office as soon as possible to avoid impersonation. The acceptance of agencies, schools, groups, etc., should be handled uniformly by the Central Government. All of this is the fundamental policy for preventing the infiltration of traitors, stabilizing public sentiment, and maintaining social order today.

We are fortunate to have the wise and timely instructions of Representative Chiang and Deputy Mayor Wu, and we deeply hope that all sectors of the city will understand the intentions of the two gentlemen, work together, maintain local order, welcome the Central Government's return to the capital and the day of the final victory celebration, and further prepare to concentrate the strength of all citizens to seek the new construction of a great Shanghai.

### Hurricane Occurs Near Japan, Landing Must be Postponed for Two Days; Allied Forces to Enter Kyushu on September 1st

Manila, 25th (Central News Agency) – MacArthur's headquarters announced that the landing operation had to be delayed by 48 hours due to successive hurricanes hitting the Ryukyu Islands and Japan. It is hoped that the wind and waves will be reduced by that time, to a level that will allow for landing. The surrender ceremony will be changed to September 2nd.

Manila, 25th (Central News Agency) – Marshal MacArthur's headquarters announced today that all plans previously set for the Japanese surrender had been postponed for 48 hours due to the hurricane. According to the Allied nations' notification to Japan, all intentions of the Allied side upon landing and the various materials that Japan should provide have been communicated. However, other parts of the occupation plan remain confidential, just like wartime military operations. Troopships, under the cover of the Third Fleet, will head to Tokyo. Once the landing begins, the US Marines on board will land in the Tokyo area. The first target of the occupying forces in Tokyo Bay will naturally be the Yokosuka Naval Base. US naval experts will inspect the secrets of the base at that time.

Chongqing, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a broadcast from Tokyo Radio, Fukuoka news reports that the Western Military District Command issued a public announcement stating that the Allied occupation forces in the Kyushu area will begin landing around 10:00 AM on September 1st. Two aircraft of the advance force will land at Kanoya Airfield in Kagoshima Prefecture. Allied occupation forces transported by air will land at Kanoya Airfield. Allied surface ships will begin transporting troops to land near Takasu. The activities of the occupying forces will be restricted to the Kanoya-Takasu area.

### Delegations from Various Countries to Go to Tokyo Bay to Participate in the Signing of the Surrender

Manila, 24th (Central News Agency) – Our delegation is scheduled to leave Manila by ship on the 25th with delegations from other countries to sail to Tokyo Bay to participate in the signing of the Japanese surrender agreement. Marshal MacArthur will fly there later. About 90 war correspondents will fly from here to Okinawa and then to Tokyo. More than 100 officers from MacArthur's headquarters will also fly from here on the same day. In order to obtain sufficient seating, the headquarters is now making every effort to use long-range aircraft, including B24 bombers, to allow journalists to send this historic news from Atsugi Airfield. Due to the inadequacy of Japanese telecommunications equipment, all news concerning the signing of the surrender agreement will be carried to Okinawa by special plane and then relayed to all parts of the world. However, it is hoped that news dispatches can be sent directly from Japan within two or three days after the signing of the surrender agreement.

### Japanese Government Requests to Send Reporters to Participate

Chongqing, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a US News Agency dispatch from Manila on the 24th, the Japanese government today requested Marshal MacArthur to allow Japanese reporters and news photographers to take photos and videos during the formal surrender ceremony and the Allied landing in Japan. There are about 25 reporters in the Kanoya area, and about 40 people will be present at Atsugi, Yokosuka, and on US battleships.

### Terauchi Decides to Send Numata to Mingaladon; Statement to Delhi Radio Yesterday Morning

Headquarters of Allied Forces in Burma, 24th (Central News Agency) – General Count Hisaichi Terauchi, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, spoke on Saigon Radio at 9:50 AM today.

Field Correspondent of Reuters in Burma, 24th (Central News Agency) – Senior Officer Abuyaing met with a special Japanese envoy in a small wooden house a few miles east of West Tangkhone this afternoon.

### Soviet Troops Prepare to Occupy Japanese Northern Islands and Hokkaido; Japan Considers it Very Regrettable

San Francisco, 25th (Associated Press) – Tokyo broadcast that, according to a report from Moscow Radio, Soviet airborne troops are now preparing to occupy Japan's northernmost islands and Hokkaido. The Japanese government telegraphed MacArthur: "If this report is true, the Japanese government considers it very regrettable.

### Large Numbers of Japanese People Committing Mass Suicide

San Francisco, 25th (Associated Press) – According to broadcasts intercepted here from Tokyo, large numbers of Japanese people gathered in front of the Imperial Palace today and committed mass suicide by seppuku. The broadcast reported that because the date of the Allied landing was imminent, large numbers of Japanese people were committing suicide by seppuku. According to a commentator in Tokyo, this kind of traditional Japanese spirit of suicide cannot be understood by the European and American Allied nations. The Japanese nation has a special sensitivity and has gone all out during the war. However, today, with blocked transportation and leaky houses, the suffering of defeat is boundless. A feeling of grief and anger is difficult to express. Since the suicide of the Minister of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations, the trend of seppuku has spread throughout the Japanese archipelago.

Local Communications

### Qingpu County, Jinze Township

— Jū Jiā

From Shanghai, take a car on the Qinghu Highway to Qingpu, then transfer to a motorboat to Zhujiajiao, and finally take a rowboat or sailboat to reach Jinze Township. It is a town with a population of approximately 10,000.

Geography and Transportation

Jinze Township is bordered by Dianshan Lake to the north, Lianhu Lake to the east, and large lakes to the west and south. It is a town surrounded by water on all sides. Together with Shangta and Xicen, it forms the Jin-Shang-Xi three townships, the westernmost town in Qingpu County. It also borders Wujiang County and Jiashan County in Zhejiang Province, making it a town at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.

Because the town is surrounded by large lakes, the only way to travel to and from other places is by boat. Before the war, the motorboat routes to other places included the Songjin Line, from the town to Songjiang; the Shangbei Line from Shanghai to Beiku; and the Zhuhe Line from Zhujiajiao to Jiashan, all of which passed through the town. After the war, although there were several attempts to restore these routes, they were all suspended due to the insecurity and frequent robberies, replaced by rowboats and sailboats. Currently, navigable routes include: east to Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, and Shanghai; south to Zhangliantang, Songjiang, and other places; west to Luxu, Wujiang, and other places; and north to Suzhou and other places. However, these routes are often suspended due to robberies or the imposition of extra taxes.

The postal service is a branch office managed by the Zhujiajiao Post Office. However, due to frequent delays in mail delivery, boatmen and rowers are entrusted to deliver mail to places with boat traffic.

Town Appearance and Security

Although the town has not been affected by the war, it is located in a remote area and suffers from poor transportation, making it a frequent target for bandits. After several invasions and disturbances by bandits, only a portion of the houses remain. Other areas, such as the town center, have been reduced to rubble. Although some small houses have been built for business, it is not as prosperous as before.

In terms of commerce, the exchange of agricultural products and daily necessities is the main focus. The manufacturing industry is underdeveloped. Currently, there are several oil mills and distilleries, but their products are not sufficient to meet local needs. Other daily necessities are supplied by Zhujiajiao, Xitang, Suzhou, and other places. Before the military grain collection ended in May of this year, the town had already finished its quota, so vendors used this place as a trading market. For a time, rice shops, rice mills, and millet stores were abundant, and commercial activity was more prosperous than in other places.

As for security, it can be said that this is the worst town in Qingpu County. One day, one army comes; the next day, another army leaves, creating a great commotion. As a result, various donations and taxes are forcibly collected. Corrupt officials also mingle among them to fill their own pockets, leaving the citizens in a situation where they dare to be angry but do not dare to speak out. Therefore, they are hoping that the authorities will quickly come to crack down on these lawless elements, so that the citizens can live and work in peace.

Products and Local Customs

Agricultural products are the most abundant, with large yields of rice, wheat, beans, melons, and vegetables, sufficient to supply the local area with a surplus. Due to the abundance of rivers and lakes, aquatic products are also very rich, with yields of fish, shrimp, crabs, yellow eels, eels, soft-shelled turtles, and other products higher than in other parts of Qingpu County. There is also a large number of fishermen who depend on fishing for a living. In addition, Zhuangyuan cake, a local specialty, is famous throughout the Jiangnan region. However, due to the recent soaring sugar prices, there has been some corner-cutting and ingredient reduction, so the taste is not as good as before. Now that autumn has arrived, the yield of water caltrop is also high.

The residents of the town are mostly Buddhist. Every year on the 27th day of the third lunar month and the Double Ninth Festival on the 9th day of the ninth lunar month, there is a custom of welcoming gods and holding temple fairs. During these days, peddlers from various places gather here, and many devout men and women from various places come to burn incense. Pilgrims come from as far away as Shanghai, Jiangbei, and other places to burn incense and worship Buddha. The scene is almost as grand as the god-welcoming ceremony in Jiangwan.

Education and Religion

Before the war, the town had a county-run elementary school. Today, there is only one county-run elementary school, enrolling more than 300 students. However, the teachers have a low level of education. Often, those who have not graduated from elementary school are also teaching. The low level of the students can also be imagined. There are no middle schools. If one wants to pursue further education, one must go to other towns.

The town has many temples. It is said that in the past, many officials were supposed to be produced here, but after someone broke the spell, many Yin officials were added. Among them, Yíhào Temple (commonly known as Big Temple) is the largest. It is said to have been built before the Ming Dynasty and was equal to Jing Temple and Lingyun Temple in Hangzhou. However, after several fires, only a mountain gate and a few newly built small houses remain. Seeing this cannot help but evoke a sense of desolation.

Shangta and Xicen

Shangta is a town more than ten li away from Jinze on the shore of Dianshan Lake, second only to Jinze. The town's commerce is developed, but due to its location in the wilderness, it is easy for bandits to enter and exit. Most of the town's famous and wealthy merchants have fled to other places, so the current commerce is in decline and the town appearance is far from what it used to be.

Xicen is six li east of Jinze and eighteen li west of Zhujiajiao. It is a small town slightly larger than a village. The town has no more than a few dozen shops, and they all have very little capital, so the amount of commercial transactions is not large. Every morning, the whole town is filled with villagers, and the teahouses and taverns are noisy. It is truly a place for villagers to relax and enjoy themselves.

### Our Three-Year Construction Plan Requires US$2 Billion – Premier Song Finalizes Arrangements in the United States

Washington, 24th – Crowley, the executor of the Lend-Lease Act in the United States, announced six economic aid measures to the Allied countries today as a replacement for the Lend-Lease Act. He also revealed that he had discussed post-war matters with our Premier Song Ziwen and finalized a three-year plan.

Allied countries can obtain all items that have been purchased and are currently being manufactured, but must pay annual interest of 2.875% for a period of 30 years. Allied countries can purchase goods stored in Allied countries based on the principles of cash payment and loans. For 60 days after the victory over Japan is declared, Allied countries can continue to obtain labor and facilities from the US Foreign Economic Administration. The United States will continue to provide shipping facilities for 30 days after the victory over Japan is declared to meet the needs of Allied countries. The United States still intends to use the Lend-Lease Act to transport goods to Allied countries so that the Allied governments have time to prepare everything and continue the supply of goods according to (unclear code) or loan principles.

### Standing Committee of National Defense Joint Conference – Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Instructions (Continued)

Mutual Love Among East Asian Nations

Here, I want to tell you about the three main principles for realizing nationalism: First, our Chinese government and people must embrace the highest sincerity and unwavering determination to never emulate Japan's treatment of Korea. We must sincerely love and support the growth of all nations that possess the ability to govern themselves and the spirit of independence, so that they achieve the goals of autonomy and independence. We must reverse the actions of Japanese imperialism and establish a foundation of national autonomy, freedom, and equality on the East Asian continent, in the full light of our anti-aggression war. For fifty years, our Chinese Kuomintang National Revolution, overthrowing the Manchus and resisting Japan, has fought not only for China's own freedom and equality, but also for the liberation and independence of Korea. From today onwards, we must adhere to the same principles and jointly respect the principles of national independence and equality with all relevant Allied nations, and permanently guarantee the status they should obtain. Second, for nations outside the provinces that possess the ability to govern themselves and have the will to be independent, and that have reached a level of economic and political development that allows them to be independent, our country must automatically support their independence and freedom with a loving and friendly attitude and spirit, and permanently regard them as equal fraternal nations of China, without harboring ill will or discrimination because they are separated from the motherland. And our various nations must express their wishes to their motherland in a harmonious and affectionate manner, following legal procedures to achieve their goals, and must not take actions to resist the motherland, so as not to cause mutual hatred between nations. Third, all ethnic groups, large and small, within the provinces must be given equal political and legal rights, and full freedom of belief and economy without interference, in order to achieve the goal of sincere unity, mutual friendship, and mutual assistance among our various ethnic groups.

Supporting the Political Development of Tibet

The political status of the Tibetan nation was decided at the Sixth National Congress to grant it a high degree of autonomy and support its political progress and the well-being of its people. I can responsibly declare that if the Tibetan nation expresses a desire for self-government at this time, our government will certainly grant it a high degree of autonomy in accordance with our consistent sincerity. If they are able to achieve economic conditions for independence and autonomy in the future, our government will also support their independence, just as it did with Outer Mongolia, but Tibet must consolidate its own permanent independent status, so as not to repeat the past mistakes of Korea.

Solving the problems of Outer Mongolia and Tibet is a major task of our National Revolution and a stage in the realization of nationalism. We must take full responsibility for solving this problem. I hope that all my compatriots in the country will also assist the government in solving this problem, based on the principles of our National Revolution and the spirit of nationalism, so that it can achieve a satisfactory result. For the sake of world peace and security, and for the consolidation and construction of the country, our advocacy of the national question of all the world must be based on the spirit of the Atlantic Charter and the Three Principles of the People to seek a solution.

Expressing Wishes Regarding Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma

I must also express our Chinese wishes regarding the national questions of several ethnic groups on our southwestern border, from the perspective of world peace and security: First, the Burmese nation has a deep historical relationship with China. During the War of Resistance, China sent troops to Burma twice. The number of our expeditionary forces who were directly or indirectly injured or killed totaled more than 200,000, and the losses of overseas Chinese are still countless. However, we respect the sovereignty of our allies and abide by international treaties. Once the mission of our army on the Burmese battlefield is completed, it will be immediately withdrawn to its own country. We regard this as an obligation that we, as a member of the Allied countries, should fulfill, without any other demands. However, we hope that our allies will actively improve and raise the political status of the Burmese nation, and provide rapid and effective assistance to our overseas Chinese in Burma in returning to work. Second, the relationship between the Thai nation and China is even deeper and more widespread than that with other nations. Our China is the country that fought with Thailand and was the first to be affected. Therefore, China has no objection to Thailand's future inclusion in the China war zone. We have always believed that Thailand's declaration of war against the United Nations was passive and purely due to the coercion of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, we hope that Thailand will restore its inherent independent and equal status after the war, and especially hope to establish normal international friendly relations with China as soon as possible. Third, during the War of Resistance against the Annam nation, China suffered huge losses in life and property because the Annam government could not protect its sovereignty and provided Japan with a base for invading China. However, today, in order to abide by the agreements of the Allied countries, we are dispatching troops to accept the surrender of the Japanese troops in the area north of 16 degrees north latitude, and we have no territorial ambitions for Vietnam. Our hope is that the Vietnamese nation can gradually achieve independence from autonomy to realize the provisions of the Atlantic Charter.

The Status of Hong Kong to be Resolved Diplomatically

Later, we want to mention the Hong Kong issue. Hong Kong is a neighboring territory that shares the security of Guangdong. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was included in the China war zone. Now, when Japanese imperialism surrenders unconditionally, our China will never disregard international cooperation and the sovereignty of the Allied nations by taking advantage of the opportunity to accept the surrender. Therefore, we are unwilling to send troops to take over Hong Kong and cause misunderstandings among the Allied nations. But I can declare responsibly to the world and the national people: The status of Hong Kong was previously based on treaties between China and the United Kingdom, and will be amended in the future. It should also be established in accordance with the friendly consultation relationship between China and the United Kingdom. Our diplomatic policy and international policy advocate respecting treaties, based on law, and seeking reasonable solutions in accordance with the requirements of the times and actual needs. Now, all the concessions in China have been gradually recovered, and the lease treaty of Kowloon is no exception. However, our China will also take the diplomatic and treaty path between the two countries to solve this last outstanding problem.

Encouraging Unity and Dedicating to Revival

In short, this World War is an unprecedented war in human history. Today, all the Allied nations hope that this unprecedented war will be the last war. Our China has fought the longest and suffered the most, so we are the most eager for peace. We must do our best to promote the realization of everything that can promote domestic unity and international peace. We must fight to the end together with our allies around the world to establish a friendly relationship of independence and freedom for all the nations and countries of the world, to maintain all human spirits, and to build a permanent peaceful life based on mutual assistance, so as not to allow the discovery of power politics in the world again, and to prevent all the nations of the world from suffering from inequality, unfreedom, and all the suffering of poverty and terror. In this sense, I believe that the realization of the principles of national equality and national independence is the most urgent task. The National Government must, on the basis of China's founding spirit of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, and the consistent national policy of the National Revolution, take advantage of this dawn of world peace to implement nationalism. This is my lifelong wish and should be understood by friendly countries around the world. This is indeed the guarantee of world peace and China's stability. I hope that all my compatriots in the country will unite and work together to achieve this goal. Then, national revival and national construction can be completed in a short time, and the heroic spirits of the millions of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed in our eight-year War of Resistance can be comforted without regret. Since the First World War, the motto that our founding father Sun Yat-sen has taught us and exhorted the world will also be achieved.

### United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Concludes – Unanimously Approves Providing Relief to Taiwan and Korea

Central News Agency, London, 24th – The Third Session of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has held a total of thirteen plenary sessions and many group meetings since its opening. The meeting ended tonight. Our representatives Jiang Tingfu and Li Zhuomin left here to return to their country on the same night after the closing of the meeting. Before his departure, Jiang met with a reporter from the Central News Agency and said that China's relief and rehabilitation plan submitted to the UNRRA will be implemented as planned. The main points have not changed substantially, but some details need to be revised. The meeting unanimously approved the expansion of UNRRA's work to liberated areas such as Taiwan and Korea. Jiang believes that the most important thing is that the representatives of various countries are willing to help all countries restore their vitality in the post-war world and cooperate sincerely with this in mind. However, some discussions have also sparked heated debates. Later, regarding Sino-British relations, he said that the experience gained by the Chinese delegation at the UNRRA proves that the United Kingdom is one of China's true friends, and the prospects for close cooperation between China and the United Kingdom in the future are extremely bright.

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th – According to a report from the US News Agency, London, 24th: The representatives of various countries attending the Third Session of the Council of the UNRRA unanimously approved the provision of relief to Korea and Taiwan, and unanimously approved the request for all countries to donate more funds to the UNRRA, with the amount set at 1% of the country's fiscal revenue in the 1942-1943 fiscal year. US Assistant Secretary of State Clayton estimates that the cost of relief for Korea, Taiwan, Italy, and Austria will be $550 million. The UNRRA's work in Europe should be completed by the end of 1946, and in the Pacific and East Asia a few months later.

### World Federation of Trade Unions - Our Delegation Determined

Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - The World Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to convene in Paris on September 25th. Our national delegation has designated Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, as the head of the delegation. The members are An Futing (coal miner), Liu Songshan (railway worker), and Chen Tiefu (Chongqing power worker). They are scheduled to fly to France around the 5th of next month to attend the meeting.

### Chongqing Gold Prices - Minimal Fluctuations, Grain Prices Plummet

Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - Gold prices have fluctuated minimally in recent days. The opening price today was 88,000, followed by 88,009, with some transactions. The closing price was 88,000. The US dollar price hovered between 1,200 and 1,300 yuan throughout the day. Although the wholesale price of tung oil further dropped to 30,000 yuan per market catty, the retail price remained at 600-700 yuan per market catty. Retail Rong oil was 500 yuan per market catty, also higher than the wholesale price. Retail prices of general merchandise have begun to fall recently. According to those familiar with the market situation, with the opening of navigation on the Sichuan River imminent, it is feared that general merchandise prices will be difficult to improve.

Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - As the autumnal equinox approaches, new grains are successively appearing on the market. Moreover, due to the decline in prices of various goods in the past ten days, grain prices in the city have also fallen, especially the prices of coarse grains, which have dropped significantly.

### Automobiles to Switch to Right-Hand Traffic - To Be Implemented Starting New Year's Day Next Year

Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - The switch to right-hand traffic for automobiles is a major initiative for our country to adapt to the global trend. In principle, everything has been approved. However, the implementation date, during this period of urgent recovery, coupled with the fact that publicity has not yet been carried out in the recovered areas, leads to a deep concern that temporary haste will inevitably lead to many errors. The Wartime Transportation Administration has now submitted a request to the Military Affairs Commission to postpone the implementation until January 1st of next year. As soon as approval is granted, it will be implemented.

### German Scientists and Technicians - To Be Utilized by the United States

Frankfurt, Continental, September 25th (Central News Agency) - An American official in the European theater of war announced yesterday that a large number of German scientists and technicians will be transferred to the United States to continue various military experiments and research. In fact, they have been engaged in American military experiments and research work since the German surrender. At the same time, he continued to point out that these Germans will not be familiar with various programs within the United States. Once the work is completed, they will be sent back to their home country.

### American Naval Power - The Driving Force Behind Defeating Japan

New York, September 25th (Central News Agency) - The New York newspaper stated in yesterday's editorial: "Regardless of how Japan insists that its defeat was due to the atomic bomb, the power of our navy was indeed a major driving force behind the defeat of Japan, which is undeniable." The newspaper added: "Before the first atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima, Japan's combat power had been almost completely lost. When they lost control of the sea, the disappearance of Japan's control over its homeland and the Western Pacific was already imminent. The naval power and air supremacy of the United States enabled the United States to achieve victory at an early date. In history, no other country has suffered such a disastrous defeat at sea as Japan did in this war. Of Japan's twelve battleships, only one remains, damaged and without sailors; of the two hundred and two transport ships, only four remain, damaged and without sailors; of the nineteen heavy cruisers, only two remain, and later these two remaining heavy cruisers were also destroyed; none of the twenty light cruisers exist; of the one hundred and fifty-six destroyers, only twenty-six remain; and of the one hundred and forty-six submarines, only twenty-two remain." The newspaper further compared Japan's naval losses with the naval losses announced by the U.S. Navy on May 31st: one battleship "Arizona," five large transport ships, six small transport ships, six heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, sixty destroyers, and forty-three submarines. However, the losses of American ships were completely compensated by the efforts of new construction. Japan built very few new ships from December 7, 1941, to August 18, 1945. Therefore, the so-called atomic bomb is merely a revolution that changes the concepts of war and defense tactics. This bomb only reveals the corruption and incompetence of all the weapons that should be used on land, sea, and air in the present world. Therefore, we should understand that in this war, the naval power was indeed the main force in destroying the enemy, both in the Atlantic and in the Pacific. The naval power, including the air transport power that guides the progress of the war and occupies the coast, together formed a powerful supply line. Even the first transportation of the first atomic bomb and other agricultural products to Saipan was by a cruiser named "Indianapolis."

### Japan Dissolves Military Supply Bureau

Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast from Tokyo on the 23rd, several regional military supply bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Port Superintendent have been ordered to be dissolved.

### Educational Recovery Work Methods in Recovered Areas - Ministry of Education Circulates Instructions for All Provinces and Cities to Follow

Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Education had already jointly formulated various recovery plans with relevant parties. Since the announcement of Japan's surrender, various recovery plans urgently need to be promulgated immediately. The Ministry of Education has decided to formulate methods separately based on the actual situation. The emergency methods for educational recovery in various provinces and cities in the recovered areas have been circulated to all provinces and cities for compliance.

Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - Methods for educational recovery work in various provinces and cities in the recovered areas: 1. The education departments (bureaus) of each province and city should immediately handle the educational recovery work and restore the education bureaus (sections) of each county and city within a specified period. 2. The temporary educational workers employed during the emergency should be assigned to recovery work. 3. Personnel should be dispatched to take over enemy and puppet educational and cultural institutions (including public theaters and cinemas), and investigate the losses of public and private antiques and documents. 4. Enemy and puppet archives should be taken over as soon as possible, and sorted out together with the original archives. 5. Various educational funds and properties should be quickly cleared, and funds needed for recovery should be raised. 6. All public and private schools and social education institutions at all levels should temporarily maintain the status quo and not be suspended. 7. An assessment committee should be organized for educational administrative personnel, school teachers, and social education personnel. 8. The personnel needed by schools and social education institutions at all levels should be registered and employed after short-term training. 9. The schools and social education institutions at all levels that were used before the war should be restored as soon as possible within half a year. Those newly established ones that are permanent should be maintained as usual. 10. National middle schools that are moved back or transferred to their original provinces should be included in the middle school plan, and teachers and staff who moved back from the rear should be given priority for employment. Students who have not entered such schools in the rear should be assisted in moving back and given priority for admission (the detailed method will be issued separately). 11. The original buildings of schools and social education institutions at all levels should be recovered, repaired, and used, or all public places should be used, and the necessary equipment should be prepared and supplemented immediately. 12. School textbooks at all levels should contact major bookstores and printing houses to print and approve versions, and the approved versions before the war can also be used. 13. Students in the recovered areas should be given training in correct thinking, and enemy and puppet textbooks and all propaganda materials should be destroyed, except for those that should be preserved as historical materials. 14. When carrying out recovery work in the recovered areas, personnel should be dispatched to assist local public and educational personnel in carrying out the work.

### The U.S. Will Drop Medicine into Hong Kong

Second, the parliament is subject to the control of French representatives. Third, the Protective Association is organized by representatives elected from all parts of Vietnam. Fourth, Vietnam has an independent economic life, has the right to solve taxation problems, and maintains international relations with other countries.

### Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Mr. Lu Jingshi, Arrives in Shanghai - Discusses the Future Tasks of the Labor Movement in the City

Mr. Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs of the National Government, was ordered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in early June of this year to be transferred as the Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Labor Movement of the Military Affairs Commission and the Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai Workers' Loyal Righteousness National Salvation Army. At the same time, he was also appointed by the Ministry of Social Affairs as the Special Commissioner of Jinghu. After Mr. Lu was appointed, he immediately sneaked into the southeast, mobilized all parties, and fulfilled his original tasks. Now that the war has ended and the war of resistance has been completed, the work in the Shanghai area is being promoted. He arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday (25th) at 2:00 PM. A large number of people from all walks of life in Shanghai drove to the station to welcome him. After Mr. Lu got off the car, he discussed everything with Mr. Bo Cheng and Mr. Wu Shaozong, Chairman of the Municipal Party Department. All circles in the city held a grand banquet that night to comfort Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu gave instructions on the future tasks of the city's public organization training, social recovery and relief work, and leadership of the city's labor movement. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit, and Mr. Lu gave the following speech:

Public Organization Training

Mr. Lu first talked about three points on the social aspect: 1. Public Organization Training: I will handle everything in accordance with government laws and regulations. Regarding the reorganization of groups in the recovered areas, the government's regulations stipulate that all groups recognized by the past puppet organizations should be dissolved. All groups that were approved by party and government agencies before the August 13th Battle that are still loyal and have not been tainted will be recognized in accordance with the law. Many groups are in good condition, but their numbers are insufficient, or due to various changes. They should be reorganized and registered in the future. Applications can be made in accordance with the law. All matters within the scope of the Shanghai Municipal Government will be handled by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. During the current transition period, it will be handled by the Municipal Party Department. All those that do not belong to the scope of the Shanghai Municipal Government will be handled by me on behalf of the Ministry of Social Affairs. In short, all existing groups are currently handled separately by the Municipal Party Department and the Provincial Chairman.

Social Relief Work: For the current wartime relief, the Central Government has set up a special agency to plan and handle post-war relief. Personnel will be sent to preside over it soon. It is hoped that during this period, the power of the people can be mobilized to establish a unified relief organization to cooperate with government relief agencies and handle it together.

Social Recovery Policy: The central government is working hard to unify the methods, and in the future, the central ministers will urge the local governments to handle it in accordance with the promulgated methods.

Labor Movement Tasks

The following is a report on the labor movement tasks: Regarding the labor movement, the local government will be responsible for guidance and supervision. Government laws and regulations stipulate that all workers must have a trade union organization. In the most important transitional stage in the future, I hope that labor friends will clearly understand the meaning and abide by the labor-management cooperation policy stipulated by the government and work hard to build the industry. Since the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, no fewer than two or three hundred workers in Shanghai who struggled for the country in hardship and suffered disasters and difficulties from the enemy and puppets. I will personally visit and comfort their families and give them pensions. Mr. Lu also stated that the Shanghai labor movement after that will uphold the central government's intentions, and ask Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's representative in Shanghai, Chiang Bo-cheng, for instructions, and consult with the municipal authorities at any time. In the future, he will command and lead all the workers in the city to assist the local authorities in maintaining public security and stabilizing social order.

### Member He Xuandao Hosts All Circles - Reports on the Progress of Propaganda Work

Mr. He Minhun, a member of the Propaganda Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, hosted the elders and leaders of all circles in the city at the Meihua Restaurant yesterday (25th) afternoon. More than 60 people were present, including Ding Fubao, Shen Yanfang, Rong Hongyuan, Li Denghui, Shen Shuyu, Jin Zongcheng, Wu Yunxiu, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Yan Huijing, Gui Chongji, Yang Yunzhong, Xu Jiyu, Qin Runqing, Yuan Fudeng, Guo Shun, Lin Kanghou, Wang Boyuan, Zhu Yinjiang, Cai Shengbai, Xiang Kangyuan, Feng Bingnan, Fang Jiaobo, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Songtao, Sun Enlin, Ge Jialiang, Feng Shuhua, and others. During the meeting, Member He reported on the organization and work of the Propaganda Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, which has nine members, divided into three districts: Northeast, North China, and Southeast. He himself is responsible for the Southeast region. He explained two points:

The progress of the work and self-reflection. I was ordered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to return east in the winter of the year before last to prepare to welcome the general counter-offensive of the National Army. Due to environmental reasons, I could not work publicly. When Japan accepted the surrender, I went to Beijing to work, and everything went smoothly. However, in Shanghai, due to the special environment, if the work is slightly careless, it is easy to cause misunderstandings, and I have adjusted it separately since returning to Shanghai. 2. The whole cooperation and sincere seamlessness. In the future, Mr. Zhao Jinqing will take the position of director of the Shanghai Office, who will be able to cooperate sincerely with the Party Department and ask Mr. Chiang Bo-cheng, the representative of the Committee, for instructions at any time to promote the work. There are many worries in the Southeast region, so propaganda work cannot be ignored. In the future, when the National Army officially arrives in various places and order is restored, the propaganda work will naturally come to an end. Now that the Japanese army has formally surrendered, it is no longer an era of secret work. I hope that there is no need to excessively stimulate others. As for the issue of puppet personnel, we are not judges and it is inconvenient to talk more. After finishing the speech, Lin Kanghou replied on behalf of the guests, explaining the expectations of the people, and then dispersed happily.

Current Affairs Figures

### Striving to Maintain Shanghai's Security

— Fang Cheng

—— A Visit with Chief Secretary Cheng of the Action Corps——

We flipped through Shanghai newspapers from the 21st and 23rd of this month and saw the headline in the local news section: "Shanghai Action Corps Headquarters Announces Important Personnel Changes." After carefully counting the names on the list of so-called important personnel from beginning to end, it seemed that most were familiar faces. However, the name of Secretary-General and concurrently Military Law Director Cheng Kexiang appeared to be new. The Shanghai Action Corps Headquarters was established by order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, responsible for maintaining security in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area, a very arduous task. At this turning point in the situation and in this complex environment, ensuring Shanghai's security is extremely difficult. Mr. Cheng, serving as the headquarters' secretary-general and concurrently military law director, undoubtedly bears a crucial responsibility in ensuring Shanghai's security. Entrusting such an important position to someone unfamiliar inevitably causes surprise, because in Chinese officialdom, the secretary-general is always a confidant of the superior. We believe that if a confidant is also a talent, there is nothing to criticize. However, if it is merely a matter of placing a confidant, or a confidant occupying a key position, then there will be no bright future for any political or economic undertaking.

Given the current and future importance of Shanghai's security, the citizens must be very concerned about the work of the Shanghai Action Corps, which is responsible for security. At the same time, they harbor a deep sense of expectation and doubt towards Secretary-General Cheng Kexiang, who holds an important position. Is Mr. Cheng a confidant of Mr. Zhou Fohai? Is he chosen for the job based on ability, or is the job created for him? Mr. Cheng has become a figure of the moment with a significant impact on Shanghai's security, thus prompting us to conduct this interview.

A Struggle of Forgetting Life and Death, United in Purpose

In a quiet and refined corner of western Shanghai, the reporter arrived at the Shanghai Action Corps Headquarters. After presenting a business card and requesting an interview with Secretary-General Cheng, he was quickly led in by an attendant. In an office decorated with simple, plain, and tidy furnishings, a middle-aged man wearing a military uniform, full of energy, with a strong physique and a refined yet resolute air between his brows, walked out to greet the reporter warmly with a handshake. This was Secretary-General Cheng Kexiang, whom I wanted to interview.

"Secretary-General Cheng must be very busy these days. I apologize for the intrusion," the reporter said, exchanging pleasantries. "Because in Shanghai, where the environment is extremely complex, maintaining security is already difficult in normal times. In the current extraordinary and exceptionally difficult situation, petty criminals and bandits seize opportunities to cause trouble. Maintaining security is truly the most difficult task." Mr. Cheng spoke forcefully and calmly, giving me an excellent impression.

"However, we are entrusted with great responsibility by Chairman Chiang and have the hopes of the Shanghai citizens below. No matter how difficult, we must work together with one heart and one mind to complete our mission. I personally have long decided to dedicate all my energy and wisdom to striving for my ambition. To remove obstacles and overcome difficulties, the only way is for all staff to forget life and death and struggle with a united purpose. Therefore, under such an ambition, the busyness of affairs is self-evident, and indeed, it is imperative to be busy." Mr. Cheng continued, expressing an even stronger work ethic.

"The current security task in Shanghai is indeed extremely arduous, and there must be thorough arrangements in place. When will the National Army arrive? This is a question of great concern to the citizens of Shanghai," the reporter interjected.

"Various measures to maintain security are already thoroughly arranged. Working comrades can also understand Chairman Chiang's intentions and firmly adhere to their positions. However, security is comprehensive and wide-ranging. The efforts of the military, police, and government alone are insufficient. All citizens must understand the importance of their own roles in relation to security, hoping that everyone will take themselves seriously, examine themselves, and move from passively not hindering security to actively cooperating in security. In that case, there will be no problem with Shanghai's security. The Central Government has already issued a clear order appointing General Tang Enbo to be responsible for taking over Beijing and Shanghai. The National Army will arrive soon. However, while the arrival of the National Army will certainly increase security forces, our citizens and excellent working comrades will always be the main force in maintaining local order. This should not be overlooked." Mr. Cheng further solemnly emphasized the responsibilities that citizens should bear in maintaining security.

A Twisting, Thrilling History of Struggle

"I am bold enough to ask about Secretary-General Cheng's past experiences." The reporter changed the subject, finally voicing the questions of himself and the general public. Upon hearing my question, Mr. Cheng's attitude immediately changed, revealing a kind and approachable smile. He tightly clasped his hands together, looked up at the portrait of Chairman Chiang hanging on the wall, and remained silent for a moment. After a moment of silence, he began to speak:

"Although I am a member of the Kuomintang, I have always held the belief that I am participating in the national revolution's struggle as a purely common person. If you want to talk about my history of struggle, it is neither short nor long, already spanning eighteen or nineteen years. Starting from participating in the workers' movement, throughout these eighteen or nineteen years, if I were to recount my experiences in detail, perhaps you could write a very twisting and thrilling long novel.

"I have been to various provinces and places, and I have been close to all classes, from high-ranking officials to common peddlers. Therefore, I can understand the trends of each class. I have been through imprisonment and private torture, experiencing life-and-death situations and terrifying and dangerous lives. Therefore, I can experience the reality of various organizations. Because I have actually participated in the national revolution's struggle for twenty years, it has formed my life habits, fostering a strict and simple life from hunger, hardship, and poverty. Until now, I still take it as a matter of course and feel comfortable with it.

"Although I have no tile above my head or land beneath my feet, I have many comrades and abundant friendships, enough to make me forget all the hardships and further strengthen my will to struggle." Mr. Cheng spoke eloquently and methodically about his history of struggle. I felt an infinite respect rising in my heart. Our nation's final restoration of light is entirely entrusted to these individuals with ambition and talent. At the same time, it made me feel even more ashamed.

Vast Comrades and Abundant Friendships

"This time, I participated in the work of the Shanghai Action Corps, selected entirely as a citizen. I personally also want to contribute all my energy and wisdom as a citizen and party member, based on my past struggles. Therefore, I participated in this work." Mr. Cheng then explained the process of participating in this work, and I finally realized that while it is the custom in Chinese political circles for the secretary-general to always be a confidant of the superior, there are also exceptions.

"Some people may think that because I am a revolutionary fighter, I must be impulsive and out of touch with the world. In fact, revolutionary struggle is my ambition. I believe my personality is gentle because I believe in Buddhism and advocate 'generosity and kindness' towards everything in the past." Finally, Mr. Cheng explained his personality with a smile. This frank and approachable attitude gave people a warmer feeling, so it was no accident that he said, "I have many comrades and adequate friendships."

Having talked to this point, much time had already passed. The reporter stood up to take his leave. From another perspective, we learned that he was from Jiangxi Province, about thirty-eight or thirty-nine years old, truly a young and energetic fighter.

### The Military Period Has Ended. All Actions Must Follow the Proper Path. Chairman's Representative Mr. Jiang Bocheng Issues a Statement

After Deputy Mayor Wu and the Military Special Envoy arrived in Shanghai in recent days, they made statements on the city's municipal administration. The reporter visited Chairman's representative Mr. Jiang Bocheng yesterday. According to Mr. Jiang, since he has respectfully followed the Chairman's instructions and issued announcements, and earnestly informed all working comrades not to engage in any transgressive behavior, the people's hearts have gradually stabilized. After Special Envoy Wu Shao-shu arrived here, he met with me multiple times and expressed his earnest responsibility for the city's security and order and the maintenance of normalcy, reassuring the citizens. The points made by Special Envoy Wu in his statement yesterday are completely consistent with my opinions, especially regarding the fact that the mission of working comrades who were working undercover in Shanghai during the war has now ended and should be concluded as soon as possible. I hope that these working comrades will end their activities as soon as possible and await unified arrangements. As for working comrades who are permitted to continue their official and public work according to regulations, I also hope that they will listen to the guidance of the respective departments. In any case, it is absolutely forbidden to abuse power and engage in illegal or transgressive behavior. It must be known that the military period has ended, and from now on, all actions must follow the proper path. We can no longer use any means necessary, as in the period of secret activities. I, as the Chairman's representative stationed in Shanghai, will not tolerate anything that damages the nation's prestige or affects the reputation of all civil servants. Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, a place of international observation. I can only hope that all working comrades will pay special attention to their actions.

### Central Propaganda Department Commissioner Feng Youzhen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Issuing a Statement Outlining Future Goals

Mr. Feng Youzhen, Special Commissioner for Southeast China War Zone Propaganda under the Central Propaganda Department, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou at 1:45 PM yesterday. Representatives from various groups, numbering in the thousands, and the heads of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Commissioner, Fei Yimin, Zhu Shao-li, Cheng Yuxi, and others, gathered at the North Station to welcome him. Despite the heavy rain, the crowds stood in the downpour, cheering for Mr. Feng. As Mr. Feng alighted from the train, military music played and firecrackers resounded. He nodded to the welcomers and proceeded to the reception room at the military station for a brief rest, then went to the Shanghai Office of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission to meet with Mr. Jiang Bocheng, Deputy Mayor Wu Shaoshu, and various party, government, and military authorities. Mr. Li Qiusheng, secretary of the Special Commissioner's Office, and Jiang Peidong and He Zhongheng, directors of the Telecommunications Office, accompanied Mr. Feng. The Special Commissioner's Office began operating in Shanghai from today. Mr. Feng also issued a statement to the reporter, recounting his past secret work in Shanghai and outlining his future goals. The contents of his statement are recorded below:

Mr. Feng's Statement

Since the War of Resistance against Japan began, I was appointed to concurrently serve as the Shanghai Commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department, presiding over propaganda work in the provinces and cities of Southeast China. I worked together with colleagues in the cultural and journalistic fields here to devote ourselves to the War of Resistance and promote national policy. I am extremely impressed by the arduous struggles and tragic sacrifices of the Shanghai colleagues. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Shanghai press corps lost their positions. I was then appointed as Special Commissioner for War Zone Propaganda in Southeast China, establishing an office in Tunxi to promote propaganda work in various occupied areas. During these three years, many colleagues in the Shanghai press and cultural circles were still able to work hard and fight to the last moment. I know this very well. Those who succumbed to the pressures of life, or whose will was weak, and who defected halfway, were also quite numerous. This is very regrettable. Now, fortunately, the War of Resistance has victoriously ended, and under the leadership of the Shanghai mayor, we will soon return to normalcy. I was ordered to move this office to Shanghai and hope that all colleagues in the cultural and journalistic fields will return to their positions and redouble their efforts, working with a consistent, upright, and just stance in accordance with the central government's national policy, to complete the rehabilitation work in propaganda. Shanghai's cultural and journalistic colleagues have made extremely significant contributions to the great cause of the War of Resistance in the past. I hope that in the future, they will also make even greater efforts for the future of national construction, making continued efforts, establishing a good reputation, playing a leading role, and combating distorted fallacies. I am willing to lead my colleagues in this office to encourage each other with you.

### Correcting Current Malpractices

— Cheng

"During the war, any means that could strike the enemy or increase our strength should be chosen, especially when the war reaches its final stage, which is unavoidable." These are the words of Deputy Mayor Wu Shaoshu. But now the enemy has officially sued for peace and the war has ended, so Mr. Wu added that part of the work has lost its significance.

"The military period has ended, and from now on, all actions must follow the proper path. We can no longer use any means necessary, as in the period of secret activities." These are the words of Chairman's representative Mr. Jiang Bocheng.

The main intention of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Wu's remarks is to maintain order in Shanghai and uphold the authority of the Central Government. What we have seen and heard in the past ten days makes us feel even more that the remarks of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Wu are indeed good words aimed at the current malpractices.

Mr. Jiang is the Chairman's representative in Shanghai, and Mr. Wu is in charge of the city's party and government affairs. What they say naturally carries the determination and dignity that must be implemented.

### American Newspapers

— Xiao Chao

The first newspaper to appear in America was the Boston News-Letter, a weekly publication that began in Boston in August 1704. Following Boston, a newspaper was published in Philadelphia in 1719. The first newspaper published in New York was the "New York Gazette," and in 1773, the "New York Journal" was published. The Civil War significantly stimulated the newspaper industry, leading to its continuous progress and substantial reforms. Recently, the United States has had over 20,000 periodicals (including over 2,500 daily newspapers), with a total circulation of approximately 220 million copies, including a total daily newspaper circulation of about 33 million copies.

Investment in the periodical publishing industry ranks fifth among total industrial investment in the United States. Most American newspapers are published multiple times a day (two to five times), with each issue containing dozens of pages (approximately 60 to 80 pages, and often over 200 pages for Sunday editions). Many pages are occupied by advertisements, in addition to long novels, detailed sports reports, and numerous illustrations. Illustrated magazines are also very popular, often with circulations exceeding one million copies.

The "concerns" (large monopolistic organizations) in the American news industry are also very large-scale. Major examples include the "Scripps-Howard" organization, founded in 1878, which E.V. Scripps consolidated from 26 daily newspapers (including the "World Telegram," "Cleveland News," "Pittsburgh Press," "Cincinnati Post," "Baltimore Post," "San Francisco News," "Washington News," and "Detroit News," etc.). Another example is the "Hearst Concern," established in 1895, which owns 23 daily newspapers and eight weekly publications (published on Sundays), (including the "New York American," "New York Journal," "Boston Globe," "Boston American," "Chicago American," "San Francisco Examiner," "Washington Times," and "Baltimore News," etc.). Other newspaper consortiums include groups led by C.HK. Katchis, Frank E. Gannett, James M. Cox, and others.

Among the major news agencies that have correspondents stationed in every country and corner of the world, the largest American news agency, the "Associated Press" (A.P.), stands out. Founded in 1900, it has a large number of publishers, 150 branch offices, and constantly provides news and information from every corner of the world. In addition, there is the "United Press" (U.P.), founded in 1907, which belongs to the Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate mentioned above and has its own dedicated telegraph network. The Hearst syndicate also owns the "International News Service" (I.N.S), founded in 1909, which serves not only the Hearst newspapers and other domestic newspapers, but also various British newspapers.

The best-selling newspaper in the United States is the "Daily News," founded in 1920, with a circulation of 1.3 million copies in New York. As for the largest newspapers in the United States, one is the "New York Times," founded in 1851, which is the organ of the Democratic Party and has a circulation of about 400,000 copies. The second is the "New York Herald Tribune," created in 1924 by merging the "Herald" and the "Tribune" (founded in 1841). It publishes 100 to 140 pages daily, is the organ of the Republican Party, and has a circulation of 1.29 million copies. The third is the "Chicago Daily Tribune," published in Chicago, which was founded in 1847 and has a daily circulation of about 800,000 copies. In addition, the "Chicago Daily News," founded in 1877, sells 440,000 copies daily. The "World-Telegram" is published by merging the "Telegram" (founded in 1867) and the "World" (founded in 1860), with a circulation of 236,000 copies, and is a major newspaper in the Scripps-Howard group. The "New York Evening Post" was founded in 1801 and belongs to the Katchis-Martin group, selling 100,000 copies daily (in addition to the illustrated magazine "Saturday Evening Post," which has a circulation of 2 million copies). Since 1940, a new newspaper, "P.M." (Post Meridian), also known as "Afternoon Paper", has appeared in New York. The city of Chicago also publishes the Communist Party's newspaper "Daily Worker" and the Communist Youth League's newspaper "Young Worker," etc. (Translated from the chapter "The United States of America" published in the Soviet Union).

Regeneration
— Xu Wenhu

Unprecedented suffering,

Unprecedented trials,

An unprecedented mission descends upon our shoulders.

Sweating, enduring tears, shedding blood;

Clenching our teeth—

We struggled bitterly for eight years!

Countless lives, countless properties;

And countless irredeemable losses:

The heroic souls of martyrs;

The ardent blood of brave men

Fearless spirit combined with superhuman endurance

Grasp the victory of today!

Wipe away the blood and tears, tear off the black纱 from our sleeves

Hang the bright national flag high

Exhale a long, pent-up breath,

Straighten our chests with dignity;

Everyone laughs heartily!

The new world has arrived!

Millions upon millions of dead and wounded;

Millions upon millions of [unclear],

Only then do we have the millions upon millions of people singing with joy today.

Under our feet are the bloodstains of soldiers,

Before our eyes are destroyed villages.

Weeds grow in the fields,

Empty frames stand in the factory buildings.

We must rebuild what is destroyed;

We must restore what is lost.

Roll up our sleeves and work hard!

The new world needs tireless cultivation.

Use our sweat to irrigate the barren fields,

Use tireless strength to rebuild a tireless country.

Use boundless perseverance to win freedom;

Use the greatest sacrifice to win peace.

Eight years of suffering ends today,

A century of debts are settled today!

Tear off the black紗 from our sleeves,

Hang the bright national flag high

The new world begins,

### Give Me Back My Freedom

— Ting Ruo

The long-separated free discussion has arrived with peace. Thinking of the freedom we have regained, I feel especially close to it. For a moment, I am joyous, excited, and comforted. Like a passenger rescued from a shipwreck, I feel safe in my life again. Du Fu has a poem that says, "Suddenly hearing of the recovery of Subei beyond the sword, I was filled with tears when I first heard the news." It describes his own emotions of being overjoyed and shedding tears, and when I recite it today, I feel that there is no exaggeration. Just imagine, from now on, our lives, property, speech, and actions will all be protected by law. We will no longer be intimidated by guns for no reason. As long as we have the ability, there is no place in the country or even the world that we cannot go. We will not fall into a "pit" when walking at night, and prices will gradually disappear, as will the distinction between "black" and "white" markets. Are these things that could have been achieved by "money" and "power" in the past? The invisible shackles have been removed from our bodies. Looking up at the clear sky, the floating clouds seem to smile. Looking back at the world, everyone is celebrating. The world has changed, and people feel several years younger. The future is bright and free.
