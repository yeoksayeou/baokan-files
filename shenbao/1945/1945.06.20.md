### Japanese Counterattack in Southern Okinawa: Fierce Battle for High Ground, Air Force Strikes Enemy Ships Nearby

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - In the southern part of Okinawa Island, enemy forces continue to attempt to infiltrate Japanese defense lines under the cover of intense artillery fire. Japanese forces are engaging in a counterattack, resulting in fierce and bloody battles. The enemy's advance is focused on the area near Itoman on the west coast, stretching through Mount Yaeza, Mount Yaeze, and as far as the coast. The enemy's offensive is particularly fierce east of Mount Yaeza and Mount Yaeze. Mount Yaeza is located three kilometers east of Itoman, and Mount Yaeze, connected to the east of Mount Yaeza, is a hill with an elevation of 150 meters. Japanese forces are using the terrain of these two hills to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. On the Oroku front, fierce fighting is occurring amidst complex battle lines. Japanese units are fighting bravely and skillfully, but they are being pushed back towards the Shimajiri and Oroku areas due to the overwhelming enemy forces, making the situation increasingly difficult.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The enemy in the southern part of Okinawa Island continues to land reinforcements. On the 16th, they infiltrated Japanese positions east and west of Mount Yaeze, penetrating 1,500 meters deep and stretching from the Nakaza village on the east coast to the Mount Yaeze area in the south. Japanese units in the area are currently engaged in a fierce counterattack. After two days and nights of intense fighting, they recaptured Hill 57 southwest of Mount Yaeze and the area south of it on the 18th. The counterattack continues, and the battle on the eastern coast has stabilized. There have been no major changes on the central and west coast fronts, but local fierce fighting is underway for the high ground about 500 meters south of Ozato.

Ryukyu Base, 19th (Central News Agency) - The weather in the Ryukyu Islands remained poor on the 18th. Approximately 100 enemy aircraft attacked. On the ground, enemy forces on Mount Yaeze gained some ground, and the summit of the mountain eventually fell into enemy hands. From the night of the 18th to the morning of the 19th, the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy ships in the surrounding area and enemy airfields on the island. The results of the battle are not yet clear.

### Prime Minister Suzuki Clarifies Determination to Win, Prefectural Governors Hold First Meeting

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The first meeting of prefectural governors was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:00 PM on the 19th. Prime Minister Suzuki, all cabinet members, and the eight governors, including Nishio, Governor of Kanto-Shinetsu, attended. Prime Minister Suzuki first gave instructions, followed by instructions from the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Finance on matters under their jurisdiction. Finally, the governors discussed issues such as reorganizing each region, establishing self-sufficiency and self-defense capabilities, and organizing national volunteer corps. After the meeting, they went to the Ministry of Home Affairs for discussions with the relevant authorities.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki recently stated his determination to win when meeting with a group of reporters: "I have absolutely no pessimistic thoughts regarding the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. In other words, the occupation of territory does not necessarily mean defeat in war. When considering the psychological impact on the enemy, who is even more distressed than us, these battles are by no means defeats. We will fight the decisive battle on the mainland, Kyushu, or other regions, concentrating five or ten times the enemy's forces for this homeland defense, and I am confident that we will achieve victory." What the Prime Minister meant is that the gain or loss of territory and the scale of the battle results are not decisive factors in determining victory or defeat, but that the fighting spirit of the nation and its people will determine the final victory. While the struggle for strategic locations is undoubtedly related to the level of fighting spirit, as seen in the battle near Berlin in Europe, the loss of that city ultimately led to the collapse of the nation's fighting spirit. However, a tenacious fighting spirit means that gains and losses are not fatal. At the end of World War I, when the Ludendorff Offensive brought Paris to the brink of crisis, French Prime Minister Clemenceau proclaimed, "I will fight in front of Paris, and I will fight in the center of Paris. If Paris falls, I will fight beyond Paris, and if fighting in the Pyrenees Mountains is useless, then I will fight at sea." The Prime Minister's heart was filled with the desire to destroy the enemy and a strong fighting spirit. Although the French army often suffered defeats in battle, this spirit and this fighting spirit never failed. Today, the situation in the Battle of Okinawa is undoubtedly critical, but in the decisive battle on Okinawa, the elite of the Japanese army, navy, and air force have inflicted a devastating blow on three of the eight enemy divisions that landed, reducing the combat capabilities of the other four divisions by half. The enemy has suffered over 73,000 casualties, and five-tenths of their fleet has been destroyed. However, even with the expansion of land and sea victories, this cannot be considered the end. The enemy endured 50 million casualties in the European war and is prepared to sacrifice millions of soldiers in the Pacific. Every moment that the Battle of Okinawa continues allows us to produce one more aircraft to sink enemy ships in our home waters and build one more fortress. Although the brave warriors on Okinawa may reach their limits one day, their spirit of fighting to the death will be transformed into an intangible force in the decisive battle on the mainland in the future. Secondly, the psychological impact of the Battle of Okinawa on the enemy is immeasurable. Leaving aside the power of the Special Attack Units (Kamikaze), if we were to confront them with the same forces, the Japanese army would not have reached the current situation. The quality of the enemy's forces on Okinawa is far inferior to that of the Japanese army, but they are superior in quantity. However, in the decisive battle on the mainland, how will the enemy compensate for their qualitative deficiencies? This is where the enemy's material warfare tactics are limited. This is a clear lesson for us from the Battle of Okinawa.

### Japanese Forces in Tarakan Launch Daring Raids

Southwest Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency) - Enemy forces on Tarakan Island continue to reinforce their troops, attempting to forcibly break through the Japanese army's first line of defense. However, Japanese units are steadfastly holding the line, launching fierce counterattacks against the attacking enemy forces. At night, they are carrying out daring and heroic close-quarters combat attacks, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. For over fifty days, the arduous and difficult struggle has continued, and the Japanese garrison has fully demonstrated its heroic spirit. Since entering the region, Japanese forces have also launched daring counterattacks against the Australian forces that landed on Labuan Island in Brunei Bay and the Brunei Peninsula, preventing the enemy's advance and currently engaging in fierce fighting.

### U.S. Army's Top Commander, Buckner, Killed in Action; This is the 17th U.S. General to Die

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Buckner, commander of the Tenth Army and the highest commander of the enemy landing forces on Okinawa Island, was killed in action on the morning of the 17th while commanding combat operations at the front line, after being hit by Japanese artillery fire. This was announced by Nimitz Headquarters in Guam. Buckner's death marks the seventeenth U.S. general to be killed in action, and the fourth in the Pacific Theater.

According to an announcement from Nimitz Headquarters broadcast by Hawaiian Radio Station at 8:30 AM on the 19th, Buckner was killed at 1:15 PM on the 18th when a Japanese artillery shell hit him while he was commanding the Navy's Eighth Combat Regiment. It has been decided that Geiger will be his successor. The U.S. Army forces invading Okinawa are the 24th Army Corps led by Hodge and the 3rd Marine Amphibious Corps led by Geiger, with Buckner as the supreme commander. Since the enemy landed on Okinawa Island, the Japanese army's brave and fierce fighting has resulted in 73,500 enemy casualties. As a result, public opinion in the United States has been highly critical of Buckner's leadership in combat operations. U.S. military commentator Lawrence has even criticized Buckner's operational errors, leading to a lack of affection for him among the American people. Buckner's death in battle occurred at this juncture. Buckner's operational style was seen as unusually conservative among U.S. military officers. He adopted a cautious, gradualist approach during the Okinawa operation. When U.S. forces landed on Okinawa on April 1st, there was optimism in the United States, with the belief that the Japanese army's organized resistance could be broken within one or two weeks. However, the fierce resistance from the Japanese army slowed the U.S. advance, and criticism of Buckner began in the United States after three weeks of landings. On April 21st, he addressed the nation through frontline reporters, stating that the U.S. military had launched ironclad attacks on the Japanese defensive positions from land, sea, and air for three weeks, but had not been able to effectively break through the Japanese positions. He said that to drive the Japanese army out of their fortified defensive positions, there was no other way but to adopt a corkscrew method or annihilate them one by one, which was the most effective tactic with the least amount of sacrifice. On May 13th, he reiterated to the American people that they should not expect the Okinawa operation to progress as significantly as the European front, as the Japanese army on Okinawa was a "spiritual army," and fighting this kind of Japanese army was not an easy battle. However, in light of the great dissatisfaction in domestic public opinion, he became impatient and went to the front line to supervise the battle, leading to his death.

### The Results and Damage of Enemy U.S. B-29 Aircraft in the Past Year

— Qi Li-fu

According to the U.S. military authorities, one of the most direct and significant causes of Germany's failure was the strategic bombing of German oil refining facilities, which totaled over 270 raids and tens of thousands of tons of bombs. Recently, since the end of the war in Europe, B-29 aircraft air raids on the Japanese mainland have gradually increased in frequency. It has been a year since the enemy's air raids on the Japanese mainland from the continent on June 16th of last year. What has been the result of the strategic bombing by B-29 aircraft?

Number of Enemy Aircraft Lost

According to announcements from the Imperial Headquarters and other sources, from June 16th of last year to June 3rd of this year, B-29 aircraft have attacked a total of 71 times, of which about a quarter were air raids on the Tokyo area. 715 aircraft were shot down by Japanese air defense forces and ground units, and 1,189 were destroyed. The total damage is 1,914 aircraft. However, this number does not include the number of aircraft that could not return to base. For example, after the Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima were all killed in action, B-29 aircraft participating in air raids on the mainland were sometimes forced to land on Iwo Jima and could not return to their bases on Saipan. Also, some enemy bases were destroyed by Japanese army and navy aircraft, or aircraft were forced to land at sea or somewhere on the continent due to mechanical failures or combat damage. It is estimated that there were quite a few of these as well.

The Enemy Fears Bloodshed Most

What the enemy Americans fear most is bloodshed. If we calculate that one-third of the destroyed aircraft, i.e., 192 aircraft, were shot down, then the total number of aircraft shot down is 1,117 (725 + 192). Each B-29 aircraft carries two pilots, one flight engineer, one communications and gunner, one bombardier and gunner, one photographer and gunner, and five gunners, for a total of twelve people. If a squadron leader or formation leader is also on board, then there are thirteen people. If we calculate twelve people per aircraft, then approximately 14,000 crew members have been lost.

Aircraft Replacements Are Difficult

Regarding the production volume of the B-29, the director of the U.S. War Production Board stated that at the end of December last year, the monthly production was 135 aircraft. Later, San Francisco radio broadcasted that after Germany's defeat in May of this year, monthly production could exceed 200 aircraft. This shows that the production of B-29 aircraft did not reach the originally planned large scale. In the past year, at most a little over 2,000 aircraft have been manufactured. According to Japanese statistics, 1,117 have already been lost, leaving a difference of only 883 aircraft. Furthermore, if we calculate an average loss of 130 aircraft per month, especially from May 3rd to June 1st, the frequency of B-29 aircraft attacks on the Japanese mainland has been very high. A total of 153 aircraft were shot down and 180 were destroyed. Using the above method of calculation, assuming that about one-third of the destroyed aircraft could not return, then the enemy lost about 213 aircraft in this one month. The remaining 120 aircraft must be repaired before they can be used again. Nelson, the director of the U.S. War Production Board, stated last year, "If 20 aircraft are lost in each bombing raid, then to replenish them, it would require over 1,000 workers working 40 or more hours per week for a year."

Huge Manufacturing Costs

The manufacturing cost of each B-29 aircraft is $650,000, requiring 80 tons of materials and about 300,000 workers. Each aircraft requires 40 ground maintenance personnel. For a round trip from the Marianas to Tokyo, each engine, with 2,000 horsepower, requires 20,000 liters of gasoline if it continues for 15 hours. 300 aircraft require 6 million liters. Ordinary gasoline requires about 30,000 cans, and transporting them requires 360 trucks with a load capacity of three tons. In addition, each aircraft carries about seven tons of bombs, and 300 aircraft carrying out ten sorties require 21,000 tons of bombs. In addition, they must also carry ammunition, oxygen tanks, food, clothing, etc. If a large number of B-29 aircraft are transported across the Pacific Ocean to the bases in the Marianas using a fleet, it is even more troublesome.

On March 23rd, Reuters quoted Second Air Force Deputy Commander General Streit as boasting, "The Superfortress has suffered extremely few losses in past air raids on Japan, and future air raids on Japan will probably be even more rapid and intensified. The B-29's operation is still in its early stages, and in the future, 1,000 aircraft will be dispatched to carry out large-scale air raids." Indeed, he said that the losses were extremely few because it was still in the early stages, as it is impossible to have ten raids and have fifteen aircraft shot down. After April, the enemy's air raids gradually intensified, and the Japanese ground and air defense units' interception was also extremely fierce. On the first of this month, about 400 B-29 aircraft attacked Osaka, and the Japanese shot down and destroyed a total of 130 aircraft, exceeding the U.S. production capacity. As Norstedt said, "How will we be able to dispatch 1,000 aircraft one day?"

No Need to Panic About Bombing

Recently, enemy B-29 aircraft have been frequently attacking the Japanese mainland. This does not mean that the bases in the Marianas have been fully prepared or that the number of aircraft has increased. Their purpose is to destroy the Japanese people's will to fight. However, no matter how fierce the bombing is, people do not need to panic. The damage from bombing is like the superficial wounds of a boxer covered in blood during a boxing match.

### Minister Matsudaira Denounces Enemy American Indiscriminate Bombing Atrocities, Japanese National Belief Strengthened

Matsudaira, Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, met with newspaper reporters yesterday (the 19th) at 3:00 PM, as usual, and issued the following statement regarding the enemy American aircraft's indiscriminate bombing atrocities:

Indiscriminate Bombing and Slaughter of Civilians

Recently, U.S. Air Force Commander General Arnold, during a visit to Manila, made some remarks about future operational plans, stating that they would continue to bomb Japan for the next year and a half, making it so that the Japanese people, materials, and everything else would have no room to exist. This kind of statement is truly an inhumane atrocity. In the past, the U.S. military also carried out indiscriminate bombing in the European war, especially the so-called carpet bombing of Hamburg. The first step was to drop huge bombs to cause psychological terror to the people, then gasoline was spread in the air, and incendiary bombs were dropped to cause fires. When the people were actively fighting the fires, countless small bombs were dropped again to indiscriminately kill civilians. When we look back at the Soviet Union's bombing of Germany, it never went beyond the scope of tactics, targeting transportation lines and strategic areas. However, the U.S. Air Force's bombing exhausted all its barbaric and cruel abilities. Comparing the Soviet and American air forces, their intentions and actions are very clear.

Americans' Brutal and Cruel Nature

Regarding the American people's brutality, it is clear from history. As seen in the era of their distant ancestors, the Native Americans, they already had the so-called extermination policy, as well as the treatment of black slaves, which can be used as proof, showing that these people are cruel in nature. This time, the enemy American aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of the Japanese mainland fully exposes their destructive nature. For example, on May 25th, the enemy bombed Tokyo, and Nimitz Headquarters openly announced that the U.S. military bombed the mountainous areas and residential areas of Tokyo. From this, it can be seen that the enemy clearly knew these areas and carried out indiscriminate bombing with the planned slaughter of innocent civilians. They brazenly disregarded wartime regulations and wartime ethics. Therefore, Arnold's barbaric remarks may contain the intention of threatening Japan, and at the same time, they reveal their cruel nature. However, the Japanese people are increasingly increasing their hatred of the United States and Great Britain, and their strong belief in raising their fighting spirit, vowing to expel the British and Americans from East Asia.

### Mitsui Company Expands Aircraft Production

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - In order to expand aircraft war capabilities, Mitsui & Co., Ltd. has decided to actively manage Showa Aircraft Company, its sole aircraft production division (capital of 60 million yen, of which four-tenths is owned by Mitsui). Mitsui is dispatching several directors and supervisors, and has decided to concentrate personnel and resources from related companies such as Mitsui Shipbuilding, Mitsui Seiki, and Mitsui Lumber Industries to manage it.

### Japanese Forces in Southern Jiangxi Launch Surprise Attack, 7th War Area Base Lost

Jiujiang, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Southern China Army announced at 7:00 PM on the 18th that the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on the main force of the Chongqing 7th War Area Army, which was calling for a counterattack in the Longnan, Dingnan, and Qiannan areas, inflicting significant damage. The Japanese army took secret action in early June and began advancing from various directions with several columns. The enemy forces were well aware of this and attempted to retreat, but were obstructed by the Japanese army's surprise attack, suffering great losses and fleeing deep into the interior. As a result, the base of the Chongqing 7th War Area Army's counterattack has been completely destroyed.

Chongqing 7th War Area Army Suffers Setback

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The main force of the 7th War Area Army under the command of Yu Hanmou, which suffered heavy blows during the Japanese army's operation to open the southern Guangzhou-Hankou Railway line, later gathered in the mountainous areas of northeastern Guangdong Province and the southern tip of Jiangxi Province, strengthening its ranks and conspiring with the recent U.S. military's attempt to land on the mainland, showing signs of activity. The Japanese Southern China Army launched a new operation in early June to preemptively strike and annihilate them. The Japanese army surrounded and attacked the Chongqing army from several directions, completely suppressing Longnan, Dingnan, and Qiannan (the southwestern part of Jiangxi), commonly known as the "Three Southern Areas," inflicting significant damage on the enemy. At the same time, they thoroughly destroyed their food depots and rear echelon capabilities, and continued to pursue the Chongqing army that was fleeing eastward towards Anyuan, achieving vast battlefield results.

### U.S. Establishes Army Communications School in Yunnan

Central News Agency - Shanghai news reports, according to telegrams from Chongqing: Recently, the U.S. military stationed in Chongqing established an Army Communications School in Yunnan. All instructors at the school are Americans, and its purpose is to train Chinese communications technicians. It is reported that six such schools have been established in different locations.

### After the Emergency Rice and Grain Measures

Since the National Government adopted emergency rice and grain measures, the price of rice in this city has tended to stabilize and has seen a rebound. If the mold rain stops slightly, the source can be smooth, and the rice price falls, which is very likely. However, we cannot sit and wait for the price of rice to fall naturally. Although the environment that may fall has been created, and the conditions that may fall have been met, how to use the environment? How to grasp the conditions? To realize the possible fall as soon as possible still requires our further efforts, which is the second main task after the emergency measures of the authorities.

What is the main task of the second step? We believe that the following matters need to be paid close attention to:

It is of course most important to dredge the source of rice and grain and make the supply abundant. First of all, in terms of transportation, increasing transportation vehicles, giving priority to the transportation of rice and grain, and giving full convenience all depend on the efforts and assistance of the transportation authorities. Allied authorities have earnestly stated that they will do their best to assist in the number of transports, and hope to relax the amount of transport as soon as possible.

Strictly prohibiting extortion at checkpoints along the way is most closely related to dredging the source. If there are heavy demands along the way and layers of exploitation, even if there are a large number of transportation vehicles, traffickers will regard it as a daunting task. At the same time, although traffickers can painfully cope with the demands along the way, they will inevitably add all the expenses along the way to the cost. As the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep." The high price difference between the place of origin and the market is a common situation in the past. However, in the past, due to restrictions on the movement of rice and grain, military and police personnel at checkpoints along the way had an excuse to demand extortion. Now that the restrictions on movement have been lifted, free trafficking is completely legal. Of course, military and police at checkpoints have no excuse to demand extortion, and absolutely cannot use their powers to coerce and demand extortion. We hope that the relevant authorities will issue a notice on this matter and strictly prohibit it. Traffickers of rice and grain may refuse and report any illegal demands and report them for severe punishment.

Preventing hoarding and manipulation must also be closely monitored at all times. The suspension of purchases by purchasing agencies and the cancellation of restrictions on movement are nothing more than dredging the source. Increasing the amount of transportation, strictly prohibiting extortion along the way, and nothing more than facilitating trafficking, in order to dredge the source, and the purpose of dredging the source is of course to enrich the supply and suppress the price of rice. However, if the purpose of dredging the source is indeed achieved, but most of it is collected and hoarded by illegal merchants, then it will be like drawing a tiger that does not look like a dog. In other words, the purpose of illegal merchants for dredging the source is not to supply people with food, but to facilitate hoarding and speculating. In this way, as a result of dredging the source, the people have not been able to open their savings, but there are more than a few price groups. This possible drawback can make the authorities' painstaking measures fail to achieve results, and the people's suffering cannot be alleviated. Therefore, preventing large households from hoarding is an important task that cannot be ignored and must be strictly prevented at all times. The day before yesterday, President Zhou also made a speech and ordered the Financial Inspection Office to inspect whether the funds provided by the banks for purchasing rice were used properly, which is also one end of preventing hoarding.

Limiting excessive grain storage is also extremely important. Ordinary households and industrial and commercial groups take advantage of the return of rice prices and purchase and store a large amount. Even if the purpose is different from hoarding and speculation, the concentration of rice and grain and the loss of regulatory performance are the same. Therefore, after the source of rice is dredged, the rush to purchase by large households should be prevented. On the active side, the municipal government should reiterate the previous order that the amount of grain stored should not exceed the needs of three months, and if the excess is found, it will be filled with fairness. At the same time, I hope that the citizens will report it, the government will enforce it, and warn others. On the passive side, I sincerely hope that the wealthy people will understand the righteousness, and it is by no means a phenomenon of social stability for a few people to be full and most people to be hungry. Moreover, the wealthy people hoard grain, except for fear of grain shortage, nothing more than to avoid the loss of eating high prices, then ask how the poor should cope once the prices are really high? We believe that only the rich are the smartest, but they should also put themselves in the shoes of the public and think about themselves, and not just think about their own calculations, which is really smart.

In short, at this critical moment of the rice and grain problem, it is fortunate that the authorities attach importance to people's livelihood and have emergency countermeasures. All of us in the government and the public should act in good conscience and cooperate to solve the problem as a whole. Although the general public has no way to actively cooperate, they should relieve the panic from the passive side. Military police and civil servants should assist from the sidelines and should never use their positions to engage in favoritism and extortion. And powerful merchants must especially examine their conscience, use their capital, conduct legitimate trafficking, only take legal profits, and do not hoard and speculate for exorbitant profits. Everyone should take it as their responsibility to save the panic of people's food. If there are still illegal and exorbitant profit actions in this emergency measure, once verified, they should be spurned by the public and punished with wartime extreme punishment, so that those who have no heart and no conscience know what to quit!

### The Effect of Emergency Rice and Grain Measures

Recently, the National Government implemented emergency rice and grain measures, stopped the rice and grain purchasing work of the Rice Control Association and other agencies, and abolished the restrictions on the movement of rice and grain. This matter has been reported earlier. The above-mentioned policies have been well received in all aspects and are unanimously welcomed. The food insecurity in Shanghai and other places will be completely eliminated.

As has been repeatedly discussed before, the current high price of rice is half due to psychological conditions. In fact, rice and its sources may not have been hopeless. Therefore, if the psychological conditions can be eliminated, the price of rice will inevitably fall, and the phenomenon of panic and rush to purchase can also be reduced. Even if the amount of rice entering the country has not increased sharply, the price of rice can be suppressed to a certain extent. After the promulgation of the emergency rice and grain measures, due to rainfall and other conditions, the amount of rice entering Shanghai may not have increased sharply, but the price of rice has fallen considerably, which can prove the above-mentioned situation, and the future role of emergency measures can be imagined.

Emergency rice and grain measures, on the one hand, reduce the price of rice in Shanghai, and on the other hand, will also increase the price of rice in the place of origin to a certain extent. If the price of rice in Shanghai and the place of origin is balanced, the result will inevitably increase the intention of farmers to increase production, which is beyond doubt. However, although it is said that a balance can be achieved, there are actually limits to it. Such as the limit of rice merchants to raise funds, the high interest they pay, as well as the heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes on rice channels, and the greedy profits of rice merchants, can all make the market prices in the place of origin and Shanghai still disparate. However, if the National Government's policies are appropriate, this problem can also be corrected considerably. After the emergency measures, the National Government's policies should of course be advanced in the above-mentioned aspects.

The implementation of emergency measures will promote the broad and free activities of general rice merchants. They will actively penetrate into the interior to purchase rice, and compare it with the market price in Shanghai. If it is cost-effective, they will collect and transport it to Shanghai. If it is not cost-effective, they will hoard it. The emergence of this result is expected. Past hoarding occurred in Shanghai or its vicinity, and future hoarding will occur in rice-producing areas, which must also be considered. Therefore, the National Government must take the entire Central China as the object and find ways to prevent hoarding. Otherwise, it will not be possible to eliminate unscrupulous merchants, and at the same time, it will be difficult to see the satisfactory results of emergency measures.

The result of emergency rice and grain measures is to give up general control over rice and grain. In essence, we hope that it is purely an emergency measure, that is, a temporary policy. This point has also been mentioned in the Shen Bao editorial, and it is emphasized that rice and grain control is necessary, but the content of the control must be suitable for China's national conditions and public sentiment, which is worth listening to. To put it bluntly, the past rice and grain control has made many mistakes. And today's rice and grain situation can also be regarded as the result of the accumulation of its mistakes. In short, the way of control must be changed first.

The general impression of the society on this emergency measure is extremely good. When the psychological conditions for the soaring price of rice are eliminated, it is necessary for the National Government to further seek active policies related to the following points. That is: immediately prohibit the illegal taxation of military police and civil servants, and thoroughly abolish the profiteering and hoarding of unscrupulous merchants. In order to make the effect of the emergency measures perfect, this must be resolutely realized. (Translated from the Mainland News on June 18)

They were all charged with sabotage, intimidation of Soviet officers, using illegal radios for communication, and conducting various anti-Soviet propaganda campaigns. Army Major General Okulicki was also charged with espionage. However, only fifteen of the defendants attended the trial, one of whom, Bedak (a member of the Polish Socialist Party), was absent due to illness. Stipulowski, a key member of the executive department of the Peasant Party, began to vigorously defend himself during the interrogation, and Army Major General Okulicki also angrily retorted when writing his confession, saying, "I am innocent, but I am only considered guilty in the confession." After he finished speaking, he stood up suddenly and claimed that he wanted to call out his witnesses, and shouted out a series of military names. General Ulrich, the chief judge of the criminal court, asked urgently in view of this, "Where are these people?" He replied, "I don't know their exact whereabouts. They may be in the Soviet army's concentration camps or in prison." In addition to General Ulrich, there were also three army officers, the prosecutor was Afanasyev, who had served as the chief of the Soviet army's military law department, and seven defense lawyers for the defendants, led by Blot, also attended at the same time. At that time, the prosecutor read out the charges against the defendant, which stated that "All the defendants, including Okulicki, have admitted that they led the organization of a secret government in Poland, but the organization of this government was instructed by the London Polish government in exile. And Okulicki was instigated by the London Polish government in exile to disband the Polish National Army, and at the same time seized a general Polish military officer and seized a large number of East Weapons and radios, using this tool to scare the Soviet army, or to carry out various anti-official propaganda campaigns against the Soviet Union. Okulicki is actually the personal representative of General Gomorowski, the commander-in-chief of the former Polish secret government. According to Kao, he led the organization of the unfinished Warsaw government last year in an attempt to seize power, and at the same time, Okulicki also led a group of terrorists to kill 594 Soviet officers and injure 249 between July 28, 1944 and May 31, 1945, and he also admitted to organizing secret agencies in Estonia to carry out various harmful acts against the Soviet Union."

### An Analysis of British and American Psychological Warfare: Using Radio Waves to Disrupt German Morale

To understand this European war, one must know that what contributed to its end was not only the visible military and economic warfare, but also the vigorous propaganda and psychological warfare behind it. Kaiser Wilhelm II once said that Germany's defeat in the previous World War was due to British propaganda. Today, Nazi Germany, known for its propaganda warfare, has been taken advantage of by British and American propaganda. Isn't this a lesson for us who hope to complete the Greater East Asia War? Now, let's gather fragments of the complex situation within the European war.

British and American Propaganda Warfare

The British and Americans knew that the Nazi German national organization was very tight, leaving no room for espionage. Therefore, once the second front was successfully opened and the Red Army's offensive intensified, they immediately launched a white-hot radio wave war, attempting to awaken defeatist ideas within Germany and cause internal division. They intercepted German broadcasts in London, skillfully altered them, and retransmitted them on the same frequencies, so that German radio listeners could not tell whether it was German news or British broadcasts, and subtly carried out anti-German propaganda in between. They used the same method to disrupt shortwave radio providing news, so that German newspapers were often fooled into publishing inaccurate information. This shows how clever and insidious British and American propaganda methods were.

On January 18, Churchill gave a speech in the House of Commons, mentioning the unconditional surrender approach. Since then, the British and Americans have focused on this matter, repeatedly broadcasting it and constantly telling the Germans: "We are people who deeply believe in peace and freedom. We want to build peaceful and free institutions from today's chaos, hunger, and bloody disputes." They used all sorts of sweet words to imply that they were willing to negotiate an armistice. Therefore, despite the Soviet Union's fierce attacks, the German people considered the British and Americans, who loudly proclaimed adherence to international law, to still be Germany's friends, and that they would surely be able to unite to defeat the Soviet Union in the future. This optimistic view, towards the end of the war, became a firm hope for the German public, just like the appearance of new weapons. This tendency eventually affected the German government. The diplomatic errors committed by Himmler, Dönitz, etc., after Hitler's death—namely, seeking an armistice with the British and Americans and resisting the Soviets—stemmed from this reason.

Moreover, British and American psychological propaganda did not let up even until the very end. For example, when the Red Army began its general offensive against Berlin, Eisenhower's headquarters repeatedly broadcast in German and Russian: "Soviet soldiers, stop the atrocities and looting on the Eastern Front! That will only strengthen the German people's will to fight." It sounded as if the British and Americans were defending their homeland alongside the Germans, and were dissatisfied with the Red Army's tyrannical behavior. As a result, many Germans fell for their tricks and fled to areas occupied by British and American troops. This fact also proves that, in spirit, the German people were defeated by British and American propaganda warfare.

German New Weapons

The German people, until the very end, firmly believed that the appearance of new weapons would surely reverse the defeat. But did Germany actually have new weapons? According to the Qingxin News, Germany did have new weapons, and they would have appeared if they had been given a little more time.

The first item that can be mentioned is the radio wave emitter. This is a kind of death ray, and its range of emission can reach 1,200 meters on the ground and in the air. It is said that "airplanes are burned immediately when they encounter this ray, and tanks will explode internally." Germany is studying how to expand its sphere of influence so that its effective distance can reach 7,000 meters, but unfortunately various factories have been bombed and destroyed, so mass production could not be achieved in time.

The second type is high-speed aircraft. Because Germany lacked gasoline, it tried its best to invent an engine that did not use gasoline. It is said that "a jet fighter propelled by oxygen explosion has been successfully developed." Its speed is said to be faster than the speed of sound. It has been practically applied since the spring of this year, and is active east of Berlin, but mass production is also not possible. Generally speaking, it is a mother-child aircraft, that is, carrying a small aircraft on a large aircraft, releasing the small aircraft at an appropriate place, and using radio to control it to intercept enemy bombers or bomb enemy cities. However, this cannot sway the overall trend of the war.

In short, new weapons are not miracles. They are the result of a high level of science and constant effort. Even if their performance is very excellent, they cannot exert their power without mass production. This is the lesson that the European War gives us.

The Brutality of the British and American Armies

When the British and American armies fight, the black soldiers are used as their shields. The American commanding officers call the black soldiers mobile obstacles. No matter how many black soldiers are killed or wounded, they do not care about it any more than they care about the consumption of ammunition. This fully exposes the inhuman essence of the British and Americans, who are full of talk about humanitarianism and freedom. However, black soldiers are also bloodthirsty. As long as they are given a moment of pleasure, they are willing to endure the difficult life on the front lines. The British and Americans have seen through this weakness of the black people, and in order to drive them, they tacitly allow them to rob the German people, and even secretly order them to commit atrocities. However, the American authorities later executed the black soldiers who followed the orders according to military law, so those who do not know the inside story often think that the American army's military discipline is indeed strict and orderly. In fact, they are sacrificing black people to achieve their goals. As for the behavior of the American soldiers themselves, what is it like? Let's not talk about anything else. Just look at the behavior of the American soldiers when they were stationed in London, didn't they almost cause a serious diplomatic problem because of morality cases?

When British and American aircraft groups carry out air raids, they often scatter a large amount of raw sulfur in addition to incendiary bombs, causing poisonous gas to appear on the ground. They also pour a lot of gasoline when bombings cause fires, in order to completely burn the people on the ground to death. As a result, 40,000 people were sacrificed in the city of Treusden alone.

### Municipal Ordinance: Protecting Grain Transport. Severe Punishment for Anyone Found Obstructing or Extorting

The Municipal Government of this city received an order from the Executive Yuan, stating that the recent abnormal fluctuations in rice prices have greatly affected people's livelihoods. Therefore, emergency measures will be implemented, as follows: "The procurement work of the Rice Grain Control Committee and all other organizations will be temporarily suspended.

### Lao Zha Police Station Cracks Major Case: Soldiers Collude with Gangsters to Rob Fabric Factory

The Lao Zha Police Branch previously arrested suspects in a military robbery of a hotel on April 5th of this year. After investigation by the Security Command, the suspects were found guilty and executed according to law. On the 11th of this month, soldiers colluded with gangsters to rob the Xin Guang Fabric Factory of registered cotton fabrics worth tens of millions of yuan. Xu, the head of the branch, and Song Bingzheng, the director of the third section, summoned all judicial personnel, including plainclothes officer Song Shaomei, to discuss countermeasures in detail. Director Song instructed the course of action, and Officer Song, along with other officers, solved the case after several days of careful investigation. The suspects and stolen goods were arrested and recovered. The details are as follows:

Unlawful Soldiers Rob Fabric

On the morning of the 11th of this month, at around 5:00 AM, two soldiers and five men in plain clothes,  from the Business Coordination Association, moved 633 registered multicolored cotton fabrics and 120 bales of cotton yarn onto a pre-arranged truck. Because the personnel intimidated and beat anyone, and did not allow anyone to go outside to report the matter, Jiang Zuqin, an apprentice at Da Long Fabric Store inside, became suspicious. He secretly went outside and witnessed a truck loaded with yarn and cloth speeding away. Afterwards, the factory owner Ma Yaoting reported the facts to the Lao Zha Branch. Xu, the head of the branch, and Song Bingzheng, the director of the third section, gathered all officers on duty, including plainclothes officer Song Shaomei, to discuss the case. Based on the truck's color sample provided by Jiang, they investigated at various truck companies and the Traffic Section of the General Bureau. They found that the truck belonged to Yi You Truck Company at 267 Anhui Road, number  "27169", driven by driver Xia Jingen. They summoned Xia to the bureau for investigation.

Investigating All Night, Suspects Arrested

Xia claimed that at around 4:00 AM that morning, six or seven soldiers ordered him to drive the truck to 756 Jiujiang Road to load fabric, then drive to Shunchang Road to park. After the fabric was transferred to handcarts, it was moved away. Director Song immediately ordered officers to investigate handcarts at various locations on Shunchang Road based on  Xia's statement. As a result, the handcart driver Gu Lao San, who had transported the fabric, was arrested and brought to the bureau. He stated: "The fabric was moved to a house at 120 Ximen Road." That night, they went to the aforementioned location and arrested the suspect Zhang Gendi and recovered part of the stolen goods. The case began to take shape. Based on Zhang's statement,  it was the work of demobilized soldiers. They notified the commander of the soldiers' service unit to detain the unlawful soldiers while continuing the investigation. They arrested the director Ma Weixiang at the China Operations Company at 334 Nanjing Road. Based on Ma's statement, they arrested another principal offender, Li Yu, and Shi Shichun and Tang Yaoxing at the Grand China Hotel. Based on the confessions of the suspects, most of the stolen goods were recovered one after another. More than twenty people were involved in receiving the stolen goods, and they will be investigated and prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office.

Huge Fraud Case Worth 200 Million Yuan

On the 6th of this month, Wang Zhuliang and other businessmen reported to the third section of the branch that Hong Kang Securities, located in the Securities Building at 426 Hankou Road, was opened by partners Pan Hongliang and Jiang Shanhua, who engaged in stock trading on behalf of customers. Wang and fifteen others sold stocks and entrusted the company to buy stocks with mortgaged gold, totaling 200 million yuan. On June 6th, the company stopped operating, and Pan and Jiang disappeared. It was clearly a case of fraudulent acquisition of property. Plainclothes officer Feng Xiushan, who was on duty, took charge of the case. After investigating, they discovered that Pan and Jiang were hiding in Room 505 of the Jinmen Hotel. They went to the address, but Pan and Jiang had already fled upon hearing the news. They only arrested the accountant Tang Yu and brought him to the bureau for investigation. Because Tang had brought the account books to his residence, he was suspected of being an accomplice in the fraud and was detained for investigation. They are currently pursuing Jiang and Pan to bring them to justice.

### Home Tutor Training Class to Hold Entrance Exam Today

Engaging Home Tutors, Please Come to Discuss

The newspaper's Compulsory Education Committee has established a "Home Tutor Training Class" to meet social needs. It has been observed that the academic performance of children from wealthy families in Shanghai is often substandard and they even fail to advance to the next grade. During summer vacation, parents should find ways to help their children catch up on their studies. Otherwise, a long summer spent playing all day will inevitably lead to further neglect. Therefore, summer tutoring is essential. However, home tutoring is not easy to do. Therefore, the committee has recruited qualified primary school teachers and provided them with short-term training in preparation for employment by families. More than seventy people have applied to the committee in recent days, mostly women. The entrance exam will be held today (20th) at 4:30 PM at the Qunhua Primary School on West Changxing Road. Those who pass will begin training the following day.
