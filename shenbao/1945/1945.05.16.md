### Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Announces Yesterday: Japan-Germany-Italy Treaty Invalid; New Policies Adopted to Cope with the International Situation

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The administration of Chancellor Hitler, who shouldered the heavy responsibility of Germany's rise and fall, has issued an order for the German army, navy, and air force to surrender unconditionally to the four nations of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The long-term European war, lasting several years, has now come to an end. Germany is now under the control of the Anglo-American-Soviet military government. The German and Italian forces in Northern Italy also surrendered unconditionally to the anti-Axis forces on May 2nd. The Italian Fascist Republic has also been eliminated. Under these circumstances, all treaties concluded between Japan, Germany, and Italy, as well as all conditions related to special relations between Japan and Germany and other European countries, must naturally become invalid. Therefore, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru explained this matter at the regular cabinet meeting on the 15th. After paying homage to His Majesty the Emperor at the palace at 2 PM and reporting the conclusion, he invited the German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, to his official residence at 4 PM to inform him of the new policies adopted by the Japanese government in response to the situation. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the treaties between the Japanese government and Germany and other European countries have lost their validity. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has clearly stated the invalidity of the treaties between the Japanese government and Germany and other European countries as follows:

"Due to Germany's unconditional surrender and in light of the recent developments in Europe, the Japanese government believes that the Tripartite Agreement concluded on December 11, 1941, the Tripartite Pact concluded on September 27, 1940, and all treaties stipulating special cooperative relations between the Japanese government and Germany and other European countries have lost their validity."

### Eleven Treaties Deemed Invalid

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – Among the treaties concerning the relations between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the core was the Tripartite Pact concluded on September 27, 1940, and the Tripartite Agreement concluded on December 11, 1941. The Tripartite Pact stipulated joint cooperation in building a new order in East Asia, with Japan, Germany, and Italy as signatory countries, and later Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and other countries joined. The Tripartite Agreement stipulated that Japan, Germany, and Italy would not make a separate peace in the war against Britain and the United States. However, after the death of German leader Hitler, the situation in Germany changed drastically. The Italian Fascist Republic was eliminated due to the execution or arrest of its leaders, including Mussolini. Furthermore, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and other countries also severed relations with Japan. Therefore, from any point of view, the treaty relationships with these European countries must be considered completely invalid. Moreover, the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Japan, Germany, and Italy has also effectively become invalid due to the dissolution of the Communist Third International on June 6th of the previous year. In total, there are eleven treaties that have become invalid: two concerning politics, two concerning economy, four concerning culture, and three concerning anti-communism. The treaties concerning politics are: The Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Pact (signed on September 27, 1940), The Japan-Germany-Italy Agreement (signed on December 11, 1941). The treaties concerning economy are: The Agreement on Japan-Germany Economic Cooperation (signed on January 20, 1943), The Agreement on Japan-Italy Economic Cooperation (signed on January 20, 1943). The treaties concerning culture are: The Japan-Hungary Treaty of Friendship and Cultural Cooperation (signed on November 15, 1938), The Japan-Germany Agreement on Cultural Cooperation (signed on November 25, 1938), The Japan-Italy Agreement on Cultural Cooperation (signed on March 23, 1939), The Japan-Bulgaria Treaty of Friendship and Cultural Cooperation (signed on February 11, 1943). The treaties concerning anti-communism are: The Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact (signed on November 25, 1936), The Japan-Germany-Italy Supplementary Agreement to the Anti-Comintern Pact (signed on November 6, 1937), The Japan-Germany-Italy Protocol Extending the Validity of the Anti-Comintern Pact (signed on November 25, 1941).

### Ambassador Tani Returns to Report on His Duties

### Japanese Government Establishes War Disaster Reconstruction Department

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – To adapt to the severe war situation, the Japanese government has decided to thoroughly implement measures regarding the reconstruction of war disasters and the support of various policies. It has decided to establish a War Disaster Reconstruction Department within the General Planning Bureau.

### Five Enemy Warships Sunk or Destroyed off the Coast of Kyushu and Southeast Seas; Japanese Kamikaze Units Achieve Glorious Results

Kyushu, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force repeatedly attacked enemy mobile units approaching the Southeast Seas on the 14th. It has now been confirmed that the results of the battle include the sinking or destruction of two aircraft carriers, one battleship, and two warships of unknown type. A total of 668 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked various parts of Kyushu on the 14th. Due to the brave interception by the Japanese air defense units and anti-aircraft artillery units, they achieved the results of shooting down 15 aircraft and destroying more than 10 aircraft. The enemy's attempts were completely frustrated, and Japanese losses were extremely minor.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Fukuoka, the enemy mobile units approaching the southeast coast of Kyushu, approximately 150 kilometers away, are estimated to have a force of 80 to 100 aircraft on regular carriers and 30 to 50 aircraft on special carriers, based on the number of attacking aircraft. A total of 900 aircraft attacked on the 13th, launching in three waves, so the actual number of aircraft dispatched was approximately 300. The escort aircraft and attacking aircraft were roughly the same. Based on this calculation, it is estimated that the enemy force consists of 500 to 600 aircraft, formed by two mobile units composed of two regular carriers and two special carriers.

### Enemy Aircraft Carry Out Strategic Bombing

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – From 8 PM on the 12th to 8 AM on the 13th, approximately 30 F6F Hellcat aircraft and a small number of Yokosuka D4Y Suisei carrier-based aircraft from the Okinawa base attacked Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Nagasaki Prefectures, indiscriminately using cluster bombs and incendiaries before returning. The purpose of this attack seemed to be to scout out Japanese air bases as a preliminary operation before a large-scale attack on Kyushu by enemy mobile carrier-based aircraft. As expected, at 6 AM, a newly formed enemy mobile unit heading north from the sea west of the Ryukyu Islands approached the Ban Sea of Kyushu and first attacked Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures with approximately 80 carrier-based aircraft. Subsequently, large-scale wave attacks were launched against Japanese air bases in the southern region. Later, several B-29 aircraft repeatedly attacked and withdrew at around 6 PM. The total number of attacking aircraft reached 900. The enemy launched a large-scale air raid on southern Kyushu with carrier-based aircraft on March 18th. This was the second large-scale air raid. The enemy's objective in this attack was to preemptively suppress the deployment of special attack units, fearing the ramming attacks of the Japanese special attack units, in an attempt to break the deadlock in the Okinawa operation. On the day after Germany's unconditional surrender, US President Truman broadcasted to the entire United States, stating that Europe had achieved victory, but the East must not lag behind. Before achieving final victory, everyone should fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, May 13th was designated as a new day for the attack on Japan to encourage national fighting spirit. The enemy's air raids on the 13th were precisely Truman's so-called "day of prayer." Therefore, this attack contained some strategic intentions. The enemy's intention remained to destroy Japanese air bases. At the same time, the closer the enemy mobile units get to mainland Japan, the more damage they will suffer, which goes without saying.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Kaohsiung and Taichung

Taipei, 15th (Central News Agency) – On the 14th during the day, approximately 60 enemy bombers and over ten fighters, which took off from bases in the Philippine Islands, attacked several times. Most of them attacked the Kaohsiung area, and a portion attacked the vicinity of Taichung.

Editorial

### Evacuation and Counter-Evacuation

This newspaper has repeatedly discussed the issue of urban population evacuation, because in order to avoid unnecessary losses and reduce the burden of living, it is imperative to implement the evacuation plan as soon as possible. However, amidst the current calls for population evacuation, a serious phenomenon of counter-evacuation has been discovered, namely the fact that the population of cities near Shanghai is counter-evacuating to Shanghai. We have repeatedly pointed out that Shanghai is a special area that is often mistakenly regarded as a land of ease and a city of gold. Therefore, in order to evacuate the population, the first step must be to prevent residents from outside the city from moving into the city. In view of the success of evacuation policies in places like Hong Kong in the past, it is necessary to carefully consider adopting measures to restrict entry. We offered several suggestions in the editorial on February 15th of this year, but at that time, various parties may have considered this suggestion to be insignificant. However, in the months since, very few urban residents have been evacuated, while the number of residents from nearby towns and cities moving to Shanghai has increased sharply. This phenomenon is contrary to the evacuation policy.

There are three main reasons for the "counter-evacuation" of residents from nearby towns to Shanghai: 1. Unrest in various regions; 2. Shanghai has various entertainment facilities that are sufficient to attract wealthy people from various places like flies; 3. Shanghai has various speculative markets, the so-called "playground for risk-takers," which also contributes to population concentration.

However, due to the excessive population in Shanghai and the "counter-evacuation" of residents from surrounding areas to Shanghai, the social and economic problems in Shanghai are becoming increasingly serious. First, due to the evolving situation, Shanghai cannot be guaranteed to be a safe area, which is very obvious. Once the war approaches and enemy air raids become frequent, such a concentration of population will cause unimaginable damage. Second, due to the lack of electricity and fuel and the difficulty of transportation, Shanghai has become a city with stagnant production. In the past, Shanghai was able to accommodate approximately five million people because it was an industrial city with developed industrial production, so commerce and industry were prosperous, and agricultural materials were constantly exchanged. However, Shanghai is no longer such a city, and production has stagnated. The number of unemployed people is increasing, and if external transportation is obstructed and food supplies are cut off, a social crisis will immediately arise.

Under these circumstances, evacuating urban residents is an urgent and unavoidable measure. In light of the reality, the first step of today's evacuation policy must be for the relevant authorities to immediately issue measures to prohibit the entry of non-essential population from other areas, and to restrict the length of stay in the city for general travelers. Only by restricting the entry population can the evacuation of the city's population be effective. At the same time, the authorities of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui near Shanghai, as well as the local authorities of various counties and cities, must cooperate closely with the city and impose necessary restrictions on residents going to Shanghai.

Second, as far as the evacuation of the city's population is concerned, the results have been minimal since its launch. The main reason is the inconvenience of transportation. Most transportation agencies, such as shipping companies and even national and public agencies, only seek to profit from their operations and are unaware of the important mission they bear to the country and the war. Although the authorities of these agencies outwardly agree to cooperate with the city's population evacuation committee, in reality, it is just empty talk. If this attitude is not fundamentally changed, it will be the biggest obstacle to the city's population evacuation plan. Therefore, we especially hope today that the leaders of the water and land transportation agencies can change their profit-oriented policy and set aside at least one special evacuation ship or train per week to effectively assist in the evacuation of the city's population. Amidst the current calls for actively promoting the plan to evacuate the population, it is necessary to pay attention to correcting the reality of residents from other areas moving to Shanghai. Otherwise, the city's population has not yet been evacuated, and residents from various places are moving in, causing the total population to increase instead, which is fraught with danger.

Okinawa Decisive Battle

### Enemy US Suffers Heavy Damage; Awaiting Reinforcements

The Okinawa decisive battle, which is reaching a severe climax, is still affected by the unpredictable weather, and the Japanese army's fierce attacks are also considerably affected. During this period, the enemy US is trying to replenish its already depleted forces, and its mobile fleet is doing its best to encircle Okinawa Island. Let us examine the enemy US's recent attitude toward the Okinawa decisive battle based on the objective situation.

The organization and expansion of the central and northern Okinawa airfields is its top priority at a time when ship-based aircraft are decreasing. Therefore, although the enemy is complaining about a shortage of ships, it is still doing its best to mobilize from all sides to desperately replenish them.

The enemy mobile fleet is extremely afraid of attacks by Japanese special attack units. Although it once approached Tanegashima, it then returned to the east of Okinawa, operating at a location equidistant between Taiwan and Kyushu, and is closely guarding against the fierce attacks of the Japanese air force.

The enemy US has repeatedly subjected Daito Island to naval bombardment because the island threatens its naval forces from the rear. Therefore, it intends to eliminate it.

The air raids on Kyushu by B-24, B-29, and P-51 aircraft are intended to compensate for the lack of strength of its mobile fleet, while attempting to strike the Japanese bases from which they launch fierce attacks on its mobile fleet. The situation remains the same. However, the number of enemy aircraft attacking the archipelago, including the main island, has been totaling 300-400 in recent days, except for 60 aircraft on April 24th. Half of them are land-based.

Therefore, although the enemy US has suffered heavy obstacles in combat due to enormous attrition, its replenishment power cannot be underestimated. According to the enemy's announcement, its top commanders, such as Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Nimitz, Fifth Fleet Commander Admiral Spruance, Amphibious Forces Commander Turner, and Tenth Army Commander Buckner, held a meeting on Okinawa Island. When Nimitz met with the press corps at the Guam Command on April 23rd, he emphasized the following four points:

1. With the end of the European war, he hopes to transfer the forces from that theater to the Pacific War.
2. He hopes to transfer B-24 and B-17 aircraft from Europe, and ensuring unsinkable air bases is particularly important.
3. The Battle of Okinawa is the most difficult battle ever, and the activity of the Japanese special attack units is an extremely terrible threat, which will become even more severe as the situation develops.
4. Controlling Okinawa is the only way to facilitate offensive operations along the Chinese coast and the Japanese mainland.

But in reality, the matters discussed at that meeting were probably nothing more than the following points: 1. How to effectively and actively use ships and fleets, and what are the specific plans.
2. How to expedite this bill, assuming that there will be little troop withdrawal from Europe.
3. How to deal with the Japanese special attack units.
4. How to urge the country to continuously replenish its attrition.
5. How to use the Okinawa decisive battle to contribute to the San Francisco Conference and other things.
6. How to handle the case when Nimitz returns to the country on official business.

Its attempt to create a fait accompli for the San Francisco Conference has already been thwarted by the continuous fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Before the opening of the conference, its stereotypical strategic offensive did not show any noteworthy facts, which is enough to prove that the attacking power that the enemy can mobilize in that area is far less than before. However, the forces that the enemy US has concentrated at the Okinawa decisive battleground are still quite large. Nimitz's mission in returning to the country is likely to further emphasize the importance of relying solely on quantity, in order to expand its replenishment production capacity and plan to transfer the armaments supplied to the European war to the Pacific, while also requiring the anti-Axis countries to take a concrete cooperative attitude toward the Pacific war, and to seek to ease the burden on the Okinawa side by actively involving the American Northern base in the diversionary operation against Japan.

In short, it is abundantly clear that it is important to destroy the enemy US before its huge replenishment power begins to rise. The key point of the decisive battle is just one word: "strength." (Translated from the April 26th Yomiuri Hochi)

Manchuria is a peasant country, and farmers across the country are fully aware of the current situation, and they get up early and sleep late, devoting themselves to increasing production. They are able to supply the amount of production designated by the central government each year. Workers in important mining departments such as iron, steel, coal, and light gold sea are working hard and do not dare to relax for a second, even during good days and festivals, they do not stop working.

They are all standing up to face difficulties, going forward to destroy the enemy, vowing to live this decisive battle life with a special attack spirit, wanting to enrich manpower to strengthen material strength, and then use their own materials to conquer the enemy's material strength, and strive for the final victory.

### Austrian Provisional Government Established; Issues Declaration of Independence; U.S. Authorities Reiterate Non-Recognition

Stockholm, Sweden, Central News Agency, 15th – The Austrian Lechner regime, backed by the Soviet Union, broadcast the following on the 14th: The Austrian provisional government declares Austrian independence and the reconstruction of a democratic republic. Representatives of Austria's three political parties signed the declaration of independence. To ensure the fairness and impartiality of the provisional government, each of the three parties will select a representative to serve as a member of the provisional government. The significance of the Lechner regime's declaration of independence lies in dissolving the German-Austrian union of March 1938 and restoring the Republic Constitution of 1920. However, behind the scenes lies the Kremlin's preemptive strategy, similar to the Polish issue, which will inevitably lead to future disputes.

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 15th – Washington dispatch: U.S. Department of the Interior authorities reiterated on the 14th that they do not recognize the Austrian Lechner regime.

### Eden and Truman Hold Talks

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 14th – Washington dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden, on his way home, arrived in Washington on the 14th and held talks with U.S. President Truman.

### San Francisco Conference Has Lost Importance; Matsudaira Elaborates on His Views

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Information Minister Matsudaira expressed his views on the San Francisco Conference, stating briefly: The future of this conference is bleak, and it will undoubtedly end in failure. The first reason is the inability to reconcile between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and smaller countries. Even conflicts have arisen between Britain and the United States. Secondly, since the end of the European war, various political and economic problems have emerged one after another. The main representatives of various countries are no longer able to focus on the joint progress of the conference, and those returning home are continuously on their journey. The importance of the conference is somewhat diminished. Those remaining in San Francisco are merely secondary figures. In the future, even if decisions are made, they will only concern some trivial issues to maintain the face of the United States. In summary, the aim of using this conference to suppress East Asia has not been achieved. On the contrary, it has invited the right of small countries to speak, making international issues more complicated. Moreover, the position of the United States will not be enhanced by this conference.

### Göring's Indictment for Crimes

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 14th – Luxembourg Radio broadcast: The War Crimes Investigation Committee will first try Marshal Göring.

### Economic Blackout to be Strictly Enforced; Joint Punishment Will Be Adopted for Violators

In order to thoroughly strengthen air defense and prevent enemy aircraft from invading, the city's air defense authorities implemented a regular blackout citywide starting yesterday (the 15th). The regulations have been published in detail in various newspapers, and citizens are expected to strictly comply. It is understood that the situation last night was not perfect. It is hoped that citizens will pay close attention and work together to improve.

### Strict Punishment for Light Leaks

It is also understood that the military and police authorities are determined to strictly enforce the regular blackout. They will dispatch personnel every night to patrol each district under their jurisdiction. Regardless of whether it is a company, firm, shop, or residence, those who violate the blackout or leak light will be severely punished. The punishment method will be the joint responsibility system. If one household leaks light, electricity will be cut off to the entire security unit or even the joint security unit. The household that leaks light will also be prosecuted in accordance with the regulations issued by the Air Defense Headquarters on July 6 of last year, for interfering with military operations and severely punished. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will monitor each other and absolutely prevent light from leaking. If there are any violations, they should be reported to the respective branch bureaus for investigation in order to avoid harming themselves.

### Several Districts Have Already Received Electricity Cut-Offs

On the evening of the Air Defense Day on the 9th of this month, when the city implemented a blackout, the air defense authorities patrolled various districts of the city and discovered that violations of the blackout and light leaks occurred in the first sections of Nanjing Road, South Road, Guangdong Road, and Hubei Road in the Old Zhabei District, and the first sections of North Fujian Road, Haining Road, North Henan Road, and Tianliu Road in the West Hongkou District, and the first sections of Yiyang Road, Lijiang Road, Zhoujiazui Road, and Chang'an Road in the Tilanqiao District. Therefore, the above-mentioned places have been given electricity cut-offs by security unit and the power supply has been stopped from the 10th. However, even though the power has been cut off, the use of other lights must still comply with the regulations, and light must not be leaked, otherwise legal action will still be taken. This also applies to citizens who use other lights after 10:00 PM.

### Air Defense Facilities to be Strengthened Next Month

The city's Civil Air Defense Headquarters will implement "Air Defense Facilities Strengthening Week" starting on the first of next month in order to strengthen air defense facilities. They will organize various air defense facilities and send personnel to inspect air defense facilities in various districts, security units, and even households throughout the city. Those that are not up to standard will be corrected. At the same time, because the existing air defense shelters are not sufficient, small air raid shelters for individual use will be dug starting next month, with the goal of being ubiquitous in all districts of the city.

### Fourth Phase of Air Defense Training Begins

The Civil Air Defense Training Institute of the Civil Air Defense Headquarters held the opening ceremony for the fourth phase at the institute on Datong Road at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 15th). Chief of the Police Defense Department Hiraoka Isamu, Chief of the Fire Department Kiyote Mizumi, Deputy Chief of the Conservation Department Okawa Rinpei, and heads of various branch bureaus, chiefs of general joint security units, and more than 400 trainees attended. Hiraoka Isamu first delivered a training speech on behalf of Director Zhou, followed by speeches from various chiefs such as Kiyote Mizumi. The ceremony concluded at around 11:00 AM.

### Shanghai West Fire Refugees Urgently Need Relief From All Sectors; Provisional Relief Committee Established Yesterday

The unprecedented fire on Yuyao Road in Shanghai West has left thousands of refugees homeless, exposed, hungry, and in a tragic state. Seventeen people from all walks of life in Shanghai West, including Yue Fengzhi, Qian Zong, Wu Songquan, Yuan Zongping, Gu Huanzhang, and Le Boming, have initiated the organization of a provisional relief committee to carry out temporary relief work to meet the urgent needs. At the same time, they have submitted requests to the municipal government and relevant welfare organizations for prompt relief. The committee announced yesterday the cause of the fire and the work being carried out, appealing to all sectors of the city to jointly assist in relieving the disaster victims. The details are as follows:

### Fire Situation

At around 4:00 PM on the 11th of this month, a huge fire of unprecedented scale broke out in the Yuyao Road area of the western district, destroying thousands of shanties and factories. The fire started from a spark left unattended while cooking in a shanty. Due to the strong winds, it spread rapidly. Although firefighters from various districts and volunteer corps arrived to put out the fire and maintain order, it continued to burn until the next morning before it was extinguished. The affected area covered a wide range, and the losses were incalculable. The 5,000 disaster victims had nowhere to turn, were exposed on the streets, and cried out in distress. If relief measures are not taken, they will suffer from hunger and exposure. Furthermore, the impact will affect social order and public health. Therefore, a provisional relief committee was established to temporarily adopt five measures to begin with: 1. Bury the dead; 2. Send the injured to the hospital; 3. Distribute food; 4. Find temporary shelter; 5. Provide assistance for returning to their hometowns. The urgency of the situation cannot be delayed, and work began on the night of the 11th. However, the disaster area is vast, and the number of disaster victims is large. We deeply feel that our strength is limited and we cannot complete the task. Therefore, we believe that disaster relief and poverty alleviation are obligations that everyone should fulfill. We hereby appeal to all sectors to work together to assist.

### Relief Meeting

The provisional relief committee for the Yuyao Road fire held an initiators' meeting yesterday afternoon. More than ten people, including Le Fenglin, Wu Songquan, Wang Wanqing, Xian Huanzhang, and Wu Yongping, attended. Wu Songquan chaired the meeting. In addition to reporting that the dead had been buried and the injured were being treated, the meeting discussed how to advance the work. It was resolved to prepare survey forms to investigate the exact amount of damage in order to determine relief standards, register those returning to their hometowns in order to provide assistance for returning. The meeting also discussed raising funds widely, believing that many hands make light work. The office is now located at 351 Kangding Road. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously.

### Detailed Account of the Yuyao Road Fire: Disaster Situation is Serious, Urgently Awaiting Relief from All Sectors

By Jia Xi

At around 4:00 PM on the 11th, a fire broke out in the first shanty town area of Yuyao Road (formerly Singapore Road). It gradually extinguished at 9:00 AM the next morning. It is estimated that over three thousand shanties, more than ten factories, two ancestral halls were burned down, four people were burned to death, seven were seriously injured, and two firefighters were seriously injured. The extent of the disaster area and the number of disaster victims are unprecedented in recent years.

### The Raging Fire

The fire was started by Jiang Rongzi, a resident of the northern shanty town of Yuyao Road. Jiang, age 40, and his wife Jiang Zhao, age 35, were selling incense candles outside. There were three children at home: eldest daughter Ying, age 15, second son, age eight, and the youngest still in swaddling clothes. Ying, because her younger siblings were hungry, was warming a cake on the stove to feed them. To get more fire, she piled more fuel. Unfortunately, the wind rose at that time, blowing the embers onto the thatched roof. The fire broke out from the top of the shanty. At that time, the south wind was blowing hard, and wherever the ash fell, it immediately ignited. From the north side of the road to the south, it immediately turned into a fiery sea spanning tens of acres!

The first fire truck arrived at 5:30 PM, but by then more than a thousand shanties had already burned down. A commonly used water dragon head was already engulfed in the sea of fire. The other four water dragon heads on Yuyao Road were in disrepair and could not produce a drop of water. After searching and searching, they finally found a water dragon head in front of the gate of 1171 Kangding Road at Jin Situ Temple. However, the hose was not long enough, so they were busy connecting hoses. By the time the hoses prepared by various districts were delivered, a lot of time had already been lost.

### The Fire Spreads

The shanty town area on the south side of the road was all on fire. The flames spread with the wind, and more than forty houses in Jun'an Lane caught fire in turn, extending to the factory area. Wanbao Silk Factory, Sanbao Silk Weaving Factory, Jiuxing Weaving Factory, 42 buildings in Longxing Lane, Daji Chemical Factory, Liangji Artificial Stone Factory, Ruibo Electrical Factory, and Hu Lixing Electrical Factory were all affected one after another. The shops along 180 to 184 Yuyao Road were also not spared.

The affected areas are in the Huashan District:

Third Block of the Seventh Joint Security Unit, 142 households, 730 people, Block Leader Zhang Ronghua.

Second Block of the Sixth Joint Security Unit, 290 households, 1,900 people, Block Leader Yao Yuzhi.

Fifth Block of the Sixth Joint Security Unit, 180 households, 960 people, Block Leader Xia Changjiang.

Sixth Block of the Sixth Joint Security Unit, 250 households, 1,100 people, Block Leader Zhao Jingqing.

Except for the Second Block of the Sixth Joint Security Unit, which are alleyway houses, the rest are shanties. These shanties are all built with bamboo, reed mats, bamboo mats, and straw. They are low, dark, and damp. Most people sleep on the ground. Only a few families have wooden beds. These houses are connected to each other, and five or six people have to squeeze into a small shanty, or even six or seven families, with twenty or thirty people, old and young, male and female, lying together. When it rains, they roll around completely in the mud.

### A Glimpse of the Disaster Area

When the reporter visited, these shanties had become piles of straw ashes, mixed with some wood chips, charred cotton wadding, scrap iron, broken pottery shards, etc. The ashes were flying, and the stench went straight to the nose. The disaster victims are all coolies who are barefoot all year round, whose occupations are nothing more than pulling rickshaws, carrying sedan chairs, pedaling tricycles, and various vegetable vendors, or workers working in nearby factories, most of whom are from Su Bei, Sucheng, Jianning, Taizhou, and other places. Most of them have no land in their hometowns and cannot make a living if they return, so no matter how difficult life is, they will never leave.

Piles of yellow new shacks, with green bamboo intertwined to support them, look like camps from a distance. Getting closer, it is truly miserable. The temporary sheds are so low that you can only crawl in. They are completely open to the sky. Inside, the good ones are paved with boards salvaged from the fire, piled with one or two clumps of black cotton wadding. The worse ones just scatter some straw on the ground. The clothes and bedding were mostly not rescued, leaving only the torn and patched pants worn on their bodies. The better ones that were usually reluctant to wear, the cotton quilts, etc., were also burned along with the shanties. For the past four days, they have had to huddle together and shiver in the cold of the night. Even if they could find a lined robe to cover themselves, it would not be enough to keep warm. Some simply put some straw on the ground and spent the night in the open air completely without cover. Ash, cold, wind, rain, and the smell of burning were all affecting them.

### Relief Work

Now, it costs at least 200,000 yuan to build a small shed for five or six people to live in. According to a shanty builder, the materials require at least 15 large bamboo poles, two bundles of small bamboo poles, two large bamboo mats, 20 reed mats, and four bundles of straw, plus lead wire, nails, labor, etc. But ten out of ten families cannot afford it. They are now all buying two small bamboo poles and three or four small mats to build a temporary shed to live in. These small sheds that cannot withstand wind and rain also cost 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. There is a large straw shed under construction, which is said to have already cost more than one million yuan.

These disaster victims are almost completely penniless, and even pots, bowls, basins, and chopsticks have been burned to nothing. It is impossible to cook. Now they all rely on temporary handouts of porridge and steamed buns to barely survive, but this is not a thorough solution.

The disaster victims urgently need, in addition to money, old quilts, old clothes, shoes, iron pots, rice bowls, iron cans, earthenware basins, chopsticks, and food such as rice, corn flour, dried sweet potatoes, and side dishes such as dried radish and pickles. It is hoped that people from all walks of life can donate generously.

### Our Newspaper Receives Donations on Behalf

To lead by example, our newspaper first donates 100,000 yuan, and President Chen of our newspaper donates another 50,000 yuan, as relief funds for the disaster area. If you would like to donate, our newspaper's Social Service Department will begin receiving donations on behalf of the victims today and will transfer them to the responsible authorities for distribution at any time.

### Director Gu of the Propaganda Department Took Office Yesterday

Former Director Liu Dexuan handed over the seals and documents, and then convened a meeting of all staff in the department to encourage everyone to do their best to work in their positions. His words were mostly admonishing, and the staff were deeply moved.

In addition, the Shanghai Small Newspaper Association held a welcome banquet for Director Gu at the Kangle Grand Building at 7:00 PM last night. The atmosphere at the time was extremely enthusiastic. The Shanghai branch of the China News Association is also scheduled to hold a welcome banquet for Director Gu today.

### Jiangsu Province Delegation Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Trip Was Successfully Completed

### North Train Station: Improvements to Order - A Conversation with the Head of the China Railway Shanghai Bureau

To thoroughly reorganize the station's order and facilitate legitimate passengers, the Shanghai Bureau of the China Central Railway Company has, since the beginning of this month, undertaken significant reforms. In addition to regulating ticket purchasing and entrance facilities for passengers, strict discipline has been imposed on all subordinate Chinese staff, and employees violating regulations have been dismissed. Simultaneously, to respond to passenger concerns, a passenger information desk was officially established on the 15th to resolve various passenger difficulties. Yesterday afternoon, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Da Meiyuan, the head of the Bureau and stationmaster, and Mr. Naito, the deputy stationmaster, who kindly shared the following conversation about the North Station's station affairs and the reforms in station order:

This station is eliminating illegal staff members, dismissing them, and employing new personnel. To prevent a recurrence of past problems, we will strictly manage new employees in the future. Previously, due to language barriers among the station's Japanese personnel and a lack of deep understanding of Chinese customs, a small number of Chinese staff members inevitably took advantage of their positions and engaged in improper behavior. Through this thorough reorganization, we aim to ensure that every passenger is satisfied and receives convenient service. From the stationmaster down to all staff members, we are now approaching the Chinese people with sincerity. To maintain order and correct past不良現象, wooden fences have been installed at the station entrance, designating separate entrances for first, second, and third-class passengers, and preventing illegal elements and vendors from entering the station. This should greatly benefit passengers entering the station. The passenger information desk is dedicated to solving all passenger difficulties and providing practical assistance. In addition to Deputy Stationmaster Xinye concurrently serving as its head, three Chinese staff members have been appointed to assist with the work. In the future, any improper behavior by station staff should be reported to the station immediately to eradicate abuses. To rigorously manage Chinese staff, they will receive appropriate education to ensure they deeply understand the necessary knowledge. To facilitate ticket purchases for female passengers traveling alone, an additional ticket window has been set up next to the existing ticket office to serve Chinese female passengers. The station was unaware of the past rampant activities of the "Yellow Gang" preying on passengers. In addition to sending personnel for secret investigations, we hope the police bureau will take responsibility for investigating and rely on passenger cooperation to report any illegal activities. If station staff members are found to have engaged in illegal behavior, we will handle it impartially and without leniency based on evidence provided. Firstly, the station will conduct close inspections of Chinese staff, and those found to be engaging in improper conduct will be dismissed.

As the Great East Asia War intensifies, China and Japan are closely collaborating to secure final victory. Therefore, China Railway itself is striving to明　化 passenger transportation under決戰, to alleviate the travel pains of the people. The passenger information desk established today is entirely dedicated to serving the Chinese people, and we hope you will make full use of it. Regarding passengers carrying light luggage into the station in the future, the limit is two pieces, totaling 15 kilograms. If the weight is exceeded, a luggage ticket must be purchased. We earnestly hope that citizens purchase tickets in an orderly queue and remain calm when purchasing tickets, please do not自行　擾, to maintain order. This will speed up ticket sales and allow you to retrieve any change due. Furthermore, non-passengers and all vendors are not allowed to enter the station. Except for official business and special circumstances involving picking up or seeing off passengers, you can apply to the information desk to purchase platform tickets, limited to two tickets per person. The information desk's service hours are from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Regarding the luggage room facilities, iron doors will be installed again on the 17th of this month to prevent混入 by those with bad intentions. Nearby vendors will also be driven away, not only to facilitate traffic but also to protect the health of passengers. Finally, we sincerely hope that every passenger purchases tickets for the prescribed車, avoiding unnecessary　消耗, and　厉拒　black market tickets.

### Only Adjusting Cash on Hand, Strictly Suppressing Premiums - A Conversation with the Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank

Recently, there has been a continued shortage of cash筹码 in the market, and people have experienced premium (贴水) issues when needing cash. Yesterday, a reporter made a special visit to Mr. Qian, the Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, to inquire about the situation. He kindly responded as follows:

Our bank's adjustment of cash positions for银钱业 is solely for the purpose of enabling them to meet the needs of their depositors. Therefore, to the best of our ability竊, we will provide assistance. Based on the daily amount of cash disbursed, there should not be a situation in the market where there is a shortage of铁码, leading to premiums. However, we fear that some unscrupulous colleagues are deliberately withholding cash to collect premiums and profit from it. We must find ways to eliminate this trend. Previously, we ordered the Financial Affairs Inspection Office to send personnel for thorough investigations. It has been discovered that a small number of colleagues are collecting large amounts of cash daily while imposing strict restrictions on depositors and selling the cash at a premium. This behavior must be suppressed. Therefore, we have continued to order strict inspections. If any colleagues engage in this behavior again, they will be severely punished once discovered, and their right to collect cash daily will be suspended. As for colleagues with numerous deposits, whose daily cash collection is truly insufficient, we will make appropriate and adequate supplies at any time, with the ultimate goal of eliminating premiums, saving merchants from unnecessary losses, and achieving full stability of the social economy.

### Second Phase of Gold Certificates to Be Issued Starting Tomorrow

The gold certificates approved for issuance by the Central Reserve Bank were issued in the first phase on the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd of this month, with exceptionally good results. The demand was extremely enthusiastic. Because the bank's listed gold certificate prices were fairer than general black market prices, and the gold reserve was sufficient, redemption was conducted after one month, which gained considerable public trust. We have learned that the second phase of gold certificates will be issued from the 17th to the 19th of this month, still lasting for three days. The listed price of the gold certificates will also be revised according to the latest market conditions. It is anticipated that there will be even more enthusiastic buyers at that time.
