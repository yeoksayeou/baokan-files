### Japanese Special Attack Units Continue Fierce Attacks; Sink Three Enemy Warships; Fierce Land Battles Unfold on Okinawa Island

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Enemy forces in the southern region of Okinawa, in coordination with naval gunfire, concentrated artillery fire on the central highlands area from around 6:00 AM on the 26th. Around 10:00 AM, they deployed powerful tank units, gradually advancing on various fronts including Nakama (1 kilometer southwest of Sashiki), Maeda (1.5 kilometers south of Gushikawa), and Kouchi (30 kilometers south of Gokokufu), engaging Japanese forces in the area. Enemy activity was subdued on other battle lines, seemingly in preparation for further attacks. Simultaneously, Japanese special attack units continued fierce attacks on enemy warship groups, sinking three vessels of unspecified type. At 2:20 PM, intense anti-aircraft fire was visible around the Kerama Islands. After 4:00 PM, heavy anti-aircraft fire also erupted around the northern and central airfields, providing a glimpse of the ferocity of the Japanese attacks.

### Director-General Shimomura Broadcasts: Victory in the Battle of Okinawa Is Certain; Urges One Hundred Million Citizens to Rise Up in a General Offensive

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau, Hiroshi Shimomura, broadcast on the radio at 7:00 PM on the 27th, under the title "Surpassing Okinawa," to clarify the government's information propaganda policy. He also explained how the Japanese people should respond to the current war situation, calling on the entire nation to rise up. The key points are as follows: Currently, there are various opinions and hopes regarding the government, the most common of which are the following two: We, the people, are prepared and will not panic no matter what happens. Therefore, we hope the authorities will clarify the true facts. We do not know what else to do. We hope the government will issue clear directives to guide the people's path. Regarding the first point, I also agree. Under the current circumstances, no matter how one argues, the unfavorable situation is indeed a fact. Since the fall of Saipan, Iwo Jima has also fallen into enemy hands. The Japanese mainland has also been subjected to enemy air raids. This current state is not optimistic. Therefore, all facts must be made public. Otherwise, rumors will spread. Therefore, the extent of damage from recent air raids has been published in detail to the extent possible. As for the second point, encouraging morale, increasing production of weapons, securing food supplies, and defending the homeland are all being actively promoted. From now on, the emphasis will be on how to implement these measures vigorously. Prime Minister Suzuki once said, "This cabinet does not need to advocate new slogans. There is only one thing: war. And in war, there is only victory." Currently, the battle of Okinawa is imminent. Of course, the battle of Okinawa cannot determine the final victory or defeat between Japan and the United States. However, after the fall of Saipan and Iwo Jima, what will be the result? Now that Okinawa has fallen into enemy hands, the enemy has not only acquired a powerful base to attack Japan, but also threatens Japan's maritime communications with the mainland. Thinking about this, we must defend Okinawa. Up to today's battle records, the United States also admits that Japan has the advantage. Although Japan will inevitably suffer considerable sacrifices, the losses of enemy aircraft and warships are significantly greater than those of Japan. Therefore, we should produce one more aircraft and send one more aircraft to the front lines. However, increasing aircraft production cannot be achieved solely through the efforts of factories. It requires the supply of a large number of materials from all aspects to be effective. To give one example, salt is a necessary raw material for manufacturing bombs. This salt must be shipped from Manchuria and North China. However, today, ships are scarce, and they must avoid air raids and mines, resulting in unexpectedly slow ship movements. Even if ships arrive in port, unloading cargo also takes a considerable amount of time. In the south, where enemy attacks are frequent, everyone on board, on land, officers or soldiers, must work together to transport goods. What normally takes two or three days must be completed in a few hours. Those who transport these goods may not know how closely related the salt they are carrying is to the Okinawa campaign. Therefore, they may not be able to maximize their efforts. If they could communicate with each other and understand the actual situation, the transportation would be even faster. The same is true for land transportation. If materials are transported to factories, and railways can exert their maximum effort and not delay in any way, it will add significant strength to the Okinawa campaign. Today is not the time for empty debates. There should be absolutely no more criticism, or shirking responsibility, or mutual arguments. All our citizens should abandon all selfish thoughts, reflect on themselves, cooperate sincerely, and dedicate themselves with a sense of determination. Today, the front lines and the rear must be united. With a sense of determination, bring together all our strength to respond to the Okinawa campaign. Responding to the struggle of the soldiers and officers of the general special attack forces, as well as the islanders there, one hundred million citizens should rise up in a general offensive. Then the divine land will not perish, and the completion of the Greater East Asia War can be expected.

### Interview with Foreign Correspondents

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau, Shimomura, met with foreign correspondents on the afternoon of the 26th and answered the following questions:

Question: What is the reaction of the Japanese people to enemy air raids?

Answer: The emotions of the victims are no different from usual. Their spirits and bodies are also very refreshed, and they look forward to a comeback in the future. From the circumstances at the time and personal inspections of the burnt ruins, it can be asserted that the enemy's bombing of shrines and temples was planned. The enemy will bomb Tokyo's Meiji Shrine, Asakusa Kannon, Kobe's Minatogawa Shrine, and other places that the Japanese consider sacred. These facts, on the contrary, are intended to stir up the Japanese people's hostility towards the enemy.

Question: All newspapers say that the Okinawa operation is a decisive battle. Do the Japanese people recognize this fact?

Answer: All Japanese citizens fully recognize the importance of the Okinawa operation and are well aware that if Okinawa is attacked after Iwo Jima is seized by the enemy, it will be threatened.

Question: What do the Japanese people think of the German resistance?

Answer: The Japanese people have the same feelings as the people of all countries in the world. They believe that the German resistance is truly amazing. The German people all have a fighting spirit, and we believe that this fighting spirit of the German army will continue to be displayed in the future.

They have already sent letters to local gentry to serve as preparatory members and are actively preparing.

Xuzhou Correspondence

### A Glimpse of New Huaihai (Part 2)

— Yi Fei

Educational and Cultural Undertakings

Education in Huaihai Province is still far from ideal. Taking Xuzhou City, the provincial capital, as an example, there are currently only three middle schools, seventeen complete primary schools, ten junior primary schools, six private primary schools, and one people's education center, with a total of more than 14,000 primary and middle school students. Due to the shortage of classrooms, students are divided into two shifts each day, attending school in turn in the afternoon. Furthermore, there are an estimated 44,000 school-age children in the city. In comparison, the current number of university children is about 30,000. The situation is indeed serious. Governor Hao, in addition to starting last month to establish a "Local Education Business Committee" in Xuzhou City, inviting local gentry and prominent merchants to jointly support the endeavor, also convened a Huaihai Education Conference on March 14 in the provincial government auditorium to comprehensively plan and listen to reports from education workers in various counties. A total of twenty units, representing more than two hundred people, gathered together to discuss and study. During the conference, Hao himself delivered a speech, explaining the main purpose of Huaihai's future education promotion, and providing many instructions on current important issues. He also inspired the representatives to "complete the great cause of saving the country and the people with simplicity and sincerity, correct oneself before correcting others, set an example for future teachers, endure hardship and work hard, broaden their minds, strengthen their aspirations, and set the goal of training young people for the future."

Because the Huaihai authorities attach great importance to education and cultural undertakings, cultural figures from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places are quite active here. The Huaihai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held a "Wartime Culture Symposium" on the 9th of the month, attended by more than fifty people from various cultural institutions, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The meeting openly discussed all issues related to wartime culture and subsequently issued a "Wartime Cultural Construction Declaration" in order to arouse the cooperation of all parties.

In order to adapt to the decisive battle system and promote the basic policy of wartime cultural propaganda, the provincial government, in order to strive for the unification of publishing censorship agencies, convened representatives from relevant agencies on the 10th of the month to review the publishing censorship methods in the provincial capital. Afterwards, it was decided that the provincial government would establish a publishing censorship office to handle all matters related to the censorship and guidance of publications in the future, in order to promote the development of cultural undertakings in the province.

Construction and Industrial Movement

Allied Nation Cooperation Committee: In order to actively promote the province's construction movement, the Huaihai Provincial Government established the "Huaihai Provincial Construction Committee" in order to enlist knowledgeable people from official and civilian circles, concentrate the power of all levels of the party, government, military, and people, and promote this movement. A hundredth construction meeting was held in the provincial government on the 3rd of the month. Under the leadership of Governor Hao, a preliminary review of the work was carried out. Afterwards, powerful figures among the allied nation expatriates in Xuzhou City responded and enthusiastically donated large sums of money in order to jointly complete the construction of New Huaihai. The largest donation was from Mr. Shinichi Komiya of the "North China Tobacco Control Association," who donated one million yuan alone. Mr. Seiichi Kawabe donated 500,000 yuan, and Kinjo Movie Theater owner Shin Saburo also donated 3 million yuan. Currently, the Japanese expatriate side has established the "Allied Nation Cooperation Committee" to comprehensively promote this to expatriates.

Preparing for the Construction of Light Industry: The construction of light industry in Huaihai Province is also becoming increasingly intense. In addition to eagerly expecting large capitalists from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to come to Huaihai to invest and establish factories, and relocate factories here, there is also an organization with special responsibilities, the "Industrial Development Association." Furthermore, in view of the importance of water sources for industrial development, the "Huaihai Provincial Well Company" was established to develop water sources as a preliminary preparation for plans to expand light industry. Previously, due to the lack of good prospecting machines, it was difficult to know the location of water sources, and the work could not proceed as smoothly as expected. Now, it has been properly arranged by the provincial government's economic advisor, Ogawa, and the "North China Development Company" to have the company's radio prospecting machine in Peiping come to Xuzhou to carry out the work. In addition to the more than ten wells that have already been completed, at a rate of six wells per month, the original plan to excavate the expected number of fifty wells should be completed entirely within the year. In the future, the water source problem can be easily solved.

Furthermore, in order to adapt to the needs of the current environment and to solve the problem of goods after the future industrial development, Huaihai Province recently established the "Huaihai Provincial Transportation Management Bureau" to strengthen the transportation organization in the province.

Agricultural Production Increase and Improvement

Huaihai Province is located at the intersection of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui, between central and northern China, and at the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai lines. It is an important military, political, and economic town, with fertile land and abundant production. It is known as the "Chinese warehouse." Wheat is the main agricultural product. In addition to domestic consumption in the province, 500,000 tons can be surplus and supplied to North China annually. The Huaihai authorities are planning to make further efforts to promote increased wheat production. After repeated experiments, it has been proven that the "Huajia No. 6 seed" is most suitable for the soil quality of Huaihai. The province's "Seed Collection Station" is now responsible for breeding this seed, which will then be distributed to families in various counties for adoption, expanding the overall increase in wheat production. It is expected that there will be amazing results in the future. As for fertilization and other tasks, they are also being planned, and effective implementation measures will be taken soon.

The breeding of sweet potatoes is also being actively promoted. Japanese improved varieties are now being used to increase production. The cultivated area will be expanded to two million mu. The expected yield will exceed the local report by more than two times. This move will make a great contribution to the province's people's food and military raw materials.

The Huaihai authorities are sparing no effort in their work to reclaim wasteland. Currently, the first step is to investigate the wasteland on both sides of the Jinpu Railway line in the province. Approximately 10,000 mu have already been found, and methods for long-term reclamation are currently being studied.

Expansion of Cooperatives

Most of the residents of Huaihai are farmers. The managing director of the province's cooperative, Mr. Hongxian Ren, dispatched personnel to various counties in late March to inspect and urge the establishment of mutual aid societies in various counties in order to improve the lives of farmers.

In order to facilitate spring cultivation and small-scale business operations for landless farmers and small business people, the cooperative has launched short-term credit loans. All members can benefit from this. The method is handled by the loan department specially established within the cooperative, and the installment repayment method is adopted. The loan term is fifty days, and it is repaid in ten installments, once every five days. The loan amount is divided into four types: Type A is 5,000 yuan, Type B is 4,000 yuan, Type C is 3,000 yuan, and Type D is 2,000 yuan. The interest rate is five yuan per hundred yuan.

In the past, ration handbooks were distributed by the provincial cooperative to the county cooperative, and then from there to the village cooperative, and then to the farmer by the hand of the township chief. The procedures were complicated and abuses were inevitable. Therefore, before the incident, farmers in the countryside had not received the supplies distributed by the cooperative. Now, the staff of the cooperative is responsible for directly delivering them to the farmers, so there is no more exploitation and embezzlement as before. This move has won the support of the farmers and increased their faith in the cooperative. It is learned that the cooperative has further developed consumer cooperation. It has now raised a large sum of money to purchase daily necessities needed by farmers and transported them to various counties to sell them directly to farmers at low prices. At the same time, in order to reduce the difficulties for farmers in transporting and pricing their agricultural products for sale, the cooperative also handles the unified transportation and sale on their behalf, in order to lighten their burden.

Editorial

### Specific Issues in Implementing Agricultural Loans

Regarding guiding idle capital and salvaging Shanghai's socioeconomic crisis, we previously discussed restoring industrial production, establishing small daily-use goods factories in the interior, and implementing rural loans, respectively, especially regarding implementing agricultural loans, believing that it is most necessary to promote it in advance. Because if it can be successfully implemented in a planned and step-by-step manner, it can not only solve the increasingly serious problem of idle capital in the city, which is beneficial to the stability of the socioeconomic situation, but also, after idle capital is introduced into the hands of production farmers, it can also salvage the current crisis of agriculture being abandoned in the wild, promote increased agricultural production, and solve the most serious economic problems in urban and rural areas today. At the same time, it will also solve the increasingly serious social and political problems, making it impossible for the Communist Party, which is watching from the sidelines, to take the opportunity to act. On the 25th of this month, the Continental New Paper discussed "Rural Loans and Business Organizations," listing several specific issues of rural loans, which were extremely pertinent and focused. We believe that today's most urgent problem is how to quickly raise funds successfully?

In principle, since the implementation of agricultural loans has been unanimously approved by the Municipal Consultative Committee, it is imperative and there is no doubt. Because this move can not only show the Shanghai citizens' cooperation in the war and help rural areas increase production; but also provide relief to rural areas and prevent Communist incitement; and has important economic and political significance. In the future, increased agricultural production will also alleviate the city's most serious food problem. What we urgently need to do today is: Raise funds quickly, ensure that citizens thoroughly understand and automatically raise funds, and determine the method of loan principal and interest.

Regarding the specific method of agricultural loans, in order to achieve quick results, it is necessary to divide the labor and cooperate to divide the agricultural loan work into three major steps, namely, fundraising, lending, and repayment. Regarding fundraising, we believe that this is the basic responsibility of the people of Shanghai. For this step to be quickly successful, the mission of the people of Shanghai will be completed. If the time for fundraising feels pressing, it can be raised in phases. The target of fundraising should be based on the principle of those with money contributing money and those with strength contributing strength. Major companies, major firms, and factories that are still operating, as well as enthusiastic people who are devoted to social welfare, naturally cannot shirk their responsibility and should take the lead in advocating.

Regarding lending, if we set up our own institutions, hire experts to investigate and study, and implement it, it will take a long time. In order to meet the urgent needs of rural areas, it is more effective for the Jiangsu Provincial Government to handle it directly. Secondly, regarding the lending method, what farmers need for production does not necessarily have to be cash. Fertilizers, agricultural tools, seeds, etc. are also quite necessary. As for the target of lending, the basic principle is to directly enter the hands of production farmers. It is certainly permissible to target farmer groups (such as cooperatives), but whether cooperatives are truly organized by the farmers themselves is a prerequisite question, and the local government must choose based on the actual situation.

Regarding the repayment point, in principle, the following must be achieved: The repayment period cannot be too short, at the earliest after the new grain is harvested, because this poverty alleviation loan is not purely economic, but contains political significance. Although ensuring principal and interest is necessary, we also need to consider that the main purpose of Shanghai's implementation of agricultural loans is to alleviate the suffering of farmers in the Jiangsu rice-producing area and increase production, thereby regulating the food supply for Shanghai citizens. Therefore, the loan conditions do not need to be calculated in detail, but it is hoped that the Jiangsu Provincial Government can discuss with us the appropriate amount of surplus grain from various places to be borrowed and transported to Shanghai for fair and preferential sales, in order to achieve the original intention of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, which would be even more convenient for both parties. Time flies and the opportunity is pressing. It is hoped that the relevant parties and caring people will quickly take action to promote it and see its success as soon as possible.

### Rural Loans and Agricultural Organizations

Introducing Shanghai's idle capital into rural areas, promoting increased agricultural production, and salvaging the Shanghai economy from the crisis of idle capital's wild movements is indeed a measure that achieves two goals with one action. This attempt will be gradually realized, which is indeed a gratifying phenomenon.

Introducing Shanghai's 500 million yuan of idle capital into rural areas is by no means an easy task. Even with the current inflation, the amount of 500 million yuan is still a huge sum of money. Therefore, both the loan planners and the money lenders must make extraordinary efforts and have a spirit of sacrifice. We hope that both sides can overcome difficulties and achieve the desired goals. The path to success for rural loans requires success in Shanghai first, raising funds, and at the same time, the local area also prepares the environment to accommodate it, so that the funds can be truly transferred to the hands of farmers.

There is no need to discuss again how farmers lack production funds. Because they lack production and living funds, they have no choice but to borrow money from landlords and usurers at alarmingly high interest rates, or sell green seedlings to overcome the current difficulties. If we let it go unchecked, not only will the farmers' economy be on the verge of bankruptcy, but agricultural production will also decrease sharply. Therefore, rural loans are indeed a method that simultaneously saves the farmers' economy and agricultural production. In order to speed up the completion, it is necessary to have good guidance that allows loan funds to flow into the hands of farmers completely and at low interest.

In the past, the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, and the cooperatives before the incident handled agricultural loans. Judging from the experience before the incident, the agricultural loans they handled cannot be considered successful. Almost all of those who used agricultural loans were landlords, usurers, and cooperative cadres, who relended them to farmers to earn interest, while the conditions for farmers to become debt slaves were not improved in the slightest.

In order for agricultural loans to be perfectly effective, these middle-class exploiters must be excluded from the implementation process of lending. As for its method, we believe that it is nothing more than the expansion and use of farmer organizations. If rural loans are targeted at individuals, they will inevitably become high-interest loans. Only when organizations are targeted can this malpractice be overcome. This point can be confirmed by past experience. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the expansion and utilization of farmer organizations is the only way to complete agricultural loans.

Among the farmer organizations after the incident, the most noteworthy are the cooperatives, especially the cooperatives in the "cleansing the villages" districts, which may be regarded as universal farmer organizations. If the organization of cooperatives in the "cleansing the villages" districts is strengthened, and the activities of production mutual aid societies and other lower-level organizations become more active, echoing Shanghai's agricultural loan movement, then agricultural loans can be smoothly realized. Of course, if the existing cooperatives want to comprehensively accept agricultural loan funds, there are still insufficient points in the organization. Therefore, both Shanghai's agricultural loan activists and those related to local cooperatives need to consider this together. (Translated from the Continental New Paper, April 25)

### Tense Atmosphere at San Francisco Conference; Deadlock on Polish Issue

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received on the 26th Stalin's instructions on the final Soviet stance on the Polish issue, and decided to convey these instructions to Eden and Stettinius during their meeting. However, the contents are still unknown. Since the United Kingdom and the United States have already expressed their strong unwillingness to compromise, the success or failure of the San Francisco Conference will depend on the outcome of the trilateral foreign ministers' meeting on the 26th. San Francisco is currently shrouded in a tense atmosphere. According to a report from United Press correspondent Wilson, relations among the three major powers are on the verge of breaking down due to the Polish issue. The atmosphere at the San Francisco Conference is dominated by a sense of tension. In short, the fate of the Polish issue will be determined during the trilateral foreign ministers' meeting. Molotov may have expressed the Soviet Union's final position in his speech at the meeting, but this is the most critical issue, and the Soviet Union may not express its position in a public session.

If tax evasion, forged books, resistance to investigation, or false declarations are discovered, they will be punished decisively according to the regulations, depending on the severity of the circumstances, including detention, fines, and orders to pay back taxes. All businesses should deeply understand the authorities' intentions, which are not to lightly punish merchants. However, those who deliberately violate the law will be punished. As for the suburban areas of the city, such as Wusong, Nanshi, Pudong, and Xucao districts, since they have been collecting business taxes, the work is relatively well-established. Currently, personnel have been dispatched to actively carry out re-inspection work. It is predicted that after this rectification, the results of this tax in the suburban areas will be considerable.

It is understood that a satisfactory result has been achieved, so the amount and price of this period's distribution can still be maintained at the original standard.

### Huazhong Hydropower Company Shanghai Electrical Branch

— Jia Xi

—— One of the Analyses of Municipal Public Utilities in This City

Huazhong Hydropower Co., Ltd., Shanghai Electrical Branch, was reorganized from the military-managed Shanghai Electric Power Company in July of last year. The predecessor of the Shanghai Electric Power Company was the Shanghai Municipal Council Electricity Department, established in 1890. At that time, power was generated at the Feilen Road embankment near the Hongqiao area. The original power source was internal combustion engines, and the business scope was limited to supplying electric lights to users. Later, as Shanghai's industry and commerce became increasingly prosperous, and more factories used electricity as their power source, a new plant was built elsewhere in 1912, covering more than 300 acres, and equipped with boilers and steam turbine generators, burning steam as the power source for electricity generation. The amount of electricity generated also increased. At that time, there were about eight boilers and two generators in the plant. Later, they were gradually added, and the old plant on Feilen Road stopped generating electricity. In September 1928, the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council sold it to the American Electric Power Company for a price of 81 million yuan in order to raise funds for the redemption of public bonds, and it was renamed the Shanghai Electric Power Company. Among them, 80 million was obtained by the Municipal Council, and 1 million was for the pension and reserve funds of Western employees and the pension funds of Chinese employees. The Yangshupu New Plant has 30 boilers and 15 steam turbine generators, with a power generation capacity of over 190,000 kilowatts. Currently, the branch manager is Koshima Akira.

Organizational Structure

The administrative management of the Shanghai Electrical Branch is largely the same as that of the former Electric Power Company. Previously, the one who was in charge of command and decision-making was one President and one Vice President, followed by a General Manager and a Deputy General Manager. The Engineering Department and the Secretariat (i.e., General Affairs) are directly subordinate to them. The Engineering Department has one Chief Engineer and two Deputy Chief Engineers, and the three departments of Transmission, Feeder User Engineering, and Power Generation are directly under it, and the Purchasing Committee also belongs to it. The Power Generation Engineering Department and the Power Plant are in the New Plant, and the General Office of Transmission and Feeder Engineering is in the building on □□ Road. All installations, repairs, maintenance designs of high-voltage lines (divided into three types: 22000V from the power plant to the substation, 6600V from the substation to the distribution panel), and the distribution, laying, repair, maintenance, and other projects of low-voltage lines are all their responsibility. The departments under its jurisdiction include the Main Line Team, the Overhead Line Team, the Motor Room, the Electric Stove Room, and the Meter Room. The Main Line Team is the executive department for laying underground cable projects; the Overhead Line Team is the executor of overhead wires; the Motor Room is the department that repairs and inspects the motors in user factories, and manages and organizes the motors; the Electric Stove Room is the department that designs, installs, and repairs users' electric heating appliances; the Meter Room is the department that repairs, manages, installs, and inspects the electricity meters for the company's own use or for users, and is also responsible for inspecting users for stealing electricity, cutting off users' power supply, and connecting to the power supply; the Drafting Room (i.e., the Design Room) also directly reports to the Transmission and Feeder Engineering Department. The Purchasing Committee purchases small items directly from the warehouse, coal is the responsibility of the Chief Engineer, Power Plant Manager, and Fuel Chemist, and other insulating materials, electrical appliances, building materials, etc. are purchased directly by it. The departments directly under the User Engineering Department are the User Engineering Department, the User Relations Office, the Sample Room, and the User Payment Office. User Engineering is an organization that designs for users, estimates the amount of electricity used in various areas, solves users' difficulties, and investigates business.

Power Generation Procedure

The most important luxury items of the power plant project are the pump room, workshop, furnace room, electrical switch room, distribution panel, distribution room, etc., and the secondary items are the coal hoisting room and coal grinding room, oil pump room, and belt room.

Power generation work process: water is drawn from the pump room to supply the furnace room, and coal is transported from the lighter by the coal hoisting workshop to the belt room, and transferred to the furnace room as fuel. The high-heat and high-pressure steam is then guided to the workshop to drive the turbine and generator, and electricity is generated. After the voltage is regulated by the distribution room and the electrical switch is opened with electricity, the current passes through the distribution panel and switch to the busbar, and then opens the electrical switch of the feeder substation with electricity through the distribution room, and the task of transmitting electricity to the feeder substation is completed.

After the steam passes through the turbine, the exhaust gas must be condensed with cold water to turn it into water, and then pumped to the furnace room with a water pump. Because the temperature of the water is still high, the amount of coal used can be saved. Oil is used as an insulating material for the distribution panel, but because the temperature inside the distribution panel is quite high, for fear of losing the insulation effect, an oil pump room is set up to circulate the oil and cool it with water.

### Recent Work Overview of the Municipal Propaganda Office: Director Liu Reports at Press Conference

The 14th press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held in the auditorium of the office at 10:30 AM on the 27th. Director Liu attended in person and answered the questions raised by reporters from various newspapers in detail. The details are recorded as follows:

Propaganda Work Actively Promoted

(Question) Since you took office, what has been the progress of the Propaganda Office's work? (Answer) It has been more than three months since I took office. After rectification, the internal work has become more standardized, and close contact has been established externally. As for the routine work, it is the guidance of large and small newspapers and the review of various dramas. The inspection of newspapers and magazines is jointly handled by our office and the Shanghai News Inspection Office, which belongs to the Propaganda Department. Films and radio broadcasts are also handled by the Film Inspection Committee and the Broadcasting Association, which belong to the Propaganda Department. Our office is only in a guiding position. In order to promote propaganda work, a dinner party is held once a week with the press department of the Japanese Embassy, and the press directors of both the Mingbang Army and Navy are invited to participate. At the same time, a Chinese press conference is held every week, and the directors of various bureaus of the Municipal Government are invited to attend to answer the questions raised by various newspapers in order to strengthen wartime propaganda. Today is the 14th time. In order to ensure the accuracy of the release of municipal news, our office previously drafted unified news release measures, which were approved by the Municipal Government. All municipal news will be released uniformly by our office. Regarding the guidance of newspapers, we have convened small newspaper managers to talk, instructing them to publish wartime news and municipal news, education ethics, strictly prohibit decadent and pornographic text, and urge them to organize a small newspaper federation, which will be formally established soon.

Handling of Key Supplies

(Question) How is the handling of key supplies for Chinese, Japanese, and third-country journalists in Shanghai? (Answer) According to regulations, key supplies for Chinese journalists are limited to editors, but I believe that the employees of the business department are also part of the newspaper and should enjoy this treatment. After consultation with the relevant parties, it has been changed to all newspaper employees, and all can apply for key supplies. Large newspapers will be reviewed by the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, and the number of employees of each newspaper will be reviewed by the preparatory personnel of the Small Newspaper Federation, and then sent to our office for verification and transfer to the Materials Allocation Office. Three periods have already been received. Chinese employees of third-country newspapers will also be verified and transferred by our office. Foreign employees can receive half a bag of flour per period, and Japanese employees of friendly newspapers will be allocated by the embassy.

(Question) What is the propaganda situation in various counties and districts? (Answer) Our office has recently sent a letter to the County Administration to order the counties and districts under its jurisdiction to report the recent propaganda situation for verification, so as to provide guidance separately based on the propaganda points issued by the Propaganda Department.

Eliminating Malpractices in Drama Review (Question) Can you tell us something about the work of drama review? (Answer) In order to eliminate various malpractices in the past in drama review, we have twice convened the persons in charge of Peking opera, spoken drama, Yue opera, Shen opera, and miscellaneous drama theaters to talk to us about complying with the inspection rules. Those who violate the rules will be warned, given a short-term suspension of performances, fined, or have their licenses revoked. The deadline for spoken dramas to be submitted for review is 20 days before the performance, and for others, it is one week. Our office will never make things difficult. In order to unify the authority to review dramas, we submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval, and our office will handle it. The police department will assist. Since March, past accumulated coins have been eliminated, which has won some praise from the outside world. Regarding the review of foreign dramas and music, we have also submitted a request to the Municipal Government to order the police department to transfer it to our office for handling. In order to ensure accurate review of the content of dramas in the future, we have submitted a request for the establishment of a Drama Review Committee, with me serving as the chairman concurrently, the head of the Enterprise Section serving as the deputy chairman concurrently, senior staff members of our office as ex officio members, and people with experience in Chinese and foreign dramas as specially invited members.

Special Propaganda Activities to be Held One After Another (Question) How is your office implementing special propaganda? (Answer) Since I took office, special propaganda activities have been carried out, including the National Father's Death Anniversary and Afforestation Movement Conference, the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, and the United National Salvation Movement Mass Meeting. All of these were handled by our office. In the future, we plan to organize touring lectures and symposiums, celebrity broadcasts, and convene a Shanghai Municipality-affiliated counties and districts propaganda conference next month.

(Question) Regarding the case of Jiao Boquan's compliance with the law, the Shanghai branch of the Special Court has begun the investigation procedure. Can you tell us about the facts of the crime? (Answer) Before the verdict, it is not convenient to tell you.

(Question) The authorities have issued a strict ban on military police officers and civil servants who do not purchase tickets and force their way into theaters. However, the fundamental solution is to follow the example of the capital city and formulate preferential treatment measures, or add Sunday morning performances and provide free invitations, so that bad phenomena can be reduced. (Answer) Regarding the preferential treatment measures for theater viewing, our office will provide opinions within the possible scope and submit them to the Municipal Government for approval and then order them to be followed.

Bad Publications Included in the Review (Question) What is the situation of the review of comic books and serial pictures on the market? (Answer) This case is being handled. The Education Bureau has a review committee for cracking down on bad public reading materials. These comic books and novels are also included in the review department. In the future, we will review them together with the Education Bureau.

(Question) Music tea houses and Peking opera ticket offices are springing up like mushrooms after rain, which is an abnormal development in wartime Shanghai. What are your opinions on this from your office, which is in charge of cultural propaganda work? (Answer) Music tea houses and Peking opera ticket offices are indeed springing up like mushrooms after rain, as you all said. We are now registering them separately, and then submitting the adjustment measures to the Municipal Government for approval before implementing them in stages.

### Relief for Baoli and Jiao Ji Hospitals: Regular Charity Performance to Raise Funds

Jiao Ji Hospital, located at 100 Wanzhufang Road, Nanshi, has been providing free medical treatment and medicine for eight years. It was originally established to treat residents of the refugee area in Nanshi. Now, all poor patients living in Nanshi can receive free treatment, and a small amount of supplies can be provided, or they can apply to charitable organizations for drug expenses. The necessary expenses in the past have been painstakingly maintained by the French charitable lottery and church organizations. In recent months, the charitable lottery has been announced to be suspended, and church organizations have stopped providing funds. The hospital's economic sources have been cut off, and the necessary expenses have increased with prices, so the expenses are insufficient and it is difficult to maintain. According to statistics, there are hundreds of thousands of residents in Nanshi, but there are very few well-equipped public and private hospitals. Especially in the Dadongmen area, which is east of the Huangpu River, south to Dongjiadu, and northwest to the Central Market, there is an urgent need for a public hospital. Therefore, the Baoli Hospital was initiated, and the address has already been determined, but the opening still depends on the fund. Both of these are urgent priorities.

After consulting with the drama community, it was decided to hold a charity performance of "Home" at the Jincheng Grand Theater at 4:00 PM on May 3rd and 4th, and the proceeds from the ticket sales will be used as operating expenses and fund. We hope that people from all walks of life will generously contribute their kindness and participate in the charity event. The sick and poor will be relieved of their suffering, and the healthy will benefit from physical and mental health. The merit is immeasurable. Ticket prices are divided into: honorary tickets of 50,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan. Ordinary tickets are divided into four types: 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. In addition to the honorary tickets being sold by the Social Service Department of the Shen Xin News, the remaining tickets can be pre-purchased at the Guotai Pharmacy in Baxianqiao.

### Record of Inspecting the Kyushu Fortress

The enemy American forces have already landed on Okinawa Island. Under these war circumstances, I went to inspect the "Kyushu Fortress," a seemingly impenetrable defense against the landing on Okinawa Island.

Visiting the Unit Commander

Entering the guard post shielded by bamboo poles, a plaque hung at the entrance, bearing the words "Sworn to Be a Breakwater for the Pacific" written in the blood of the warriors of Saipan, similar to the words "Sworn to Kill the Enemy." This is a certain combat command post. The small forest is the sacred site of the descent of the heavenly grandson and the ancient ruins of a certain royal family's old city. Now, this sacred site is the "General Headquarters" for planning the killing of the enemy. The entire old city has been used as a fortress for modern warfare, with the old moats serving as operational routes. In addition, underground tunnel fortifications and connecting trenches are being dug day and night.

Electric lights have been installed in the underground barracks, and young soldiers are busily working. The intelligence room is filled with telephones, and signalmen are holding telephones, constantly prepared to relay messages.

Climbing to the uppermost level, this is the unit headquarters, also a semi-underground barracks. A unit commander said spiritedly:

"There is only one path to patriotism. During this period, we must absolutely protect our homeland. If the enemy dares to invade boldly, then we must all, men, women, young, and old, rise up together with the spirit of a suicide squad and fight the enemy to the death."

○○ Bay, at the southernmost tip of Kyushu, is serene and silent. Like a coastline interspersed with fortresses, the Chinzei area, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, is guarded by seemingly impregnable fortresses. Commander K of the unit expressed a firm sense of shared hatred for the enemy, saying:

"This area is the enemy's favorite sandy beach. The foreign devils can come from anywhere, no matter what. Therefore, we cannot fight according to ordinary tactics, establishing strongholds, defending trenches, fortifications, or castles. According to our neural warfare tactic that minimizes our own losses, we will carry out sneak attacks at night, boldly execute assaults, and must annihilate the last soldier of the enemy. Our soldiers are all very brave and very vigilant. If such soldiers carry out suicide squad-style assaults, I believe we are absolutely confident of success."

Finally, he added forcefully:

"The Japanese are impatient. This will not work in the current war; we must be calm to find a solution."

Countless horizontal tunnels that can accommodate all citizens are being dug into the mountainside. If enemy planes come to invade, these will become the best aerial breakwaters. If they come by land, all these trenches will become firing points, which can cooperate with certain fortresses to inflict painful blows on the enemy, so that the mouth of ○○ Bay will become the graveyard of the American devils.

Air Fortress: Passing through the tea plantations of the plateau, I went to visit the air fortress in southern Kyushu. "The buildings standing on the ground have gradually lost their modern appearance and have become antiques from the previous century. All the factory facilities attached to the base have been moved underground to work. A part of it has been completed." This is the valuable experience that Commander H gained in New Guinea.

Around the base, under the leadership and design of the brigade commander, and with the enthusiastic help of the local people, a 0-kilometer underground city is being built non-stop. The Labor Service Corps, schoolchildren, and ordinary people from nearby villages all expressed, "We must defend our base!" working desperately, truly working under the stars and moonlight. Even female workers came to participate in the work, and organized suicide squads, working day and night, and training hard every day. Following the guidance of the unit commander, the reporter walked along the mountain path of volcanic ash and inspected the construction project of the underground fortifications. This high trench is also the remains of an ancient castle. This trench, only in name, has already become a motor road. In the white and gray mountain, there is a large cave. Although it is gloomy and dark inside, people are constantly working. The unit commander thanked each of these people, saying, "Thank you for your hard work! Thank you for your hard work!"

"This is truly a great opportunity for Heaven to test us. We Japanese must strive for victory, even if we leave not a single blade of grass or tree." The unit commander expressed this resolutely.

Mountain Stronghold: I also went to visit a certain stronghold. This mountain is the highest, with a ridge extending far into the sea like undulating waves. All the mountainsides of this peak have been completely transformed into gun emplacements. Following a small path, treading on weeds, and walking toward a plum grove, I discovered the position. This is the ○○ cannon. Crawling into the ditch, I saw the ○○ cannon. At this time, two soldiers were carrying heavy material boxes up the mountain. We, who were not carrying anything, felt that this mountain road was very dangerous. Seeing the soldiers working so hard, I was truly moved. Not only did the brave soldiers do such hard work, but also at night, after the bodies exhausted from working overtime in the white daylight, they had to desperately undergo melee combat training. At the edge of the cliff, there is a flat ground that people cannot see. This is the position where they await the enemy's landing and fight to the death. Let the enemy come if they want! This is what all the brave soldiers are saying. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, April 6th)

### Special Attack Force Training Center

Formations of Zero fighters flew across the sky, like tangled silk, sometimes in straight lines, sometimes in curves. The silver wings flashed, reflecting the spring sunshine, and each aircraft danced wildly in the air at an unusually high speed. This is aerial combat training by a certain naval air corps. If aerial combat is so beautiful, then war must be a lot of fun.

Rumbling, one after another, they head towards the battle command post. Altitude × thousand, arriving in an instant. This is dive bombing training. Whining—the aircraft dives overhead, only fifty meters away, then suddenly lifts its nose again. Behind the windshield, there is a smiling face. They are all young officers who came from reserve student training.

This fighter squadron is filled with murderous intent. Today, when domestic air bases are being used as much as possible to annihilate the enemy, it is a good opportunity to leverage the strengths of the homeland air fortress in base operations, and it is natural that this combat base is filled with tension.

The enemy has begun to use the Iwo Jima airfield. A considerable number of B29s are gathering in the Mariana Islands. Moreover, they have landed on Okinawa Island. The war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and its tragic and heroic nature can be described as a do-or-die battle. In aerial warfare that emphasizes speed and maneuverability, this base also participates in the conquest of the enemy forces on Nansei Islands, and to date, it has dispatched many special attack forces.

Aerial combat requires high-performance aircraft and highly adaptable and skillful aerial combat techniques. Because of this requirement, they are constantly sharpening their skills and training elite aerial warriors under rigorous training. The dormitory for officers who came from reserve student training originally had a sign that said "Student Dormitory," but recently, at some point, it has been changed to "Kamikaze Dormitory." Someone has even composed a magnificent Kamikaze song. In this "Kamikaze Dormitory," filled with the enthusiasm of the entire special attack force, their movements are more calm and quiet than before, and the military discipline within the dormitory is strict and orderly, forming an excellent atmosphere. In the Kamikaze Dormitory's air corps shrine, trainees are sure to worship several times a day, and this has become a new habit.

"We will soon be going to fight to the death. We have to study hard how to die." This lighthearted remark passed like a spring breeze through the willow branches. The people in the Kamikaze Dormitory, having received enthusiastic farewells from their compatriots at the Meiji Jingu Gaien and Ueno shrines, went to the front lines as students. Now, they are all lieutenants and second lieutenants, holding command positions and becoming authentic warriors.

From 7:00 AM to 2:00 PM, they conduct instrument flight training. On a certain day, the weather was clear, and the spring sun shone on them, making them feel languid. Wearing dark glasses, the trainees perform blind flight, relying solely on instruments. The Zero fighter they are piloting is a small, high-speed, and excellent aircraft. They grip the control stick tightly, cautiously and wholeheartedly piloting it, as this is their first time piloting a Zero fighter.

In front of the battle command post, filled with dust and sand, a group of people gathered. Among them were a lean and capable commander, a tough flight commander who had served as an air staff officer in Rabaul, and a flight squadron leader who was determined to turn enemy aircraft and warships into powder. They intently watched the aircraft flying overhead. A few days ago, when enemy small aircraft came to attack, this squadron of Zero fighters, under its glorious tradition, had piloted training Zero fighters—which had been allocated here specifically for training due to minor flaws—to launch a surprise attack from above the clouds on a formation of four Grumman aircraft, destroying three of them in one fell swoop. The instructor, Staff Sergeant A, was the one who established this feat. Under the influence of such a mentor, the trainees not only learned the highest combat techniques, but also cultivated a fearless spirit.

The weapon of the special attack force is training refined a hundred times! Training is combat, and combat is the entire aircraft carrying out special attacks! This base, which specializes in training special attack talent, is accumulating strong and fearless combat power. (Special Correspondent Mikami, translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 5th)

### Explosive Weapons for Close-Range Combat

Bayonet fighting, melee combat, is a method of decisive battle that the Japanese army, ready to die for their country, excels at. In this bloody battle where melee charges are launched everywhere, one cannot help but ask: What types of weapons are used in modern warfare for close-range combat? In addition to bayonets, pistols, rifles, and military swords, there are also hand grenades, hand-thrown explosive mines, and anti-tank weapons, grenade launchers, and flame bottles. Among these, explosives play the most important role. The following is a brief description of several weapons used by the Japanese army in close-range combat, for general reference.

Hand Grenade: This is a bomb that can be easily thrown by hand, also known as a hand-thrown bomb. The explosive used is picric acid. The explosive charge is about 50 watts, and the weight of the grenade is about 300 watts. The length of the grenade is about 10 cm, and the diameter is 5 cm. Its power, after a certain period of time (about four seconds), will cause it to explode, and the fragmentation is effective enough to kill or wound people and horses, with a range of 5 meters in radius.

With ordinary practice, it can be thrown about 30 meters. Before throwing, the safety device is removed, preparing for ignition. When the time comes, the fuse is ignited, and after confirming that it has been ignited, it is thrown immediately. However, it must be noted that its explosion time, as mentioned earlier, is about four seconds, so if one is a little slow, there is a risk of it exploding in one's hand. On the other hand, if it is thrown too early, there is fear that the enemy may pick it up and throw it back before it explodes. Furthermore, its effective radius is 5 meters. If the enemy is very close, one may end up getting blown up along with them, so caution is necessary.

Grenade Launcher: This is a handled tube carried by infantry, with a device for adjusting ignition and a dial for adjusting the throwing distance. The caliber is 50 mm, the total length is about 600 mm, the weight is 5 kg, and the maximum range is 700 meters. As for its use, one holds the grenade launcher, lies prone on the ground, places the hand grenade or other explosives inside the tube, and pulls the trigger to launch it. The throwing distance is determined by the angle of inclination of the tube and the amount of gunpowder. It is usually used by two soldiers, one is the shooter, and the other is the ammunition handler.

Hand-Thrown Anti-Tank Mine: This is an anti-tank weapon that maintains the durability of the explosive until it collides with tanks or other objects, at which point it explodes. To maintain durability, the explosive is also used in a special shape. Moreover, because the filling amount is limited, the explosive must be small in quantity but have a large explosive force. This type of hand-thrown anti-tank mine has sufficient destructive power against light vehicles, and its throwing distance is about 20 meters. In addition to anti-tank mines and anti-tank guns, flame bottles and adhesive explosive mines are also used in close-range combat against tanks.

Flame Bottle: A glass ball filled with explosives, with the outside coated with adhesive liquid, to make it adhere to the tank and explode.

Adhesive Explosive Mine: This is a device that uses magnetism to adhere to the tank and explode. The amount of explosive used is usually less than one kilogram, so its effect is not very great unless it is thrown within a close range of 5 meters to 10 meters. Moreover, it cannot target the thinner rear and upper parts of the tank and armored vehicle, so its destructive power is insufficient. In short, these explosive mines must approach the tank. Recently, the Germans and Soviets used rocket-style mines, which can be called the motorization of throwing. Izen

### Recent Conditions of Hygiene Facilities in This City

— Yuan Junchang

——Speech Broadcasted on Shanghai Radio Yesterday——

Listeners, I am Yuan Junchang, the Director of the Bureau of Health of this city. Tonight, I would like to take this opportunity to report on several recent health administration matters in this city, and I hope that all our citizens will pay attention and assist, because these matters are related to national health and are also matters of vital interest to every citizen.

First, for this year's cholera prevention injections, the entire staff has been organized into six large teams: the Central Team, the Pudong Team, the Punan Team, the Puxi Team, the Pubei Team, and the Gaoqiao Team. Since the 20th of this month, we have begun to implement the injection work comprehensively. The estimated number of people to be injected in two phases is approximately six million. I hope that citizens will go to the nearest injection station to receive the injection and do not evade it. You must know that evading the injection will not only harm yourself, but also harm others. Because if you evade the injection and later get cholera, you will spread it to others who have not been injected. Isn't this a very dangerous thing? Therefore, I hope that all citizens will enthusiastically go to the nearest injection station to receive the injection. Last year, because the number of people injected was high and prevention was good, no epidemic cholera was discovered. This year may be a cholera year, and I hope that the number of people injected this year will be even higher, so that cholera will still not occur.

Second, recently, cases of diphtheria have been discovered this year. This disease is most easily transmitted to school-age children, especially because school-age children live a collective life, which makes it even easier to transmit. Therefore, this Bureau has started injecting diphtheria toxoid into school children to prevent it from spreading. I hope that citizens with children will pay attention to this.

Third, recently, it has been discovered that illegal merchants in the market are greedy for profit and are selling dead pigs, evading the inspection work of the Bureau's meat inspectors, and passing them off as edible meat. I attach great importance to this, because the entire body of a dead pig is full of bacteria. If it is used as edible meat, aren't people simply eating the bacteria on the pig's body? When you think about it, aren't you afraid? Therefore, the immoral behavior of these illegal merchants can also be said to be exterminating humanity. I have strictly urged all meat inspectors and environmental health inspectors to work harder in the future and to patrol the main roads at any time and crack down severely. We must absolutely eliminate the mixing of dead pigs with edible meat in the future. At the same time, I hope that citizens will pay attention to themselves. Any pork that does not have the Bureau's meat inspection seal or has been inspected and deemed unsuitable for human consumption with a rejection stamp must not be purchased or eaten. Do not try to save money for a moment and test the bacteria on the pig's body, giving the bacteria a chance to lurk inside the human body. On the other hand, I also hope that citizens will assist the government to take strict control and, if there is any sale of meat that is not suitable for consumption being passed off as edible meat, report it to the Bureau immediately for strict crackdown.

Fourth, the weather will gradually get hotter, and the number of cold drink stalls by the roadside will gradually increase. Most of these cold drink stalls are unhygienic. Even if there are no flies hiding, the ingredients in these cold drinks may not be clean, or there may be raw, cold water in them. Some fruits, sugar cane, water chestnuts, lotus roots, and water caltrops are sprinkled with unclean cold water, which is also unhygienic. Originally, this Bureau has been cracking down on food at any time and anywhere. Now that the summer season is approaching, cholera is most likely to occur, and these cold drinks should be cracked down on even more strictly. I hope that citizens will not easily try unhygienic cold drinks.

Fifth, regarding the accumulation of garbage that often occurs on various roads in the past, which is not only unhygienic, but also unsightly, I pay special attention to it. Garbage is generated by every household every day. If it is not removed, it will of course accumulate more and more. This is something that anyone can see. Since I am the Director of the Bureau of Health, my duty is concerned, and I will of course never be indifferent and allow it to accumulate, merely causing disgust to the citizens, and I must try to remove it at all times. However, sometimes there are inevitable practical difficulties that stand in the way, so that it cannot be removed according to the original plan for a while. For example, the wages of workers were originally very low. Although they have now been increased, the original vehicles used to transport garbage have become old and damaged day by day, so that the number of vehicles that can be used is decreasing day by day. Then, the garbage that cannot be removed and accumulates will proportionally increase day by day. This is a serious issue that cannot be ignored. Now, the materials needed to repair the vehicles have been purchased, and I have already submitted a request to the superiors to send someone to inspect and accept them immediately, so that they can be used for repair. At that time, the number of garbage trucks will increase day by day. If the citizens can no longer discard or dump garbage everywhere in the city, then there will be no more accumulation. Now that the weather is about to get hot, I hope that citizens will not dump garbage everywhere, so as not to breed flies and spread germs. At the same time, I hope that the Baojia personnel will closely assist and cooperate to prevent citizens from dumping garbage everywhere. Because garbage is generated by every household every day, and paying attention to hygiene is also something that every household should pay attention to. If one household does not pay attention to hygiene and gets an epidemic disease, it will immediately spread to others. Therefore, it is best for the Baojia personnel to assist this Bureau in preventing citizens from dumping garbage everywhere. I hope that the Baojia personnel and the citizens will cooperate closely.

Sixth, the cost of living is increasing day by day, and the cost of childbirth for poor pregnant women has also become a serious problem. Therefore, this Bureau is planning to establish a public maternity hospital in the urban area, which can be established after it is approved by the municipal government. However, before it is established, this Bureau has already made a special agreement with the Guangci Hospital in this city to temporarily attach dozens of free maternity beds in this hospital. Any poor pregnant woman in this city who truly does not have the ability to pay the expenses can apply to this Bureau. After being approved by this Bureau, they will be sent to this hospital for hospitalization and childbirth, and she will be provided with free services. In addition, we have also contacted various public and private maternity hospitals to accept free or reduced-fee poor pregnant women. I hope that listeners will pass this message on to poor pregnant women if they encounter them.

Seventh, our country has always had a saying, "The people are the foundation of the nation," but the mortality rate of our Chinese compatriots is very high, which is a very worrying matter. Examining its causes, it is nothing more than the fact that the level of hygiene education among the people is too low. Therefore, the promotion of hygiene education is not to be delayed. This Bureau has contacted Shanghai Radio and French Radio to regularly send personnel from this Bureau to broadcast common sense about hygiene, and also wants to contact the Baojia authorities to periodically convene Baojia chiefs to hold hygiene education symposiums, and plans to hold hygiene sports meetings regularly. Once the municipal government approves the funding, it can be held. Last year, many people visited the hygiene sports meeting. If it is actually possible to hold it this year, please visit it, listeners. It is very meaningful.

Eighth, I also hold the position of Director of the Rescue Department of the Civilian Air Defense Headquarters of the city. The personnel of the Rescue Department are staff members seconded from the Bureau of Health. Because I saw that the number of air raids in Mushi is gradually increasing, I have already prepared measures for rescue work when the city is attacked. The general idea is: according to the police precinct area, except for the naval Baojia area, rescue teams will be established in the south of the Suzhou River and in Pudong, with a total of thirteen units, so as to immediately implement rescue during air raids. Each unit is also each area, with one rescue team leader, who is the president of a local famous hospital, responsible for directing various rescue matters in his area, and all hospitals and doctors in each area will be organized into major injury hospitals, minor injury hospitals, and rescue stations. Whenever people suffer major injuries that require major surgery, they will be sent to major injury hospitals for treatment. Whenever people suffer minor injuries that require minor surgery, they will be sent to minor injury hospitals for treatment. Whenever injured people only need to have medicine applied and bandages, it will be handled by the rescue station. As for the rescue classes run by the Air Defense Training Institute of the Air Defense Headquarters, the Bureau also sends people to serve as instructors. The Bureau also selects personnel from the Bureau's civil servants at all levels to organize special rescue teams to carry out strict air defense rescue training and general military knowledge, so as to be sent to various rescue areas in the future to guide rescue work, and is currently rushing to train. Therefore, there are considerable measures in place for rescue matters when the city is attacked in the future. However, I still hope that citizens will try to avoid danger quickly during air raids. This is very important.

Other issues such as the Bureau's promotion of medicine management, rectification of municipal hospitals and clinics, expansion of school hygiene, popularization of hygiene education, promotion of women's hygiene, implementation of labor hygiene and prison hygiene, etc., have already been published. I will talk about the rest when I have the opportunity in the future.

### Banning Sensational News

— Yao Jiong

The case of Zhan Zhou's murder of her husband, which occurred not long ago, immediately spread throughout Shanghai after being published in various newspapers, becoming the subject of idle chatter for people of all kinds after tea and dinner. Some unscrupulous people even fabricated rumors from it, attracting crowds of people in the streets and alleys, hoping to see the scene of the murderer parading the streets. From this, it can be inferred that the impact of newspapers' revealing news on the majority of people in society is huge. If, at this time, it were to be used as a tool to disturb local public order by organized unscrupulous elements, it would be unimaginable. In my opinion, newspapers should not publish such cases, and I hope that the news censorship authorities will ban them.

This type of case is indeed cruel and inhumane and should be severely punished. However, if it is published rashly at the time of its initial occurrence, it will only be used by a part of the population to make profits, and some newspapers will photograph and print it, and even some small theaters will stage dramas, which not only wastes materials and time, but also, most seriously, gives uninformed people a bad suggestion—that even if you commit murder, you can still be in the limelight, and its impact is very bad.

I believe that if this type of news can be published based on the facts after the investigation is completed and the judicial authorities have pronounced the sentence, it will not only avoid such a bad impulse on society, but also allow those who do evil to know what to be wary of. Its effect will definitely be greater than publishing it before the sentence is pronounced.

### General Overview of Municipal and County Affairs

— Tan Shuzhan

1.  Organization of the County Administration Office

Before the Incident (referring to war), the administrative area of this city only included the urban area (including what is now the suburban area). After the Incident, seven counties surrounding the urban area, namely Baoshan, Jiading, Chongming, Shenjiang (formerly under Shanghai County), Chuansha, Nanhui, and Fengxian, were transferred from Jiangsu Province to the jurisdiction of this city. Therefore, the Municipal Government of this city is responsible for both municipal affairs and county affairs. However, despite these dual responsibilities, the Municipal Government has not established a dedicated agency for the county affairs department. This often leads to neglecting one aspect for another. Furthermore, each bureau and office independently corresponds with the counties, resulting in two or three bureaus handling the same matter. This not only makes the procedures cumbersome and time-consuming but also leads to inconsistencies in management and a lack of centralized authority, significantly affecting administrative efficiency. Therefore, the Municipal Government established the County Administration Office on March 1st of this year, specifically to centrally manage the county affairs of this city.

The organization of the County Administration Office, in addition to the Director and Deputy Director, includes two secretaries, one or two assistant secretaries, and four sections. The First Section is in charge of documents, personnel, and general affairs; the Second Section is in charge of civil affairs, economy, and police administration; the Third Section is in charge of finance, construction, and land administration; and the Fourth Section is in charge of culture, education, social welfare, and propaganda. In addition, there are also commissioners, inspectors, and technical personnel.

After the establishment of the County Administration Office, its policies, in addition to guiding various counties to promote various administrative tasks, also include drafting an outline for strengthening the implementation of county administration, which has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. In addition, it has also taken over the police administration of various counties and convened a police administration discussion meeting with the heads of the police bureaus of various counties on the 20th of this month. In short, the policy focuses on increasing the administrative efficiency of various counties, improving the police administration of various counties, supervising the collection of land taxes in kind in various counties, promoting increased production, advancing education, improving the treatment of county government staff, and rectifying official discipline.

2.  "Outline for Strengthening the Implementation of County Administration"

The "Outline for Strengthening the Implementation of County Administration" drafted by the County Administration Office has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The content is divided into eight parts: First, strengthening the organization, focusing on streamlining unnecessary subsidiary institutions and strengthening the responsibilities of district chiefs and township leaders; Second, strengthening personnel, focusing on training, performance evaluation, rewards, and punishments, as well as loyalty to duty; Third, strengthening official correspondence, focusing on speed and effectiveness; Fourth, strengthening civil affairs, focusing on cooperation between officials and the people, effectively promoting administration, rectifying official discipline, promoting private enterprises, and alleviating people's suffering (such as eliminating opium and gambling), and rectifying concurrent judicial administration; Fifth, strengthening finance, focusing on establishing the foundation of county finance, implementing the collection of land taxes in kind, consolidating local public funds and properties, and stabilizing rural finance; Sixth, strengthening construction, focusing on building roads and bridges, implementing increased production and reclamation, as well as promoting afforestation and promoting handicrafts, and laying the foundation for rural economic development; Seventh, strengthening education, focusing on strengthening school education, increasing the number of rural primary schools, promoting universal education, training teachers, and improving student achievement; Eighth, strengthening public security, focusing on rectifying county security teams and police discipline, eliminating local hidden bandits, ensuring local security, strengthening the baojia (household registration) and self-defense corps system, and protecting the safety of law-abiding citizens.

3.  Public Security Situation in Various Counties

The public security in various counties of this city was previously poor, and clearing campaigns were implemented one after another. Now that the clearing work has long been completed, the public security situation is still good. However, there are still some bandits hiding in remote rural areas, but under the current police system, it does not hinder the overall public security.

4.  Financial Situation in Various Counties

Regarding the financial situation of various counties in this city, according to the Municipal Government's regulations for the land tax revenue in the 33rd year of the Republic, 40% is to be handed over to the municipal treasury, and 60% is to be retained by the county to fund local expenses. In addition to administrative expenses being issued by the Municipal Government, police and construction education undertakings are all paid from local funds. This is more than enough for large counties, but it is insufficient for small counties. Therefore, in the current year (34th year of the Republic), the Municipal Government has decided that after the land tax is changed to collection in kind, all the finances of the counties will be centrally collected and disbursed by the Municipal Government (that is, all county tax revenues will be handed over to the municipal treasury, and all county expenses will be estimated and issued by the municipal treasury). Therefore, the financial difficulties of various counties can be easily solved.

5.  Economic Production in Various Counties

The economic production in various counties of this city is mainly agricultural production. Generally speaking, the ratio is 70% cotton and 30% rice. Therefore, the rice production in various counties is mostly insufficient. In addition to relying on the supply of rice from Jiangsu Province, the local people's food also needs to be supplemented by flour and miscellaneous grains. Currently, various counties are stepping up the implementation of increased production, and vegetable production has also been listed as one of the departments for increased production. In addition to promoting it through incentive methods, the method of increasing production in agricultural land from time to time is also adopted.

In addition, the blockade checkpoints set up in various counties during the clearing campaign period are now being contacted and removed as the clearing work has been completed. Once the preparations are completed, they can be officially abolished.

6.  Treatment of Police in Various Counties

The treatment of police in various counties was extremely low in the past in several counties, such as Nanhui and Chuansha, where each police officer only received about 90 yuan per month. The County Administration Office considered raising it when Luo Qian was the concurrently Director, to be equal to the Security Team. That is, in addition to giving each police officer three dou of rice per month, there will also be a salary of more than 4,000 yuan. This has also been agreed upon at the recent police administration discussion meeting and is now being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. Once approved, it will be implemented immediately.

7.  Administrative Relations Between Various Counties

of This City and Neighboring Counties in Jiangsu Province

Although the counties of this city are adjacent to Jiangsu Province, each county implements its own laws and regulations. Therefore, there is no direct administrative relationship with the neighboring counties in Jiangsu Province. However, in indirect administration, such as road construction related to transportation and joint defense and suppression related to public security, there are still occasional contacts between each other.

### Model Baojia Construction Movement

— Luo Ding

The Baojia Office of the Naval Garrison District, in order to promote the standardization and sound development of civil autonomous organizations, has specifically planned to promote the "Model Baojia Construction Experiment Movement." The goal is to universally extend the effective results gained from local experiments to the entire district so that it becomes a sound fundamental organization for building a new China and implementing constitutional government.

The district currently includes nine subdistricts. Most of these subdistricts have seventy to eighty bao (groups of households), while some have less than ten. In total, the Naval Baojia District has a population of over 700,000. It is currently planned to designate three bao in each district as model bao. Investigations are currently underway, and implementation is expected to begin in early May. The time frame is limited to three months.

In terms of organization, a "Model Baojia Construction Experiment Movement Headquarters" will be established as the highest guidance institution. It will adopt a committee system, with the Director, Chief Secretary, District Chiefs, Section Chiefs, District Guidance Officers, and Secretaries as members of the committee. The Director will serve as the Chairman of the Committee, and the Chief Secretary will serve as the Vice Chairman. In order to strengthen the implementation of the movement, a Supervision Department will be established within the headquarters, with the Chief Secretary as the person in charge, and staff members will be assigned to handle the following matters: Conducting household registration surveys; Presiding over meetings of the Head of Ten Households and Bao Chiefs; Collecting Baojia fees; Engaging in air defense and self-defense; Promoting propaganda and enlightenment, and mutual assistance. A Model Baojia Construction Experiment Movement District Office will be established as the executing agency in each district. The District Committee will consist of the District Chief as the Chairman, the Head of General Affairs as the Vice Chairman, and district staff members as committee members. The District Chief Guidance Officer will, based on the instructions of the Supervision Department of the Headquarters, direct district staff members to handle the various matters under the jurisdiction of the Supervision Department.

The work in the experimental districts is as follows: Conscientiously convene meetings of the Head of Ten Households and Bao Chiefs, and fully listen to and adopt public opinions; Conduct detailed household registration surveys and conscientiously collect Baojia fees; Launch mutual assistance activities such as consumer cooperatives, communal kitchens, baojia farms, and nurseries; Emphasize practical work and effectiveness to idealize air defense and self-defense activities; Expand the practical work of propaganda, enlightenment, and public education movements; Implement the election of Head of Ten Households and Bao Chiefs.

The sequence of work development is as follows: First, designate the experimental bao in each district, investigate the current situation of the experimental bao, assign responsible experiment workers, establish work plans, procedures, and methods, and pay attention to practical promotion after the work begins in order to achieve practical results.

The existing organization of the Naval Baojia District is very complete, and the cooperation between residents and the authorities is quite earnest. They bear more obligations and have more guarantees. The Baojia fees have been re-regulated since April: 100 yuan per month for a tenant of a three-room house, 200 yuan per month for a landlord of a two-room house, 400 yuan for a store with one storefront, 600 yuan for two storefronts, 800 yuan for three storefronts, 1,000 yuan for four storefronts, and factories are also graded according to their scale. The residents are also working hard on air defense. The excavation of air-raid shelters has been successfully completed. The members of the self-defense corps have devoted themselves to rescue work, which has played a exemplary and leading role. In the future, they can set up learning role models. At the same time, conveying lower-level information to higher-level and higher-level intentions to lower-level will also be the focus of future work. Other mutual assistance work and strengthening public education are also necessary preliminary work for the future implementation of constitutional government, and must be resolutely promoted.

Geographical Situation

As for the geographical situation of Okinawa Island, it is briefly described as follows:

Okinawa Island is located in the center of the Ryukyu Islands. It is the largest island in the archipelago and the main part of Okinawa Prefecture. It is about 135 kilometers long and 35 kilometers wide at its widest point and 5 kilometers at its narrowest. The island is narrow and long, with a perimeter of about 400 kilometers and an area of 1,211 square kilometers (including small affiliated islands). The northern part of the island (the rounded head) is mainly composed of ancient formations, forming a mountainous area. The spinal mountain range runs from northeast to southwest, and subtropical plants such as gel tree are luxuriant. Due to the lack of flat land on the island, the gathering places of the population are limited to narrow coasts and bay heads, and the main roads are built along the East Asian coast.

The southern part of the island (Naha City, Shuri City, and most of Nakagami District and Shimajiri District) is a swamp with an altitude of less than 200 meters. The geology belongs to the Tertiary strata, with coral limestone on top. The rivers are short and small, and the water volume increases sharply during rainfall, but is very low at other times. Most of the island's population is concentrated here, and railways are also limited to this area. The old capital Shuri City and Naha City are located in the center of this area. The latter is the center of the prefectural government and the only port city, with a prosperous city. Itoman Town in the south is particularly prosperous in fishing.

Maejima Island is one of the Kerama Islands in Shimajiri District, Okinawa Prefecture, and is narrow and long from northeast to southwest. The perimeter is about eight kilometers. There are islands such as Hader (transliteration) Island and Naka Island to the northeast. The whole island is overgrown with shrubs. The residents live on the east coast, almost all engaged in fishing.

Kamiyama Island is located about eleven kilometers north of Naha Port and is the easternmost and smallest island of the Kei Islands (also known as the Kei San Islands). The entire island is made of calcareous gravel and is flat, with lush Atan trees. The low-lying areas are submerged by seawater at high tide, dividing it into two islands.

### Distant Memorial

— Yi Xuan

I haven't thought about home for many years! I don't dare to think about it, and I'm even more afraid of thinking about it. If I think about home, I can't help but think about the bittersweet family of my childhood; I can't help but mourn my father, who loved me the most and died of illness in his prime; I can't help but miss my aging mother leaning on the door, yearning for me; I can't help but remotely worry about you struggling in our poor hometown; I can't help but think about the desolate fields and the displaced uncles and brothers struggling to make a living in all directions. Thinking about home fills me with endless sorrow! I don't dare to think about it, I'm afraid of thinking about it, I haven't thought about home for a long time.

However, this kind of suppressed and latently present emotion, once suddenly bursts out, its sadness and pain often surpass normal emotions.

For the past year, I knew you were sick. I was afraid to receive letters from home, but I also looked forward to receiving letters from home. Every time, every time I repeatedly looked at the letters from home, every time, every time I couldn't help but shed tears, because I thought about home again, because I missed you even more.

The year before last, I vomited a basin full of fresh blood. The year before that, after suffering from dysentery and typhus, I also contracted pneumonia. I had no choice but to leave my friends and drag my sick body to the snowy north to recuperate. At that time, I was afraid that if I died far from home, I would leave my mother with the "pain of losing her sight" and leave you with the "sorrow of broken wings"; who knew that just as my health was gradually improving, I heard the news that you had been bedridden for years; who knew that it was you who left my mother with the "pain of losing her sight," and it was you who left me with the "sorrow of broken wings." Truly, who knew that after I returned south, I would spend day and night grieving for you with my remaining illness!

Brother Kuan, I cried loudly when I received the letter from home in the north, knowing that you had throat TB. I was afraid that you could not stay in this world for long, and I was afraid that this life would be a long farewell for us, but I did not expect that on the second day of my return to Shanghai, I learned from Uncle Liu that you had already passed away for half a year. At that time, my family was still hiding it from me. I cried, but to what avail?

It was not until a month ago that my younger brother wrote to tell me the news of your death, and also described his own symptoms as the same as yours. At that time, I was wandering around, holding the book, wiping away tears, unable to finish reading. Although the book was burned by my Uncle Liu on the spot, however, Uncle Liu's actions could not reduce the sorrow in my heart. I cried, I was afraid that my younger brother would die of illness! I cried, but to what avail!

For the past eight or nine years, we have been communicating, we have been encouraging each other, we have been comforting each other, we have stored up thousands of feelings of separation, we have been looking forward to the day when the wandering siblings can reunite in our homeland; but now I still have thousands of words, but how can I confide them to you!

For the past eight or nine years, we have all grown up. I miss you, I can't imagine how tall you have grown. In my dreams, I see you as children in your teens, bouncing around. It seems that I have forgotten that you have died. We are still talking and laughing as before. Soon, the rooster crows and the dream breaks. When dawn is approaching, you are gone. You will never be in this world again!

Brother Kuan, Brother Jun, in childhood, following our parents, our footsteps have almost traversed this ancient country; in childhood, we have cooperated in many mischievous stories; now, even if I run all over the world, who can join me in tracing the past? I can only see the shadow of your lost childhood in the childishness of any innocent and mischievous child. Every time I see a friend's younger brother, every time I think of you, and even every day I face the children in the streets and alleys, I will be reminded of you.

Grandmother died of lung disease, father died of lung disease, tenth uncle died of lung disease, and you also died of lung disease one after another. In this ancient country, 90% of people have latent tuberculosis germs in their bodies, and those who die of tuberculosis are everywhere. Many people struggling on the iron cold front lines are walking the path of lung disease due to malnutrition and overwork. Many people do not know that they have lung disease and let it spread, and many people do not have the strength to treat it and are approaching the edge of death. In this ancient country, it is the working country where tuberculosis germs spread!

When I imagine all those who suffer from lung disease as you, my heart can't bear my sorrow!

How will I use my full of sorrow to remotely mourn you who died of illness in the distance?

### After Separation

— Steve

Wanting to completely forget everything, I wave my hand tremblingly at the bottom of the seven-stringed zither; the three months after separation have left no trace, like a blank page of paper. The deserted island is no longer a human realm. There is no longer a paradise in this world; wanting to completely forget everything is impossible. The quiet words of the forests and springs often sell me to the past. Falsely alarmed by the ten-mile pine waves, I no longer blame myself for being so meticulous. Since there is no piece of paradise now, I will destroy the love I have built. The three paths are overgrown with weeds! The flowers and plants I cultivated have not waited for this year's spring breeze, but still have to wait another winter. Even if time cannot be turned back, I have no regrets, only that all warmth is palpable. I will embrace the thunder of next spring. Please return to the scene of the whipping knight. I am here, and I am conveying to you, this future is precious!

### Lamenting the Passing

— Fang Zheng

The chirping of insects in the corner replaces the cicada's noise at the treetop; yesterday it seemed to be "the scorching sun blazing like fire," but blink of an eye it is the season of "fishing alone in the cold river snow"; and waiting just a moment longer, it will be the spring of "ten miles of orioles singing, green reflecting red." The giant wheel of time is always spinning non-stop!

Time makes people old, which is the most irrecoverable regret in the world. Although not prone to melancholy, I cannot help but feel sad and distraught every time the seasons change. Hoping for "eternal spring" and "eternal youth" is a constant human emotion, but we can only read about Dr. Hawthorne's ideal elixir of life, "The Elixir of Youth," in books, but cannot drink a drop of the elixir of immortality. As the protagonist, Dr. Heidegger, said well: "My old friends! I have always been experimenting in this laboratory to amuse myself. Now I would like to ask you to help me with a small experiment." This is tantamount to telling us that the matter of returning to youth is just an "experiment." If we really go to fantasize about drinking "The Elixir of Youth," the result will be as disappointing and sad as the four old men who were experimented on. Otherwise, Cao Mengde, the "hero of the world," and Napoleon, the "eccentric genius of the world," would not have aroused people's sigh of "Where are they now?" Lu You's poem: "A hundred plans cannot escape gray hair." Du Gongbu's poem: "It is rare for a man to live to seventy in ancient times." Liu Changqing's poem: "Looking at my shadow, what can I do with my white hair?" This kind of passive chanting is nothing more than an expression of the ancients' lament for the fleeting passage of time. Originally, in such a short life, who does not have the feeling of "life is like a dream, what is the purpose of power?" As long as you see whether you can grasp the passing time, it is good to "not let your youth down."

Due to the change of seasons, I often ask myself the related question: "What is life after all?" When I read Xu Zhimo's "Keats' Grave," I seemed to get a partial solution. He said: "What is life after all? You have to add your annotations, you have to express your 'view.'" Tao Yuanming said: "Everyone is floating in this river, and one day they will be submerged in it. Let me take advantage of the good scenery of Nanshan today, plant a chrysanthemum and drink a cup of sweet wine." Li Taibai, Su Dongpo, and Lu Fangweng all echoed that was right. Their "view" is in the wine glass. The ancient poem Nineteen Poems often expresses: life passes in a flash, but you have to live it. Thinking of immortality is foolish, grasping the present and enjoying happiness as much as possible is true.

Strictly speaking, people are all unaccompanied lone travelers in the world. Each individual is a lonely soul when they become aware. Zhuangzi also had no way to deal with this long time. He borrowed a dry skull to imagine another universe, where the process of birth is no longer subject to the limitations of time. The ancient Roman poet Horace also said: "Life is a comedy from the point of view of those who observe it, but it is a tragedy from the point of view of those who feel it."

One day on the road, I met a friend, Mr. C, whom I had not seen for two years. Judging from his old clothes and broken shoes, he must have been working hard. He was still the same as before. After we happily exchanged greetings, he told me that he had something very proud of recently. It turned out that his wife had died. He did not grieve for his wife's death, but said he was proud. I suspected that he might have been too sad and developed a mental illness. While I was suspicious, my friend explained in great detail, saying that in this era of living in suffering, not seeing with a glance, isn't that also happiness? This eccentric remark, a complaint, was certainly extremely absurd upon first hearing, but after careful consideration, it was a sentiment from the heart; he can be said to be a faithful believer of Tao Jingjie.

This article, hastily written to this point, should also come to an end. Recalling the Qianjia Poetry, Cui Tu's "Travel Feelings" poem, the opening sentence is "The flowing water and falling flowers are both merciless." Isn't that so? Flowing water and falling flowers are merciless. Don't let your youth pass in vain! Don't you think so?

### Pawn

— Bai Fan

Willing to treat forbearance as a layer of sugar coating,

To wrap up the excess emotions.

Thick affection is originally despicable;

Love—that meddlesome wasp,

Let it sting fierce horses as it stings a Su Lan's heart?

The universe has boundless vastness,

Heartache is a drop of dew;

If I have been destined to be a pawn,

I shouldn't even frown if my arm or leg is broken;

The warmth lost in my full grasp,

Why look back again?

When silently carrying the memory like a grain of dust,

Embark on the road of ten thousand miles without regret;

Let Mount Tai collapse in front of me,

Ah, I have no right to tremble!

### The Unfolding of Emotion

— Xiao Yi

Lately, I often like to lean alone at the back doorway, gazing at the horizon, turning some inexplicable thoughts. I don't know why, I just feel more comfortable like this.

There are many suffering people in the world, who often restrain their emotions and become coy. For the sake of a kind of "worldly" mask, they cannot willfully do what they like to do. Their reason and emotion restrict and bind each other, falling into the abyss of pain. They cannot laugh frankly at happy things, and they cannot cry frankly when facing sad things. This is the sorrow of distress. When I have been wronged and in pain, I really want to hide alone in a room and cry heartily, letting the depression flow away with the tears. I would rather have swollen eyes tomorrow and let people laugh at me, than be a painful, guilty, reluctant hero. Knowing how to find an appropriate occasion to let emotions unfold innocently will surely lead to a happy life. Just like my gazing at the blue sky and thinking freely, although it does not contain any purpose, allowing emotions and inspiration to gallop freely will bring pleasure. Sometimes, you can even get great enlightenment. The success of many things often starts in leisure. I also often feel that a life that is too busy and bound by the rules of work is a painful burden. There should be some leisure, or some leisure should be extracted from being busy to live leisurely, to protect and nurture one's emotions, to make one's humanity more true, good, and beautiful. This is not extravagant enjoyment and waste of time. I remember when Gorky was old, he smiled at a group of innocent children in the park. He kindly stroked them, the advanced love for mankind from the bottom of his heart. Just imagine how sublime and comfortable it is to be intoxicated by such overflowing love!

To get the enjoyment of emotional unfolding, what must be paid attention to is the demand for absolute innocence. Any affectation or forced imitation is completely a tool of bondage, that is to say, "truth" is needed in the realm of "beauty." Finally, listening to music is also a good tool to help emotional unfolding and human nature cultivation.

### Snippets

— Hu Shengquan

1

Outside the window is wind, is rain, is snow; inside the room, accompanying me, are only my own shadow and a flickering candlelight. I quietly count the beating of my heart, seemingly forgetting all emotions. Laughter is not necessarily for joy, and tears are not necessarily for the sake of pain.

Suddenly, a child's crying came from the next room. Why such a sharp scream? I stood up and asked someone to bring him over, but who knew he opened his eyes wide, faced the candlelight, and smiled.

--Ah, how fickle are the things that cry and laugh! I couldn't help but smile too.

2

Lately, it seems I live very leisurely, and also that I live very tensely; this has aroused envy, regret, and blame from many of my friends. But as for myself, I haven't planned anything, just living day by day like a monk ringing the bell. In this day and age, how many things can one decide for oneself? I just want to be busy when I'm free, and secretly laze when I'm busy.

There are many days when life is truly too boring. I don't want to read, don't want to write, don't want to... don't want anything! So I throw myself into the crowds on the street, following people running around in a panic. Occasionally, my heel bumps into someone else's, and I blush and get flustered, making things very "tense."

"Are you rushing to put out a fire?"

"Are you rushing to put out a fire!"

"Are you rushing to report a death?"

"Are you rushing to report a death!"

If there weren't such noisy commotion every day, wouldn't life in this world seem even more lifeless?

3

For a long, long time, I've learned to sigh. "Why do you sigh so deeply?" When someone asks me, I can only vaguely shake my head. I can't answer the reason. I just feel that I have to "sigh," and I involuntarily "sigh" it out.

Many kind-hearted friends are concerned about my health, saying that constantly sighing like this is very bad for my body. My mother is also worried about this, saying that constant sighing is also related to the rise and fall of the family's fortune. So I often subconsciously suppress the "sigh" that's in my throat and swallow it into my stomach.

However, I become thinner day by day. Facing the mirror, I shed tears - this world is suitable for sighing, but I can't sigh. How insignificant am I!

4

With the wind and snow, spring has finally arrived. Last year, on a moonlit night like this, I got drunk. A friend sitting next to me suddenly had a burst of artistic inspiration and wanted to write poetry. I am a vulgar person and an amateur when it comes to music, chess, calligraphy, painting, and poetry. But after his repeated prodding, and relying on some drunken strength, I actually completed a vaguely wonderful ancient-style poem of seven characters per line. Among them were four lines: "Sorrowful thoughts are as lush as the dense green, what good do down-and-out friends bring? When awake, I dance with my sword; when drunk, I sleep, I am a sleeping dragon in Nanyang." Who knew that it would make him angry, saying that I was "not self-deprecating and presumptuously comparing myself to the sages of the past." From his letter full of "zhī hū zhě yě" (classical Chinese particles), I had truly become a heinous person. This made me laugh. Of course, I was too frivolous, but if an elegant person has only such a measure of tolerance, how can he be considered someone of standing?

Now, spring has come again. I am still the same as before, except that I sigh more, and I dare not arbitrarily express my complaints.

5

I don't hide my pride. I'm too lazy to turn my eyes to those shallow vulgar people. However, on sleepless nights, I suddenly re-evaluated myself. "What am I?" I jumped out of bed. I have more shortcomings than others. I am the most unworthy one.

--Go away, you useless thing!

I scolded myself. But what's the use? Another "me" is laughing coldly: "You scold me, but I am you!"

Recently, I can't even stand myself. I feel that I have no reason to forgive myself, but I can blame others.

6

My sudden silence, like a philosopher, surprised many friends who were used to my meddlesome nature. "So-and-so has changed, becoming a bit outdated and depressed." I heard them sighing secretly like this, and my heart felt a hidden pain.

Am I not still very young? Is the blood flowing in my veins not the same fresh, red blood as everyone else's? But why is my soul so old? I have questioned myself several times, shouting out such a voice in my heart

--Forgive me, I can't answer you!

I remember that a doctor once prescribed such a prescription for a patient who was terminally ill: Fresh air and sunlight. Perhaps I also need a prescription that is equally suitable for my condition. Now, I am waiting, waiting for that prescription that will restore my youthful vitality!

Map of the Southern Part of Okinawa Island

Since the enemy Americans began landing on the southern part of Okinawa Island on March 25, more than a month has passed in an instant. After the Japanese army bravely fought back, the enemy army has remained confined to the landing points, such as Kadena, Chatan, Awase, Naha, Shuri, Itoman, and Hanakawa, unable to advance. According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, from the 19th of this month when the enemy army began its general offensive until the 23rd, the enemy army's losses were determined to be as follows: More than 6,000 personnel killed or wounded, 80 armored vehicles destroyed, 11 artillery pieces, and countless military supplies captured. The Japanese army's achievements in this battle will further strengthen its belief in the victory of future operations in Okinawa.

### Volleyball Season is About to Begin, All the Mighty Armies are Actively Preparing

Prelude: Three Provinces Friendship Match Against the White Team

The basketball season has passed, and exciting games have disappeared from the scene after three charity matches. The football league is also coming to an end, and although there are still a few exciting games left, it ultimately feels untimely. The volleyball season, which suits the season, is poised to rise in popularity. It is reported that the Volleyball Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at 4:00 PM today to discuss the implementation plan. However, since both the Western Youth and Central Youth gymnasiums cannot be used simultaneously, the authorities must turn to outdoor venues for development. It is learned that all the mighty armies are actively preparing, aiming to have a good performance when the time comes.

Looking back at the last tournament, the champions were Guangdong Chinese School in Group A, Yongsan in Group B, and the Green Team in the women's division. The above three teams all had the best results. It is now heard that the Yongsan team is determined to continue its efforts and participate in Group A for further development. As for Guangdong Chinese School, it is awaiting the decision of the host Zhuo Xigeng. There is talk that the Green Team in the women's division may retire. This is because several members of the team have gotten married and will no longer show their skills. They also have the intention of making way for newcomers. After the league champion is produced, they will have an exhibition match with them. The teams currently practicing are introduced below:

Central Northern Team

Since Wang Zhongtao took charge of the Central Northern Team, it has been full of vigor. However, it only had a basketball team organization. In this year's open basketball tournament, the team won both the Group A and Group B championships. Because of this, Wang's interest in ball sports has become even stronger, and he has the intention of organizing a volleyball team. Among the basketball team members, there are volleyball skills, including Li Zhenzhong, Li Baozhong, Chen Xuechong, and Zhuo Guorong. Moreover, Baozhong and Xuechong's left-right attack and defense can be said to be the two best at sea. Checking their team members, it is ultimately felt that their strength is insufficient. It is then heard that Guangdong Chinese School will not continue to host, so the players may belong to the Central Northern Team. It is recently heard that negotiations are underway, and it is generally hoped that it will become a reality. If so, then the team will be very strong and can dominate this year's league.

Three Provinces Team

The news of the establishment of the Three Provinces Men's Volleyball Team was disclosed in the last issue of this publication. It is now learned that the team has been formally established and has a tight organization. The coach, Qi Gong, is a senior in the volleyball world, with excellent experience and knowledge. Most of its members are from the Yizhong Team, the runner-up in Group B last year. Checking Yizhong's performance last year, they repeatedly defeated strong teams in Group B. Until the final championship game, they lost to Yongsan by a very close score and were ranked second. But watching their performance, it was considered to be excellent. This time, with the guidance of a famous coach, they will definitely be able to go to the next level. It is heard that the team has decided to join Group A. Although they have no great ambitions, giving people satisfaction is naturally expected. The team's roster is copied below:

(Team Leader) Pan Sansheng, (Coach) Qi Gong, (Manager) Deng Xiaoliang, (Captain) Zhang Siwei, (Members) Cheng Yihong, Chen Xiaoping, Lin Shen, Xie Funeng, Huang Hongdao, Xiong Daxu, Zhang Borou, Tang Liangsun, Chen Jiayou, Chen Zedong, Yao Weny, and Yi.

White Team

The White Team has more than ten years of history in the volleyball world. Its record has always been maintained at a horizontal line. This is because the team has always focused on using sports for leisure and physical exercise, and initially had no ambitions. This is also why it cannot reach the peak. This year, at the beginning of the season, the team is active again and has started practicing. Captain Wang Deyuan said that he will still gather all the old members to participate in the league, to show the supreme spirit of the White Team in volleyball.

Winter Green Team

Checking the women's teams, since the Green Team has the saying that it may retire, Zhi Qian also has the situation of disintegration, and Western Youth Red is unlikely to form a team, then among the list of last year, there will only be the Three Provinces and Huayan teams, which will inevitably be deserted. But hopefully, emerging newcomers will actively participate, to make a success together, not to let down the good intentions of the authorities. Now news has come that the Winter Green Women's Volleyball Team has risen. Among them are well-known people such as Zhang Biru, Wang Jinfeng, and Liu Zuxin. Zhang Fengru was the pillar of the former Wuben Team and attended the Far East Games. The grandeur of her and Huang Xingfen in those years is still in our minds. However, in recent years, Miss Zhang has focused on education and has not played this tune for a long time. This time, she has made a comeback. It is not known what the result will be. Liu Zuxin is a famous general from Liangjiang and also a veteran of more than ten years ago. Miss Liu has always been a sports instructor, and her students are all over the place. Her interest in volleyball has never faded, so her skills are still as good as ever. There is also Wang Jinfeng, who has not been seen for a long time since she showed her talent in the Weiwei Women's Volleyball Team. The excellence of Miss Wang's three-pass set is what the author admires the most. It can be said that until now, no new general can compare with her. This time, she is showing her skills again, which will surely give fans the best impression. The team has these three veterans, plus Liu Zuxin's talented students, and the results should not be weak. However, the author has met with the above three, and it is learned that the team is purely for the purpose of strengthening the body and may not be preparing to participate in the league. The author, in view of the loneliness of this year's women's volleyball team, is doing his best to urge the team to participate. It is heard that the team is considering it.

Three Provinces to Play the White Team in the League Prelude Next Monday

In order to test their strength, the Three Provinces Team has specially invited the White Team to a friendly match next Monday (April 30) at the Provincial Office Stadium on Anfu Road. The strength of the two teams has been briefly introduced in the previous article. In the first game of the season, the two teams will naturally be welcomed. Moreover, the environment of the Provincial Office is beautiful, and the stadium is surrounded by trees. At this spring day, fans can watch the game and enjoy the pleasure of the park, which is a truly good deal. It is thought that the owner of the Provincial Residence will be able to openly welcome visitors, to show promotion. (Bei)

### As Football and Basketball End, the League Federation Competes with the Referees

In the football league, with the abandonment of the game by the Donghua team tomorrow, the Group A competition will only have a duel between the League and the Portuguese. At the end of the last tournament, there was a friendly match between the Football Federation and the referee team, to show a great conclusion. Once a year, this year's friendly match has been decided to be held tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM in Jiaozhou Park. The competition focuses on fun, and ball skills are secondary. The official lineup of the two armies has been announced.

Football League

Zhou Jiaqi, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Takashi Takayama, Ma Shan'er, Jiang Yimen, Meng Nuo, Xuan Zhengdu, Shen Siliang, Shi Digen, Cheng Yize

Referee Team

He Chunhui, E Sen, Wu Shouheng, Jin Jiabiao, Wang Shoufang, Hu Chengquan, Lv Changfu, Zhang Le, Huang Fengjia, Li Guanxiong, Wang Wenyi

Football: Two Teams Compete in Jiaoyuan Tomorrow

Looking at the above list, both teams are all well-known people, but most are in their twilight years and may not have the ability to support the entire game, so both teams have a large number of reserves. The referee team has more than 20 people, which can be said to be a grand sight. Last time, the referee team won by a narrow margin of two to one. This time, the Football League is eager to take revenge and has the help of Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, and Ma Shan'er, so the back line can be said to be solid. All that is needed is to see the efforts of the front line to win the victory. The referee team has new people such as Huang Fengjia, and it is not known whether they can resist, otherwise, they will definitely lose. In short, this game has the meaning of a get-together, and fans are tending towards fun. The lively and grand occasion can definitely be predicted.

Basketball: The Group B Finals Will Include a Performance

The basketball league is currently only underway in various divisions of Group B, and it will also be completed soon. In the future, after the champions of each division are produced, a round-robin final will still be held. It is learned that at the final championship, the league authorities are also preparing to have a short performance of the Basketball League and the Referee Association.

The list of the old gentlemen's army of the Basketball League includes Zhu Zhongtao, Dai Changling, Zhou Jiaqi, Zhang Xiang, Qian Xucang, Niao Cheng, Shen Kunnan, Ling Xitao, and Lin Zuoshi. Among them, Wang Zhongtao, Zhang Xiang, and Qian Xucang have always been known on the court. The model of veteran style is still there, and their strength should not be underestimated. The referee team's list includes Wang Shoufang, Yu Ju, Jin Jiabiao, Chen Baolin, Yang Liecheng, Zheng Zhifang, Jin Botao, Zhou Huaibang, Wang Liwu, and Huang Cunrui. It seems that the old gentlemen's army of the League has potential. Zhou Huaibang is a representative of the Shanghai Bank basketball team's heyday. Jin Jiabiao is a good player in this area, and Jin Botao and Huang Cunrui have extraordinary skills. In terms of strength, they can be said to be comparable to the old men of the Basketball League, and in terms of energy, they are much more abundant. When they meet in the future, the victory will depend entirely on this. (Wang Duan)

### Basketball Referee Zhang Guoxun

The famous basketball referee Zhang Guoxun was once prominent in the basketball world more than ten years ago. He also had considerable attainments in football refereeing. Because of a slight conflict in a Zhendan vs. Lequn football match, he later specialized in basketball refereeing and left the basketball world after the war. He was impartial and fair in his judgments, so the audience and players all had a good impression of him. Mr. Zhang is now 49 years old and graduated from Shanghai University. He is excellent in English. In his spare time from business, he was also a sports editor for an English newspaper and later editor-in-chief of a local newspaper. In the past three years, he has rarely interacted with the sports world. It is recently learned that he is teaching at Toufan Middle School. (Zuo Zuo)

### The Eastern League vs. Donghua Game Tomorrow: Donghua Announces Forfeiture

In the football league, there will be a Group A match tomorrow between Donghua and the League. According to the two teams, the two giants of the Chinese team, can have a certain appeal, and the two teams have very few opportunities to meet. Just like the Donghua War last time, the Jiaozhou Garden created an unprecedented grand occasion. Now that there is such a good relationship, fans will naturally be happy to appreciate it. However, looking at the current situation form, Donghua has suffered three defeats. For the championship, it is hopeless. However, the League and the German Chamber of Commerce drew, and then drew with the Shanghai Police. The two draws are listed at the top with the Portuguese's one defeat (lost to the Overseas Chinese League). Although the Portuguese and the League have met, the result was not satisfactory due to the order relationship. Now the authorities have approved a rematch, so the League still has hope. Although Wu Qu has been expelled, the team has many talents and is well-adjusted, so its strength may not be slightly reduced. In addition, it has been practicing very hard recently, so it will definitely be able to do a lot. Under such circumstances, the Donghua authorities, in view of the fact that all the championships in this session have become the world of foreigners, only the League team in our Chinese team has this line of hope in this league. In the position of Donghua, it is indeed possible to allow the League to make the final effort to win glory for our Chinese people. In fact, Donghua's victory over the League would not be of much benefit. If it fails, it would be superfluous. Although the purpose of the ball game is not here. But in terms of reason, it is not impossible to violate the purpose of the sport. Therefore, the saying of Donghua is not just a rumor, but has become a reality.

Yesterday, Zhuang Youren, the secretary of Donghua, sent an official letter to the authorities of the Football League, stating that Donghua had decided to abandon the game tomorrow, making the League a success, and then fighting the Portuguese for the final. I hope that the League will work harder and not live up to Donghua's kindness.

### White Horse Cup Postponed

### China Table Tennis Room Opens Yesterday: Exciting Singles and Doubles Performances, Enthusiastic Audience of More Than a Thousand

The China Table Tennis Room held its opening ceremony on the third floor of the New World on Nanjing Road at 7:00 PM yesterday and invited the best table tennis players in Shanghai to participate in performance competitions. More than a thousand people from all walks of life came to watch, which was very popular for a time. Zhou Daoqian and Wang Yi, directors of the Shanghai Table Tennis Federation, attended the ceremony, and famous sports figures, stadium celebrities, and famous players also came to watch the battle. As the ceremony began, Chen Linsheng was first invited to unveil the opening and deliver a speech, and guests Qu Zhaokang, Chen Tianjue, and Chen Zhong delivered speeches.

The two generals came out to play in the warm applause of more than a thousand spectators. Lu drew and Zhang cut, and the opponents met. Lu lifted up one move and finally won three to one. The second group, short blocker Li Zongpei, cleverly met Fu Qifang. Xiao Fu was originally a good hard drawer, but he has been working hard to practice cutting recently and has also been successful. Therefore, during the competition process, drawing and cutting were used together. Although Li resisted desperately, he was exhausted by his lack of strength and lost to three to one. In the third group, Huang Zhijun faced Fang Keping. The two fought fiercely, and Keping had been practicing for a long time, and his hitting seemed to be unable to do what he wanted, so he was defeated by a score of one to three. The fourth group was played by the main players of the Shanghai Young and Strong faction, Xue Xuchu and Wang Youxin. Xue won the Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship in the last Jingwu Cup. His fierce attacking style can be called unique in the table tennis world. Youxin is also known for his hard pumping and has recently defeated several famous players, shocking fans, so the tension of this battle is unprecedented. Both sides used long pumping and fierce attacks, and the ball seemed to be a meteor, and its speed was unparalleled. Youxin was eventually defeated by the strong enemy with a score of three to two, which can be said to be not easy. After the singles match, Dianyi fought a show, with Xue Xuchu partnering with Li Zongpei against Chuan Qifang and Lu Hanjun. The battle was wonderful, and the audience applauded and was amazed. As a result, Xue Li won with two to one. Finally, Lu Hanjun, the main force of the room, delivered a thank-you speech.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (17)

— Liang Zhaoan

Checking the five-person zone defense method has its advantages and disadvantages. Its advantages are that it saves energy, makes it difficult for the enemy to go deep, reduces the enemy's chance of shooting near the basket, can resist the enemy's use of blocking methods to attack, can win more balls in the middle, and can quickly counterattack, especially in the ball rebounded by the baffle. However, its disadvantages are also numerous: If one person is in a zone, it is difficult to defend two enemies. If three enemies rush in at the same time, the front line will easily fall into chaos. It cannot force the other party to attack. If the other party gets a higher score and there is little time left in the game, the enemy can pass the ball in the outer circle without attacking to wait for the time to end and gain a few points of victory. In this case, even the audience feels bored. If the field is too large, it is not easy to retreat and defend, and it is easy to be attacked by the other party's rapid attack. If the field is too small, it is not easy to prevent the opponent's long-range shooting.

Therefore, when using the five-person zone defense method, it is necessary to understand its advantages and disadvantages before using it well to be effective. For individual defensive skills, in order to cooperate with this defensive method, the following points must be paid attention to. When the ball is lost, five people must quickly retreat and defend, and there must be no carelessness or slow intention to avoid being taken advantage of by the other party. When defending, look at the ball and not the person, which is the opposite of the "man-to-man" defense method. Depending on the direction of the ball, the front line should be shifted in advance and echo each other to avoid misunderstanding of duties, confusing the front line, or triple-teaming to control the enemy's concentrated attack.
