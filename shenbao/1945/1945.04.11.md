### Ryukyu Main Island Japanese Garrison Forces Stage a Heroic Counter-Attack, Enemy Attempt to Land at Nago Bay Heavily Damaged

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The battle situation on Ryukyu Main Island has gradually intensified, with both sides currently engaged in a heroic and fierce battle. Since the morning of the 8th, 4,000 enemy troops, under the cover of intense naval and aerial bombardment as well as heavy ground artillery fire, launched a full-scale offensive against the Japanese army's positions north of Shuri, led by a tank group of no less than a hundred vehicles. The fighting was particularly fierce along the central part of the battle line. Enemy front-line intelligence also acknowledges that Japanese ground forces have begun a formal counter-offensive. Faced with the brave and skillful fighting of the Japanese army, the enemy is struggling. At the same time, a portion of the enemy, due to the heroic surprise attacks by the Japanese army, was forced into disarray.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy near Ryukyu Main Island attempted to land at various locations. On the evening of the 7th, accompanied by 130 tanks and approximately 5,000 infantrymen, they attempted to land at Nago Bay. After being intercepted by Japanese forces, 25 of their tanks were left burning, and approximately 400 other personnel were killed or wounded. In addition, 60 enemy boats landed on Tsuken Island in Nakagusuku Bay.

A Certain Base, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Two enemy warships invaded Nakagusuku Bay on the eastern side of Okinawa on the afternoon of the 8th. Japanese forces in the area sunk a large destroyer and heavily damaged a smaller vessel. A portion of the enemy landed on Tsuken Island.

### Japanese Naval Special Attack Unit Fiercely Attacks Enemy Fleet, Sinking a Giant Destroyer

A Certain Base, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - On the afternoon of the 8th, a Japanese naval special attack unit attacked enemy warships near Tsuken Island at the mouth of Nakagusuku Bay, sinking a large destroyer and heavily damaging one other vessel. Another detachment attacked the cruiser fleet around Ishigaki Island, inflicting significant damage. Details of the battle results are unclear. Around Okinawa Island, there are eight enemy battleships, over thirty cruisers and destroyers, and over a hundred other vessels, continuously bombarding Japanese army positions on land. Due to adverse weather conditions in recent days, naval and aerial battles have not reached a peak intensity.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese army, navy, and air force special attack units, under the escort and supply of the 5th Army, launched a fierce attack on the American warships scurrying on the waters of Okinawa, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. According to a report from Stockholm via Seoul, the American operation in Okinawa has encountered the strongest Japanese resistance, suffering considerable losses of warships, exposing the American military to immense damage. Now the United States is further alarmed and at a loss due to the continuous fierce attacks of the Japanese special attack units. Currently, the American warships in the waters off Okinawa have suffered enormous losses since the Japanese military's all-out attack, resulting in a gradual decrease in the number of aircraft on their aircraft carriers. However, the enemy, already trapped in a dilemma, cannot ignore the plight of the landing forces, so they continue to strive to increase supplies and carry out fierce attacks, eager to complete the operation. The battles around Okinawa are fundamentally different from previous operations. Now both sides are committing all their strength to this battle, so its outcome will have a significant impact on the future war situation. Therefore, the war has entered a formal decisive phase.

### Isado Unit Achieves Merit, Army Ministry Awards Commendations

They sunk one aircraft carrier and damaged one large aircraft carrier, one medium aircraft carrier, and one battleship each. Subsequently, it was confirmed that they had sunk two aircraft carriers and one battleship, totaling three aircraft carriers and one battleship sunk, and destroyed one large and one medium aircraft carrier each. In the initial battle of Okinawa Island, they terrified the enemy. For their great contributions, commendations have been awarded to the unit commander, Army Captain Isado Tatsuhisa, and other brave soldiers.

### Allied Navy Creating Victory, Commander Ling of Naval Department Delivers Speech

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Ling Xiao, Head of the National Government's Naval Department, recently delivered the following speech: Looking ahead to the battle of Okinawa Island, since the enemy Americans and their powerful mobile units landed on Okinawa Main Island, the Allied land, sea, and air forces have continuously employed "special attack tactics," inflicting enormous damage on the enemy. Recently, the battle situation has become increasingly intensified. The Allied Navy's surface units have also been deployed, and they are jointly launching a formal attack with the land and air forces. Therefore, although the enemy possesses a powerful mobile unit of over 1,400 various ships, they have not only suffered significant damage, but the number of sunk and destroyed ships has reached as many as 245. According to information released by the Allied Headquarters on the 9th, the enemy's mobile unit is already showing signs of collapse. In this operation, the enemy side also had the British Pacific Fleet participating, and their most powerful new-style battleship, the "King George V," was struck by five special attack aircraft. Although it did not sink, it has lost its combat capability and cannot be used again without major repairs. From this, it is clear that the Allied special attack units are brave and skilled in combat, terrifying the enemy. Future developments in the war situation will surely bring even more astonishing news of victory. The Pacific War has reached a decisive stage. The Allies are fighting the enemy with their traditional spirit, and with the advantages of favorable timing, location, and popular support, defeating the enemy is a certainty. Furthermore, with the reorganization of the Allied cabinet and a new lineup, the final victory is undoubtedly assured. All of us yellow-skinned people should strive to inspire each other and cooperate with the Allies to strive for victory. This is a matter of utmost importance and allows no hesitation. Furthermore, the enemy's propaganda claiming that the Allied Navy has been annihilated is false. This falsehood has been exposed by the Allied Navy's surface units participating in this battle. The Allied Navy will surely achieve extraordinary feats, fulfilling the fervent hopes of the one billion people of East Asia. Let us wait and see.

### Foreign Minister Chu's Remarks

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Japanese army's great victory over the enemy's mobile units at Okinawa Island, everyone who heard the news was delighted. National Government Foreign Minister Chu specially released remarks on this, stating: The Allied Headquarters has already provided detailed information on the battle results and situation of the Allied Navy in the past two days, so there is no need to repeat them. Such battle results in a short period of three or four days are extremely gratifying. The enemy Americans, after obtaining Iwo Jima, then attacked Okinawa, and are now suffering such a disastrous defeat, with news of attempts to escape. Heaven despises violence, as can be seen from this. But for us, the meaning of celebration and joy lies not only in this. When the Allied war situation was critical, the cabinet was renewed, and the attention of the people was united, just at this time, the naval officers and soldiers achieved such a great feat, shifting the overall situation with their magnificent battle results. The impact of this is difficult to measure. The momentum of the new Allied cabinet can also be seen from this. With this ability, future achievements are even more difficult to limit. In addition to joy, I point this out to inform the people of the nation.

### Protect the Motherland, Liberate East Asia, Strive to Achieve War Objectives, New Japanese Foreign Minister Togo Speaks to the Press Corps

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - New Japanese Foreign Minister Togo Shigenori held his inaugural ceremony on the evening of the 9th. When he met with the press corps for the first time on the afternoon of the 10th, he specially released the following remarks: Wartime diplomacy and military affairs are mutually reinforcing. In order to achieve the objectives of the war, Japan must adopt decisive policies and carefully implement them. The imperial rescript issued by the Emperor at the beginning of the war has been clearly announced and made known to all. Japan, due to the improper oppression of Britain and the United States, was on the verge of a life-or-death crisis. Therefore, in desperation, it resorted to war for self-defense. This point has been overlooked by the enemy in their recent publications. Therefore, Japan must engage in the war to defend the motherland until the end, so that it can establish a foundation of mutual benefit and equality and achieve harmony among all nations. The liberation of all countries and peoples of Greater East Asia will gradually come about from this. The survival of Japan and the rise and fall of East Asia are determined by this battle. Therefore, this is the reason why one hundred million citizens are acting as special attack units, fighting bravely and skillfully. Britain and the United States persist in their conspiracy to dominate the world, deliberately hindering the progress of all mankind, and arbitrarily engaging in destructive acts. Their ambitions are the true cause of the disruption of world peace, so we must shatter them. To protect our ancient national polity and complete the autonomy and independence of the countries of East Asia is the purpose of Japan's war. It is in line with international justice, and "seeking construction in destruction" is the greatest hope of the Empire. Therefore, with the unified belief of the entire nation to consolidate and achieve the objectives of the war, although the road ahead is difficult, I firmly believe that the completion of the war's objectives can be expected in the near future.

Editorial

### On the Significance of the Great Battle Results in the Ryukyu Islands

In the Allied Japan, to adapt to the demands of the war situation and strengthen unity, as Admiral Suzuki formed a new cabinet, the war centered on the Okinawa Islands in the Ryukyu Islands has been constantly reporting great battle results. On one hand, it demonstrates the strong combat strength of the Allied land, sea, and air forces, shattering the enemy's propaganda. On the other hand, it is sufficient proof that the establishment of the new Suzuki cabinet in Japan is to strengthen unity and wholeheartedly eliminate stubborn enemies.

The operation in the Ryukyu Islands, whether in terms of terrain or strategy, has extremely important significance for the entire East Asian war situation. Standing in the position of a participating country, for the sake of liberating the future of East Asia, we cannot ignore the significance of this great victory.

According to the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, from the 5th to before dawn on the 7th of this month, 15 enemy ships have already been sunk and 9 destroyed. Reconnaissance on the afternoon of the 7th revealed that the enemy mobile unit, 200 miles southeast of Kyushu, centered on two fleet aircraft carriers and one auxiliary aircraft carrier, had been dragging an oil slick of 2,000 meters long and fleeing southeast. By dusk on the 7th, the enemy mobile unit east of Okinawa Island had suffered heavy damage to four or five enemy ships after a brave interception by the Japanese army. As a result, it had fallen into great chaos and fled east. On the next day, although the enemy repeatedly attacked, they retreated in defeat with heavy losses, with at least sixteen enemy boats sunk. According to the announcement on the 9th, since March 23rd, the Allied forces have sunk and damaged as many as 245 enemy ships!

In this major invasion of the Ryukyu Islands by the enemy, five mobile units were mobilized, vainly attempting to fight a quick battle and achieve success in one fell swoop. However, as of now, according to the battle results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, three enemy mobile units have been completely annihilated, and the remaining two enemy mobile units have also suffered significant damage. According to military experts, the reason why they were not completely destroyed was due to the limitations imposed by adverse weather conditions. However, this fully demonstrates the strength of the Japanese naval, land, and air forces in defending the homeland. This is also the first time that the enemy's strategy of invading the Japanese mainland has suffered a serious blow. After this serious blow, we do not need to predict whether the enemy will admit to being taught a lesson and change their strategy, but at least the enemy's second step of conquest has been frustrated as a result.

What are the reasons for the Japanese army's victory in this great battle? It is very clear that Japan does not rely solely on material strength like the enemy Americans. As our military strategy says, "attacking the mind is paramount." The most important thing is that, in addition to material strength, it can also inspire a unified sense of enemy hatred among the military and civilians, as well as the spirit of national unity to defend the country to the death. As Prime Minister Suzuki pointed out the other day: "We are fighting the United States today in the same situation as during the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, Japanese elders believed that Japan was not sufficient to defeat Russia, but as a result, Japan ultimately won under the inescapable circumstances of joint warfare. This war is also a situation in which war is unavoidable, so we must ultimately achieve victory." This is also the "putting oneself in a deadly position and then surviving" in our military strategy. Now that the Allies have obtained such a great victory in the initial battle of the homeland defense war, it can be regarded as a turning point in the recent entire East Asian war situation. We, the participating Allied country of China and all the East Asian nations, will also be encouraged and inspired by this. Although the future of the war situation still holds greater dangers and difficulties, if we can unite the one billion people and firmly believe in victory, then greater dangers and difficulties are precisely the prelude to the final victory!

### Baron Hiranuma Succeeds as President of the Privy Council, Inauguration Ceremony Held the Night Before

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Prime Minister Suzuki decided to recommend former Prime Minister Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō to succeed as President of the Privy Council. After visiting him at 11:00 AM on the 9th, he obtained his understanding. He then went to the Imperial Palace at 8:00 PM on the same day to request approval, and the inauguration ceremony was held that night.

### Japanese Army Secures the Laohekou Front, Occupies Neixiang on the Henan-Shaanxi Border

Central News Agency Dispatch - Laohekou is a strategic point in Hubei Province and also one of the bases for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. This time, after being occupied by the Japanese army, the Chongqing army believes that the Japanese army's advance into the interior will become more active, so it feels extremely embarrassed. The Chongqing side then ordered the front-line troops to defend strictly. According to the recent announcement by the Chongqing Military Commission, the Japanese army has now secured the Laohekou front, and in Henan Province, they are also advancing westward from the Nanyang, Tanghe, and Dengxian areas, occupying Neixiang, a strategic point between Henan and Shaanxi. At present, they have advanced to Zhechuan, about 45 kilometers west of Neixiang, near the border of Shaanxi Province. To its north, at Changshui Town, southwest of Luoning, fierce battles are unfolding between the two sides. According to the Chongqing side's announcement, Xi'an has already been threatened by the Japanese army from the southeast and east. Britain, the United States, and Chongqing have propagated that due to the increasingly tense Pacific war situation, the Japanese army's advance on the mainland has been weakening. However, according to the repeated announcements by the Chongqing side, it can be proven that the Japanese army's extermination war on the Chinese mainland is unfolding actively, and Chongqing also admits that the military threat it is receiving is extremely significant. As the Chongqing side says, if the Japanese army advances from the south along the west side of the Han River from Nanzhang through Laohekou and Guanghua, to the north to the area of Liguan, Zheshui, Luoning, and Changshui County, then Shaanxi Province will be threatened on all fronts. Militarily, the recent movements of the Japanese army, regardless of the Pacific war situation, are taking offensive postures everywhere in order to destroy the Chongqing army. In particular, the Japanese army's advance on Laohekou and Neixiang suggests that the offensive route from that direction through Ankang and Hanzhong to Chongqing has already been opened. People familiar with military news are making such observations, saying that the Japanese army will directly attack Chongqing.

### American Magazines Overflow with Dissatisfaction with the Authorities, Attacking the Romantic Lives of Important Figures

(Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch) According to reliable sources in this city: Recently, American domestic magazines have frequently disclosed news expressing dissatisfaction with the authorities' measures and the lifestyle of important figures. Details are as follows:

Roosevelt's Second Son Buys Steeds as Gift for Wife

The second son of American President Roosevelt, promoted to acting brigadier general, according to the American aviation personnel promotion system, those who do not possess aviation piloting skills cannot be promoted to officer ranks. This has aroused criticism from the domestic public, and all magazines have risen up to condemn it. According to the content published in American magazines, Roosevelt's second son, Elliott Roosevelt, is 34 years old this year and has been in the military for only four years, with no experience in military or aviation matters. Because of his early start in learning, his promotion has been rapid. He was promoted to colonel in 1943, which has already dissatisfied his colleagues. At the same time, he was sent to England to serve as the commander of an air force unit. Therefore, the magazine specifically pointed out the regulations of the American military aviation unit officer appointments, stating that anyone without piloting experience is not allowed to be appointed as a unit commander, but the promotion of Roosevelt's second son is strangely exceptional. Unexpectedly, this year, the Commander-in-Chief of the American Air Force, Arnold, appointed Elliott Roosevelt as an acting general, and stated that in America, Elliott Roosevelt is the only one who does not understand piloting technology. Subsequently, the magazine further explained that the appointment of an acting general must be approved by the Senate Military Committee before it can be finalized, and it is still unknown whether Elliott Roosevelt's appointment has been approved. It is noted that Elliott Roosevelt originally married a Hollywood actress as his wife. Now, since his promotion to acting general, Elliott Roosevelt is very happy in England and specially selected and purchased eight fine horses, which were transported from England to the United States to send to his wife. This has once again aroused criticism from the domestic public, as it is a time of wartime transportation difficulties, and civilian needs for transportation are already difficult to meet, yet he leisurely enjoys himself, leading to widespread condemnation.

After Eighteen Years of Marriage, Nelson Breaks Free

American economic advisor to Chongqing, Nelson, is already 56 years old. Recently, he caused a divorce joke in the country. His former wife had been married to Nelson for eighteen years. The reason for breaking free this time is because Nelson has another lover, a woman named Margaret Corbyn, who is only 26 years old. She was the beauty queen of George Washington University in 1939. After Nelson favored this woman, it is rumored that he is unwilling to go to Chongqing again.

American Soldiers in New Guinea Suffer from Homesickness

The American troops in New Guinea have recently been suffering from homesickness, but because the government has issued very strict conditions for returning home after service, it is very difficult to return home even if they want to. According to the magazine, soldiers who are approved to return home must have three special circumstances in order to be approved: First, the soldier himself has three-quarters of his limbs disabled; Second, he has been awarded two or more medals or five or more badges for merit; Third, he is infected with one of twelve malignant infectious diseases, and the disease must be very severe. Only those who possess these three special circumstances can be approved to return home. Now, according to the magazine's investigation, the soldiers abroad who are allowed to return home with the above reasons are all over 55 years old. At the same time, it is heard that the journey from New Guinea to the United States is considered by some to be almost a journey to transport the dead.

### Edible Oil Sales to Be Centrally Managed, in Order to Thoroughly Eliminate the Black Market

The Edible Oil Industry Association of this city has recently observed that the oil market is chaotic, and retailers have no goods to sell in the market, which has severely affected the food supply of Shanghai citizens. In order to implement the government's economic policies and to restrain illegal transactions by industry members and non-industry members, the association has consulted with relevant authorities and key industry personnel, and is preparing to centrally manage the sales of industry members and strictly set market prices, in order to thoroughly eliminate the black market.

In addition, according to Shen Weiya, the chairman of the association, the current inventory of edible oil in the city is still abundant, but the chaos in the market price is actually caused by the illegal operation of a few industry members and non-industry members, which has created a panic. The association is now actively working to implement centralized management of sales, and at the same time is persuading industry members to comply with price limits and restore retail sales in stores to meet civilian needs.

### Jiangwan's Industries

— Jia Xi

Jiangwan is located north of Shanghai, about twelve li from the city. The Songhu Railway runs through it from north to south, and the Zoumatang River winds around it from east to west. Furthermore, the highways are accessible in all directions, making land and water transportation convenient. Before the war, the market was extremely prosperous during the racing season, and there were many schools nearby. Now, it has completely changed.

Flour Industry

After the Incident, large-scale flour companies such as Fuxin and Rongfeng once suspended production. Therefore, small flour mills sprung up in Jiangwan like bamboo shoots after the rain three years ago, with seven or eight mills appearing. Each of these factories has only one or two machines and ten to twenty workers, producing approximately one hundred bags of flour per day. After the electricity supply was stopped, several mills switched to using firewood or diesel engines to generate electricity, but the fuel consumption for each machine is 20 dan of firewood and 20 jin of diesel per day. Now, wheat transportation is extremely inconvenient, and since it is the time of the year when the old crop is running out and the new crop has not yet arrived, the price of wheat is over 30,000 yuan per dan. After managing to buy some wheat piecemeal, plus labor costs, the finished product cannot be sold at too low a price. Recently, sales have been sluggish, and few people want it even at 25,000 or 26,000 yuan per bag. The grain stores, rice stores, and flour stores in Jiangwan Town all have large piles of flour, and in terms of actual business, they are as desolate as if no one ever comes to ask about it. Therefore, Fuchang and Jiangyuan flour mills have already stopped production. Now, only Songsheng, Gongda, Xinda, Yuanmao, and Yuansheng are barely maintaining production. It is said that the flour from Wuxi and Changzhou is also attacking them.

Sauce Garden Industry

Yusheng Sauce Garden in Jiangwan has a good reputation in the industry. It has been established for more than seventy years. During its peak period, it had more than fifty employees. Its soy sauce is made using traditional methods. Although the production time is slow, test results show that it is extremely nutritious and completely different from soy sauce made by new chemical methods. Currently, production has been reduced to a standstill due to the difficulty in sourcing soybeans, soybean cakes, and salt.

Oil Pressing Industry

There were originally two oil pressing factories in Jiangwan. Yuxin Oil Factory has already closed down. Only Yukang Oil Factory is still using diesel engines for production, but the output is extremely small, only enough to supply local users. Furthermore, the cost is higher than products from Changzhou and northern Jiangsu, making it impossible to compete. Recently, soybean oil from northern China and other places cannot be transported here, and the oil from northern Jiangsu and Changzhou is mostly transported to other places because the Shanghai soybean oil price limit is lower, which has caused the oil price to rise.

Local agriculture mainly focuses on growing cotton and vegetables, but due to the war, much of the land has been deserted, and it is also inconvenient to repair the river ports. Although there is a desire to increase production, there is no way to proceed.

Due to the war and other reasons, Jiangwan, which used to have convenient transportation, has become a dead city. Rice, grain, firewood, and grass are not easy to obtain, and the prices of meat and vegetables are similar to those in Shanghai's urban areas.

### Mr. Zhou Youhai Transfers Manuscript Fees to Support Charity School Fund

Mr. Zhou Youhai has always been enthusiastic about rescuing those who have dropped out of school. In addition to providing various sponsorships to this newspaper's scholarship fund, he has now transferred 14,000 yuan in manuscript fees from "Shen Bao Monthly" and "Talking about the Storm" to support the "Charity School Fund," benefiting the poor and cold, which is worthy of admiration.

Expressions of Sympathy

The children, Meiqi, Wang Zhiying, Zhu Changping, and Lou Lili, wrote: "We feel that your newspaper's establishment of compulsory elementary schools and Mr. Xie Lilin's initiation of the 'Charity Scholarship Fund' are very meaningful. Indeed, there are too many students dropping out of school now. We are now donating our month's worth of pocket money, totaling 6,000 yuan, to your newspaper to be used as the 'Charity Scholarship Fund.' Although the amount is very small and cannot make up for the shortage, it is just an expression of sympathy and a manifestation of the spirit of mutual assistance. We hope that other students in school will donate more to make compulsory elementary schools even more widespread, so that countless brothers and sisters who have dropped out of school will have the opportunity to study."

All the students of Xiaguang Elementary School wrote: "Your newspaper has established ten compulsory elementary schools, enrolling out-of-school children for free. We are young and weak, so we can only donate some old books to do our part. We are now sending 10,296 books, please accept them as textbooks for the charity schools."

### Continuing to Send Free Injury Treatment Vouchers

Lin Zhentang has always been enthusiastic about charitable undertakings, printing free injury treatment vouchers and distributing them to the poor and sick, and entrusting the martial arts master Mr. Tong Zhongyi to be in charge of medical affairs. A total of 150 copies were entrusted to this office for distribution. Now, 50 more copies have been sent. Those in need can obtain them from this office. However, due to the high cost of medicine, the cost is at least several hundred for minor injuries and thousands for serious injuries, so they are limited to the poor and sick. The clinic is located at 23, Lane 124, South End, Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road. Hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Serious illnesses are treated immediately upon arrival. The Houfeng Paperboard Company, located at 45 Baike Road, Tongchunfang, also distributes these free vouchers.
