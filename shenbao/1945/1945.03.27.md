Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a speech at the closing ceremony of the Parliament on the 26th, as follows: During this Parliament session, the government has straightforwardly elucidated the actual state of the Empire’s constant and present crisis, as well as various internal and external situations. At this critical juncture for the rise and fall of the Empire, we have specifically laid bare our determination to break through this extraordinary difficult situation, along with the fundamental principles and concrete outlines of our policies, in order to inspire and gain the cooperation of the people. At the same time, we have clarified to both domestic and international audiences the unwavering stance of the Empire regarding the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Members of Parliament, driven by profound patriotic sentiments, have frankly engaged in fervent discussions and have further urged the government to decisively implement active and resolute policies for achieving victory. In the face of this increasingly urgent war, their vigorous spirit of certain victory is truly noteworthy. This Parliament, with national unity, is resolutely advancing toward the path of achieving victory, and the determination of the hundred million is extremely high. The government, having had the budget and various legal bills resolved, will strive to implement them. At the same time, the important policies declared in the Parliament will also be rapidly implemented, and the total power of the hundred million will be mobilized to achieve the completion of national defense and the enhancement of war capabilities. Now that Iwo Jima has unfortunately fallen into enemy hands, and enemy air raids on the mainland are gradually intensifying, the mainland becoming a battlefield is a possibility. As the situation becomes increasingly tense, I hope that the people will further maintain the spirit of protecting the national essence and fulfill their duties as shields protecting the Empire. I hope that all the people will unite and strive to fulfill the responsibilities of completing production and defending the rear, with military officers and civilians integrated as one, advancing on the path of certain victory.

### An Outline of the Capital Price Maintenance Committee (Part 1)

— Ren Ping

The most noteworthy and surprising measure in the capital this year is the establishment of the "Capital Commodity Price Maintenance Committee" to stabilize people's livelihoods. When the committee announced its establishment on January 27th, commodity prices in Nanjing immediately showed a unified downward trend. In particular, the price of rice, the main staple food, surprisingly dropped from 24,000 yuan per shi to 17,000 yuan per shi, despite the normal time for the Lunar New Year holidays.

After the launch of the price maintenance work, the committee simultaneously sought to suppress commodity prices and rectify military discipline, wielding a big stick with both hands. The government orders were like mountains, and for a time, hoarding merchants and illegal military police disappeared. Committee Chairman Ye Peng's bold style is creating the first genuine initiative since the return of the capital to effectively relieve the people's suffering.

Seven Essential Items for Daily Life Determined

The mission of the Price Maintenance Committee is to prevent the soaring of commodity prices. Therefore, it has specifically determined seven essential commodities for daily life in the capital: rice, firewood, salt, oil, vegetables, pork, and poultry (including eggs). To eliminate all obstacles, it simultaneously rectified the discipline of the military police. In addition to assuming the responsibility of unblocking sources and suppressing prices, it also established severe penalties for obstructing the supply and demand of the seven commodities. A brief summary is as follows:

(1) The Price Maintenance Committee may apply the "Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law," the "Wartime Criminal Special Law," the "Regulations on Punishing Embezzlement by Public Officials," and the "Criminal Law."

(2) For the seven essential commodities for daily life, those who use violence, coercion, fraud, or other methods to obstruct their supply and demand, resulting in shortages in the market, shall be punished with the death penalty as specially approved by wartime military orders.

(3) Those who seek illegal profits, illegally levy donations, or use their power to extract wealth from the people by violence, coercion, fraud, or other means, whether they are public officials or not, shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years.

There are also two additional provisions: (1) Organizations, groups, or individuals shall not solicit fees from merchants engaged in the seven essential commodities for daily life. Violators shall be severely punished equally. (2) If Price Maintenance Committee personnel abuse their temporary power and the opportunity to perform their duties to engage in corruption, dereliction of duty, or violation of other laws and regulations, they shall be punished to the fullest extent of the law. All of the above shall be adjudicated by the committee's military law team and submitted to the chairman of the Military Affairs Commission for execution.

Organization and Supervision

In terms of organization, the committee has a secretariat, dispatch office, fuel group, supervisory group, and military law group. All staff members are seconded from various agencies and are unpaid. The chairman of the committee is concurrently held by the Minister of the Army. Initially, it was Ye Peng, and now it is Xiao Shuxuan. The members are concurrently held by Mayor Zhou, General Supervisor Li, and other relevant officials.

The most important work lies in supervision. Therefore, a supervisory brigade was organized. Every day, in areas where goods are circulating or related areas, the brigade conducts strict supervision by district and item. The supervisory teams can be seen speeding along the roads in large trucks with team members standing on them. The team flag, marked with white letters on a red background, is visible. Sometimes, illegal military police are discovered, and they are taken to the truck and brought back for questioning. These supervisory team members are also a mix of personnel seconded from various agencies and troops.

The team's work can be said to be consistently rigorous, and their spirit is commendable. According to the investigated figures, from February 1st to February 26th, in addition to the three major offenders who were executed for extorting money from the people and engaging in fraud, 209 illegal or law-breaking military personnel and civilians have been investigated. Among them, 117 were released after interrogation revealed minor circumstances and were given a reprimand. Fifty-nine, whose cases were more serious, were sent to the military law group for detention and investigation. Currently, 33 are still detained in the team.

Editorial

### A Word of Contribution to the Wartime People's Representative Conference

The suggestion from representatives of various sectors of the capital to convene a wartime People's Representative Conference for all provinces and cities has been accepted by the government, and the conference is scheduled to be held for three consecutive days, from tomorrow to the 30th. All provinces and cities have dispatched representatives to Nanjing to attend. We would like to express our sincere wishes for the smooth progress and successful outcome of the conference.

We believe that the mission of the wartime People's Representative Conference is for each representative to express their views on national affairs and people's livelihoods, as well as their ideas for improvement. Through discussion, these views should be synthesized into practical and feasible recommendations for the government to adopt and implement, in order to benefit both national affairs and people's livelihoods. To put it bluntly, the conference must resolve various practical issues related to winning the war and strive to avoid all cliché proposals common in wartime conferences.

This conference, as its name suggests, should link "wartime" and "the people." During wartime, military affairs are undoubtedly paramount. However, at the same time, the coordination of wartime politics and wartime economy with military affairs cannot be ignored, as it is necessary to effectively guarantee the achievement of military victory. The target of wartime politics and wartime economy is the people, which means how to achieve the spontaneous cooperation of the people during wartime through the coordination of politics and economy. This has always been the biggest challenge for the government.

For the past two years, we have consistently advocated the establishment of public opinion organs in the central and local governments at all levels. The purpose is to link wartime politics and wartime economy with the people, and thus to link the government with the people to work together to win the war. This conference can be said to be the beginning of the government's connection with the people, so we express our extreme support for it.

Currently, there are two viewpoints in society regarding the current situation. One viewpoint is that everything should be based on the war, with wartime politics and economics being secondary. In other words, only military affairs should be the focus, and everything else should be neglected. The other viewpoint is that the people's demands for politics must be met first, and the people's minimum living conditions must be resolved before military victory can be effectively guaranteed. We believe that these two viewpoints have the same goal, but the means used are different. We have always advocated that military affairs should be paramount at present, but meeting the people's political demands and resolving the people's minimum living conditions must also be done concurrently. Leaning toward either side would disconnect wartime from the people. If this happens, then the effort to achieve military victory will be doubled with half the results.

Therefore, we hope that this conference will address how to link wartime and the people closely, how to unite the people and the government, how to ensure the final victory of the war, and how to meet the people's minimum political demands and resolve their minimum livelihood problems, and reach satisfactory conclusions on these issues.

We believe that this conference is the government's initial effort to listen to the people's opinions. As for how to establish permanent public opinion organs, we hope to promote their realization in the near future.

Japan, an allied nation, recently passed a general mobilization plan in its cabinet and organized a national volunteer corps. Prime Minister Koiso encouraged the people, saying, "Defending the country is not only about taking up arms and killing the enemy, but also about redoubling our efforts in various rear-area tasks such as increasing military supplies, increasing food production, and transportation. The effectiveness of this is no less than that of defending the country." This is a concrete explanation of how wartime politics and economics coordinate with military affairs to jointly achieve victory.

On the 12th, representatives of various sectors of the Nanjing people, at a wartime situation discussion meeting, resolved to convene a national People's Representative Congress. At that time, the East Asia League, the New National Movement Promotion Committee, and the New People's Society were invited to actively assist in order to materialize the movement. Because this is a people's movement initiated by the people themselves, we believe it is very meaningful. It is undeniable that the current situation is very serious. All Chinese people who are slightly concerned about politics hope for a change in the situation in some different sense in order to resolve the situation. However, honest Chinese people are tending to avoid the attitude because the objective situation is too serious. However, if this move is truly a patriotic people's movement initiated by patriotic people, then the national government should seize this best opportunity to seek the free expression of public opinion. Propaganda Minister Zhao Zunyue, with a heart full of enthusiasm, expressed his patriotic sincerity and said that he believed that the conference would make extremely great contributions. Therefore, he expressed his sympathy and full understanding of the movement. We also cannot but hope that this spontaneous people's movement will receive the active assistance of the three organizations and achieve full results. But to truly achieve success, it is necessary to respect the fact that the conference was convened by the people themselves. At the same time, it should also be emphasized that the government should not interfere or guide the personnel and discussion content of the conference. Furthermore, since the conference is the crystallization of patriotic sincerity, then even if it occasionally utters words that the national government does not want to hear, the government should naturally show generosity and should not take an opposing or retaliatory stance. If the conference only drafts a grand declaration and ends the meeting, then the convening of the conference will have lost all meaning. The initiators of the movement and the national government should pay attention to this point.

At the same time, the government should always fully respect the various resolutions decided by the conference in the future. Anything that is possible to implement should be implemented immediately in good faith. Of course, the decisions of the People's Congress cannot have direct binding force on the government's policies. But its decisions and recommendations truly reflect the urgent demands of the people. Therefore, anything that is possible to implement should be adopted as government policies with boldness and without hesitation. Only in this way can public opinion be fully expressed. If the People's Congress, no matter how appropriate the decisions, cannot be reflected in the actual political sphere, then this is equivalent to the people's movement, which was launched with painstaking efforts, being hit with a head-on blow, causing great disappointment to the people and causing them to return to a passive attitude of not caring about politics. Therefore, we cannot but hope that the national government will properly handle this point.

Because the Chongqing regime succumbed to the political attacks of the Communist Party and the domestic interference of the United States, it is preparing to convene the National Assembly this autumn. The Nanjing National Government also clarified in its return-to-capital declaration that realizing peace and implementing constitutional government are the government's greatest tasks. Later, it even worked hard on the work of the Constitutional Implementation Committee. However, in the current environment, what can be admitted frankly is that hastily implementing constitutional government will end up in the quagmire of formalistic formalism and will even lead to a trick to deceive the people. If this view is correct, then major political issues such as the implementation of constitutional government require full and thorough preparation and waiting for objective conditions to mature. Therefore, it is more practical and wiser to pursue other appropriate means of freely expressing public opinion at present. On this point, the national government should fully respect the National Congress and at the same time should admit that the conference has the utilization value of grasping the people.

### Various Industries Selling Off Goods for Cash – Prices Fall

Recently, commodities and raw materials in various industries and markets in the city have been displayed for sale in large quantities, with price reductions and discounts seen everywhere. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in recent years. However, due to supply exceeding demand, although various industries hope to sell goods for cash, business remains very sluggish due to the weak purchasing power of citizens. This phenomenon fully indicates that hoarded goods have been completely released, and market prices have stopped rising and started to fall. According to figures in the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors, the consistent decline in commodity prices in Shanghai is mainly due to the municipal authorities' strict investigation of prices, and secondarily due to the poor water and land transportation to other areas. It is expected that from now on, the prices of all goods will continue to decline. It is also understood that various factories, companies, and shops in the city have been repaying their loans to various banks and money shops in advance, regardless of the amount. Generally, the amount of these industrial and commercial loans recovered by banks and money shops accounts for about 80% of the total amount lent. This is because the various industries believe that there is little hope of price increases for purchased goods, and it is more stable to sell goods for cash to repay debts than to borrow money and pay interest.

### Prelude to Miss Li Tianduo's Solo Concert

The famous soprano Miss Li Tianduo will hold a solo concert at the Majestic Theater at 5 PM on the 31st of this month. Miss Li is a talented student in the vocal music department of the National Conservatory of Music, where she studied with Professor Shuxilin for six or seven years. Since last summer, she has also been studying with the famous conductor, attempting to deepen her knowledge, and has been working with Mrs. Furer to adjust her pronunciation and beautify her timbre. Anyone who has heard Miss Li's singing has praised her wide range and considered it to be her unique talent. This range, combined with the roundness of her timbre, makes her an ideal talent.

In order to enhance the effectiveness of the accompaniment, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra has been increased from its original number to sixty members. This large-scale orchestra is unprecedented, but it can be said to be a perfect match for Miss Li's voice. The conductor is Professor Magolinsky, whose unique research and experience in singing accompaniment have long been appreciated by the public. The program for this concert is worthy of being solemn and grand. Works by great composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Mascagni, Wagner, Verdi, Rossini, etc., have been included, and Miss Li's solo songs are all extremely famous and exquisite. Only Miss Li has dared to attempt such a difficult program.

Recently, due to the lack of large-scale concerts, the musical atmosphere has become increasingly dull. Miss Li's concert, held on a large scale with a steadfast spirit during this period, can meet the urgent needs of music lovers.

### Students Most Forceful in Donating to Charity School – Eagerly Awaiting Support from All Sectors

Donations of Money and Books Equally Welcome Huaguang Voluntary Primary School has been running voluntary education for three semesters with remarkable results. This newspaper recently co-organized a voluntary elementary school, and the teachers and students of the school enthusiastically supported it because of their shared interests. A few days ago, all the students of the school donated money for voluntary student aid. Yesterday, the faculty and staff of the school raised more than 40,000 yuan, which is commendable. They also sent a letter expressing their enthusiasm, stating: "Huaguang Voluntary School, located at 284 Taikang Road, was founded in the second semester of 1943 by enthusiastic educators. It currently has more than 400 students, divided into ten grades, organized into two parts, with tuition and book fees all waived. There are more than ten faculty and staff members, with equal emphasis on teaching and training. Because it is necessary to cooperate with the school board in providing porridge, clothing, medical care, and medicine, special attention is paid to family visits. Since its establishment, it has been in its third semester. We, the faculty and staff of the school, have been interested in voluntary education for a long time, so we have been trying our best to achieve results; however, our abilities are weak and our experience is limited, so we cannot have full development. Since reading your newspaper's initiative to establish ten voluntary elementary schools, as well as Xie Lilin's advocacy of the 'Voluntary School Fund,' and the enthusiastic response from all parties, we are very excited and believe that your newspaper's initiative is promoting the strength of the entire society and is the initial creation of the entire voluntary education, which will surely be supported by people from all walks of life, and its results can be expected. As for the management regulations, they will be as perfect as possible, not only will Huaguang Voluntary School have rules to follow, but we will also be happy to have like-minded people, hoping to learn from each other and work together to seek new development for the future of voluntary education and popularize national education, which has profound significance. Because our economic abilities are weak, we have to do our best to solicit donations from outside. We have raised a total of 44,500 yuan in stored currency, and we have attached a list of donors. Please publish it separately to show credibility." (The names and amounts of donors will be listed in the donation advertisement)

Donations from Lost and Found Transferred to Charity School

Mr. Guo Qiuchao wrote: "I am writing to inform you that I found a passbook from a bank and two checks on the road. Later, I learned that they belonged to Xingsheng Grain Shop, so I telegraphed the shop. The manager, Mr. Chen Yunzhang, kindly offered me 3,000 yuan as a reward. Because I believe in the ancient saying that it is wrong to take what is not yours, I dare not accept it. I thought that the voluntary school run by your newspaper is in urgent need of donations, so I will transfer Mr. Chen's donation to the 'Voluntary School Fund' to create good fortune for Mr. Chen."

Teachers and Students Work Together to Donate Money and Books

All the children in the fourth grade of the Private Yisheng Elementary School wrote: "During today's commemorative week, our class teacher, Bo Guangsheng, reported on the news of your newspaper establishing a voluntary elementary school and Mr. Xie Lilin's initiative to create a voluntary school fund. We were all very excited when we heard this, so we also wanted to do our small part to help your newspaper complete this great act of righteousness. However, most of the parents of the children in our grade are vendors, and their families are very difficult, so our children are very frugal and do not have pocket money on a daily basis. Only a small number of children eat snacks in the morning, so only the children who eat snacks in the morning can save some money to donate to the 'Voluntary School Fund.' However, we spent a morning and only raised 400 yuan. We felt that this amount was too small, so we asked Mr. Bo to donate a little as well. He donated 600 yuan, combining it into 1,000 yuan. In addition, there are 1,400 yuan in candy money saved by other children, and a list is attached separately. Please publish it in your newspaper to show credibility. Although the amount we donated is very small, like a drop in the bucket, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will respond together, so the amount of donations will definitely be considerable in the future! In addition, we are offering 20 elementary school textbooks, hoping that you will accept them as textbooks for the voluntary elementary school."

All the students of the Private Daye Chengyu Elementary School wrote: "Recently, your newspaper is running voluntary elementary schools to rescue out-of-school children. We sympathize very much and are willing to do our part to help. Now we are sending you a total of 16,555 yuan, which is the snack money we have saved for a few days, and 584 old textbooks that we have collected, as well as 7,000 yuan that student Chen Xiufang has enthusiastically solicited (3,000 yuan each from Miss Wu Zhijing and Mr. Cheng Yunlong, 1,000 yuan from Miss Chen Nanxin, 4,000 yuan from Yuan Jinshan (donated by Mr. Yuan Qiqing), 2,000 yuan from Chen Qinzhun (donated by Mr. Chen Renli), and 1,000 yuan from Pang Meizhen (donated by Mr. Pang Qing), for a total of 30,555 yuan), please deposit it under the "Voluntary School Fund."

We are all children and know that our strength is small, but in order to help relieve the suffering of out-of-school children and respond to the enthusiasm of your newspaper, we are widely soliciting donations from our relatives. We hope that like Chen Yuan and other students, they will also come to help this cause!"

### Chinese Health Association Extends Examination Time

Today marks the centenary of the birth of Wilhelm Röntgen, the founder of X-rays. All sectors of the city are holding a Tuberculosis Prevention Week, hoping to curb the spread of this terrible disease through universal examination methods, which is of great significance. The Chinese Health Association at 996 Jing'an Temple Road in this city has been working hard to provide health examinations for citizens, and in commemoration of this great inventor, it has expanded the examination time. From today, examinations will be conducted all day in the morning and afternoon (only in the morning on Sundays) until the end of this month, and only half the fee will be charged. These preferential examination coupons are now being sold by this office at a half price of 700 yuan per coupon. We hope that all sectors will not miss this opportunity.
