### Around Okinawa Island Waters: Twelve Enemy Warships Sunk and Destroyed; Japanese Special Attack Units Launch Relentless Assault

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): On the 23rd, enemy forces in the southern part of Okinawa Island launched an offensive from the line between Uehara and Tanahara, with a force of approximately 1,000 men and a dozen tanks. Japanese forces are resolutely defending the front lines and fiercely fighting back. In the area west of Dōyama, enemy forces are advancing with their armaments and personnel, preparing for the next phase of operations. Since the enemy's attack began on the 19th of this month, as of noon on the 23rd, Japanese forces have inflicted approximately 6,000 casualties on enemy troops, destroyed 80 tanks, destroyed 11 artillery pieces, and destroyed four military supply depots, including cargo trucks and munitions. Japanese forces also captured two mortars, 26 heavy machine guns, one autocannon, and two rocket launchers for attacking tanks. As for the naval battle situation, the attacks by Japanese special attack units have been very fierce. On the 22nd, it was confirmed that 12 large ships, including aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers, were sunk or destroyed, and several warships of unspecified types were damaged.

Southwest Base, 24th (Central News Agency): Enemy warships are still active around Okinawa Island. On the afternoon of the 23rd, a portion of them approached the southern west coast of the island and bombarded it. On the 23rd, a total of approximately 350 enemy aircraft attacked Okinawa. On the 22nd, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force attacked enemy warships in the northern sea off Okinawa Island, sinking at least two warships of unspecified types. Another unit destroyed a large transport ship near Kerama Island. On the morning of the 23rd, Japanese defending forces in Ginowan Bay sank an attacking enemy destroyer.

Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: According to an announcement by the U.S. Pacific Fleet on Monday: On April 20th, U.S. forces on Iwo Jima engaged in combat with remaining Japanese forces on the island for 24 hours. According to this report, there are still Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, entrenched in fortified positions within caves, continuing to fight against U.S. forces.

### Enemy Aircraft Invade Japanese Homeland: Twenty-Six Aircraft Shot Down; Northern Taiwan Suffers Blind Bombing Again

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): Approximately 120 B-29 type aircraft from the Mariana Islands base assembled over the sea south of Izu, formed into several waves, and invaded from the west of Shimoda at approximately 8:20 AM on the 24th, mainly bombing the Tachikawa area. Investigations are currently underway, but it is expected that the results of the Japanese aerial and ground interception efforts will be significant. As of 11:00 AM, the results of the fighting by the aviation units that have already been confirmed include six aircraft shot down and more than 20 aircraft destroyed. It is believed that the results of the anti-aircraft artillery units are also substantial.

Taipei, 23rd (Central News Agency): On the 23rd, approximately 35 enemy bombers and approximately 30 fighter aircraft attacked the Taipei area from Vigan, Philippines. A portion of them bombed Hualien Harbor and 12 villages in Hsinchu Prefecture. On the morning of that day, enemy large aircraft attacked the vicinity of Taipei, blindly bombing civilian houses, but the damage was minor.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): Since the enemy occupied the Philippines and Okinawa, the scale of strategic bombing of the Japanese homeland by the enemy has suddenly expanded. It is expected that larger-scale attacks will occur in the future, but each time enemy aircraft attack, they suffer significant damage. Their attempts to destroy combat capabilities, disrupt public morale, and discourage the will to fight will not be able to fulfill their ambitions in the face of the unified interception front of all military officers and civilians in Japan.

### Organizational Decisions for the Japanese Political Association Branch

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): The issue of the branch organization of the Greater Japan Political Association has been resolved with the government authorities, and it was officially decided on the 24th to strengthen the Welfare Practice Department, the Wartime Living Department, and the General Affairs Department, with the branch chief and secretary-general as the center. Furthermore, joint associations will be established in each local administrative council district, with chairmen selected from local members of prominence as branch chiefs. All personnel and organization are expected to be completed in May. Furthermore, each branch will do its best to assist the National Volunteer Corps organized by the government. Thus, the formation of a national structure is established with the goal of completing the war and defending the homeland.

### National Registration to be Implemented Throughout Japan

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): Japan has decided to implement national registration throughout the country, except for Tokyo Prefecture, starting on May 1st. All men aged 12 to 60 and women aged 12 to 40 must apply for registration. However, active military personnel, those called into military service, army and navy students, military personnel, teachers, dentists, pharmacists, nurses, veterinarians, sailors, scientific and technical personnel who have already been registered, as well as students attending national schools, and married women are not subject to this requirement.

### Spring Temporary Grand Festival at Yasukuni Shrine

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): Japan's spring temporary grand festival at Yasukuni Shrine is scheduled to be held on the 25th at Yasukuni Shrine. Admiral Zengo Yoshida will serve as the chairman of the grand festival committee. A spirit invocation ceremony will be held on the 24th. This temporary grand festival will include 41,318 new enshrined deities, including Count Hirohide Fushimi, a navy lieutenant commander who died in action in the Marshall Islands campaign, Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and General Toshiyuki Maeda, who died in action in Borneo.

### On the San Francisco Conference

Deceptive propaganda is a means of war. Due to domestic political, international diplomatic, military, and economic financial relations, Britain and the United States have no choice but to hope to end the war against the Axis powers of Japan and Germany as soon as possible, and are therefore currently actively engaged in deceptive propaganda. The "United Nations Post-War International Security Conference," also known as the "San Francisco Conference," which will be convened in San Francisco, on the Pacific coast of the United States, on April 25, is the most notable example of deceptive propaganda. Anything that is called deceptive is not only absolutely devoid of sincerity, but also employs a wide variety of methods such as bluffing and cheating, threats and inducements, intimidation and wooing. Judging from the conception and convening of the San Francisco Conference, it is a typical manifestation of deception. But the British and American fraudulent tactics, due to their overbearing and arrogant attitude, reveal their flaws everywhere, but they still ignore everything and desperately want to fulfill their own ambitions.

Participants

The San Francisco Conference is based on the results of the Crimea Conference in February of this year, with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as initiators, and summoning 44 United Nations members to meet. Therefore, the apparent purpose of the conference seems to be to review and evaluate the general international organization draft for world peace and security decided at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in the United States last October, and the draft voting procedures for that organization decided at the Crimea Conference. But in reality, it is an organ for dividing the world under the control of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The invited members include Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Chongqing, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dominica, Egypt, Ireland, El Salvador, Ecuador, Abyssinia, France, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Sudan, Arabia, Turkey, the Union of South Africa, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. But apart from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, most of the other countries are either nominal governments-in-exile, or countries forced to join the United Nations camp under the oppression of the three countries. Among them, countries such as Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Ecuador, Paraguay, Turkey, Iran, and Egypt are not only subjected to various political and economic oppressions, but are also threatened, saying that if they do not declare war on the Axis powers before March 1, they should not expect to share in the benefits after the war, so these countries had no choice but to declare war. There is also Argentina, a large South American country that has always bravely resisted the oppression of Britain and the United States until recently, and has always maintained neutrality in fact, was finally unable to resist the oppression of Britain and the United States, and declared war on the Axis on March 27.

British and American Intentions

induced to participate in the San Francisco Conference. If we examine the Dumbarton Oaks draft, which is the foundation of the San Francisco Conference, we can immediately see through the farce of the "Post-War International Security Conference". The French government of Turgot had long seen through the ambitions and conspiracies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, so it refused to serve as a convening country of the conference. Chongqing, which depends on Britain and the United States for survival, is of course listed as a convening country alongside Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but this is only based on British and American plans to make Chongqing a tool for controlling East Asia. The content of the Dumbarton Oaks draft, that is, the content of the post-war international security draft, is of course the anti-Axis United Nations alliance plan announced last October, but the organization and function of the new League of Nations are the same in different ways as the former League of Nations, which was the root cause of this world war. If we examine this kind of organization, we can know that it is a very harmful institution. The new League of Nations has five organs: the League General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat. These organs handle all international relations, but the real power is in the hands of the permanent council composed mainly of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Small countries can be said to have no say. This can be seen very clearly: Britain and the United States have torn up the Atlantic Charter, which they themselves promoted as the war's objective, and are using this new organization to drive small countries as they please. Just look at the express provisions of the Security Council:

"The Council shall consist of eleven members, and the permanent council shall be composed of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. France may also participate when possible. The Council shall have full power to prevent aggression, and may take action and use land, sea, and air forces without seeking the consent of all member states."

It can be seen very clearly that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are in fact dominating the world by force. What can Chongqing and France, which have no real power, do even if they are permanent council members? This is an obvious fact. In addition, there is an express provision regarding the method of handling disputes:

"A military commission shall be established as the organ for actually guiding the exercise of force. The commission shall be composed of representatives from the general staffs of the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing."

This means that force is used to maintain peace according to whether Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are happy or not. Using force to maintain peace means armed peace, which is nothing more than another form of war. The international security mechanism is just an empty name, and is merely an organ for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to dominate the world.

Soviet Indifference

The voting procedures for the Security Council have been a source of much debate and disagreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. It was not until the Crimea Conference that they reached a consensus, but the Soviet Union insisted that countries that are regularly involved in disputes should also have the right to vote. Britain and the United States reluctantly compromised and stipulated:

"Whether or not a country involved in a dispute is a permanent council member, it has no right to vote. However, when exercising force and making other major decisions, the consent of all permanent council members is required."

Thus, the matter was concluded. But unlike Britain and the United States, the Soviet Union has other far-reaching plans. Relying on its own political, diplomatic, and military power, it has rapidly advanced its influence in Eastern Europe, the Near East, the Balkans, and along the Mediterranean coast. Naturally, it does not like Britain and the United States using the San Francisco Conference to restrict its freedom of action, so it has shown a rather indifferent attitude towards the conference. Even from the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the future of the San Francisco Conference is far from optimistic. Furthermore, countries such as Brazil, Australia, Canada, Norway, and the Netherlands, which often consider themselves to be major powers, have not become permanent council members, and are actually subordinate to Chongqing. They will naturally be filled with anger. In particular, France, a leading country in one corner of the European continent, is the central force of all small countries with dissatisfaction. This is worth special attention. Pierre Tynan, the Minister of Information for the Turgot government, once stated that the Dumbarton Oaks draft is useless for world security, so it has notified the San Francisco Conference and submitted amendments. However, Britain and the United States, who use threats and inducements to win over small countries, are convening the San Francisco Conference according to a predetermined trap, forcibly violating the opinions of other countries, and using it as a source of propaganda to expand to the world. However, the peace they want to establish is an armed peace that is beneficial to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and a peace that is unattainable for small countries. Since armed peace is just a form of war, then the San Francisco Conference is nothing more than the brewing of the Third World War. (Translated from the Daily News, April 3)

Editorial

### The Achievements of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference

Just as the San Francisco Conference, which the enemy has been clamoring about for a long time, focusing on discussing the issue of future international organizations, is about to open, the ambassadors of East Asian countries first held the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference in Tokyo. This conference did not make any publicity beforehand, and is absolutely not as meaningful in terms of international strategy as the San Francisco Conference; but the spirit of sincerity, equality, coexistence, and co-prosperity is expressed in the unanimous four resolutions and the joint statement.

Among the four resolutions of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference, the first and second items are to jointly support the complete independence of Vietnam and the various ethnic groups in East India. This is precisely a factual explanation of the true purpose of the Greater East Asia War, explaining its progressive nature of fighting for the liberation of colonial peoples; and the fourth item regarding the resolution of the Indian Provisional Government is also a concrete proof of the same purpose; these three resolutions have already solved the problem of the post-war disposition of colonies and the problem of a new world order, which will inevitably lead to disputes at the San Francisco Conference. And the third resolution regarding the permanent liaison mechanism of the Greater East Asia Conference reminds people of the problem of a new international organization, which has already caused disputes between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union before the San Francisco Conference was convened. We, standing with the East Asian countries whose interests are aligned, have already solved this problem first.

Secondly, the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference passed a joint statement, reiterating the significance and purpose of the Greater East Asia War, refuting the enemy's various unrealistic propaganda about the allied countries and the Greater East Asia War; at the same time, it reiterated the determination to concentrate the total strength of the ten hundred million people to complete the war, and the original text of its seven resolutions is a concrete explanation of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration of November 1943, reiterating the guiding principles for building a truly equal and free new world order.

After this Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference, the ten hundred million people of East Asia have gained a further understanding of the Greater East Asia War and are more determined in their belief in victory. At the same time, we firmly believe in the joint declaration of the conference. It will be the highest principle for the construction of a new world order in the future. And it will give a powerful warning to the world who are focusing their attention on San Francisco.

Further Discussion on the San Francisco Conference

Although the San Francisco Conference is being held today as scheduled, its essence has undergone a major change due to the death of Roosevelt. Roosevelt had always aimed at the world domination policy of American imperialism, and attempted to establish a new international organization that would take the lead of American imperialism in this war and after the war, so as to manipulate the politics and economy of the whole world and expand the hegemony of the United States. He used diplomatic strategies to capture Britain, and he used superior materials and tactics to limit the demands of the Soviet Union; from the Dumbarton Oaks Conference last year to the Crimea Conference this year, he forced Britain and the Soviet Union to submit, and prepared to realize his ambitions at the San Francisco Conference.

Now, although the San Francisco Conference is being held as scheduled, due to the death of Roosevelt, whether the United States can continue to maintain its position as the leader in the conference is a major question. The Soviet Union's opportunistic decision to send Foreign Minister Molotov to attend has obvious political significance that deserves attention. Regardless of how intensified the opposition between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union over the Polish issue on the eve of the conference, at least the dream that Roosevelt and his generation had of using the San Francisco Conference to induce the Soviet Union to participate in the East Asian war and strengthen the oppression of Japan, obviously has a sense of "changed circumstances".

The main task of the San Francisco Conference is to discuss the issue of post-war international security of peace, and to realize a new world organization dominated and monopolized by great powers. However, in Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, whose national systems are fundamentally different, it is inevitable that they will have different dreams and be outwardly united but inwardly divided in the future. This highly limits the application of the new organization; on the other hand, the new organization is controlled by the interests of the great powers, and will inevitably become an arena for the great powers to compete for interests, and will become a preparatory mechanism for the next war; we believe that the small nets of the world have read the joint statement of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference a few days ago, and they will definitely have some sudden realization!

As for the Chongqing representatives' participation in the conference, they not only cannot represent the ten hundred million people of East Asia, but in the self-serving competition among the great powers, what they gain is only being listed in the crowd! Rather than empty and unrealistic dreams, it is better to sincerely cooperate to promote the realization of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference's joint voice and resolutions!

### East Asia Establishes Permanent Peace Based on Morality: Chairman Chen Issues Statement

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency): Chairman Chen of the National Government went to North China on the 16th of this month to inspect general administrative affairs. After completing the inspection, he flew to Shanghai a few days ago. On the 24th, he returned to the capital by train from Shanghai. Foreign Minister Chu, Minister of Propaganda Zhao, and Chief Secretary Zhou, who accompanied him, also returned to the capital together.

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency): Chairman Chen issued the following statement on the San Francisco Conference: The San Francisco Conference was produced by the anti-Axis countries such as Britain and the United States after the Crimea Conference. The original intention was that the European war would end this spring, the world situation would gradually become clear, and this conference would be used to discuss the end of the war, as well as political aftermath issues, and especially the new mechanism for world peace. However, after detailed study of the effectiveness of this conference, it is difficult to be sure. Moreover, although the European war situation has been extremely urgent in recent days, the date of resolution is still far away. The Pacific war is still in progress, and it is absolutely impossible to have a winning chance. Since the war has not ended, the political posture after the war is difficult to imagine, and how can the aftermath problem be easily stated. At this conference, the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States have already caused considerable disputes over the voting rights and the issue of Poland's attendance. When the conference is held in the future, the arena will be full of competition, which is to be expected. As for the other small countries, they are mostly raised by Britain and the United States to enhance their momentum. In fact, they cannot immediately control the conference. Moreover, since the death of Roosevelt, although the successor to the foreign policy has declared that it will remain the same, the urgency and priority will be different from before, and the strength and weakness will also be different. In the previous conference, the focus was on Roosevelt, which is undoubtedly the case. Now that the candidates have been decided, who will be the leader will definitely require more twists and turns. In short, since the old world order can no longer be maintained and the war in the East and West Oceans has occurred, it is necessary to establish a new mechanism for maintaining peace in international affairs. The East Asian people love peace very much, but the peace they love is a truly and permanently lasting peace. The results of the San Francisco Conference are still likely to repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations. It is clearly obvious that it cannot establish a permanent peace mechanism to ensure international security. On the 23rd of this month, the allied country Japan convened the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference in Tokyo in order to eliminate the ambition of Britain and the United States to dominate the world and to complete the independence and liberation of the Greater East Asia countries. The conference proposed to establish the foundation of a new international mechanism for a new world order based on the principles of political equality, economic reciprocity, and respect for inherent culture and elimination of racial discrimination, which should be unanimously supported by the Greater East Asia countries. Since our country is established in East Asia, we should be resolute and strong, uphold our aspirations, and strive to achieve a reasonable and permanent peace in the world under the victory of the war. The San Francisco Conference is not yet sufficient to talk about this.

### San Francisco Conference Scheduled to Open Today

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to British sources: 1,200 delegates from the United Nations World Security Conference have gathered in San Francisco, and the conference is scheduled to open at 5 PM tomorrow. These delegates represent 46 countries. 18 other countries were not invited because they did not meet the qualifications for invitation, as they did not declare war on the Axis powers in accordance with the Yalta Conference and did not sign the United Nations Declaration. All delegates and local envoys stationed in various countries participated in the memorial service for Roosevelt. The Honduran Foreign Minister proposed that the San Francisco Conference should be renamed the Roosevelt Conference to express respect for the deceased US President.

Foreign Ministers of Three Countries Exchange Views

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports from Washington: The foreign ministers of the UK, US, and USSR held a meeting at the US Department of State yesterday. The British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kerr, and the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, were also present. No statement was issued after the meeting. As the San Francisco Conference is about to open, there is no doubt that the three countries exchanged views on the issues that have arisen since the Crimean Conference, particularly the Polish issue, which seemed to be the focus of discussion. The meeting is scheduled to continue today, but there is no confirmation as to whether the Chongqing representative will attend.

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: The British delegation attending the San Francisco Conference includes three cabinet members, five deputy ministers, and three representatives each from the Conservative and Labour parties, and one each from the Liberal and National Liberal parties. Halifax is also a cabinet member, but he is attending this time in his capacity as an ambassador.

### Construction of the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway: Engineering Office Established, Director Xu of the Construction Bureau Concurrently Serves as Director

Municipal authorities, in light of the reduced number of train services, believe that although the city has ships and automobiles for external transportation, the shortage of fuel is causing a daily decline in transportation. Moreover, many of the highways connecting various counties have fallen into disrepair over the years and are not fully passable. Furthermore, at a time when the city is actively relocating its population, transportation is a priority. Therefore, after consulting with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it was decided to jointly undertake the construction of the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway to ensure smooth passage. The plan has already been fully prepared. The city has established the Shanghai Special Municipality Shanghai-Suzhou Highway Engineering Office, with Director Xu of the Construction Bureau serving concurrently as director. Preparations are actively underway, and the office will soon begin operations.

Two Bridges on the Suzhou Creek Reopened

The Suzhou Creek West Xizang Road Bridge and Fujian Road Bridge, which had been closed by the Municipal Construction Bureau, have not yet been reopened. In order to improve traffic flow in the city, the bureau has repaired them, and they have now been fully completed. They will be reopened today (the 25th) to facilitate pedestrians. Only pedestrians are allowed to use the two bridges; vehicles are strictly prohibited.

Bicycle Registration Deadline Approaching

The Municipal Construction Bureau has decided to close the registration for this year's bicycle licenses at the end of this month. Citizens who own bicycles are urged to apply for registration as soon as possible within the specified period. Those who fail to register in accordance with the regulations by the deadline will be fined 500 yuan according to regulations upon discovery.

Changes to Fees for Loading and Unloading Materials

The Municipal Construction Bureau has determined that the current license fees for loading and unloading materials at the city's public docks are no longer in line with actual costs. Therefore, the regulations have been changed and approved by the municipal government. Effective immediately, each license will be charged 100 yuan in national currency. Merchants in the city who load and unload materials at municipal docks must comply with the regulations and pay the fees.

Unified Management of Long-Distance Buses

Long-distance bus companies operating in the suburbs of the city have flourished recently, especially on the Songjiang, Qingpu, and Shenjiang routes, with many daily services. It is learned that the Songjiang District Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, in order to unify management, has ordered all companies to register and has sent personnel to investigate their internal organization and structures in order to issue business licenses.

### Call for Citizens to Cooperate in Air Defense: Prevent Light from Leaking Outwards, Statement from Air Defense Headquarters

The city's air defense authorities, recognizing that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage and the danger of air raids is unavoidable, and that enemy aircraft have repeatedly raided Shanghai, believe that strengthening air defense is an urgent priority. Citizens should also make every effort to cooperate in air defense tasks. However, it has been observed that citizens' air defense equipment is not perfect. In the past, electric lights mostly had air defense lampshades, but as the power company has adjusted the use of electricity in order to conserve power, citizens have switched to using kerosene lamps or candles after 10 PM each night. These oil lamps and candles do not have air defense covers, which often leads to light leakage, which is highly inappropriate. Therefore, citizens are urged to be careful to prevent light from leaking outwards when using various types of lighting and to take appropriate measures. Not only should lights be turned off after hearing an air raid alarm, but also light must not leak outwards after dark at all times, as enemy aircraft may raid Shanghai at any time. Otherwise, once discovered by police officers, it will be treated as a violation of lighting control and punished severely according to regulations.

Statement from Air Defense Headquarters

The Air Defense Headquarters also issued a statement saying: "In this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the danger of air raids in the city is absolutely unavoidable. Citizens are often indifferent, and even harbor the despicable idea that the former concessions were 'safe areas,' so that they show no sense of urgency when encountering air raids and even adopt a detached attitude. Even if they reluctantly take shelter for air defense or cover the lights, it is only out of fear of punishment and is a perfunctory response, not an automatic action from within. They only seek to avoid being noticed, and during the day they may freely look up at the sky and watch the planes, and at night they have no qualms about turning on the lights, completely ignoring whether our actions or lights are being observed from above. It should be known that this behavior is extremely dangerous, not only related to the safety of individuals and their families, but also to the safety of neighbors and the entire city. Therefore, these people deserve harsh criticism and can be described as 'pests of air defense,' who are rejected by all citizens. Therefore, we must not only examine whether we have fulfilled our personal and family air defense responsibilities, but also prevent others from being irresponsible in order to reduce the damage from air raids. Therefore, we must absolutely pay attention to the following: first, during air raids, whether day or night, we must enter air raid shelters in an orderly manner and not watch on the roads; second, during air raids at night, we must not turn on lights or other lamps, and absolutely avoid light leakage to prevent unnecessary sacrifices."

### Municipal Finance Bureau Revises Regulations on Business Tax Collection

The Municipal Finance Bureau is levying this year's spring business tax in accordance with the provisions and tax rates in the "Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Business Tax," as revised on October 5th of the 32nd year of the Republic. Now, the bureau believes that many of the regulations are no longer suitable for the current situation, and has revised Article 6, Article 10 (the tax on capital has been raised by one level), Article 12, Article 23, Article 24, Article 27, Article 28, Article 29, and Article 35, and has submitted them to the municipal government for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for approval and to the Executive Yuan for record. In accordance with Article 11 of the regulations, "for business types not listed in the tax rate table but meeting the nature of business tax collection," a supplementary tax type table has been prepared based on the types of businesses in Shanghai and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and record. It is understood that the supplementary tax type table will be retroactively levied as soon as it is approved by the authorities. The revised regulations have been decided to be formally implemented starting this summer (i.e., April, May, and June). The regulations are transcribed below:

Chapter I: General Provisions

Article 1: These regulations are formulated in accordance with the provisions of the Business Tax Law, taking into account the nature and conditions of business in the city.

Article 2: All businesses operating in the city, except for factories that have paid factory tax to the central government or banks organized as joint-stock companies that have paid income tax, and those that have paid local taxes in the city, shall pay business tax in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.

Article 3: Business tax is levied on enterprises operating for profit, but agriculture is exempt. The foregoing provisions are limited to those with fixed business premises and manufacturing sites and shall not be levied on goods.

Article 4: The tax base for business tax collection in the city is temporarily limited to two types: total business revenue and business capital. The calculation of the total business revenue mentioned above shall be based on the total revenue for each quarter, and the calculation of the business capital shall be based on the actual capital used for business. Accumulated funds, etc., should be considered as capital. (To be continued)

### Construction of the Greater East Asia Ethnic Group's Ideal World Order: Director Matsudaira's Reflections on the Ambassadors' Conference

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japan Embassy held a routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Director Matsudaira of the Information Department expressed his reflections on the joint statement issued by the Ambassadors' Conference of the Greater East Asia nations, as follows:

Ideal World Order

The joint statement of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference discloses to the world everything that we Asians have wanted to say but dared not say for many years. I feel like a bird in a cage that has flown into the vast sky, and the darkness that remained in my mind has disappeared in an instant. The enemy, Britain and the United States, felt very threatened by the Greater East Asia Declaration in November of the previous year, fearing that the self-determination of the Greater East Asia people would be too fast. Therefore, they immediately held the Cairo Conference, dragging the Chongqing regime into their camp and creating an atmosphere of liberation for the Asian people. Subsequently, they went a step further, planning to create a world based on Britain and the United States, forcibly incorporating Asia into this world. The United States also fabricated an international organization plan with itself as the center, which it will force all countries to recognize at the San Francisco Conference, regardless of everything. However, the world order that the Greater East Asia countries have envisioned is completely different from the world order based on Britain and the United States, as compared in the following points:

British and American Concepts Put the Cart Before the Horse

Britain and the United States do not investigate the reasons for the outbreak of World War II, and only want to stop the war and establish peace. This is their fundamental shortcoming. The cause of this war is that Britain and the United States wanted to block the development opportunities of the Japanese, German, and Italian nations and artificially prevent their progress. On this point, the seventh item of the joint statement issued by the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference says: "Regarding the security guarantee mechanism, it is necessary to avoid the unilateral decision of the great powers and the unified method of the world, and to establish a security guarantee system that is suitable for the actual situation in the region, so that various world security mechanisms can be used together, and to adapt to the constantly evolving world situation, opening up the path for international order to change to peace." However, the Dumbarton Oaks international organization plan does not have this fundamental concept. It is like treating a disease without using a scalpel to remove the source of the disease, which is putting the cart before the horse.

Fundamental Concept of World Order

The fundamental concept of world order should be to seek happiness for all mankind. The three words "clothing, food, and housing" are not the only concern, but all mankind should also be satisfied in all aspects such as knowledge and thought. In other words, international equality is the fundamental concept. Therefore, we advocate that regardless of the size of the country, it must obtain political equality, economic protection, and respect for its inherent culture. However, what is expressed in the British and American international organization plan is completely the opposite. The great powers want to dominate the small countries, and the strong prey on the weak. The so-called international equality is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish.

Britain and the United States Exploit Various Colonies

Britain and the United States have always prided themselves on their countries because they have colonies to exploit. They use the sacrifices of the inhabitants of the colonies as their own exclusive enjoyment. In the future, they will use what they have squeezed from their own colonies to complete their post-war domestic reconstruction. Therefore, there are no regulations on colonies in their international organization plan. Before the San Francisco Conference, the United States stated that it was unwilling to discuss this issue, secretly still wanting to maintain the status quo of the colonies. The third item of the joint statement of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference says: "Liberate all ethnic groups in colonial status, so that each can contribute to the advancement of human civilization." By comparing this with the thinking of Britain and the United States, it is clear how self-serving their claims are and how they disregard the happiness of other ethnic groups.

Building a Truly Ideal Order

In short, the enormous sacrifices made by the nations of the world in order to complete this war must be for the sake of the evolution and development of mankind. This is something that British and American politicians have no trace of self-determination for. Disregarding the construction of an ideal world order, Britain and the United States still want to build a self-serving world order based on Britain and the United States. In order to smash such an unreasonable world order, we should continue to work hard, based on the spirit of international equality, and use the practical expression of blood and sweat to make Britain and the United States recognize our ideals.

### The Yang Changkang and Changxian Brothers Diligently Raise Significant Funds for Charitable Aid

Yang Changkang and Changxian are brothers from the Hongfa Jixiang Company. They are usually dedicated to charity, sparing no effort. Last year, when the Shanghai Home for the Aged was raising funds, Mr. Yang actively promoted and solicited donations. Moreover, in previous charity drives and various social causes sponsored by this newspaper, they generously contributed and took the lead in initiating support. Recently, they made an even grander vow to extensively provide convenience by raising a significant sum of three million five hundred thousand yuan. They delivered this to our offices, entrusting us to forward it to various charitable organizations. The Yang brothers' dedication to public service, righteousness, and courageous charitable acts is truly exemplary for society. We are recording their original letter as follows:

"Respected Sirs, my brother Changxian and I have raised donations totaling exactly three million five hundred thousand yuan.

"A list of the donors' titles is attached on the left."

"Luo Yuan, Broker No. 45 at the Chinese Securities Exchange No. 106, Li Da (mediated by Yang Changkang, Changxian, and Dong Laisun) - 500,000 yuan (specifically designated for the Student Loan Fund and Pushan Villa, 250,000 yuan each), Yang Changhe - 500,000 yuan, Lin Yegeng - 300,000 yuan, Zhu Mingyu and Zhu Wusheng - 200,000 yuan, Yongtai Company's Zhu Ronglin, Xu Zhiqin, and Jiang Hegeng - 200,000 yuan, Shi Qi (in memory of his deceased brother Xin) - 150,000 yuan, Zheng Chongwen, Xu Meifeng, Xincheng Company, Chen Pengnian, Kuang Canying, Li Ji, the above six organizations each donating 100,000 yuan. Ma Yulin, Zhang Ruguo, Zhang Ruguo and Yao Zhicheng, Sun Jingzhi, Liu Mingquan, Zhang Qingyu, Ding Shouzhen, Wang Jixian, Tongxinde, Ye Desheng, Yang Changgeng, the above ten organizations each donating 50,000 yuan, Wang Yongnian - 20,000 yuan, Que Wenrong - 10,000 yuan, Yang Changkang and Yang Changxian - 520,000 yuan. Respectfully, Yang Changkang and Yang Changxian."

(Note from this publication: We hope that all the charitable organizations listed above will provide official receipts for collecting the funds at our office.)

### Children's Savings Donated to Charity School Fund

A statement from the Student Self-Government Association of the Workers' Children School of the French Electric and Water Company: "We, students of our school, are deeply moved by your newspaper's establishment of charity schools. However, although we have a warm heart, most of our parents are impoverished workers. It is already difficult for us to continue our studies, let alone have surplus funds to express our enthusiastic hearts. However, for the sake of our country's future, we must save some money, even in hardship, to fulfill our responsibilities as children. Enclosed are various old textbooks and a donation of 8,680 yuan. Please acknowledge receipt. In addition, Ding Feiying, a student in the first grade, has donated 2,000 yuan individually, while students Lu Yongxiang and Wu Genbao each donated 500 yuan, setting an example for all students."

### Grand Performance of Prizes in the Wanshang Hall - Significant Funds Donated to the Home for the Aged

Recently, Mr. Li Ze, General Manager of the Xin Xin Company, sent a letter stating: "On the anniversary of the Xin Du Hotel's Wanshang Hall, various manufacturers generously donated valuable products for a prize drawing, which greatly aroused the interest of customers. Furthermore, the winning customers enthusiastically embraced public welfare, selling their prize winnings on the spot to support charitable causes. In addition to several instances where the proceeds from the charity sales were designated for the student aid funds of both Shen Bao and Xin Qin newspapers, last night, at the evening market, customer Mr. He Jialiang won the grand prize: a case of Benevolentor wine. He immediately put it up for charity sale, and it was purchased by Mr. Lu Zanming for 300,000 yuan. Subsequently, Mr. Lu resold the wine for charity, and it was purchased by Mr. Luo Mingshan for 100,000 yuan. A total of 400,000 yuan was raised from the charity sales. It is evident that the three gentlemen, He, Lu, and Luo, never forget to do good deeds, which is truly admirable. Our company, following the example of these gentlemen, has added 100,000 yuan, bringing the total to 500,000 yuan. We are sending this letter along with the donation to your newspaper, requesting that it be forwarded to the Home for the Aged to help with their expenses. We also hope that you will publish the charitable deeds of He, Lu, and Luo in your newspaper and the News Daily to encourage others."

Charity Performance by the Pude Society: The Shanghai Pude Society, in order to raise funds for providing medical consultations, medicine distribution, and charity school expenses, has specially requested the participation of movie and drama stars to hold a charity performance of dramas and songs.
