### Japan Has Absolute Confidence in Increasing Production of Special Attack Aircraft; Interview with Mitsubishi Representative

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Okinawa air battle has suddenly entered a state of melee since the 14th. However, Japanese special attack teams have successively broken into enemy fleets and carried out collision bombings, so the battle results can be confirmed one by one. At present, the loss of enemy aircraft carriers is quite significant. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the Ryukyu Islands, as of the 17th, totaled only one hundred and dozens, and the number of attacks on Okinawa Island, including land-based aircraft, totaled only three hundred and dozens. This proves that the enemy's naval and air power has gradually been suppressed by Japanese air attacks. However, the enemy can endure this unprecedented consumption and attempt to seize Okinawa with all their strength. On the 15th and 16th, about 100 carrier-based fighters attacked the Kyushu area. On the 17th and 18th, B28s were used to bomb the Kyushu area, carrying out tactical bombing. The B29s, which were previously used for strategic bombing, are now being used for tactical bombing, which proves that the enemy's naval forces in the Okinawa area have been weakened and cannot fully cooperate with the land battles. As for their carrier-based aircraft, they are attempting to cut off the source of Japanese mainland air power by repeatedly carrying out tactical bombing warfare. This enemy's fighting spirit cannot be ignored. Now, the Okinawa decisive battle has, thanks to the sacrifices of the Japanese special attack teams, created a good opportunity for Japan to make favorable progress. Whether or not this opportunity can be fully grasped depends on the strength of the enemy's will to fight and whether we can endure consumption and resupply. Since March 23rd, it has been confirmed that the Japanese side has sunk or destroyed about 400 enemy ships. If we calculate that three Japanese aircraft can sink one enemy ship, then Japan has lost 1,000 special attack aircraft. Therefore, regardless of whether the attempt to crush the enemy can be completely grasped, the situation will be even more serious for Japan if the final resupply is lacking. Therefore, Japan should increase the production of special attack aircraft and strive to resupply in order to seize the opportunity to reduce the enemy's strength. Regarding the increase in the production of special attack aircraft, according to Ishigami Kozo, a representative of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan: I am confident that I have absolute confidence in increasing the production of special attack aircraft and will never lose the good opportunity for pursuit warfare due to the production of aircraft. Historically, the warplanes, which are most valuable in the pursuit battle, have been proven. The current battle situation on Okinawa Island is indeed a good opportunity to destroy the enemy. We are determined to overcome any difficulties and transport good aircraft to the front line. Also, there is no need to worry about the sustainability of Japanese aircraft production, because wooden aircraft can be produced. Japan is geographically blessed with abundant wood resources. Furthermore, burning wood can extract gas, which can obtain good aviation fuel, and charcoal can be used as fuel for automobiles to ensure transportation capacity. From this point of view, the production of Japanese aircraft is quite optimistic. Even if the war lasts for 50 or 100 years, it is no problem. We are confident that the Divine Land will not perish and will fight to the end.

### Enemy American Fleet in Okinawa Plunged into Chaos; Minister Matsushima Elaborates on the Battle Situation

The Allied Japan Fleet Press Department held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by Minister Matsushima, Captain Matsudaira, and many newspaper reporters. Minister Matsushima elaborated on the battle situation on Okinawa Island, stating that the enemy American fleet has been plunged into extreme chaos due to heavy losses. Secondly, the US Navy budget for 1946 has been reduced compared to the past, which indicates that its resources and manpower have been severely hit. The main points of the speech are recorded below:

Japanese Forces Launch Offensive on Okinawa

Since the 11th, Japanese land, sea, and air forces have continuously launched fierce attacks on the enemy mobile units in the waters around Okinawa Island. As of the 17th, the battle results were as follows: 393 enemy ships were sunk or destroyed, which is an unprecedented victory. In particular, five enemy aircraft carriers were sunk on the 16th and 17th. Such a great victory will have a great impact on future operations. However, although the enemy Americans have suffered a large number of casualties, they continue to replenish the front line from the rear. Before the 16th, the enemy had gathered about 12 to 14 aircraft carriers. During the 16th and 17th, the Japanese Navy destroyed more than half of the remaining enemy American aircraft carriers. This kind of damage has a significant impact on future mobile warfare. In order to save this critical situation, the enemy is using B29 aircraft to bomb the Japanese mainland, and B24 aircraft are being launched from Iwo Jima, hoping to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and Okinawa Island through bombing. According to our judgment, the number of enemy first-line and rear forces, excluding aircraft carriers, gathered in the waters around Okinawa Island is as follows: 5 to 7 battleships, 10 to 13 cruisers, about 20 destroyers, about 20 minesweepers, and 80 transport ships. In addition, there seem to be three aircraft carriers and more than five battleships near Uruchi, and all ships have been severely damaged. In land battles, the enemy has suffered repeated and heavy casualties on the southern front due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. On the northern front, the elite Japanese forces, which have been silent for a long time, have already launched an offensive on the Motobu Peninsula. This is known from enemy reports. Therefore, the current battle situation is at a major turning point, and the enemy is in extreme chaos due to unexpected losses. Their reports do not mention the situation of the naval battle at all, which shows how terrible the losses they suffered.

Truman's Flattering Attitude Towards the Soviet Union

US President Truman, in his first meeting with reporters on the 17th, expressed the United States' concern for the Soviet Union in various ways. At the same time, he also indicated the amount of US military supplies lent to the Soviet Union. Truman's flattering attitude towards the Soviet Union is evident. The weapons that the United States lent to the Soviet Union from October 1941 to February 1942 totaled 8.225 billion US dollars, which is 32 percent of the military supplies provided to the United Nations. The number of aircraft was about 13,000. The United States always relies on material resources in everything it does, so we must pay close attention to its political and strategic policies in the future.

Naval Budget Reduced Significantly

The US House of Representatives submitted a report on the naval budget for 1946 on the 17th of this month, which amounted to 23.4052333 billion US dollars, a decrease of 5.1 billion yuan compared to last year. The US Navy has suffered a large number of ship losses, but its budget for the next year has been reduced, which shows its lack of resources and manpower.

Post-War Ambitions of the US Navy

US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal said: The United States must maintain at least 5,830 ships after the war. General King, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, insisted that the United States should retain the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands in the Pacific. Therefore, it is clear what kind of hopes the United States has for the Pacific after the war. Secondly, the strength of the US Pacific Fleet has not been comprehensively announced, but it is estimated that about three to five formal aircraft carriers and about ten special aircraft carriers are used as the basic force. Those operating in the waters of the Ryukyu Islands are a mobile force composed of two aircraft carriers and several battleships. On the 17th of this month, the New York Times published an explanation by Hanson Baldwin, which stated: The British fleet will soon launch an offensive from Myanmar, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra in the Indian Ocean towards Singapore. This kind of operation depends on the level of activity of the British fleet. Now that the British fleet has suffered great losses in the Ryukyu Islands, it is doubtful whether the above plan can be realized.

Chongqing Air Force Very Active Recently

On the mainland, the Chongqing Air Force has been very active recently. The area north of the Henan-Hankou Railway, the Yangtze River basin to the south, and the area along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway are all within its range of activity. The Chongqing Air Force is bombing its own territory and destroying the lives and property of its own people. This is done by a group of "American faction" pilots who came from the United States at the end of last year. This move, compared with the American ambitions for China after the war, makes it impossible to understand their psychology. On the 8th of this month, Nimitz Headquarters announced that the US military is still conducting mopping-up operations on Iwo Jima, which shows that the Japanese army is fighting bravely and exerting its spirit of sacrifice to repay the country even when it is down to the last man.

Editorial

### Prospects for the Battle of Berlin

The development of the European war situation is gradually approaching its climax. Although Berlin is on the eve of a storm, the German military and civilians have already made preparations for the inevitability of the Battle of Berlin. Combining recent dispatches from various sources, it can be known that the Battle of Berlin has already begun.

From the perspective of the political and strategic policies of the United Nations, today's Battle of Berlin will be regarded as a re-enactment of the general offensive on the Hindenburg Line in September 1918. The battle on the Hindenburg Line was the last battle of World War I. The general staff of the Allied powers, led by Britain and the United States, still harbor the ambition to relive their old dreams. The explicit announcement of the time and location of the San Francisco Conference at the Crimean Conference in February this year can also reflect this ambition of the supreme command of the anti-Axis powers. They plan to end the European war around April 20 and convene an Allied conference in San Francisco on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean on the 25th. Looking at the situation after the Crimean Conference, on the eastern front in Europe, the Soviet army has been inactive at the Kustrin Fortress, the eastern gateway to Berlin, waiting for the advance of the American, British, and Canadian forces on the western front, so as to approach Berlin at the same distance of tens of kilometers as the eastern front, before launching a general offensive on Berlin again recently. The above-mentioned political and strategic policies of the anti-Axis powers are already clear.

However, although the situation in Berlin is tense, the supreme command in Berlin has not shown any panic. Leader Hitler encouraged the soldiers on the 17th of this month, pointing out that "there is always the possibility of a change in the war," and ordered "anyone who orders a retreat will be arrested on the spot regardless of their rank, and if necessary, will be executed on the spot." His determination to carry out the Battle of Berlin and not allow the enemy to easily obtain Berlin and realize the predetermined plan can already be seen from this. However, the enemy's scheduled date for converging in Berlin is only a few days away. The Soviet army's fierce attack of more than 450 shells in two hours is precisely to show the anxiety of the anti-Axis powers about the Battle of Berlin. However, a quick victory and quick decision are often impossible in fact. It is inevitable that Berlin will hold out until after April 25.

Secondly, the outcome of the Battle of Berlin, no matter what, cannot be compared with the Battle of the Hindenburg Line in 1918. Today, the entire territory of Germany does not yet have the conditions that made it impossible not to surrender in 1918. The background of the Battle of the Hindenburg Line at that time was a large-scale famine throughout Germany, and the front line lost the support of manpower and material resources. On the other hand, the enemy strengthened its combat power with the participation of the American fresh troops. But today in Germany, everyone is united, and the will to defend the motherland is still very strong. Although the front-line situation is serious, the manpower and material resources needed by the soldiers to persist are still being replenished continuously. "People's assault teams" to protect the government are spread all over the place. Therefore, the situation today and in the past is very different.

Because of the above-mentioned reasons, no matter what the outcome of the Battle of Berlin, it will not be the last battle of the Second European War. The German nation will be as Leader Hitler declared on the 17th of this month: "If the soldiers on the eastern front can do their duty, then their offensive will inevitably collapse, and the enemy on the western front will perish with them." What's more, the German counterattacks in the Elbe River and other places have already begun! As for the war in Europe and the war in East Asia, the situation is even more different. Therefore, anyone who uses the situation in Europe to create rumors about the situation in East Asia is simply meddling. In short, at this stage of the world's total decisive battle, we must have a calm observation, respond calmly, and not be confused by rumors. And we must clearly recognize and prevent the enemy's conspiracy to create rumors.

### Enemy Landing on Ie Island; Japanese Forces Intercepting; No Change in Okinawa Land Battles

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - There is no change in the land battles on Okinawa Island. The enemy still seems to be preparing fiercely to attack the Japanese army's land positions. For this reason, the Japanese army has been bravely stepping forward day and night to launch repeated surprise attacks, or waiting for a good opportunity to strengthen the counterattack, inflicting great casualties on the enemy. The brave and daring fighting is currently underway. On the other hand, the enemy's ambition for the Chinen Peninsula is gradually exposed, and its actions are becoming more active. Also, on the morning of the 16th, an enemy fleet based on battleships gradually approached the Motobu Peninsula and fired fiercely and bombarded Ie Island with naval guns. Subsequently, about 100 boats landed on Ie Island. The current strength is about 80 tanks and 1,000 soldiers. They are currently being intercepted by the Japanese garrison troops, and fierce fighting is underway. As of the 17th, the confirmed battle results were: more than 100 soldiers killed or wounded, and nine tanks set on fire. Furthermore, the enemy is using the two airfields in the north and central parts of the island more actively. Most of the aircraft used are carrier-based aircraft such as F6Fs and F4Vs. Because the aircraft carriers were bombed, a considerable number of aircraft were unable to return to the ship. The Japanese air force continues to attack these two airfields fiercely, and is currently suppressing them.

Central Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese air force has been relentlessly and continuously launching fierce attacks on the enemy American forces invading Okinawa Island. On the afternoon of the 17th, an air battle occurred with enemy carrier-based aircraft over the southern part of the Okinawa Islands, shooting down one of them. The remaining aircraft immediately fled. Furthermore, on the same day, they carried out a night raid on the airfield in the northern part of Okinawa Island, and several places were hit and caught fire. On the 18th, the Japanese air force fiercely attacked the enemy fleet east of Okinawa and the Kerama Islands, braving fierce anti-aircraft fire, and launched a large-scale bombing after breaking into the Kerama Islands. After that, the Japanese air force attacked the enemy fleet all night. As a result, the number of enemy attacking aircraft has been significantly reduced. It is easy to imagine what the damage to the enemy's aircraft carriers is.

### Total Japanese Naval and Air Offensive Greatly Threatens the Enemy

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese army has carried out a total of three general offensives by the air force to wipe out the enemy mobile units around Okinawa Island. The attack on the 6th was the first time, the 12th was the second time, and the 16th was the third time. In these two general offensives, the Japanese navy and air force acted in unison, dispatching a large number of special attack teams and mine-bombing teams to continuously launch fierce attacks. In particular, the large-scale dispatch of special attack teams was the most distinctive feature. As of now, the combined battle results show that the enemy has suffered damage totaling 400 enemy ships sunk or destroyed, which is an unprecedented achievement since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. Since this world war, it is the first time that the enemy has suffered such heavy blows in its forced landing operations on the eastern and western battlefields. The enemy Americans, who rely solely on their material resources to maintain their naval power, ensure air and sea dominance, and attempt to actively achieve the goal of capturing Okinawa Island, have already become a fantasy.

### Japanese Army Ministry Announces Commendation of Five Brave Warriors

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 19th that five members of the special attack team's flight squadron, including Army Second Lieutenant Tsurumi Kunishiro, Kamimiya Kenji, Army Sergeant Aomoto Kenji, Army Corporal Yoshino Yoshizumi, and Fuhisaka Hiroo, were awarded commendations for crashing into enemy ships in the sea near the Southwest Islands in the past. This time, it was also reported to the Emperor.

Detailed battle results are currently under investigation.

Taipei, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Throughout the 19th, about 80 enemy bombers and about 20 fighters took off from bases on the island and attacked Hsinchu Prefecture. After dropping bombs in Hsinchu City, they fled south at around 3:00 PM. Also, at around 9:00 AM on the 18th, about nine enemy bombers and more than 30 fighters from the Philippine Island base attacked the area north of central Taiwan several times, bombing and strafing Taichung, Tainan, Hualien Port, and some bombing and strafing trains, cities, and factories. Japanese losses were extremely light.

Southwest Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - On the evening of the 18th, 17 enemy large and medium-sized aircraft attacked Balikpapan.

Southern Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - On the 16th, more than 80 enemy B24 and P38 aircraft attacked Bougainville. The Japanese troops stationed there launched an intercepting attack, inflicting considerable damage on them. The enemy aircraft then fled.

### Japanese Army in New Guinea Attacks Mar Airport

Southern Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese combat unit on the northern coast of western New Guinea attacked the enemy's Sangsapor enemy positions on the front line of the enemy Mal airfield on the night of February 20th and completely occupied the position, and was able to control the Mal airfield. Subsequently, after reconnaissance by the Japanese air force, it was learned that several places on the runway of the Mal airfield had been damaged, and only a part of the buildings remained. Therefore, the enemy has completely abandoned the airfield. Also, there are currently several enemy large aircraft at the Gemini Island airfield, but the hope of using them is very weak.

### Britain and the United States Decide to Divide Operational Areas in the Pacific

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to enemy sources, the areas of responsibility for Pacific operations by Britain, the United States, and other countries have recently been decided. Myanmar, the Malay Peninsula, and Borneo belong to Britain, the former Dutch East Indies belong to the Netherlands, and the various islands in the Pacific, including the Philippines, are the responsibility of the United States. This decision can be observed in two ways: one is that the United States is unable to cope with the Japanese attacks alone, and the other is that it has the intention of dividing the spoils.

### Guangdong Circles Express Condolences to Bombing Victims

Guangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The committee for expressing condolences to bombing victims from all circles, together with the political affairs propaganda team, went to various disaster areas to inspect the situation.

### Minister Zhou Sent Personnel Yesterday to Thoroughly Investigate Stock Exchange Accounts to Investigate the Reasons for the Soaring Stock Market

Minister of Finance Zhou believes that the recent violent fluctuations in the Shanghai Stock Exchange have led to an increasingly fierce rise in stock prices. Some stocks have risen irrationally, exceeding the value of their assets by more than double. It is inevitable that unscrupulous merchants are driving up prices, and the stock exchange authorities are responsible. In particular, since the exchange began its trial of convenient transactions, speculation has been triggered, and stock prices have fluctuated. However, the participants in the exchange have become increasingly complex. Therefore, in addition to instructing the stock exchange to suspend convenient stock transactions, Minister Zhou specially sent Lu Congming, supervisor of the Stock Exchange, Li of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, Zhang Guru, the inspection team leader, and Xu Jiang, director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau, to the Stock Exchange together at 10:00 AM on the 19th to personally thoroughly investigate the recent transaction accounts of various brokers and the actual reasons for the recent soaring stock market, in order to determine how to deal with the situation.

Strictly Prohibiting Outsiders from Entering the Market for Transactions

The Office of the Supervisor of the Shanghai Stock Exchange of the Ministry of Finance issued a notice stating: "This market is a place where various brokers and their agents gather to buy and sell on behalf of customers. Other personnel are not allowed to enter the market for transactions. From now on, except for registered brokers or their agents, market affairs personnel, supervising personnel from this office, and specially dispatched investigators from other relevant agencies, other personnel are strictly prohibited from entering the market. All personnel in the market are not allowed to entrust brokers or their agents to conduct securities trading. Once discovered, they will be severely punished."

In the urban area, the bureau has formed several mobile teams, which will be stationed at various transportation hubs every day from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM to carry out the work. The locations and dates of the mobile team's work from April 20th to 30th are listed below. Citizens are urged to pay attention and promptly request inoculation to avoid contracting the disease. Jurisdiction of the Taishan Road Branch Bureau: Nanyang Bridge Iron Gate, Ziyang Road Iron Gate, Yongtai Road Iron Gate.

Certificates Remain the Same

As usual, upon completion of the inoculation, the cholera prevention inoculation personnel should issue a certificate as proof. It is understood that the format of this year's cholera prevention inoculation certificate is the same as last year, and the validity period is three months. In the past, there have been cases of private transfer of such certificates. This year, the authorities will strictly supervise this, and those who violate the regulations printed on the certificate will be severely punished.

Exemptions from Inoculation

The standard dosage for inoculation is as follows: Adults 1.0 cc, 10 to 15 years old 0.5 cc, 7 to 10 years old 0.3 cc, under 7 years old 0.2 cc.

B, Those with beriberi, heart disease, or kidney disease with edema, but must have a doctor's certificate to be exempted from inoculation. C, Pregnant women (especially in the early stages of pregnancy, three to four months). D, Others whom the doctor deems unsuitable for inoculation. To prevent liability arising from inoculation, doctors must have medications such as cardiotonics prepared in advance.

Travel Report

### Governor Hao Pengju Discusses Welcoming Factories to Relocate to Huaihai; Travelogue of Huaihai, Part 3

— Yifei

The prerequisite for all administrative reforms is a solid economic foundation and public order. Regarding this point, Governor Hao Pengju said: "Huaihai Province's economy is based on agricultural production. Wheat is the main crop, with an annual output of 1,087,245 tons. Soybeans have an annual output of 288,365 tons, mung beans have an annual output of 46,670 tons, and sorghum has an annual output of 219,029 tons. Sugarcane has an annual output of 725,634 tons. These are all very important. Taking wheat as an example, three crops can be harvested in two years, with a yield of 500 jin per mu. Although Huaihai has a continental climate, it is moderated by the marine climate, so it can have a good harvest. The annual surplus grain is about 500,000 tons. Therefore, the rural economy is still good, and the farmers' lives are quite wealthy. The taxes they pay to the government account for only 4 to 7 percent of their total income.

"In terms of prices, they are about half the price compared to the northern and southern provinces. The provincial government's policy of suppressing prices is to use political power to unite merchants and purchasing people together, so Huaihai's prices have not soared. In short, Huaihai Province's economy is very stable. In fact, it can be described as 'rich people and poor officials.'

"In terms of public order, although Huaihai is in a difficult environment, it has maintained public order and has not deteriorated. In terms of defense works, more than 1,170 large and small strongholds have been built. There are tens of thousands of well-trained troops stationed in the strongholds. With their excellent quality, they can fight against the enemy at a ratio of one to six. The military supplies industry is also very developed. Clothing, equipment, leather, military food, and equipment repair can all be self-sufficient. There are also thorough arrangements for communication construction. Recently, to implement the legal warfare system, a general mobilization of manpower, material resources, and spirit has been implemented, so that every person and every thing in Huaihai can meet the needs of the war. In terms of air defense, in addition to air raid shelters built everywhere, Xuzhou City has also organized a police defense corps. The members of the corps are selected by merchants and civilians themselves and strictly trained. The total number is about ten thousand. In addition, there are nearly a thousand firefighters, divided into ten teams. Therefore, the public order of Huaihai can be said to be stable."

Regarding the issue of dispersing Shanghai's industries to Huaihai Province, Hao expressed his great welcome. He replied:

"As the war approaches the decisive stage, the industries in Shanghai and along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, although they have complete equipment, are suffering due to a lack of raw materials, power restrictions, high labor costs, and transportation obstacles. However, in the newly born Huaihai Province, these are not problems:

"Raw Materials: Huaihai Province is naturally endowed with abundant agricultural products, as mentioned earlier. The minerals buried underground are even more astonishing, comparable to the Ukraine in Russia. The main ones are valuable phosphate rock (produced in Haizhou) and iron, manganese, sand, mica, coal, etc. The water fruits include pears, grapes, pomegranates, etc. Therefore, wineries, canneries, oil mills, tanneries, glass factories, and alcohol factories are most suitable for relocating to our province.

"Power: Huaihai produces abundant coal, and the coal produced by the Liquan and Gushan coal mines can be supplied in large quantities. There is a power station in Liquan, and the electricity is sufficient to supply the needs of factories throughout Huaihai Province. Therefore, electricity is not a problem.

"Labor: Huaihai Province is located between central and northern China, governing two cities (Xuzhou and Haizhou) and twenty counties, with a population of about 13 million. Because of the low cost of living, labor costs are very low, and there are many strong young men. Currently, there are few factories in our province. If a large number of factories move to Huaihai, there will be no labor problems. The only thing is that technical training needs to be strengthened.

"Recently, our province has established an 'Industrial Development Association,' which is jointly run by the government and merchants. The main task is to assist in the development of industry. If the factory owners have insufficient capital, this agency can assist in subsidizing 40% of the total capital. If the factories on the Nanjing-Shanghai line are dispersed to Huaihai, this agency can be fully responsible for assistance in terms of transportation, capital, factory site, labor, and fuel." At this point, the topic turned to the provincial government's construction policy. (To be continued)

### Wang Maoting, the Main Culprit in the Gambling Den Case, Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment; Verdict Announced Yesterday in the Russian Emigrant Association Gambling Den Case

The Xincheng Police Station cracked a gambling den in the Russian Emigrant Association at No. 147 Weihaiwei Road on February 24th of this year. Wang Maoting, Han Huaqing, Li Xiulan, Ping Fugeng, and other 32 people were arrested, along with more than a hundred gamblers, and were all transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. Except for the gamblers, who were all given a fine of 5,000 yuan each, the other 32 people, including Wang Maoting, were all prosecuted according to the law. The case was tried by Yin Gongjia, the presiding judge of the criminal court of the District Court, on the 12th of this month. The final verdict was announced yesterday: Wang Maozu was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for gathering a crowd to gamble, and one year and six months of imprisonment for bribery, to be served for two years. Han Huaqing was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The remaining 30 employees of the gambling den, including Li Xiulan and Ping Danggen, were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment and fined 2,000 yuan. The imprisonment can be commuted to a fine of 15 yuan per day.

### Lao Zha Branch Bureau Cracks Gambling Den

The municipal authorities, in order to thoroughly eliminate gambling, resolutely closed the gambling dens in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts. However, the bad guys are still trying to revive and disperse their activities, secretly setting up gambling dens in the central area or opening rooms in hotels, gathering people to gamble, which is illegal. The authorities have cracked down on several places, including the "Russian Emigrant Association" and South Chongqing Road. The Lao Zha Branch Bureau, because there are many public places in the area under its jurisdiction, where gambling is inevitable, decided to take vigorous measures to ban and crack down on gambling. It ordered the police to conduct a thorough investigation. It was found that a certain public official opened Room 435 in the Jie Shi Hotel on Yunnan Road, gathering people to gamble, with very frequent traffic, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan a day. Xu Minshou, the director of the branch bureau, personally led Deputy Director Sato, Third Section Chief Song Bingzheng, police officers Feng Xiushan, and detectives Xian Zhongming and others to the above-mentioned location at about 9:00 PM on the night before (the 18th). They first surrounded the entire fourth floor and then broke into the room, where more than a hundred gamblers were caught in the act of gambling. The gambling tools and gambling money were confiscated and taken to the bureau for investigation. Yesterday, Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government ordered that the case be handled in accordance with the "Russian Emigrant Association" gambling den case. All the gamblers were released on bail, and the owners, staff, and hotel tea servants were all remanded and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Before the gamblers were released on bail, Xu Minshou, the director of the branch bureau, gave them a detailed lecture, explaining the authorities' intention to ban gambling, and warned them that there must be no similar behavior again, otherwise, they would be severely punished according to the law.

### Adjustment of Bicycle License Fees by the Finance Bureau

The Municipal Finance Bureau has re-adjusted the fee rates for various vehicle licenses. The following is a list of bicycle license fees:

New Registration: Registration fee 750 yuan, license fee 100 yuan, license plate fee 375 yuan (the above is administrative income on behalf of the Bureau of Construction), license stamp 600 yuan, small license plate fee 100 yuan, totaling 1.925 yuan.

Lost License: Lost license fee 300 yuan, license plate fee 375 yuan, inspection and stamp fee 80 yuan (the above is administrative income on behalf of the Bureau of Construction), license stamp fee 600 yuan, small license plate fee 100 yuan, totaling 1.455 yuan.

For the above items, except for the receipts issued for administrative income on behalf of the Bureau of Construction, for the license stamp fee and small license plate fee collected by the Finance Bureau, because the bureau's regulations stipulate the use of stamps, only the amounts are noted separately on the vehicle license, and stamped as proof, without issuing separate receipts.
