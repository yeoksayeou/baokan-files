### The Fortieth Army Memorial Day: Japanese Minister of the Army's Address to the Entire Army, Urging Unity Between Military Officers and Civilians to Overcome Difficult Times

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the occasion of the fortieth Army Memorial Day in Japan, Army Minister Sugiyama issued a proclamation to all officers and soldiers, stating: "The enemy forces will inevitably invade our homeland. We must unite as one, uphold our conviction of certain victory, defend the imperial land, crush the enemy's ambitions, and prolong the life of the imperial nation." It is noted that this is the first time since the army's founding that such a proclamation has been issued by the Minister of the Army. The gist of the proclamation is as follows: On this, the fortieth Army Memorial Day, amidst an unprecedented war situation, reflecting on the past fills us with profound emotion. The war situation intensifies daily, and the enemy, eager to end the war, is pouring all their efforts into attacking us. They are single-minded in their objective, disregarding any means, even resorting to the atrocity of violating our Imperial Palace and the Sacred Shrine. We are filled with utmost indignation. The enemy further claims to reform our national polity to bring about the collapse of our empire. This is something we can never tolerate. Observing recent trends in the war situation, the enemy's intention to invade our homeland is very clear. Our army, under the personal leadership of His Majesty the Emperor, will demonstrate its long-standing traditional spirit. We are now on the verge of defending our divine land. The entire army, both at home and abroad, must unite to thwart the enemy's ambitions and ensure the prosperity and longevity of our nation. Past victories were the result of the utmost sincerity and loyalty of our officers and soldiers. The special attack spirit of the army's soldiers serves as an example. Let us unite as one, fulfill our duties as soldiers, and thoroughly annihilate the enemy. In the thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth years of the Meiji era, through the painstaking efforts of our predecessors, we overcame a perilous crisis and ensured the safety of our imperial nation. Throughout the three thousand years since the founding of our nation, the reason our country remains intact is due to the glorious achievements of our ancestors. Today, as all officers and soldiers reflect upon this, they should strive even harder. Our one hundred million citizens should rally around the army as the core, gather our collective strength, strengthen our resolve, and display the spirit of unity between military officers and civilians to overcome these difficult times, so that our ancestors may rest in peace and our imperial nation remains as solid as a rock."

Chief Matsumura's Broadcast

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Matsumura, Chief of the Army Press Section of the Imperial Headquarters, gave a broadcast on the 9th entitled "Celebrating the Fortieth Army Memorial Day," saying: "The war situation has progressed to the stage of a decisive battle on our homeland, which is something we have anticipated. In past long wars, we often approached a crisis point in the fourth year. Drawing on historical facts such as the Seven Years' War of King Frederick the Great and the breakthrough of difficult situations by Clemenceau during the First World War, we can see that they all consistently used the effort of certain victory as the backdrop of their conviction of certain victory. They overcame all difficulties and persevered to the end, ultimately achieving a glorious final victory. Therefore, when attacking, soldiers become human bullets; when defending, soldiers become living fortresses. The imperial army declares its confidence and determination to open up this difficult situation with national unity and the single-mindedness of one hundred million people, for the day of sacrificing oneself bravely is already before us."

### Emulate the Spirit of Allied Armies to Fulfill the Mission of Revitalizing China - Minister Xiao Inspires Soldiers

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Minister of the Army, Xiao Shuxuan, recently delivered a speech on the occasion of the Allied Armies Memorial Day, inspiring our army compatriots to be proactive in fulfilling their responsibilities to revitalize China and protect Asia. The main points are as follows: "Army Day has great significance in the history of the Japanese Army. On this day forty years ago, the elite troops of the Japanese Empire, in order to defend their country, established great achievements and glorious war records on the fertile lands of Greater East Asia, fully demonstrating the Bushido spirit and loyalty to the emperor and love for the country of the Yamato people. Therefore, today's Army Day is truly worthy of our recalling the meritorious achievements established by the Japanese samurai forty years ago. As the Greater East Asia War of Defense intensifies, the Allied soldiers are gradually completing the strategy of bloody battles. I am confident that the elite troops of the Japanese Empire will be able to further complete the sacred mission of defending Greater East Asia by defending their own country. While celebrating the Japanese Army Day, we should also wish for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Here, we look forward to the soldiers of our national army, with the belief that all ethnic groups in East Asia live and die together, fighting side by side with the Allied forces, with loyal courage and boiling blood, following the Japanese Empire's army, jointly shouldering the great task of defending East Asia, in order to realize the Father of the Nation's legacy of Pan-Asianism and complete the mission of China's freedom. Chinese loyal and brave army soldiers! The Japanese elite army is a good example for us. The stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade. May all Chinese soldiers be of one heart and one mind, strive to realize the lofty ideals of the Father of the Nation, and build a glorious historical site in the history of the Greater East Asia Revival. 'The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard.' All my army compatriots, do not forget this vigilant instruction."

### Press Chief Mishiina Discusses the Current War Situation of Japanese Forces in Various Regions: The Enemy's Attempt at a Quick Victory is Doomed to Failure

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Lieutenant Colonel Mishiina, Press Chief of the Japanese General Army, met with a delegation of Chinese journalists in the capital on the 9th, elaborating in detail on the current war situation in various regions. As it was the 40th anniversary of the Japanese Army, his remarks were particularly significant. The original text of the interview is recorded as follows:

On the Mainland:

The situation on the mainland: the enemy's movements on the mainland seem to be declining on the surface. Chiang Kai-shek's side is actively planning a general counter-offensive in order to echo the American military offensive in the Pacific. It is said that 200,000 soldiers are currently being trained in the Kunming area, and each war zone has also changed its spinning to a large-scale war system, and is trying to improve its supplies. It is expected that once the deployment is complete, the general offensive will begin. This time, the spirit of Chongqing's army reorganization, emphasizing quality, is heard. It is estimated that 400,000 people will be mobilized, and the purpose of this mobilization is twofold: 1. to deal with the Japanese army, and 2. to deal with Yan'an. It is possible that mechanized units will be incorporated into the new army. The American air force stationed in Chongqing has recently dispatched aircraft to conduct roaming bombings of Jinan and Qingdao, especially concentrating on military facilities and transportation lines in North China. There are only about 1,000 American air force aircraft in Chongqing. The first transport team on the Ledo Road arrived in Kunming on February 4. The center of the war in Burma is Mandalay. The Chongqing army is currently returning from the front line to defend, and the Japanese army in Kunming is currently facing them on the Irrawaddy River. The enemy's air power is increasing daily, and they have begun to attack the Japanese army's front line and rear.

Various Southern Regions:

The war situation in the south: In Luzon, the Japanese army is conducting a bloody battle, causing them to suffer heavy losses. The Japanese army adopted a bloody battle method and engaged in a protracted war. The enemy adopted a infiltration tactic, forcing the Japanese army from the northwestern mountains. By the end of January, the enemy's casualties had reached as many as 60,000 to 70,000. On Iwo Jima: Five enemy divisions landed, and the battle was extremely fierce. The Japanese army was determined to fight to the end, so the enemy's losses were extremely heavy. As of March 5, the enemy's personnel casualties had reached 20,000, and more than 250 tanks had been destroyed. Air Control Over Japan: The enemy used mobile units or B29 aircraft from the Heliana air base to attack the Japanese mainland, with the aim of directly assisting the Iwo Jima operation, cutting off the Japanese army's supply line to Iwo Jima, and secondly, to attack Japanese air bases, bombing aircraft on the ground, aircraft manufacturing plants, and transportation lines. Each time the enemy blindly dropped bombs, causing some casualties to civilians, but the people not only did not waver because of this, but instead strengthened their determination to kill the enemy. Therefore, in the vicinity of Tokyo and Kyushu, there are special attack units organized to intercept the American air force head-on.

Mainland Landing Operation:

Whether the American army plans to land on Iwo Jima, or to land on the Chinese mainland, or to land on the Japanese mainland, people are paying close attention to it. It is predicted that if the United States occupies Iwo Jima, in order to cut off the connection between the mainland and the South Seas traffic and to aid Chongqing, it may use Iwo Jima as a forward base, and use mobile and Mariana B29 air force to prepare for a landing on the Japanese mainland. Therefore, it is inferred that in the future, a landing attack will occur on Chichi Jima or Haha Jima or the Ryukyu Islands (Southwest Islands). According to this trend, it does not seem that there is a tendency to land on the Chinese mainland. If the enemy American lands on the Chinese mainland, it will have to fight to the death with the invincible million Japanese army, and the bloodshed will be significant, so they will definitely adopt a roundabout operation instead of dispatching a large army like in Europe, and will not land in Japan on the one hand and land on the mainland at the same time. Because the enemy American can use no more than ten divisions for landing this year. The Japanese army has a strong deployment in various coastal areas of China. If the enemy army lands in China, the dispatched army will be able to fight with all its strength and give a major blow to it. Therefore, the dispatched army hopes that the enemy army will be able to land a large number of troops in China, but in order to avoid its major losses, I am afraid that it will not dare to make this big mistake.

European Side:

On the Eastern Front, German and Soviet troops are facing each other on both banks of the Warta River. The Soviet Union is holding four to five bridgeheads as bases on the west bank, and there has been no progress to date. On the Western Front, part of the British and American joint forces have broken through the Siegfried Line, and its front has reached the Rhine River, but the German army has recently resisted more fiercely, and its defense has been stronger than before. Before the San Francisco Conference, because the United States wanted to grasp the post-war peace mechanism in order to fulfill its ambition to be called the new world, there was a proposal to hold the San Francisco Conference on April 25. All small countries that declared war on the Axis before the beginning of March could participate. Now Turkey and various small countries in South America have been forced by threats and have declared war on Japan and Germany. Roosevelt's failure at the Crimea Conference will be taken back at the San Francisco Conference, but Spain and Portugal have not been moved by it, and Tergoth has explicitly refused to participate, so Roosevelt's ambition has another layer of obstacles. Regarding the United States, there is quite a bit of bitterness from the lack of manpower. According to the current population of the United States, its military mobilization and industrial mobilization have reached the saturation point. The number of deaths and injuries, as of February 22, was announced by Stimson as 800,000, which must be nothing more than a reduced announcement. According to Japanese statistics, as of last year, there were 1.6 million, and in the South Seas Islands, those who could not participate in the battle due to disease and other illnesses also exceeded 800,000. Its total mobilized force is about 11 million to 12 million, but its losses are nearly 20% of the total. Therefore, the enemy American hopes to win quickly, otherwise its human resources will not be able to continue for a long time. Japan is the opposite, whether in the mainland of China, Burma, the South Seas, the Japanese mainland, and Jeju Island, it all hopes for a protracted war.

Editorial

### Work Together to Strive for Victory - Welcoming the 40th Allied Armies Memorial Day

Today is the 40th anniversary of the Allied Japanese "Army Day". As the Greater East Asia War is proceeding in the decisive stage, meeting this day is naturally of more profound significance. On this day forty years ago, the Allied Japanese defeated Imperial Russia in the Battle of Mukden. After this battle, it laid the foundation for its strength. Since then, the responsibility for the liberation of the weak ethnic groups in East Asia has fallen on the shoulders of Japan, and the Japanese army has shared this heavy responsibility and has since become the noble ideal of soldiers. For forty years, painstakingly forging ahead, tragically and bravely sacrificing, it was for the freedom and development of the one-voice hall of the Japanese people, and at the same time, it was for the freedom and development of all the ethnic groups in East Asia.

Three years ago, when British and American imperialists invaded the entire East Asia as a group, the Allied Japanese, based on the position of East Asians, were shocked by the meaning of lips and teeth, and spared no sacrifice and no difficulties. As in the spirit of forty years ago, they rose up and stood on the front line of the Greater East Asia War, resisting Britain and the United States, defending Japan, defending East Asia, and striving for the independence of all ethnic groups in East Asia. Today, on this holiday, all the people of East Asia feel excited.

Japan is the pillar in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the pioneer in attacking the aggressive ambitions of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Although the enemy is pouring its superior material resources against Japan, we believe that Japan still has the power to ultimately defeat the enemy. Although we cannot immediately fight shoulder to shoulder with the Allied forces and share the task of the front line, we are ultimately a member of Greater East Asia, a participating country, and our soldiers also have the natural duty to defend the country, protect East Asia, and drive out the enemy. On this holiday, we should especially train and enrich our qualities with the spirit of the Allied Army as a model.

At the same time, we should remember the glorious tradition in the history of the Japanese army, as General Kodama said: "I wish to fight against the superior enemy with a small number of troops and an advantage of four to one." The birth of Army Day was obtained by the Japanese army fighting against a powerful enemy with fifty times its land, three times its population, and five times its military strength. For forty years, the Japanese army has not forgotten this historical fact of victory. On the contrary, with the decisive situation of the war, it has become more and more developed. At present, in the Greater East Asia War area, everywhere is a living history of heroic fighting. This spirit of fighting against the superior enemy with a small number of troops must be the guarantee of ultimately winning the war.

In our editorial on this day last year, we especially mentioned the article "Admonishing Soldiers in China" published by Lieutenant General Masazo Kawabe, the former Chief of Staff of the Dispatched Army in China, on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, encouraging the soldiers in China to have the following attitude: 1. Establish strict military discipline; 2. Practice the word "sincerity"; 3. Respect the traditional customs of the Chinese people. At that time, we determined that the progress of modern military affairs must be coordinated with politics, and military affairs and politics have an inseparable close relationship. In the political history of China, "sincerity" is the condition for those in power to win the love of the people, which is also the condition for political operation. Therefore, in order to coordinate military affairs with politics, we must pay close attention to the conditions for political operation. In the Greater East Asia War, the sincere cooperation between China and Japan is a necessary condition for winning victory, which has been the consensus of the insightful people of China and Japan. Therefore, how to coordinate the military and politics of the two countries is a common task. The instructions of General Kawabe in the past are the unchanging principles for coordinating military affairs and politics, which was the case in the past, is the case now, and will be the case in the future. On this Army Memorial Day, we especially feel a point that requires deep reflection.

While we are working hard based on the above principles, we also recognize that today's war is a total war, and the victory or defeat is not only determined on the battlefield, but also determined in the rear. In order to be the masters of East Asia, at this decisive stage, it is time for us to do our best for the country, to be completely loyal to the nation, to contribute everything to the war, and to do everything we can to win yesterday.

### Supreme Commander of the Philippine Expeditionary Force, General Yamashita Discusses the War Situation: The Japanese Army Will Exert Its Strength to Encircle and Annihilate the Enemy Army on Luzon Island

Philippine Front Line Base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - General Tomoyuki Yamashita, Supreme Commander of the Japanese Philippine Expeditionary Force, has been silent for five months since the decisive battle in the Philippines began. Today, he suddenly broke this silent atmosphere and answered reporters' questions as follows:

Question: What does Your Excellency mean by saying that the enemy has entered our belly?

Answer: So far, it can be said that the enemy has been induced into the central Luzon Plain and the Manila area. From now on, it will be attacked and annihilated from all sides. This is the initial plan of our army, so the war has progressed smoothly. The enemy's bloodshed has exceeded 70,000, which is also due to this. However, the current operation is still within the scope of the so-called preliminary operation, and the operation of fully exerting the strength of the Philippine Japanese army.

Question: However, has our side suffered considerable damage due to the fierce fighting?

Answer: This is indeed unexpected. Our losses are very small. The night combat is the kamikaze team, which has repeatedly won surprising victories in the past. If we have such loyal soldiers, we can say that the battle will be invincible.

Question: The mainland is looking forward to the Japanese army in the Philippines launching a major counter-offensive operation. What are your thoughts?

Answer: Soldiers act according to the situation. The opportunity to act will only begin when the opportunity arrives. If there is no opportunity, even if it is ten or twenty years, we will only work hard to make the American army bleed heavily and absorb the enemy's military power in the morning. The enemy will have no spare power in the future and will be able to discover the enemy's engineering machine. No matter what kind of situation we encounter, our army is fully prepared. The general took time out of his busy schedule to meet with reporters, who placed great trust in him.

Japanese Army Occupies Stronghold Near Montalban

Luzon Front Line, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese army near Montalban, east of Manila, has occupied a part of the enemy army's stronghold that is under construction around the front line, and the results of the battle are expanding.

Northern Iwo Jima: Fierce Battles Continue; Japanese Air Force Bombs Enemy Positions

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 7th, the American army on Iwo Jima launched a fierce attack on the northern positions of the Japanese army. The Japanese garrison team guarded the front line and shattered the enemy's attempt. On the evening of the 7th, several powerful suicide attack teams broke into the mountainous area and inflicted great damage on the enemy. From the morning of the 8th, the enemy began to fiercely attack the positions in the northern area of ​​the Japanese army, and even attempted to invade the positions near the drifting book. The war in that area was extremely fierce, and the Japanese garrison team guarded various strongholds and intercepted the enemy at close range. The Japanese army is determined to firmly and unswervingly defend the country and continue to fight the enemy to the death, killing and wounding many enemy troops. The Japanese side also suffered considerable damage. The battle on the Yutama Mountain was relatively slow on the 8th. The enemy army desperately built an airfield and has begun to use the Child Island airfield. On the 8th, the enemy had nine medium-sized transport aircraft, more than ten fighter aircraft, and thirteen bombers, and curtain houses appeared on the south side of the Motoyama airfield.

A Certain Base on Iwo Jima, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - From midnight to dawn on the 8th, the Japanese air force attacked the enemy's positions on Iwo Jima, causing the enemy's material warehouses and its facilities to be hit by bombs and burned. Japanese aircraft then returned to defense.

### Mitzka Admits: Japanese Army is Strong

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a special correspondent from the Associated Press aboard the flagship of Vice Admiral Mitscher, commander of the U.S. Navy's Task Force 58, Mitscher stated: "It is currently impossible to imagine what events will unfold in the Pacific theater over the next six months. During the recent attacks by U.S. Task Forces on the Japanese mainland, Japanese resistance was not particularly intense. However, this does not indicate that the Japanese Navy and Air Force have been completely destroyed. Japan still possesses a powerful navy and air force. It is believed that the U.S. fleet cannot operate freely in Japanese waters without sustaining some damage. Furthermore, Japan still has a well-trained and highly capable army, and the United States has not yet inflicted any significant damage on this large army."

### Chairman Chen's Instructions: Promote New Life Movement Regulations to Achieve Thrift, Order, and Cleanliness

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The New Life Movement Promotion Committee, after promoting the organization of New Life Movement practice groups in all sectors, has formulated New Life Movement action regulations and practical items as the general work focus of the practice groups. The committee has also stipulated that the first phase, from March to August of this year, will focus on thrift, order, and cleanliness as the main action items, and will begin implementing thrift practices starting in March. Chairman Chen of the committee has issued instructions, urging all citizens to unite and practice diligently, and instructing all provincial and municipal branches to earnestly implement these guidelines. The key points of Chairman Chen's instructions are as follows: "The key focus of this year's New Life Movement work is shifting from the organization and training of youth to the organization and training of the general populace, from major cities to general rural areas, and from the propaganda stage to the practical stage. Over the past three years, the organizational work of youth across the country has largely taken shape. Moving forward, we must dedicate ourselves to developing the organizational training of the general populace, aiming to extend the promotion of the New Life Movement from youth to all sectors of society, concentrating our will to strengthen national power in order to build a Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People. The fundamental key to promoting the New Life Movement lies in striving for simultaneous progress in both spiritual and material construction, enabling us to shoulder the great mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. The purpose of spiritual construction is to eliminate the inherent shortcomings of the general populace and, furthermore, to develop strengths. Based on this principle, the committee has promulgated the New Life Movement action regulations and practical items. The first phase, from March to August of this year, is the implementation period for the practical items, with thrift, order, and cleanliness as the key areas of focus. It is deeply hoped that all citizens across the country will understand this intention, practice it personally, and that all provincial and municipal branches will have the responsibility to lead and promote it, actively promoting and earnestly implementing the previously issued New Life Movement action regulations and practical items."

### Goods Allocation Office Announces Current Status of Priority Allocation, Specifies Allocation Scope and Rice Quantities

The implementation of goods allocation in this city began in 1942 and has now lasted for three years. Initially, only rice and flour were allocated, followed by sugar, oil, and daily necessities. However, rice remains the primary focus. Rice allocation is divided into household allocation and special allocation. Because household allocation quantities cannot meet the minimum required, special allocation is implemented to supplement the shortfall in household allocation. The allocation system was originally a product of implementing a controlled economy, a wartime economic policy practiced by various countries, and some have achieved effective results. In our country, it is a preliminary attempt. Furthermore, people have traditionally been free, and are not yet accustomed to it, which poses obstacles to implementation. Based on past performance, although it is not said to be perfect, it has had considerable effect, but it needs to be improved at any time. Regarding the allocation quantity, the quantity of household allocation is insufficient, and the quantity of special allocation also fails to meet the actual needs, but this is not related to the allocation system itself, but only due to incomplete control.

Priority Allocation of Rice First

In order to meet the needs of the current decisive battle period and to make up for the insufficient allocation quantity, the Shanghai Special City Goods Allocation Office will implement priority allocation starting this year, starting with rice. The scope of allocation is defined as follows: security teams, police, fire personnel, civil servants, teachers, staff of newspapers, cultural institutions, customs officials, Chinese staff of foreign embassies and consulates, municipal hospital staff, doctors, nurses, patients, factories (manufacturing allocation items and military supplies), charitable organizations sheltering refugees, ranches, and prisoners. The most difficult point in implementation is the issue of numbers. Because beneficiaries all hope to receive more allocation materials, they often falsely report numbers when applying. They may also apply repeatedly due to holding positions in two or even several places. Authorities, on the other hand, face difficulties in procuring materials and are striving to verify numbers, prevent waste, and achieve savings, so they place great importance on numbers.

Methods for Verifying Numbers

Therefore, regarding this point, the Shanghai Special City Goods Allocation Office stipulates the following methods for verifying numbers: The numbers for municipal organs applying for allocation should be verified by the Municipal Government Secretariat. The numbers for central government organs stationed in Shanghai applying for allocation should be verified by the responsible ministry. The numbers for teachers applying for allocation should be verified by the Education Bureau. The numbers for newspaper staff applying for allocation should be verified by the Propaganda Office. The numbers for municipal hospitals applying for allocation should be verified by the Health Bureau. The quantity allocated per person per month is determined by their occupation and is separately determined by the Shanghai Food Allocation Adjustment Liaison Committee. The current quantity standards are as follows:

Police and Fire Personnel (2.5 to 6 *dou*)
Security Teams, Municipal Civil Servants, Judicial Organ Staff, Customs Officials, Teachers, Newspaper Staff (3 *dou*)
Central Government Organs Staffed in Shanghai, Chinese Staff of Foreign Embassies and Consulates, Commercial Fire Brigades, Factory and Ranch Workers (2 *dou*)
Prisoners (1.5 *dou*)
Cultural Institution Staff, Hospital Staff, Doctors, Nurses (1.25 *dou*)
Charitable Organizations, Ranch Staff (1 *dou*)

Issuing Half Quantities First

The Goods Allocation Office is purely an executive allocation agency. All allocation materials are supplied by relevant parties. Currently, only half of the priority allocation rice has been received. Therefore, the rice to be allocated for the entire month will be issued in two installments. However, efforts are being made to improve the situation. In the future, priority allocation of items other than rice will also be implemented step by step according to the planned plan, so as to thoroughly fulfill the mission of the Allocation Office.

### Police Bureau Distributes Free White Rice

The City Police Bureau, in order to improve the treatment of police officers, began distributing free rice to Chinese staff in February. The regulations stipulate: (A) 6 *dou* per person per month for those who are married with children, (B) 4 *dou* per person per month for those who are married but without children, (C) 2.5 *dou* per person per month for those who are unmarried, and (D) 3 *dou* per person per month for those in rural areas. The rice for the first half of last month, 2.5 *dou* per person, has already been issued. The quantity for the second half of the month was still lacking, but has now been arranged and will be distributed separately by each branch bureau starting today. All police officers can collect it from their respective branch bureaus. Retired police officers are also eligible to receive it. At the same time, all retired police officers should apply to their respective branch bureaus to receive their retirement pay to show care.

### Police Bureau Expands Crime Prevention Department

The third division of the Municipal Police Bureau is actively promoting crime prevention work and has expanded the crime prevention department. Under the director of the department, Dao Chenghu, and deputy director, Kusumoto, there are four sections: First Crime Prevention Section, headed by Zhou Guanghui; Second Identification Section, headed by Kusumoto (concurrently serving as director); Third Inspection Section, headed by Tan Binglin; and Fourth Statistics Section, headed by Liu Bin. All crime prevention work has been decided and is being implemented according to plan under the direction of Division Chief Li, in order to achieve the goals of preventing crime and maintaining public order.

Furthermore, the crime prevention department of the third division of the police bureau, recognizing that the evacuation of the city's population is currently underway, and that wharves and stations often have unemployed vagrants and scalpers extorting passengers and disrupting travel, has dispatched the first section chief, Zhou Guanghui, and deputy detective, Feng Zheng, to cooperate with the Huangpu, Hongkou, North Station, and Changning branch bureaus to arrest and send them to vagrant labor camps in order to assist in the evacuation and ensure the safety of travelers.

### City Education Bureau Strengthens Supervision Work

In order to strengthen supervision work, the City Education Bureau is preparing for supervision matters for this semester. The first supervision meeting was held yesterday, attended by all supervisors, inspectors, and section chiefs in charge, chaired by Director Dai. The supervision situation in the last semester and the process of organizing reports were reported, and more than 400 public and private primary and secondary schools were approved to be rewarded, punished, and improved, and were ordered to comply. Then, the supervision plan for this semester was discussed, and the meeting adjourned after four hours. It is heard that the second meeting will continue to be held today, and all work will be further discussed, and all supervisors will be dispatched soon.

### Yesterday Was the 15th Air Defense Day; Various Drills Were Conducted; Tense Atmosphere and Realistic Drills

Yesterday (9th) was the 15th Air Defense Day. The Air Defense authorities followed the usual practice of expanding propaganda to promote the significance of air defense, and conducted various air defense drills. The whole city was in a state of air defense, with a tense atmosphere. The details are recorded as follows:

Alarm Drill

At 10:00 AM sharp, an air control alarm order was issued for the drill. Instead of sounding the alarm siren, the method of transmitting the alarm was used. The Air Defense Headquarters issued an order to each branch bureau, and then each branch bureau ordered the liaison officers of each joint guarantee to transmit it to each neighborhood. Then, full traffic control was implemented. Pedestrians and vehicles were not allowed to pass. After twenty minutes, pedestrians were allowed to walk on the left side of the street, except for vehicles, and police personnel were responsible for directing traffic. At the same time, various comprehensive air defense measures training were conducted in each district. At 11:00 AM, the air raid alarm was lifted, and at 12:00 PM sharp, the entire alert alarm was lifted. At 3:00 PM, the alert alarm was ordered. At 4:00 PM, the air raid alarm was ordered. Traffic control was still implemented. All entertainment venues stopped entertainment. Each district continued to hold comprehensive training. Each factory also dispatched personnel from each branch bureau to guide the implementation of training. At 5:00 PM, the air raid alarm was lifted, and at 6:00 PM sharp, the alert alarm was lifted. At 7:00 PM, the alert alarm was ordered. At 7:30 PM, the air raid alarm was ordered. In addition to implementing traffic control and stopping entertainment in entertainment venues, strict lighting control was also implemented. Police officers from each branch bureau, together with personnel from the neighborhood organization, organized a lighting control team to investigate the streets and alleys in each district. Those with light leaks had their store numbers recorded and were given electricity cutoff penalties according to regulations. At the same time, each district conducted various comprehensive training under the starry night. At 8:30 PM, the air raid alarm was lifted, and at 8:45 PM, the entire alert alarm was lifted. The alarm transmission training this time was more advanced than in the past.

Local Training

This local training was held in the Old Zhabei and New Cheng districts. The New Cheng district started at 10:00 AM and was conducted at the intersections of Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road, Jing'an Temple Road and Wujiang Road, Great Shanghai Road and Chengdu Road, Zhengyang Road and Weihaiwei Road, Chengdu Road and Datong Road, Jiading Road and Datong Road, Fengyang Road and Huanghe Road, Xizang Road and Xin Zha Road, and Datong Road and Xin Zha Road. Various comprehensive training such as firefighting, first aid, and shelter was conducted. The branch bureau chief, Li Guohua, Sugi, and section chiefs Zheng Zhong and Kusa, etc., went to the venue to direct all the neighborhood air defense team members and the public to participate. The Old Zhabei district started at 3:00 PM and was conducted at the intersections of Xiamen Road and Guizhou Road, in front of the Sincere Company, the intersections of Fujian Road and Tianjin Road, Beijing Road and Fujian Road, Beijing Road and Xizang Road, Zhejiang Road Bridge to Fujian Road Bridge, Zhejiang Road, Ningbo Road, Liuhe Road, Niuzhuang Road, in front of the Wing On Company, the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Fujian Road, Hubei Road and Fuzhou Road, Xizang Road and Fuzhou Road, Hankou Road, Guangxi Road, Fuzhou Road and Zhejiang Road, Fujian Road, Guangxi Road, Beihai Road, and the intersection of Zhejiang Road, etc. Various training such as firefighting, first aid, shelter, and fire extinguishing was conducted. The branch bureau chief, Ito, together with section chiefs Shen Hua, Lu Weilian, Oyama, Song Bingzheng, Yamahara, Harkingang, and He Peifu, etc., were responsible for going to each location to direct the district's police defense team members and the public to practice. The local training in the two districts had the organization of a demonstration class. The Old Zhabei district was mainly based on the navy, and personnel were sent by the branch bureau to participate. The New Cheng district was mainly based on the branch bureau, and was assisted by the army. They were responsible for teaching the neighborhood personnel and the public the necessary air defense measures in each district. The air defense headquarters also dispatched the deputy director of the second division, Yin Dengdi, and the deputy section chief of the air defense section, Li Zhenshi, to inspect the venue. The atmosphere was extremely tense, and the drill situation was very realistic.

Deputy Minister Du Inspects the Training

In addition, the Old Zhabei district held a large-scale comprehensive training at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Xizang Road at 3:00 PM. Deputy Minister of Air Defense Du Zhengjian, Director of Fire Brigade Kiyoshu Mizumi, Deputy Director of Police Defense Division Gu Dengdi, Section Chief of Air Defense Section Li Zhenshi, and the commander of the naval concession troops all went to the venue to inspect. Branch Bureau Chief of the Old Zhabei Ito Tadashi, Section Chief of the Second Division Shen Hua, Section Chief of the Third Division Yamahara, Section Chief of the Fourth Division Oyama, and the deputy commander of the district's police defense team, Li Man and Gu Zhan Gui Rong, directed the training of all police defense team members. The Great China Hotel and Wanshou Shan Restaurant were assumed to be bombed. First, the observation post reported that enemy planes were coming, and shelter training was implemented. Then, firecrackers were used as substitutes for bombs and incendiary bombs, imagining that a bomb and an incendiary bomb hit the sixth floor of the Great China Hotel and the third floor of the Wanshou Shan Restaurant, and the police defense team members quickly used ladders and ropes to climb the building to fight the fire and extinguish the bomb. At the same time, someone pretended to be injured and implemented first aid training. The performance was very realistic. After the performance, the naval commander and Deputy Minister Du gave instructions, commending each team member for their spirited spirit, and correcting some shortcomings. It ended at around 4:00 PM.

### Paying Business Tax at the Shen Bao Newspaper: Permission Granted for Accommodating Procedures; Four Measures Decided by the Municipal Bureau of Finance

The Municipal Bureau of Finance, to initiate the spring business tax collection in the former 1st and 8th districts, convened a discussion meeting with the responsible persons of various trade associations a few days ago to discuss collection methods. At that time, due to several unclear points, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce dispatched responsible representatives to consult the financial authorities again, presenting their difficulties. Director Luo personally received them and, understanding the merchants' hardships, granted accommodating procedures.

The spring business tax was originally scheduled to be reported and paid based on the total business volume of the three months of October, November, and December of last year. It is now permitted to change to using the total business volume of the three months of January, February, and March of this year as the standard (the business period of March has not yet expired; the business volume of January and February will be used for calculation).

The tax rates were originally determined by the government according to grades. If the business engages in other businesses in addition to its main business, it must also be taxed based on the main business. It is now permitted to indicate the types of businesses engaged in within the declaration form and report and pay taxes separately.

Manufacturing factories, regardless of whether the capital is fully utilized, were originally taxed based on the total capital amount. It is now permitted, if only a portion of the capital is started and used for work, to reduce the tax amount and only pay tax on the capital of the portion being used for manufacturing.

The spring business tax was originally scheduled to be reported and paid within five days. It is now permitted to postpone the declaration to no later than the 20th of this month. When the Bureau of Finance approves and notifies the tax payment, it should be paid to the bureau on the same day without delay. Various trade associations have notified their member businesses to obtain declaration forms from the Business Tax Collection Office in the Ma Dang Road District or the Municipal Chamber of Commerce starting immediately and follow the instructions to declare and pay taxes.

### Municipal Government Subsidy: National Central University Scholarship

Mayor Zhou believes that National Central University is the highest institution of learning in our country. However, students at the university are under pressure from the increasing cost of living, and those who cannot afford it are at risk of dropping out of school. In response to the letter from Principal Chen of the university, it has been decided that the municipal government will subsidize the university with 30 scholarships, each worth 10,000 yuan per month, and both the Finance and Education Bureaus have been ordered to comply.

### Bureau of Construction to Set Up Confidential Complaint Box

The Municipal Bureau of Construction has recently received reports from citizens that tricycle drivers are not complying with the limited prices and are arbitrarily demanding fares. It is understood that the bureau has decided to set up confidential complaint boxes in various vehicle registration offices in the near future to thoroughly suppress and strictly investigate this. This will allow citizens to send the tricycle number to the confidential complaint box after being overcharged by drivers, so that investigations can be conducted strictly according to the complaint.

### Industrial and Commercial Loans from Silver and Money Businesses: Business is More Slack Than Before; 40% Decrease Compared to Last Year

Major banks and firms in the city's silver and money industries have been accepting industrial and commercial loans as much as possible. Except for the authorities' prohibition of encouraging speculation and lending or mortgaging controlled goods, other legitimate commodity and property mortgage loans are still being accepted separately if they are not excessively large, and no special attention has been paid to tightening them. It is reported that the loan business of various banks and firms has become more slack than last year, and according to statistical figures, it has decreased by about 40%. It is said that the main reasons for the decrease are:

Many firms and banks are using their own funds for direct business investment.

The loan interest rates and newly added handling fees of firms and banks vary greatly. Customers who need funds are automatically reducing the amount of their loans.

### Brief News

Relocation of the Sanitation Section: The Sanitation Section of the Municipal Health Bureau has moved its office from the original location downstairs in the municipal government building due to insufficient space. It relocated to the third floor of the municipal government building yesterday. The original office will be used by the Third Section of the Bureau of Construction.

Shanghai Radio Station Broadcasts Programs: In order to strengthen recreational content and increase citizens' entertainment interests, the Shanghai Broadcasting Station has decided to resume broadcasting highlights from major theaters.

### Minister Matsushima Explains Recent War Situation: Unprecedented Losses for Enemy Forces on Iwo Jima

The press conference of the Press Department of the Allied Japanese Fleet in China was held at 3:00 PM yesterday. Minister Matsushima, Naval Lieutenant Matsumoto, and reporters from various newspapers attended. Minister Matsushima gave a speech, explaining the war situation on Iwo Jima, the Philippines, and various aspects of the Pacific, the main points of which are as follows:

Heavy Losses for American Troops on Iwo Jima

On Iwo Jima, about 500 enemy troops used all means to launch a general attack on the main positions of the Japanese army. The Japanese side also concentrated its forces to seriously attack the enemy, causing a great deal of casualties. In this battle, the enemy not only used three divisions of marines but also increased some troops. The sea used naval gun bombardment and also used aircraft to assist. At present, both the Japanese and American forces are engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat on various positions. As the enemy Americans said, this is the most intense battle in the Pacific. Therefore, the losses of the American army are unprecedentedly huge. As for the Japanese army, although the enemy has repeatedly claimed that the damage is serious, in fact, the Japanese army is using cave warfare, and the loss of soldiers and weapons is minimal. The American losses have exceeded 20,000 people. It is believed that the enemy will suffer more significant losses in the future.

Luzon War Situation Yet to Unfold

The main battlefields in Luzon are in the areas around Manila Bay and Clark Field. The Japanese army in the mountainous area around the Kra Balian Mountains is using strong positions to contain the enemy in various directions, causing the enemy to suffer heavy attacks. When the American army fought, it used flamethrowers, white phosphorus incendiary bombs, and 20 cm shells, but although the war situation seems fierce, from a general observation, the Japanese and American forces have not yet reached the stage of main force battles. How the war situation will develop will require more time. Recently, MacArthur said that his troops will soon be transferred elsewhere, which is difficult to achieve.

Meaningless Propaganda of Landing on the Mainland

Recently, the American army has been vigorously promoting the landing on the Chinese mainland. It has used radio broadcasts to ask the people, especially the powerful people in the coastal areas, to help the American army, with various inflammatory propaganda. The Chongqing side also broadcasted, hoping that the Chinese people would follow the example of the French when the American army landed, contributing to the Allied forces by forming a second front. But what did the French get? Only hunger and chaos. What is especially terrible is that women sell their chastity, and thieves run rampant in the city, becoming a state of anarchy. In the peace conference on April 25, how should the French be treated, and how should they be rewarded? Every association makes people shudder. How can the Chinese people not consider it, ignore their future destiny, and rashly obey? This is worth studying.

Contradictory Phenomenon of British and American Navies

British Admiral Fraser, commander of the British Pacific Fleet, declared to reporters on the 5th in Erber that the British Pacific Fleet is now fully prepared and waiting for the opportunity to attack. 50% of the fleet are aircraft carriers, and they are quite confident in their mission. Playing with his tone, his target is not Japan but the United States, which is very interesting. According to well-informed sources in London, the US plan for operations against Japan has recently been completed. The general outline of its strategic part is: when the British and American established a joint Pacific fleet, there was a declaration that the British and American should assist each other in the war against Japan. However, because the strength of the British navy is not as good as the United States, the British navy cannot stand alone in the Pacific. Therefore, this time it was decided to make the British navy a secondary assistant. Moreover, the British navy's inability to take on difficult tasks alone in the Pacific is also the position of US Fleet Commander King. It was opposed to Churchill's position at the Quebec Conference in the past. Therefore, Fraser's recent remarks were actually directed at the United States. According to the remarks of both the British and Americans, there will inevitably be disputes due to contradictions in the Pacific War, not to mention that the strength of the British navy is extremely weak.

Enemy American Production Has Been Reduced

The combat power of the British and Americans has now reached its peak, especially the aircraft production of the United States. The quantity in February was 6,286, a decrease of 249 from the previous month. This phenomenon is not only true for aircraft production, but also for shipbuilding. Therefore, observing the war situation, the US military seems to have made some progress on the surface, but in reality, the loss of human resources has been impossible to adjust, especially the loss of the black team (especially on Iwo Jima) is extremely large. In the past, many roads were built on the mainland, and black teams were also used. The lack of manpower can be imagined. Since the human resources of the British and Americans are so lacking, coupled with the inevitable disagreements in the Pacific War, their future feels full of obstacles.

Finally, Minister Matsushima said that the Washington Star Evening Post of March 7, Constantin. Brown's interpretation of the news said: When the World Security Conference opens in San Francisco on April 25, President Roosevelt is expected to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. The US Secretary of State has already denied this news.

### Examination Along the Beijing-Shanghai Line: Report No. 2; Observing from Statistical Figures: Suzhou's Food Production More Than Sufficient to Meet Local Needs

— Tang Yi

There are dozens of large-scale tea shops in Suzhou's urban area, each capable of accommodating thousands of people, and the seats are often full. From this perspective alone, it can already prove the wealthy environment in which the people of Suzhou live. The foundation of this wealth is built on the endless fields in the four fields.

Rice

According to county government statistics, Suzhou has approximately 1.8 million mu of farmland. Among them, 1,330,860 mu are planted with rice. The highest yield is three shi per mu, and the lowest is one shi, averaging two shi. Therefore, Suzhou County produces 2,641,700 shi of rice annually.

According to the statistics of the County Government's Baojia Office in December last year, Suzhou County has 284 townships, 3,390 baos, 23,766 jias, 270,907 households, and a total of 1,162,736 people. If the people of Suzhou eat rice all year round, averaging two shi per person, the total annual consumption of rice is 2,325,472 shi. Subtracting the consumed rice from the produced rice, the annual surplus of rice is 316,328 shi.

Miscellaneous Grains

However, Suzhou has two harvests a year. In addition to rice, there are soybeans in the autumn harvest, with a planting area of 65,000 mu. The yield per mu is 7.5 dou for the highest and 5.5 dou for the lowest, averaging 6.5 dou per mu, with an annual yield of 42,250 shi. In addition to the autumn harvest, there is the spring harvest, commonly planting wheat, barley, broad beans, and rapeseed. The yield of wheat per mu is 7.5 dou for the highest and 5 dou for the lowest, averaging 6.5 dou; the yield of barley per mu is 7 dou for the highest and 5 dou for the lowest, averaging 6 dou; the yield of broad beans per mu is 7.5 dou for the highest and 6.5 dou for the lowest, averaging 7 dou; the yield of rapeseed per mu is 6 dou for the highest and 4.5 dou for the lowest, averaging 5 dou. According to the above production, according to county government statistics, the miscellaneous grains produced each year, excluding soybeans, are roughly as follows:

If viewed from the above figures, Suzhou's food production is more than sufficient to meet local needs, with a large surplus. However, today, residents in Suzhou city are eating rice at 52,000 yuan per shi (March 8), which is higher than another rice-producing area—Wuxi, where the rice price is only 37,500 yuan per shi (March 8), which cannot help but be surprising. Apart from man-made reasons, we really have no way to explain it. (Sent from Suzhou on March 8)

### The Difficult Problem of Lunch for Office Workers

Now, people who go out to work often feel two pains. One is the problem of transportation, because there are no trams, and bicycles have solved the difficulties for some people. The second is the problem of food. A very simple lunch can easily cost thousands of dollars. Going home to eat is impossible due to the long distance. Going to a relative's house nearby seems inappropriate due to the high cost of living. Bringing a lunch box is tiring and there is no place to heat it up. Eating some biscuits is not enough to satisfy hunger. This is truly a very difficult problem, and I fear that there are not a few people who feel pain. I hope that food shops will develop a nutritious food that does not require cooking or vegetables, and can replace porridge and snacks. If it is launched, it will be a celebration for friends who go to the office! — A Citizen

### Allied Japanese Army Memorial Day Special Punishment Inevitable Victory

— Shanghai Army Department News Department Koike Toshio

"On the battlefield, the artillery roars, the machine guns spit fire, and the enemy troops surge forward. At this time, even if our comrades are injured or killed one after another, as long as we still have breath, we should bravely rise up, because the time to annihilate the enemy is right in front of us. Combat is tragic, and there should be confidence in annihilating the enemy. If we don't rise up with great courage at this time, and intensify our efforts, when will we?"

These are the words that the late Colonel Yasumasa Ishida often said. Colonel Ishida passed away not long before the Sino-Japanese Incident. He was a researcher of war history - especially the annihilation war, not only a treasure of the Japanese army, but also a world authority on military science. Colonel Ishida's words are indeed deeply meaningful, especially today in the Greater East Asia War, they are fully answering.

Today, the war situation is becoming more and more tense, and the American army is gradually advancing, trying to invade the Japanese mainland or attempting to land on the coast of China. Looking at the progress of the entire war situation, the front line that was far away in the South Pacific in the past is now getting closer and closer to us. But if we think that we have lost because of this, that would be a big mistake, and it would be too hasty. Only cowards who lack great courage would think so. The front line is getting closer to us, and the tragic war is directly hitting us. It is just a phenomenon that the whole war situation has reached a critical moment. In other words, the war situation before today was a war in which we had never encountered an opponent. It can be said that we have engaged in a just war starting today.

In the early stage of the war, the enemy British and Americans failed to exert their original strength, so the Japanese army's attack was like sweeping away rotten wood, as if there was no one in the world. In the opening battle of the Greater East Asia War, it was this kind of one-sided battle. By the middle of the second year of the war, the enemy Americans were able to regroup and reorganize their formation, and take out their strength. Since the fierce battle of Guadalcanal, until today, the enemy army has been constantly striving to counterattack, and now the enemy Americans are pouring all their strength, pouring the sum of their national power on the front line. At this point, we have the opportunity to confront the enemy head-on and eliminate all its strength. This is the "good opportunity to annihilate the enemy" that Colonel Ishida said.

Since the enemy is exerting all its strength to challenge us, of course, we cannot be complacent in preparing. The southern and other military supplies obtained under the great war results of the opening battle have been fully utilized, and our combat power is becoming stronger and stronger. At the same time, there is no miscalculation in the estimation of the enemy's combat power. In the autumn when the enemy army is fully invading, we have a tactic of meeting them head-on to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop, and we have ample time to choose a favorable time and battlefield. Today, the opportunity to annihilate the enemy has come.

Furthermore, let me talk about another view of the war situation.

Modern war is a total war. Thoroughly destroying the total power of the enemy country, that is, destroying the total power of things, and destroying the total power of people, is the purpose of modern war, and victory or defeat is determined by this. Therefore, the gain or loss of one place is not a problem, and it does not matter where the war front occurs. It is enough if we can annihilate the enemy and smash its combat power. And to strike the enemy with all its strength in the most appropriate time and the most favorable battlefield, so that there is no surplus, is the highest tactic of modern war. From this point of view, whether the front line is far away in the Pacific or close to our inland sea, there is no reason to judge whether the war situation is good or bad, nor is there any reason to be happy or sad. Those who are worried about today's war situation are really stupid, otherwise they are cowards who cannot endure the tragic war.

Today, the best time to defeat the enemy British and Americans has arrived. As Colonel Ishida said: "The more tragic the battle, the more confident we are in annihilating the enemy." Today, the corpses of British and American soldiers are piled up like mountains on the battlefield, and their fresh blood has painted the sand red. Our frontline soldiers have taken this opportunity to launch a great decisive battle to annihilate the enemy in Luzon or Iwo Jima.

"If we don't rise up with great courage at this time, and intensify our efforts, when will we!" These words are the best words we need to shout out today. Only in this way can we win, only in this way can we defeat the British and Americans, and only then can we expect the cleanliness and prosperity of Greater East Asia.

### A Roundtable Discussion on the History of the Development of the Japanese Army

Lieutenant General Kohei Kashii

Entrusted Officer of the Minister's Secretariat of the Army Ministry Kiyoshi Fujita

Army News Reporter Hei Hino

Hino: Looking back at the reason our army has developed into such a powerful force, we will know the invincibility of our Japanese army in the future. I was born after the Russo-Japanese War, so I naturally cannot know many things. I humbly ask the experts to teach me more.

My hometown is Aramatsu in Kyushu, and I often pass through the Kanmon Straits there. During the "Expel the Barbarians" era of Bunkyu 3 (1863), the Choshu domain in that area bombarded foreign ships. The following year, eighteen fleets from the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands returned and defeated the Choshu domain utterly, even occupying the artillery battery. I have never forgotten this in my heart, and that is why I participated in this Greater East Asia War. I have been to the Philippines, where the Japanese army also utterly defeated and occupied islands that were American territory. Recalling that in the mere eighty years since the time of Shimonoseki, the powerful Japan has accomplished such earth-shattering feats, I am truly excited to the point of tears. If we examine it from a historical perspective, we will surely find the reason for its flourishing and growth. I believe that the reason the Japanese army has become so powerful is due to the conscription system. As for the circumstances before and after the conscription system, I ask the two of you to enlighten me.

The World's Strongest Army

Kashii: If I say anything wrong, please correct me, Mr. Fujita. The question raised by Mr. Hino just now is indeed very meaningful.

Just as Mr. Hino said, in a mere eighty years, our Japanese army has been able to achieve the world's strongest and world's number one title of being invincible and unconquerable. How exactly did we succeed in this? Comparing the Russo-Japanese War and World War I at the outset, it becomes immediately clear. Perhaps some might raise an objection, saying, "That's absurd. The role the Japanese army played during World War I was limited to a corner of Qingdao in Shandong Province, China. That was merely equivalent to the enemy, Germany, being far from its own country, defending an insignificantly small city with isolated and unsupported forces, which was then occupied by our army. As for fighting against the powerful Russian army at a military fortress like Port Arthur, exhausting half the army's energy and engaging in arduous struggles before finally occupying it, Qingdao and Port Arthur can never be spoken of in the same breath. How can the Russo-Japanese War be compared to World War I?" Naturally, I do not intend to compare the Russo-Japanese War with World War I, nor do I intend to compare the Battle of Port Arthur with the Battle of Qingdao. Instead, I want to examine the entire evolution and process of the Russo-Japanese War, which provided great lessons for the offensive and defensive operations on the European battlefield during World War I.

In April of Taisho 13 (1924), I served as a military attache at the Japanese embassy in Germany. At that time, Marshal Hindenburg had not yet assumed the position of president of the republic after the revolution. One day, I visited the Marshal. Marshal Hindenburg, with his six-foot-tall, stalwart frame, shook my hand vigorously and said with a smile, "Welcome! Welcome!" Then, he politely said, "The German army learned from Japan." This statement was truly unexpected to me, as the German army was already quite powerful. I also inadvertently said politely, "Actually, the Japanese army also received inspiration from your country's former Meckel." Hindenburg was very pleased to hear this, and the originally scheduled thirty-minute meeting was extended, and he even invited me to lunch.

This is admittedly superfluous to say, but it shows Hindenburg's admiration for our Japanese army. At that time, Marshal Hindenburg was suffering from influenza and was recuperating in a sanatorium. He should not have entertained guests for too long, but he made an exception and even had lunch with me. Although someone from the military side had advised against it, I had offered to decline, but he retorted, "Lunch has already been prepared. We must have it together." So, I talked and laughed with his daughter (who had married a cavalry captain), his wife, and his adjutant. There, I realized that the Marshal truly admired the Japanese army from the bottom of his heart, which made me deeply grateful. So, in what specific area did Germany learn from the Japanese army? I think the first thing was the Japanese army's defeat of the Russian army. Through the Russo-Japanese War, Germany learned from Japan about the Russian army's tactics and mental fortitude. Hindenburg had spent a long time in East Prussia and had devoted a great deal of effort to constantly researching this issue. For example, his victory in the Battle of Tannenberg against the Russian army, which established his initial success, and his subsequent consecutive victories were by no means accidental.

The second point that Germany learned from Japan was the removal of the 28-centimeter howitzer from the coastal fortress and bringing it to Port Arthur to unleash its firepower. As a result, the enemy's ships hidden in the port were destroyed from 203-Meter Hill. This indirectly became the reason for the defeat of the Baltic Fleet.

Japan's use of the 28-centimeter howitzer proved that Japan had such weapons, which gave Germany a great impetus at the time. Therefore, at the beginning of World War I, the one that destroyed the important fortress of Liège in Belgium in one fell swoop was also successful because of the 42-centimeter giant gun. This was all because of the inspiration the Japanese army gave to Germany during the Russo-Japanese War.

Third, it may seem like a small matter on the surface, but it is actually very important. That is, the Japanese army used mortars for the first time in Port Arthur. This type of mortar achieved remarkable results in the Battle of Port Arthur. This type of mortar was later adopted by all countries on the European battlefield, and Germany was no exception. The invention of this type of mortar began during the Russo-Japanese War. Another small matter is the use of hand grenades. Speaking only of the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian army first used hand grenades in Port Arthur. The Japanese army immediately imitated it and "returned the favor" to the Russian army, which was very effective. However, the issue of this type of hand grenade did not actually begin during the Russo-Japanese War. As far back as Meiji 10 (1876), Major Kodama (later General) during the Kumamoto Castle siege used empty cans and bottles for explosions as a staff officer at the time. Later, it became very popular in the European War, and thus became a hand grenade.

The Foresight of the Sages

There is also a serious issue, namely night combat, also known as night fighting. Since ancient times, Japan has been known for night battles. Since the use of launchers, they have been practiced even more, and have ultimately become a unique characteristic of Japan. Therefore, the Japanese army always practices it during the autumn exercises. However, the German army, in the wars before the Russo-Japanese War, would always set up sentries at dusk, arrange the battlefield, pretend to fight, and then it would be time for dancing and sleeping. But during the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army soldiers, who were all soldiers who were relentlessly trained day and night, ultimately defeated the Russian army. After the war ended at that time, the Germans came to Japan to study, and were ultimately convinced by the seriousness of the Japanese army's exercises. Therefore, from the perspective of foreigners, the victory of the Japanese army during the Russo-Japanese War always seemed like an army of elite soldiers emerging from the ground. But to be honest, this was all due to the foresight of the sages, the officers and soldiers enduring hardships, and their training. Therefore, we must specifically explain the efforts of our sages and the obedience of the officers and soldiers.

To trace the origin, we must examine the ten years of gathering strength and ten years of teaching, the "lying on firewood and tasting gall" history before the Russo-Japanese War. The phrase "lying on firewood and tasting gall" is truly worthy of it. But the hypothetical enemy at the time was too large, occupying one-sixth of the Earth's land area. Just thinking about this point, Russia is frightening enough. Moreover, Russia was a continental military power in Europe, standing amongst various powerful nations. Therefore, for the Japanese army, even thinking about facing Russia in a real battle was already heart-wrenching, let alone actually fighting them. As for the Japanese war expenses during the Russo-Japanese War, the two hundred million taels of silver in indemnity that China paid during the Sino-Japanese War were, to be honest, no more than a drop in the bucket. Military expenses had to be allocated from the meager budget, so it was truly brain-racking and painstaking. Looking at the battle aspect alone, as I have already said, battle preparations had already been made for ten years, and the Sino-Japanese War also laid the foundation in practical experience. Recalling the Sino-Japanese War, our Japan used only six divisions to win a surprising victory.

At that time, although China had been repeatedly defeated by Britain and France since the Opium War, in the eyes of the general public worldwide, China was still a lion in a deep slumber. Therefore, the whole world still did not dare to underestimate China at that time. Since China was like this, and the Qing Dynasty was also threatening our Japan with all its might, our Japan could only fight back with all its might. At the beginning of the war, our Great Japanese Imperial Army won every battle, so it became practice for actual warfare.

The reason why Japan achieved a great victory in the Sino-Japanese War was because our Japan had been actively expanding preparations and working hard to prepare for war since the Meiji Restoration. Although it is said that we had been actively preparing for war since the Meiji Restoration, the maximum number of soldiers was no more than six divisions. But judging solely from the quantity would lead to the error of quantitative determinism. Since the Meiji Restoration and up to the Sino-Japanese War, Japan had also made enormous sacrifices.

When discussing the Sino-Japanese War, we must examine the Southwest War of Meiji 10. The Southwest War, to be honest, was not only a major event for our Japanese army, but also a major event in Japanese history. As for its true significance, we have not yet fully developed the spirit of our Yamato nation. Only later did we understand that the Southwest War itself had unprecedented great value in the developmental history of the Yamato nation.

The Significance of the Southwest War

Hino: Let's take a look at the Southwest War. From the perspective of constructing the army, it was a trial period for the conscription system. From the perspective of the Greater East Asia War, I believe that the Seikanron (Conquest of Korea) at that time was a preparation for managing Greater East Asia, with Saigo Takamori having a genius and insightful vision. Naturally, Mr. Saigo may not have foreseen the current Greater East Asia War, but the so-called Seikanron was the prelude to managing the continent. From this perspective, Mr. Saigo seems to have already seen the Greater East Asia War.

Kashii: What exactly was the Meiji 10 Incident? The army was composed of the samurai class, while the government army was composed of so-called commoner soldiers. From the name "commoner soldiers," one can see the utmost contempt. At that time, the Kumamoto Castle was occupied with a sweeping force, approaching with irresistible momentum. The Southwest War was a war between an army of citizens and farmers against an army of the samurai class. But what should never be forgotten is that when Saigo-sensei saw that the government army was very brave and decisive, he smiled when he died and said: "In this way, I can die for Japan with peace of mind." This is Saigo-sensei's greatness and the typical spirit of loyalty and courage of the Japanese man. This is also something we can never forget. At the same time, thanks to the Southwest War, the true value of the so-called new army was demonstrated, and the position of that army was suddenly elevated, and the new commoner army gained unlimited trust in protecting the country and its people.

During this war, the government mobilized the drawn-sword squad from the police and the soldiers from all over the country to fight, but the atmosphere in the whole country was very calm.

In addition, a major diplomatic event occurred at that time. Everyone must still remember the British chief envoy at that time, Sir Harry Smith Parkes. This British envoy came to Tokyo during that time of war and chaos. He pressed Minister of the Right Iwakura, saying that the number of guards in Tokyo was gradually decreasing, and it was difficult to guarantee the lives and property of foreigners. It would be better for Britain to send troops to be responsible for protecting public safety. Then Minister of the Right Iwakura came up with an idea in his haste. He ordered all the students of the Army Academy, who were all on vacation, to gather together and hold a temporary military parade. As a result, Parkes' arrogant plot was completely crushed. Looking back, it is truly infuriating. Foreign troops were stationed on our Japanese territory, all the way up to Meiji 7 (1874), for three years. They had just withdrawn from the country, but they wanted to seize the right to station troops again, taking advantage of the Southwest War of Meiji 10.

Hino: It is recorded in ancient books that in the foreign troops' garrison area in Yokohama, a sign saying "Japanese people are not allowed to enter" was erected high.

Fujita: It has been around for a long time.

Reporter: Please tell us about the army situation during the Southwest War, Mr. Fujita.

Fujita: The war in Meiji 10 was indeed very important. The war expenses at that time were indeed shocking. It was a pity that such bloodshed occurred because it was a domestic incident, but it was a great lesson for future generations. If you look at the problem like this, the war expenses were not too great. Not only were soldiers from all over the country mobilized, but also the police. On the surface, it seemed that mobilizing commoner soldiers would not help, but in fact, the commoner soldiers were very obedient and only acted according to orders. The samurai class, on the other hand, was scattered and disjointed, only knowing how to charge straight in, advance and retreat arbitrarily, and even if there were orders, they would not act. Therefore, the government army was easier to command, and its actions were all according to orders. During the ten-year war, the mobilization and organization were very complicated, but after this experience, the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War were both successfully fought against the enemy. Even the advance team was successfully organized.

Whether in terms of mobilization or military service, thanks to the painful experience of the Southwest War, it was successfully completed during the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, the value of conscription was also valued, and the actual foundation of conscription was also strengthened. As a result, a powerful army was finally established. During the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, no one had thought that victory could be achieved, which is something everyone knows. Even Ito Hirobumi thought that we could not win. Since others are invading us, our Japan cannot help but rise up to defend against the enemy. In desperation, we will send out surprise troops and swear to kill the enemy.

Hino: Was there a kind of confidence that persisting to the end would lead to final victory?

Fujita: There was this kind of confidence. As I have already said, there is the story of ten years of lying on firewood and tasting gall. At that time, Emperor Meiji's poem was as follows:

"Surprising winds and raging waves, boundless oceans,
Even in a small boat, I swear to reach the distant shore."

This poem fully expresses the Emperor's determination to reach the shore, no matter how difficult it is. Although this poem was included in the work of Meiji 38 (1905), it was written when recalling the Triple Intervention. At that time, it was truly a great test.

Hino: There is such an example. That is, the latest feudal lord, the lord of the Hitotsubashi family. He was quickly reorganized into government soldiers.

Get up and kill the enemy! One more is good. We are all special attack forces!

The Origin of the New Military System

Kashii: Whether it is the Qibingdui (surprise soldier corps) problem or the German-style problem in Wakayama, they were all recognized as the new army of Meiji 10. As for the conscription order, legally speaking, it was based on the conscription edict promulgated on November 28, Meiji 5 (1872). Although it is said to be a new military system, its origin must still be said to be the ancient founding of Japan. Although it was said two years ago that it has been a full 70 years since the promulgation of the conscription order, this only refers to referring to Western-style laws and regulations. For example, a tree, the trunk or branches that can be seen on the ground. This is indeed an expression of the last seventy years, but the deeply rooted roots beneath the ground hide a long ancient history of more than 2,500 years. This can be seen in the edict. As long as you read the imperial rescript given to the soldiers, you can understand this even more.

The period when the conscription system was produced certainly contains many myths, but to be honest, we cannot but admire the Yamato nation for having such a history. Recently, it has often been said that changing one's mind has become a major issue at present, but in the early Meiji period, changing one's thinking was especially difficult. The major reason for this was the oppression of a long period of samurai politics of seven hundred years and the deep-rooted habitual practices. Therefore, there is no reason why it was difficult to change one's mind in Meiji 10. After the ten-year war, it was possible to have a completely new look and completely change one's thinking. This proves the magnitude of the sacrifice at that time. However, our ancestors or predecessors turned misfortune into blessing thanks to this sacrifice. Therefore, I not only feel the strength of our nation, but I myself am also very happy. This is turning misfortune into blessing, not a dead end. Continued alternation in any situation is a constant in military strategy. Ogyu Sorai also explained Sun Tzu's Art of War, saying that misfortune and good fortune alternate. Although Sun Tzu's Art of War says so, I believe that our Yamato nation is rich in growth and development in flexibility, which is a living example. During the Kan'ei era, the Tokugawa shogunate was unable to cope with the Shimabara Rebellion, so it retreated and implemented a closed-door policy, finally enjoying a peaceful and prosperous life within the country. At that time, military preparations were very sluggish, and the only commercial port, Nagasaki, only had Dutch and Chinese ships entering and leaving. Even from the overseas situation created by Dutch and Chinese ships, one could know that the military preparations of the great powers were advancing rapidly at that time. There was truly a situation that made it impossible to stick to the rules and live in comfort. Then a great man appeared. This was Takashima Shuhan, a gun manufacturer who belonged to the Nagasaki Magistrate in the Kansei era. This Takashima Shuhan resolutely determined to follow a seasoned artillery officer of the Dutch army and studied hard for four years. After devoting himself to studying armaments, military administration, and tactics for four years, he later suggested reforming the military system. But the officials at that time did not accept this suggestion. He thought that buying guns was acceptable, so he bought guns. Takashima Shuhan, who was quite rich, had exhausted his assets by buying guns and artillery by the early Tenpo era. Then he began training. At that time, many deputies of the daikan (magistrate) of the Hiyama region, Egawa Tarozaemon Hidetatsu, were sent to Takashima's place to study. Other domains also sent people to study. The most people sent to study were the deputies of Egawa Tarozaemon. After countless twists and turns, Japan's first Western-style training began at Takanoura in Nagasaki in Tenpo 11. At that time, China was starting the Opium War. When this information reached Nagasaki, the Nagasaki Magistrate also felt the demands of the times and was moved by Takashima Shuhan's repeated fervent suggestions and was finally adopted by the shogunate. Later, in Tenpo 12, exercises for both infantry and artillery units, cavalry shooting, and artillery live ammunition firing began at Tokumarugahara in Edo. This was the first time the situation of Western training was made public to the world. As a result, there was both praise and criticism. But for Takashima Shuhan, whose reputation was growing, some became jealous, and some worried about losing their jobs, because if they were old-style military scholars and gunners, and once a new method was adopted, their occupations would naturally become a problem. Therefore, many people thought that Takashima Shuhan was a ferocious beast. Such stubborn people and conservative elements under the shogunate formed an alliance and hated Takashima. So they used various methods to frame Takashima, even falsely accusing him to the shogunate, saying:

"Takashima is a bad guy who is violating the shogunate's ban and smuggling private goods into the country to make a fortune. He is storing ammunition and food and building his residence in a dangerous place, plotting a rebellion."

With such a huge crime, he was falsely accused to the shogunate. Therefore, Egawa Tarozaemon was greatly surprised.

The Military System and Takashima Shuhan

Fujita: Among Egawa's disciples was Marshal Oyama Iwao, who can truly be said to be an outstanding talent who surpassed his teacher. He was skilled in artillery and invented the Miyo-Suke gun.

Kashii: So, Takashima Shuhan's achievements made a significant contribution to the new military system. His academic tradition is still passed down to this day. Lieutenant General Arisaka, as well as his father and grandfather, were all disciples of Egawa and inherited Takashima's academic system. Therefore, whether it is Marshal Oyama's explanation or Lieutenant General Arisaka's Soku-Shin gun, they all have a significant connection with Takashima.

Therefore, when Katsu Kaishu, the hero of the late shogunate, compiled "The History of the Army" in Meiji 22 (1889), he practiced at Tokumarugahara at Takashima Shuhan's suggestion. Based on this, our Japanese army system has changed, and this is explicitly recorded in the book. The foundation of the Japanese new military system was laid by Takashima Shuhan, and there is no doubt about this.

Hino: The unity of soldiers and farmers, this has been around since the age of the gods in Japan, right!

Kashii: In the end, although a military system like today's has been established, there have been extremely complex and intricate events. During the Meiji government, in order to return to the situation of the Jinmu era, they spent a great deal of effort on military power, but the situation at that time was as I just said. If you look at it in detail, there were all kinds of weapons and tactics, French-style, British-style, Dutch-style, American-style, etc., each with its own advantages and disadvantages. As for which one had the greatest advantage, they were all more or less equally matched.

Hino: I heard that the tactics are different now, so when the conscription system was implemented, the samurai abandoned their swords and became militiamen. Even if all the people who joined the Qibingdui were commoners or small citizens, they could become samurai, so they all liked to be soldiers. The commoners and small citizens who applied were packed like sardines in a tin. According to what the old people said, when the common people applied to the Qibingdui, as soon as they wrote their names on the list of soldiers, they would immediately get two swords. Once they became soldiers, they would wear white-belted clogs, walking back and forth in their village with great strides and looking very heroic. Although they were originally common people, they would pretend to be alive and well when they saw rice seedlings, saying "Is this how rice is planted?" Such soldiers received Western-style training in the Qibingdui. During the duel between the Choshu and Kokura domains in Moji's Akasaka in Keio 2, the two sides were always making advances and retreats with no definite winner. When the shogunate's troops came to Kokura, the troops of Kokura were always wearing clothes, playing drums and exercising. However, once the Qibingdui came, they fled at the sight of them. Later, the Kokura domain fought, but was forced to Akasaka. After the Battle of Akasaka, on one side were the clothes of the Qibingdui who died in battle, and the shogunate's troops were all wearing helmets and armor and battle mirrors, while the other side was all wearing gauze Western clothes. The gauze was bought from Nagasaki at that time, and an inch cost several ryo at a high price, but the troops of Choshu were all neatly dressed. So someone kicked their corpses and said, "This guy is luxurious enough."

Later, when the shogunate's troops attacked the Choshu soldiers, they never saw the shadow of the army. They only saw people who looked like commoners running around. Feeling very strange, when they beat drums and marched forward in neat steps, the army that looked like commoners immediately disappeared. Thinking that everyone was afraid and ran away, they rushed forward, but were suddenly subjected to simultaneous firing from all sides, were utterly defeated, and returned in defeat. This is the method of using skirmish tactics to fire all at once. This is the great difference between the Western style and the shogunate.

The Painstaking Efforts to Prepare Weapons

Kashii: Let me tell you another recent story. In the early Meiji period, the army was externally oppressed by foreign tribes and internally had chaotic weapons and tactics. After unification, it suddenly became a powerful army, which is truly commendable. The true starting point in the reorganization was ultimately aimed at being used on the battlefield. It was not reorganizing for the sake of reorganizing. It was not organizing for the sake of organizing. The real goal is to defeat the enemy. It is the strategy and tactics to win the war. The so-called strategy is always the same. As for tactics, they are constantly changing depending on weapons and arms. The era of using bows and arrows is completely different tactically from the era of using walking or using horses. Since reorganizing mixed weapons and organizations is certainly not an easy task.

Napoleon I also said that weapons and tactics change once every ten years. This is because they are constantly progressing. If you don't advance, you will retreat, and you will never stop at one point forever. In the early Meiji period, after reorganizing that situation, our sages had long advocated the principle that weapons should be independent and not dependent on foreign countries. As I have already said, since the early Meiji period, it has been either a riot or a civil war, so weapons are independent and not like Toyama School. Mr. Kiyo Yoshimura, an infantry major and instructor at Toyama School, was a very famous shooter, so he was entrusted with designing a special Japanese gun. He went to study in Europe, and as a result, he invented the Murata gun. Later, this Murata gun was used in the Sino-Japanese War. Japan, working hard like this again and again, finally created such an elite and powerful army today, thanks to the difficult management of its predecessors. Today's ever-victorious army did not fall from the sky. Inheriting the science of Takashima Shuhan and Egawa Tarozaemon, Lieutenant General Arisaka manufactured the 31st-style field gun, which was turned by pulling a thick rope and was used during the Russo-Japanese War. The 30th-style bolt-action rifle, in general, weapons are constantly independent and do not rely on foreigners, but it is sad that Japan's iron and steel industry is very backward and never progresses, so it is a major difficulty in weapons independence. Despite this difficulty, a 28-centimeter gun was also manufactured. In addition, what made our Yamato nation raise its eyebrows was that Major Meckel came to our Army University and guided us for about three years, educating the senior officers at that time. Meckel believed that Japan's complex terrain, and the roads at that time were not developed, so Japan had many mountain guns for national defense. Meckel was a very biased and impatient person, always a characteristic person who did things his own way. Although our sages learned from him, they opposed the view that Japan's national defense relied entirely on mountain guns and adopted field guns. This is how our predecessors struggled. This is just something I thought of by chance. Here, it runs through the spirit of our Yamato nation.

Striving for Perfection

Hino: After World War I, the idea of peace had penetrated every corner. Whether in terms of world trends or domestic trends, it was believed that armaments had become a useless burden. Therefore, under this surging public sentiment, the military had no choice but to obey obediently. Before this, in order to protect its own interests, the military needed 25 divisions. Due to the issue of stationing two divisions in Korea, there were several tumultuous scenes in the Diet, and there was even a military order to dissolve the parliament. However, in the end, the military accepted the call to reduce armaments. On the surface, when the national peace craze was raging like crazy, this could only exert the power of the military. For example, the military spared no effort in reducing the amount and preserving the strength. This is something that our Japanese people should thank the government for.

Kashii: Today, we often sing the slogan of making the impossible possible, but in the state after World War I, Britain and the United States were all trying to enslave our East Asia under the banner of maintaining world peace, relying on their own weapons and the League of Nations. At that time, in order to maintain the world's strongest army and to consolidate its own position when necessary, Japan spent countless efforts. It was very convenient in times of emergency, but it was a bit overwhelming in peacetime. At the same time, they wanted to cut the huge military expenses in terms of economy, so they finally proposed to cut two divisions. Therefore, they had to manage very miserably for a long time. According to common sense, after a fearless struggle, they finally maintained and strengthened today's elite army, and accomplished a commendable achievement. People generally like to say the words "simple and serious." Just go to the regimental commander's office and you can see it at a glance. In the regimental commander's office, the regimental flag is enshrined in the cupboard, and this regimental flag fully symbolizes the unity of the team.

The regimental commander's office is completely made of unpainted wood and is only as big as a knee, so the regimental commander works at a simple desk. Where is such a situation? Of course, this is not slandering other organizations, but there is no such simplicity in ordinary large companies. From this point, you can know everything else. By using the method of being as simple and serious as possible, they overcame the economic difficulties and were able to maintain the Japanese army. In other words, this is what it means to make the impossible possible. Mr. Katsu Kaishu once said a sentence, "Deep sleep with definite views." This is a motto that Mr. Katsu Kaishu found in the Dutch books. Human beings must have certain directions and insights. If you grasp this direction, you will sleep deeply on it, that is, you must thoroughly understand it, and then nothing in the world will be impossible. Otherwise, you will regress. Of course, you must have a certain direction, but grasping it is not yet considered a success. The same is true in technical problems. There is a science, and there are axioms, laws, and formulas. But if you are not careful, you will make mistakes, but especially laymen will make other mistakes. So you have to consider unexpected things. Specialists will grasp the definite views on unexpected things, so they are often exposed in the news. On this issue, the impossible is sought to be possible. Looking at it abstractly, looking at it conceptually, you may think that this is a contradictory thing. But when you get into the actual problem, the impossible becomes possible. This is the most important thing to win the Greater East Asia War. Our predecessors have already made the impossible possible. Only because we know this bottom line can we say the words "Deep sleep with definite views." This sentence "Deep sleep with definite views" actually has supreme power, so we are determined to carry out a long-term war with the enemy with a fearless spirit. Because we make the impossible possible, we will win this Greater East Asia War. Just look at the 50-year history of the Japanese army, and you can believe it without a doubt. Recently, the army reorganized the troop materials such as infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineering. It is no longer called an infantry major, but only an army major. If you trace the origin, this was designed during the Russo-Japanese War. Each troop branch thereby fully fulfills its duties and its own responsibilities, and also cooperates closely with each other. It is truly a kind of organic connection body composed of various troop branches. Since this is the case, if you take a wrong step, it is easy to create a cause for mutual restraint and mutual destruction. However, they have gotten along without any gaps in the past. They competed with each other and united with each other. This is the basic factor that makes the Japanese army far superior to other countries' armies. Now that the era of troop branches competing with each other has passed, there is no need to retain troop branches, so troop branches have been abolished.

Although the world is big, there is no other country in the world besides Japan that has a complete army, navy, and air force. Although Britain boasts of its navy, it does not dare to mention its army. Just look at the European War, and you can understand that my words are not false. As for the United States, it certainly has a large army in quantity. But we are not afraid of their quantity. The imperial rescript once said, "Do not insult small enemies, do not fear big enemies." Just eliminate the idea of quantitative determinism. The words in the imperial rescript are by no means limited to concepts and abstractions, but fully express the true beliefs of the Yamato nation. Therefore, it is self-evident who will win.

Hino: We have generally reached a conclusion. Although I am not familiar with military strategy, I have recently read Sun Tzu's Art of War and know that an angry army will be defeated. The enemy is extremely anxious and is completely an angry army. Since an angry army will be defeated, then our belief in victory will be even stronger. (Translated from Weekly Mainichi Magazine)

### A Record of a Visit to the Army Preparatory Schools

It is said that the strength of an army depends on the excellence of its officers. However, the education young children receive greatly influences the quality of these officers. From this perspective, renowned generals should emerge from the current Army Preparatory Schools (Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, Kumamoto, and Sendai). Here is a record of a visit to the Army Preparatory Schools in Sendai and Osaka:

Characteristics of Osaka and Sendai Schools

Osaka—First, let's talk about the characteristics of the Osaka and Sendai schools! What represents the character of Osaka Preparatory School is its school song.

Chrysanthemum Crest

Glory shines upon Chiyoda Hill
Morning and evening, we reverently read the Imperial Rescript
Relying on the Imperial Majesty
We protect our Imperial City
With utmost sincerity and pure loyalty
We practice the way of robustness and perseverance
Beneath Mount Kongo
We scoop the flow of the Kikusu River
We protect our Imperial City

Kusunoki Masashige initiated loyalist troops
Kongo of the righteous army emerges, and the Sekiyama barrier with Kusunoki, resembling the walls of Chiyoda Hill, where the Osaka Army Preparatory School is located. Every speck of soil in this area is undoubtedly permeated with the dignified loyalty of Kusunoki Masashige.

Sendai—The characteristics of the Sendai Preparatory School are no different from other preparatory schools. However, perhaps because the school is built in Sendai, the students always seem to possess the generous character of the people of the Northeast. In terms of disposition, they tend to be taciturn and diligent, and are rich in endurance.

The Sendai Army Preparatory School was originally established in May 1906, like other local preparatory schools, but it was closed in 1924 and reopened in 1937 during the July 7th Incident. The original school building was not in the current location. Many famous figures graduated from this place, such as the war god Kato, General Tada Hayao, General Doihara Kenji, and Lieutenant Colonel Ōkoshi.

Osaka—The reporter visited the school on April 13th, taking the Nankai Koya Line train to Chiyoda Station, and then walking along a cherry blossom-lined path to the school.

After finishing their classes, the students cherish even the slightest amount of time to practice military songs and gymnastics with great vigor.

The strength of the army relies on the excellence of the officers who form the backbone of the military, and the excellence of these officers relies heavily on their early education. Therefore, based on the edict of Emperor Meiji, outstanding youths are selected and gathered in special places for education, to be trained as the future pillars of the nation and the foundation of the Imperial Army, and the Army Preparatory School was established.

As the students are gathered under such a clear banner, each student is an excellent individual. And what the Osaka Army Preparatory School can boast about is its advantageous location.

This area is where Kusunoki Masashige followed Ōe-shi to learn strategy, and studied Chinese and Japanese books at Kanshin-ji.

The principal once said:

"Every preparatory school aims to cultivate national talents with lofty figures as models. The Osaka Army Preparatory School is especially located in Kusunoki Masashige's birthplace, so the mountains that soar into the clouds and even a speck of the relics shine with the sun and moon. Therefore, every student unconsciously has the spirit of loyalty to the emperor and love for the country of Kusunoki Masashige permeating every cell of their body."

Whenever students have spare time, they climb the nearby mountains to recall the image of Kusunoki Masashige. Sometimes they even stay out all night, quietly gazing at the starry sky to comprehend the enduring truth of "repaying the country with death."

Teachers and Students as Father and Child

Sendai—The Sendai Preparatory School is located in the central part of Sendai City, but it is far from the bustling areas of the city. The chrysanthemum crest hangs on the front of the school.

When our delegation arrived at the school, Captain Ninomiya, the adjutant, greeted us.

The student body is divided into several training classes each year, each with a supervisor. The students, who have left their hometowns and are far away from their parents, all respect and love their supervisors, and call them "father." The supervisors act as the students' fathers and take care of everything, so a special bond is formed. But it is not only the supervisors who care for the students. From the principal and military and civilian instructors to the school staff, everyone does.

The principal, Mr. Chida Tei, is a generous and upright elder. During the morning uniform inspection, one student went home to rest due to foot pain. After recovering, he returned to school to report the incident. After the report, the principal told him many small things to pay attention to.

At first glance, the students have not completely lost their childishness. In fact, since their age of admission is between thirteen and fifteen years old, they are of course childish. However, if you look at their demeanor and actions, they are like good soldiers. Shaping the mind through form, this extremely thorough training instills the military spirit into the students in a very short period of time.

Osaka—According to school officials, many of the school's teachers bravely resigned from their positions as middle school principals to work as ordinary teachers, or gave up everything because they had specialized knowledge and learning to educate the students at this school.

"Although I rarely dream of my own children, I often dream of my students." This statement is enough to prove that the teachers at this school are so enthusiastic.

Because the students are still young, some of them still have the habit of bedwetting. The mothers of these children are very worried about this and often come to the school to ask the teachers to take good care of them. The teacher suddenly wakes up the child in the middle of the night and takes him to the bathroom to treat the bedwetting habit. This continues for half a year or even a year. If the children next to him are awakened, it would be an unforgivable matter. Therefore, the teacher always tries hard not to wake up the children sleeping next to him.

Completely like the loving spirit of a mother, to cultivate these children, this kind of hard work and worry is truly extraordinary. In these words, the reporter deeply experienced the kindness of the teachers.

The principal once said:

"The children here are the country's essence. These innocent young children grow into adults in seven or eight years and shoulder the destiny of the nation. We all hold this thought, believing that all children are precious treasures, and we nurture them with this perspective."

In the past, when the missionary masters summoned talented people from all over the world to educate them, to make Mount Kōya a great place to protect the nation, the general policy for training students was "Gold, silver, and silk are not the treasures of the nation; the treasures of the nation are people." This training policy is now seen here again.

Most of the people who come to the Army Preparatory School are outstanding children from national elementary schools and peace schools. Therefore, they are working hard to implement good education so as not to lag behind ordinary children. The principal also said that the work of the preparatory school is very important.

Sendai—Sendai and Osaka are not very different. The daily schedule, from getting up at 5:30 in the morning until going to bed, has detailed regulations, and the students' free time is very limited. The students always have something to do all day long. After roll call in the morning, they wash their faces and go to worship from afar. The Sendai school is on a high hill, with the highest point as the place for remote worship. This place is called Three Gods Peak. On Three Gods Peak, which is covered with green turf and flowers, there is a remote worship site and a majestic shrine. The entire school recognizes this place as a sacred ground. Everyone believes that the spirit of the school resides here, and for the students, it becomes a place of spiritual encouragement.

Every morning, the students come here to worship the Imperial Palace, ancestors, and parents from afar, and recite the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers.

After breakfast, the day's classes begin. After dinner, they sing and march. Lining up in neat formations, the tallest are in the front, getting shorter towards the back, with the small soldiers who are four or five feet tall at the end. Everyone waves their hands and sings the song of the war god Kato loudly, which feels very cute. Captain Ninomiya said that although the students in the second or third grade are still small, their muscles are already strong. Indeed, when they rub themselves with dry cloth in the morning, they all have healthier bodies than adults.

Osaka—The students get up at 5:30 am (6:30 am in winter), do morning exercises, visit the shrine, worship from afar (the Imperial Palace, Ise Grand Shrine, parents), recite the Sacred Edict, sweep, and tidy up their weapons and luggage, and have breakfast. When practicing the morning worship of their parents, they all sit on flat stone slabs. The direction of each prefecture in the country is engraved on the stone slabs, and the students know the direction of their hometowns based on this. Facing their parents from afar, they say in their hearts, "Good morning!" Their feelings at that time are just like being in front of their parents' knees, performing a respectful greeting. Parents who know that their lovely sons are practicing remote worship from Osaka, at that moment, return the greeting solemnly. Parents will surely be even more respectful of their sons who respect discipline and bow cautiously when they return home for vacation.

Parents can rest assured to send their children to school

Osaka—The Army Preparatory School has a student meeting place. They are divided into rooms for wisdom, benevolence, courage, and defense, and they sleep on straw mats, feeling completely at home. There are go and chess games, as well as places to buy daily necessities such as snacks and soap.

On the second floor there is a cultivation room. There is a wooden statue of Kusunoki Masashige, and photos of Kusunoki Masashige's relics, handwriting, etc. are on display. One room preserves the artifacts of former students. Relics of those who gloriously gave their lives in the Russo-Japanese War, World War I, and the current war are on display, so students receive living lessons every day.

Sendai—When talking about Kato, the war god who graduated from Sendai, none of the students fail to stand in awe. As many as 80% of the school's graduates become air force officers. One reason is the many days of skiing, which improved the passing rate of the aptitude test, but the most important thing is the great influence given to the students by the war god Kato.

To conclude my feelings about visiting the preparatory school, it can be said that the education of the students is perfect. The school's purpose is to train future officers and cadres of the Imperial Army, but its educational policies and implementation guidelines are considered to be models for ordinary schools to imitate. I have no other comments, only complete admiration.

The educational guidelines of the preparatory school, it is said, are exactly the same for the six schools in Osaka, Sendai, Nagoya, Hiroshima, and Kumamoto. Its spirit can be described in one sentence: to follow the Imperial Rescript.

In short, parents and brothers who send their children to the preparatory school do not have to worry. Even if there is no absolutely perfect personality in society, it can be said that the school is making the greatest effort to train talents in this direction. To prove that this is not a false statement, just look at the training of the school's instructors and soldiers, or meet the students again after ten or fifteen days of admission, and you can immediately see, and you will always feel that there is a big difference in spirit and group.

Parents and brothers who prevent their children from attending this school are urged to change their minds and send their children to enroll. Don't think that it is only possible for those who have completed two years of middle school; anyone who has graduated from national elementary school can apply. (Translated from Weekly Asahi)

### Military Spirit

The following is a portion of the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers regarding military spirit:

"Our army has been commanded by the Emperor for generations... Now, we intend to reform the military system and glorify our country. For fifteen years, the army and navy systems have achieved today's scale. The great power of the military belongs to Us, and We entrust its administration to Our subjects, to be faithfully passed down from generation to generation. The Emperor retains the meaning of holding the great power of civil and military affairs, hoping not to repeat the mistakes of the Middle Ages and later. We are the Grand Marshal of you soldiers. We rely on you as Our limbs, and you should look up to Us as the head. Whether We can protect the country, repay the grace of Heaven, and honor the virtues of Our ancestors, depends entirely on whether you soldiers can fulfill your duties. If Our national prestige does not flourish, you should share Our worries. If Our martial power is demonstrated and its glory shines, then We will share its praise with you. You should each guard your posts, be of one mind with Us, and devote your efforts to protecting the country, so that the people of Our country may forever enjoy the blessings of peace, and the strength of Our country may transform into the glory of the world. We especially hope that you soldiers will abide by the following instructions:

"1. Soldiers should make loyalty their fundamental duty... Do not be misled by public opinion, do not ask about politics, only fulfill your duty, firmly uphold loyalty, and deeply understand the principle that duty is as heavy as Mount Tai, and death is as light as a feather..."

"1. Soldiers should uphold proper etiquette... Lower ranks who receive orders from superiors are receiving Our orders... Furthermore, superiors should not lightly insult or be arrogant towards subordinates. Except when maintaining dignity for official business, they should strive to be sincere and loving, and unite from top to bottom to diligently serve the King's affairs." (Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)

### The Cause of Great Victory in the Battle of Mukden

"The Russian army suffered an unprecedented defeat in the unprecedented battle under Mukden. This must be said to be a major lesson in confirming the idea that we cannot, with our current military administration, confront Japan." (Reported by the Russian newspaper "Novy Krai" regarding the Battle of Mukden) The Battle of Mukden forty years ago made Russia realize the weakness of its own military power, and finally became a turning point in the Russo-Japanese War. In this decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, we are once again celebrating this festival, and its significance is extremely profound. What role did the Battle of Mukden play in the history of the Russo-Japanese War? What was its course?

The Battle of Mukden, in the Japanese history of the Russian Expedition, is called the second phase of the second operation, and it was a decisive battle between the Japanese and Russian armies. In the first operation, the Japanese army drove back the Russian army and completely occupied Korea. In the second operation, the Japanese army further swept away the Russian army in Manchuria, defeating the enemy at Liaoyang and the Sha River. At that time, although the Russian army was larger than the Japanese army, the Japanese army bravely improved its battle tactics and was unstoppable. It was truly said to be invincible, but the Japanese army's losses were not small, and the lack of artillery shells was the biggest worry. At that time, the Japanese army actively increased its troops while replenishing its military supplies, waiting for the opportunity to launch a major decisive battle. At the same time, the Russian army also longed to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese army. Because at that time, the Russian Socialist Party's arrogance was greatly increased, and the Tsar urgently needed to receive news of a major victory in the Far East in order to eliminate the danger of revolution. Under the same intention of both armies, the curtain on the Battle of Mukden was slowly lifted. The reason why the Japanese army chose the beginning of March, the end of the freezing period in Manchuria, was that it could avoid the coldest weather in Manchuria and also use the frozen ground to make the movement of the large army light and easy.

Thus, the all-out general attack began on March 1st. The Russian army also wanted to reverse the many past defeats in this battle, so Commander-in-Chief Kuropatkin had high expectations and ordered that there should be no retreat in this battle, and that anyone who retreated in battle would be executed by shooting. The greatest fierce battle in history unfolded under the intention of the two armies.

As a result, the Japanese army won a decisive victory in this battle. The Russian newspaper "Novoye Vremya" lamented: "The great defeat in the Battle of Mukden made our three armies lose their spirit. St. Petersburg is of course no exception. Even in the remote countryside, friends and relatives are at a loss, and are shrouded in the gloom of the flood, and the darkness of the future is like a dense mist obscuring the sun and the sky. We are deeply worried and do not know what to do." Although other newspapers still occasionally made arrogant remarks, the idea that "the war should not be continued and should be ended as soon as possible within a dignified range" became increasingly strong, and finally envoys were sent to seek peace.
