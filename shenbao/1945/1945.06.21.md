### Bloody Battles Continue in Southern Okinawa; Japanese Forces Launch General Assault; Mobile Force Discovered Near Miyako Island

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since the 16th and 17th, enemy forces in the southern Shimajiri district of Okinawa Island have gradually encroached upon the eastern half of the battle line. However, on the 17th, Japanese forces launched a fierce counterattack and continued fighting to recapture independent high ground in the Yaeju-Dake area. The battle line had momentarily stabilized. However, since the morning of the 18th, under the cover of intense artillery bombardment, especially in the east at Mount Yaeju, an incredibly fierce battle unfolded. At present, Japanese forces are steadfastly securing the line from the southern foot of Mount Yaeju, south of Gushichanza, to the west coast. The situation on that front is chaotic, with both sides locked in a confusing and seemingly continuous, tragic, bloody battle.

Ryukyu Islands Base, 20th (Central News Agency) – The enemy in the southern Okinawa Island area is pressing upon Mount Yaeju from the east coast, gradually penetrating the southern Japanese lines. Japanese forces are engaging in bayonet charges, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and continuing to fight bravely. In the Oroku area, a confused, intertwined battle has developed, with fierce fighting erupting everywhere. The Japanese naval forces launched a general assault at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, committing suicide charges into enemy lines. The situation on that front appears to have reached its final stages.

Ryukyu Islands Base, 20th (Central News Agency) – The weather in the Okinawa area on the 19th remained poor, significantly hindering air operations on both sides. Only about 90 enemy planes attacked the island chain. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 19th, an enemy mobile force consisting of two fleets, with five aircraft carriers, one battleship, and three cruisers as their core, appeared near Miyako Island. Also, near the main island, one aircraft carrier, one battleship, and several cruisers and destroyers appeared. In addition, over a hundred enemy transport ships were anchored in the Kerama Islands area.

### American Military Correspondent Discusses Difficulties of Pacific Warfare

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New York, a military correspondent for the New York Times discussed the supply difficulties faced by the American forces in the Pacific Theater, pointing out the following: The war in the Pacific is even more difficult than the war in Europe. The biggest problems are long distances and supply. Supplying the war against Japan from the very beginning of American involvement until the end of the European war resulted in over a million American casualties and missing personnel. But conquering Japan will result in even greater losses. To minimize losses, the United States must deploy vast quantities of supplies in the war against Japan. Where only one transport ship was needed in the European theater, three or more are needed in the Pacific. Feeling the shortage of transport ships in the Pacific Theater, the United States is now converting one hundred Victory-class freighters into troop transports, and one hundred and seventy-two older Liberty-class freighters are also being converted into troop transports. Sending an armed infantry division requires six or seven freighters and an equal number of troop transports. Transporting a mechanized division requires even more. An American mechanized division has 269 tanks, 80 self-propelled guns, 637 heavy trucks, 601 tractors, small cars, armored vehicles, and 555 tank repair vehicles, and 471 boats. Maintaining the tanks of one division requires replenishing 1.5 million tons of spare parts annually, which must be transported to the port of departure in 600 trucks. Furthermore, maintaining the activity of 400 warships requires replenishing 474,000 tons of spare parts annually. A round trip between the Pacific Theater and the base takes sixteen weeks. An infantry division fighting for one day consumes 500 tons of ammunition. A mechanized division advancing 100 miles consumes 75,000 gallons of gasoline. Although B-29-type planes have not yet been used extensively in the Pacific, when 1,000 B-29 planes are launched, they require 1,000 tons of ammunition, 15,000 tons of bombs, 30,000 tons of gasoline, 40,000 tons of lubricants, and 44,000 tons of other supplies. For the landing operation at Lingayen Gulf, a total of 1,033 ships were deployed, with 277,000 naval personnel. For the landing operation on Iwo Jima, a total of 800 ships were deployed, with over 220,000 naval personnel. From this perspective, the difficulties of Pacific warfare are even greater than these figures suggest.

American Casualties on Okinawa Increasing Daily

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Due to the desperate and fierce attacks by Japanese land, sea, and air forces, the enemy invading Okinawa has suffered heavy casualties. American journalist Lawrence criticized, saying that the losses in the Okinawa operation were heavier than those at Pearl Harbor, causing a major backlash in American domestic opinion regarding the unprecedented damage to American forces. The Japanese ground forces defending the southern part of the island have killed or wounded 75,000 enemy soldiers to date. Japanese special attack units are also continuing to launch fierce attacks daily on enemy fleets and airfields near the main island, causing enemy losses and casualties to increase sharply every day. To conceal these enormous sacrifices, enemy officers continue to use cunning tactics to report fewer losses than actually occurred. However, according to a Guam broadcast on the 16th, the damage to American forces on Okinawa was unexpectedly severe. According to figures released on May 24th, the total number of dead and missing is estimated at 35,116, twice that of Iwo Jima, with the majority being naval personnel. Due to the Japanese special attack unit's activity, deaths and injuries are even more severe.

### Balikpapan Continues Under Shelling

Southwest Pacific, 20th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces are still subjecting Balikpapan to naval bombardment. On the 19th, four minesweepers entered the bay and began minesweeping operations. Japanese forces responded with heavy fire from fortified positions on land. Subsequently, one of the enemy minesweepers suddenly struck a mine and sank. The other three, fearing Japanese artillery fire, fled seaward.

### American Minesweeper Sunk

Central News Agency – According to a Washington dispatch, the US Navy recently announced that the minesweeper Impeccable, which once served as a guard ship during President Roosevelt's overseas travels, was sunk by a Japanese special attack plane on April 6 in the waters off Okinawa Island, resulting in the deaths of 61 crew members and injuries to 78. The Impeccable was originally a destroyer but was later converted into a minesweeper. It was assigned to the Pacific region in January of this year.

### Japanese Privy Council Plenary Session Held at the Imperial Palace

Vote on Wartime Emergency Measures Law

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – At 9:30 AM on the 20th, the Privy Council held a review committee for the Wartime Emergency Measures Bill at the Imperial Palace to deliberate on matters submitted for imperial inquiry. Subsequently, with His Majesty the Emperor in attendance, a plenary session was held from 11:00 AM, with Chairman and Vice-Chairman Hiranuma and Shimizu, as well as all advisors, in attendance. The Wartime Emergency Measures Bill was presented, reported by Chairman Shimizu, and put to a vote, which was immediately passed.

### Japanese Business World Prepares for Decisive Battle Posture

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – As the war situation intensifies daily, the major Japanese zaibatsu, such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, are all urgently preparing for a thoroughgoing decisive battle posture of resistance. This inclination of the Japanese business world deserves serious attention. The Mitsui zaibatsu has taken the lead, deciding that the Mitsui main family will forego all stock interest during the war and has improved its concrete organization into a decisive battle posture. Its affiliated companies number 173 in Japan, with businesses spanning commerce, finance, mining, heavy chemical industry, and various industrial sectors. In the face of the decisive battle on the home islands, the coordination of these businesses requires painstaking effort. Local Supervisory Offices have been established, dividing the country into administrative regions: Kanto, Tokai, Kin-ki, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Then, the managing directors of directly controlled companies, representing the head office, are stationed in each region. Under them, a Mitsui Cooperation Council is established to assist, aiming to powerfully manage the companies under their jurisdiction in each region. The Mitsubishi zaibatsu is also taking steps similar to Mitsui, dispatching key figures to major regions, urgently preparing for a decisive battle posture. The Sumitomo zaibatsu has established a Wartime General Mobilization Council in its head office and has established a General Supervisor and assisting organizations, such as a General Headquarters and Deputy General Headquarters, to control all business operations in various regions. Their activities have already begun. If the country is divided, they all have powerful authority to take appropriate actions. Therefore, such measures can be described as a unified decisive battle posture of the zaibatsu, and it is worthy of note that the giant zaibatsu are able to prepare such measures.

### Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang – Overview of Fenghua

— Yifei

To get from Ningbo County to Fenghua, one can take a long-distance bus operated by the Hua Zhong Railway, a journey of 32 kilometers. There are six main stops along the Ning-Feng Highway: Shique, Yinshe, Hengzhang, Jiangkou, Loutang, and Daqiao (within Fenghua). Before April 26th of this year, the fare was only 2,100 yuan, but it has now risen to 5,500 yuan. Due to the high fare, most travelers between the two places have switched to taking steamers to Xiwu Town in Fenghua. The steamer fare is only 700 yuan, but Xiwu is still 10 li (5 km) from Fenghua County, so one still needs to take a rickshaw. On the other hand, the bus can go directly to Daqiao Station, which is the advantage of the bus over the steamer.

A Glimpse Along the Way

On the morning of May 26th, at 8:30 AM, the reporter took a bus from the Ningbo South Gate Ning-Feng Bus Station to Fenghua. Along the way, farmers were busy with agricultural work. The bus stopped briefly at Jiangkou Station. The Jiangkou River is wide, but the water flow is shallow. Small boats travel back and forth, relying on boatmen to wade and push them, making it very laborious. According to a local on the bus, every spring, mountain water flows down from the mountains, and the water level rises significantly, filling the entire river.

Midway, there is Yuanzhen Bridge, a very long wooden bridge built by Allied soldiers. There is still a stone tablet next to the bridge to commemorate their achievement. (This bridge is the only major bridge on the Ning-Feng Highway, with a total length of over 20 zhang (approximately 66 meters).

At 10:30 AM, we arrived at Daqiao Station in Fenghua. Since there were no cars available at the station, we walked to the county government for an interview. Along the way, we passed Jinping Mountain, which has a Zhongshan Park built on the mountain. The reporter took the opportunity to climb the mountain. On the mountain is the Zhongzheng Library, which was destroyed during the war and now only the shell remains. There are three temples: Upper, Middle, and Lower Pagoda Temples, all very grand. It is said that this is the burial place of the famous monk "Cloth Bag Monk" of Dajiao Yuelin Temple during the Liang Dynasty.

Shizuoka, Fukuoka, and Other Cities Hit by Incendiary Bombs

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Around 200 B-29 type aircraft from the Mariana Islands base, about 90 of which entered the Toyohashi area gradually around 0:40 AM on the 20th, dropped incendiary bombs on the vicinity, and retreated south around 3:00 AM. Another 210 enemy aircraft dropped incendiary bombs on the vicinity of Shizuoka City and fled, causing fires in various parts of Shizuoka and Toyohashi Cities. The fire in Shizuoka City was extinguished around 5:00 AM, while the fire in Toyohashi City was not extinguished until 8:00 AM.

Osaka, 20th (Central News Agency) – From 11:00 PM on the 19th to 2:00 AM on the 20th, over 30 enemy B-29-type aircraft advanced northward from the southern end of the Kii Channel towards the central parts of Nara and Mie Prefectures, entered Wakasa Bay, dropped naval mines, and disappeared via the Tokai Military District.

Fukuoka, 20th (Central News Agency) – The 4th Military District Headquarters announced at 6:20 PM on June 20th that approximately 60 B-29 enemy aircraft from the Mariana Islands base had, from around 10:30 PM on June 19th to 0:30 AM on June 20th, entered Kyushu proper from the eastern sea of Miyazaki Prefecture in single aircraft and small formations, dropping bombs on Fukuoka City for approximately two hours. At the same time, 10 B-29 enemy aircraft, entering from the Bungo Channel, dropped naval mines near the Kanmon Straits. Fires broke out in various parts of Fukuoka City, but were largely extinguished by 2:30 AM through the efforts of military personnel and civilians.

Fukuoka, 20th (Central News Agency) – At 8:20 AM, approximately 30 enemy F4U and F6F small aircraft from the Okinawa base entered the Omura area via the sea west of Ogasa and attacked, and disappeared near Nagasaki around 9:00 AM.

General City Appearance

The largest street in Fenghua is the Daqiao Straight Street and Heng Street in Daqiao Town, which are about two li (1 km) long and are the center of prosperity for the entire county. Next are County Front Street, Bridge East Street, Zhongzheng Road, etc. There are mostly general merchandise stores. Different from other places, the southern goods stores also sell western tobacco, which is quite unique.

Transportation Overview

Before the war, transportation in Fenghua was quite developed, with the following highways:

Ning-Fenghua Highway Trunk Line: From Yushantou within the county to outside the county seat, it is 9 kilometers long and is managed by the China Railway Company. There is one bus that runs between Ningbo and Fenghua in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Ning-Fenghua Highway Branch Line: Jiangkou Section, from Jiangkou to Xikou, is 21 kilometers long. Currently, the section from Jiangkou to Xikou has been completed, and trucks run to connect with the Fenghua-Xinchang Highway.

Fenghua-Xinchang Highway: From Fenghua to Xinchang County, the entire route is 26 kilometers. Trucks travel between the two counties on weekdays.

Fenghua-Haining Highway: This highway runs directly from Fenghua to Haining County. After being destroyed during the war, it has not been repaired to this day because it is close to the war zone.

Currently, except for the Ning-Fenghua Highway, which is still running as usual, all others have been temporarily suspended due to environmental factors.

Waterways: The main rivers in Fenghua are the County River, Jin River, and Mao River. The upper reaches are too shallow for anything but bamboo rafts. The lower reaches are navigable by civilian boats. All three rivers connect to the Fenghua River. The Fenghua River is 26 kilometers long and can accommodate small steamers and sailboats, leading directly to the Yong River and flowing into the sea.

Official Roads: The main road in Fenghua is the "County East Road," which runs from the east gate of the county directly to Xiwu, is 10 kilometers long, and is passable by rickshaws and carts. In addition, there are official roads to Xiaowangmiao and other places that are accessible to vehicles.

Specialties and Prices

The Fenghua water peaches are famous throughout the country, and the most famous production areas are Xikou and Shadi, which are 40 li (20 km) from the county seat. Before the war, locals would put specially made paper covers on the peach trees after they had fruited to protect them carefully. Therefore, after ripening, they were unusually large, delicious, and sweet, and had no blemishes. Nowadays, due to excessive costs, high labor costs, and an unfavorable environment, the peaches are left to grow naturally, so people in the cities can no longer enjoy this delicacy. According to the locals, the peach trees in the village stop producing sweet fruit five years after they begin to bear fruit. Now, due to difficult living conditions, many locals saw down the peach trees for fuel.

On the day the reporter arrived in Fenghua, the price of rice was 120,000 to 130,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg), oil was 880 yuan per jin (approximately 0.5 kg), vegetables were 320 yuan per jin, pork was 1,100 yuan per city jin, and matches were 110 yuan per box.

Currently, Fenghua is severely lacking in housing, so it is difficult for people from other places to find a house. Furthermore, there are no inns or hotels for travelers to stay in. Recently, the rent for a simple room is about one dou (approximately 10 kg) of rice per month. City housing in the busy areas costs about two to four dou of rice per month.

Area and Population

The southwest of Fenghua County is high and mountainous, while the northeast is relatively low. The maximum east-west distance of the entire county is 82 kilometers, and the north-south distance is 40 kilometers. The total area of the county is 1,500 square kilometers.

The entire county, excluding two direct-administered towns (Fengzhong Town and Daqiao Town), is divided into five districts, totaling 43 towns. In reality, there are only 38 townships, with the other five being non-peaceful areas. Of these 38 townships, 12 are safe areas, 14 are semi-safe areas, and 12 are dangerous areas. The population statistics are 302 bao (neighborhoods), 3,310 jia (groups of households), 41,836 households, and a total population of 170,858, including 86,741 males and 84,117 females.

As for the state of public order, of the 38 townships, 19 have self-defense force organizations. In addition, Allied forces and the 10th Division of the National Army are stationed in various important strongholds.

Land Overview

The total number of mu (approx. 667 m²) of land in the entire county (including guerrilla areas) is 788,018.95 mu, including 332,449.83 mu of paddy fields, 67,454.02 mu of dry land (used for planting miscellaneous grains), 376,373.28 mu of mountainous land, and 11,741.82 mu of marshland.

There are a total of 141 villages in the rural areas. The landlord with the most land owns only 500-600 mu. Before the war, tenant farmers paid two hundred jin (approx. 100 kg) of grain to the landowners for both seasons combined. Later, due to rural "grain requisitioning," this was reduced to one hundred jin of rent grain per mu per year. However, the current situation is slightly different. Those who plant "big fields" pay the landowner 167 jin of rent grain per mu per year, while those who plant "small fields" pay the "big field" landowner about 70-80 jin of rent grain per mu per year (in mid-July), and the landowner divides it into two seasons, 40 jin each time, for a total of 80 jin.

Land Tax and County Government Expenses

In 1943, the tax rate in Fenghua County was 30 yuan per mu for paddy fields, 20 yuan per mu for dry land, and 4 yuan per mu for mountainous and marshland. It was estimated that over 7.68 million yuan could be collected. After deducting a 15% levy collection fee, the actual tax revenue was only over 4.417 million yuan.

The distribution situation was that the provincial government took three-quarters, and the county government took the remaining one-quarter. However, at that time, the county government's finances were very tight, so only 100,000 yuan was sent to the provincial government that year. The remaining 3,213,360 yuan was later approved by the provincial government to be used for the county government's expenses.

The 1944 tax rate was increased to 60 yuan for paddy fields, 25 yuan for dry land, and 6 yuan for mountainous and marshland. Collection began in September, and the total amount collected by the end of the year was over 10.364 million yuan. The distribution method was 40% for the province and 60% for the county. The levy collection fee was also changed to 20%. The total amount to be remitted to the province was over 3.316 million yuan, and 1.890729 million yuan has already been remitted.

When the reporter visited the county government, the facilities were very simple, and the messenger in the communication room wore patched clothing. Afterwards, the political personnel of the county said that the county was originally a third-class county, but was later upgraded to a second-class county. However, most of the revenue comes from land tax, but in recent years, the county administration has not been able to advance smoothly, so there are many fields that are in arrears with taxes. According to statistics, in 1943, the fields in arrears with taxes totaled 20,468 mu, 17,913 mu of dry land, 128,383 mu of mountainous land, and 451 mu of cemetery land. In 1944, there were 41,768 mu of paddy fields, 21,243 mu of dry land, 153,074 mu of mountainous land, and 693 mu of marshland. Looking at the amount of land in arrears, it is gradually increasing, so the county's own expenses are very difficult. The funds allocated by the provincial government, taking July to December of 1944 as an example, totaled 72,000 yuan, while the actual monthly expenditure was over 200,000 yuan. Although it is now difficult to increase funding, it is still felt that income is insufficient to cover expenditure.

Editorial

### Cracking Down on the Discounting Craze

In economic theory, "cash shortage" is what is known as "deflation." The benefit of deflation lies in preventing those who hold capital from having excess purchasing power, thereby making it impossible to use this excess purchasing power to engage in material hoarding. Therefore, it can naturally become one of the methods for stabilizing prices. However. The current "cash shortage" in the market is drastically different from the "deflation" in economic theory.

Since the reason for the current "cash shortage" in the market is not the result of the authorities implementing a deflation policy, we should conduct separate research into the causes of the so-called "cash crunch." The fact is very obvious that the occurrence of this "cash crunch" is an unnatural and unreasonable phenomenon. Looking back at the financial market conditions in the past six months to a year, a "cash crunch" phenomenon also occurred before and after the issuance of 500-yuan and 1000-yuan bills, during which artificial reasons were also very obvious. At that time, some cunning financial operators already had the intention of raising the discount rate to seek personal gain, but later the financial authorities handled it appropriately and did not cause serious consequences. Recently, the normal business of some financial operators has not been able to develop for various reasons, so most of them are engaged in illegal profit-making activities. The main reason for this cash panic is that some financial operators deliberately hoard cash and issue payment orders and promissory notes indiscriminately. On the other hand, it is broken down into smaller pieces, and many discounters appear on the streets to seek extra profits, so the discount rate has increased from several percentage points to more than 20%.

This artificial "cash crunch" has now caused at least two very bad consequences: first, it poses a serious threat to the lives of ordinary people, that is, the vast majority of people. The amount of their income, on the one hand, has been greatly discounted by the crazy rise in prices. For example, last month, the income of an ordinary salaried class was about 100,000 yuan, which could buy one shi of rice; now, it can't even buy two dou, and has been discounted to 20,000 yuan. Now it seems that these 100,000 yuan are all checks, and what is exchanged is a payment order or a promissory note, and then it has to be cashed at a discount rate of 15% to 25%, so the actual income is less than 10% of last month! In addition to devising other countermeasures for price increases, appropriate countermeasures should be devised quickly for the unexpected exploitation of the majority of people caused by the "cash crunch." The second bad consequence is that some financial operators, in order to create a "cash crunch," are holding back cash and issuing payment orders and promissory notes indiscriminately, gradually causing a malignant expansion of credit currency. That is to say, in today's situation where the country is striving to limit currency issuance to avoid stimulating prices, various banks and businesses have become disguised currency issuance agencies to stimulate prices. If limiting the amount of cash in circulation is the authorities' "deflation" measure to prevent price increases, then the current facts prove that this method only deprives the small purchasing power of the vast majority of people, while condoning a few manipulators to use credit currency such as payment orders to manipulate the market. They are not affected by the restriction of cash circulation. On the contrary, the restriction of cash circulation allows them to engage in hoarding and speculation in the same way by issuing and using credit currency such as payment orders without restrictions, and the risk is borne by the country and the Central Bank. This is such an unreasonable and dangerous phenomenon! What's more, counterfeit payment orders have been found in the market repeatedly!

Due to the above-mentioned dangerous phenomenon, we urge the authorities to immediately take the following emergency measures to deal with the "cash crunch":

First, the Central Bank should reasonably supply cash to various banks and businesses. The cash supply of the Central Bank's Issuing Bureau to Shanghai banks should be reasonably adjusted in the future. It is reported that the current daily supply of a fixed amount of cash cannot be reasonably distributed to various banks and businesses in practice, and the total amount for each week or half month should be fully supplied so that it can be planned and then rationally distributed to various banks and businesses according to the actual situation of the market.

Second, the issuance of credit currency to various banks and businesses originally had three systems: the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank, the Silver Union Reserve, and the Qian Union. Excluding the Yokohama Specie Bank system, our Silver Union and Qian Union have relatively strict hierarchical regulations on the issuance of payment orders and promissory notes. However, the actual amount issued and exchanged by various banks and businesses inevitably involves illegal and indiscriminate practices. For example, the indiscriminate issuance of excessively large and small denominations has extremely serious drawbacks. In the future, the qualifications of banks and businesses that are allowed to issue payment orders should be strictly regulated. Those who do not meet the qualifications should not be allowed to issue payment orders, and those who have already issued them should be ordered to recover them as soon as possible to prevent abuses. Banks and businesses shall not arbitrarily restrict withdrawals from depositors or change payments to payment orders, etc., to protect the lives of the general public.

In addition, it is an important measure to crack down on high discount rates, but if the above two measures can be implemented, even if there is no crackdown, the practice of high-interest discounting and exploitation will gradually subside.

### ### U.S. Commander in the India-Burma Theater Replaced

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Lieutenant General Sultan, commander of the U.S. forces in the India-Burma Theater, has returned to Washington this time and has been concurrently appointed by Lieutenant General Holman, deputy commander of the Southeast Asia Allied Forces. It is reported that Sultan served as Deputy Commander to Stillwell in 1943 and went to India, and will then engage in commanding operations in Burma.

### ### Chongqing to Convene Fourth Wartime Council on Schedule

The CCP will not send representatives to attend

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the first meeting of the Fourth National Political Council will be convened on July 7th.

Central News Agency, Yan'an: According to a dispatch from Yan'an, the Chongqing side has decided to convene the National Political Council in Chongqing on July 7th. The CCP has announced that it will not send its party's council members to attend, which exposes the increasingly fierce friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party recently. The reasons given by the CCP side, according to the person in charge of the CCP Central Committee, are: Since September of last year, the CCP, the Democratic League, and the general democratic masses have requested the Kuomintang to abolish one-party dictatorship, convene a meeting of representatives of various political parties, establish a provisional coalition government, and implement general elections after the war, and convene a National Assembly, but the Kuomintang refused. The Kuomintang did not consult the CCP and other political parties in advance regarding the convening of the Fourth National Political Council on July 7th. The National Political Council and its members are considered to be a dictatorial organization by the Kuomintang. The National Assembly is completely occupied by the Kuomintang, which may cause division among the people and outbreak of internal strife. When the National Political Council is convened in the future, it will be forced to pass various reactionary concrete measures of the Kuomintang. If passed, it will be a serious mistake. It is reported that the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang only decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12th, and did not mention the powers of the National Assembly and the issue of delegates to the Assembly. It is planned to convene the National Political Council on July 7th to solicit opinions from outside the party before making a formal decision. The means are extremely cunning. At the same time, in Mao Zedong's political report at the Seventh National Congress in Yan'an, he opposed the convening of the National Assembly by the Kuomintang, denied the legitimacy of the Assembly, and frankly criticized this as Chongqing's attempt to incite civil war. Chongqing originally planned to use the National Political Council to cover up the truth, but was again opposed by the CCP. The CCP's failure to send representatives to attend further indicates that the CCP has severed ties with the National Assembly, and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has deteriorated further due to the issue of the National Assembly.

### ### Elite Japanese Troops in South China Occupy San'nan, Jiangxi Province. Fierce Battle for Dingnan Underway.

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - The elite troops of the Japanese South China Army launched an attack on the Seventh War Zone of the Chongqing government in early June, and soon captured Sannan (Longnan, Qiannan, and Dingnan), Jiangxi Province, a counterattack base of the Seventh War Zone of the Chongqing government. The Chongqing government's broadcast on the 16th also acknowledged this fact as follows: The Chongqing army in Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces, after receiving reinforcements, launched a fierce battle with the Japanese army for Dingnan on the morning of the 16th. Fierce battles also broke out in the western area of the area. Also near Longti, they are currently attacking the Japanese army that occupied Anyuan, northeast of the area.

Guangdong, 20th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army launched operations in the Sannan area this time, they will directly encircle the Chongqing army with several columns of troops from the north and south, unexpectedly, and completely destroy the Chongqing army's base in one fell swoop, completing a major annihilation battle. On June 1st, the Japanese army dispatched two columns of troops from the Guangdong area, one column of troops from the Huizhou area, and formed one column of troops from Shaoguan, a key point on the Yuehan Line, and Nanxiong, the former base of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, and launched an attack from three sides simultaneously. On the 15th and 16th, they arrived in the Sannan area and launched a pincer attack on the main force of the 12th Army, the 63rd and 65th Armies, of the Seventh War Zone of the Chongqing army, totaling about 60,000 troops, and are currently expanding the results of the battle. The Chongqing army was also caught off guard by the sudden attack of the Japanese army and lost its composure. It failed to transport various collected materials and military supplies, resulting in all of them being captured by the Japanese army. The strength of the Seventh War Zone of the Chongqing army has been completely destroyed by this attack. Although the Chongqing army had previously claimed that the preparations for the counterattack had been completed, in reality it was nothing more than empty slogans. We can also know from the fact that the Chongqing generals Yu Hanmou and others retreated without fighting a single battle that the Chongqing side had long lost its will to fight.

Contents of Kotowski's Testimony

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Moscow: Sixteen Polish leaders were tried again in Moscow yesterday, and the witnesses for the prosecution were also questioned in detail. The first witness for the prosecution was Czertlinski, a 36-year-old journalist. He testified, "I was a member of the Polish National Army until mid-summer of 1942, serving as the commander-in-chief of the Second Army in the Vilnius region, and later served as the main task of propaganda and various intelligence in the region." Regarding whether he had received instructions from the Polish secret government, he replied, "Before the Soviet army entered, the government issued various orders based on diplomatic relations." The prosecutor Afanasyev hurriedly asked after hearing this, "What are diplomatic relations?" He replied, "Because the Soviet army at that time was indeed regarded as the enemy." He continued to testify, "On February 16, 1944, I received instructions from the secret government saying that the Soviet Union should be regarded as an enemy invading our country, and that all eastern regions should be regarded as enemy-occupied areas. All official propaganda activities are only through the dissemination of leaflets and pamphlets, etc." Following Czertlinski, Kotowski, the acting prime minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London, was questioned. The prosecutor asked in a stern voice, "Have you issued instructions to teach them to organize various acts of terrorism?" Kotowski replied, "The issuance of this instruction was ordered by the London authorities. The content of this instruction is nothing more than returning national power to our Polish people, so the issuance of the instruction is to enable them to seize national power, and even if it fails, the independence of Poland must be defended." The prosecutor asked, "How to defend it?" He replied, "Try to use counter-propaganda and various intelligence work." He also asked, "Is it just these two tasks?" He replied, "Yes." Later, the prosecutor's questioning of the witnesses for the prosecution and Kotowski involved issues such as illegal organization's internal meetings and contact with the Polish army in the Vilnius region. The second witness for the prosecution was Anponowaks, 23 years old. He testified, "I was a company commander in the Polish National Army. When our Polish regiment fell into the hands of the German army, we attacked the Soviet guerrillas." It is said that during the trial, the court was densely guarded by armed defense forces, all with bows drawn and swords sheathed, as if facing a formidable enemy.

Chief Aide-de-Camp Lu was unable to attend due to official duties in Nanjing. The other four high-ranking officials arrived on time. Heads of various municipal agencies attending included Xu Jidun, Yuan Junchang, Fan Yongzeng, Gu Jiwu, Zhou Yuying, Watanabe, Chen Dongbai, Wu Wenwei, Zhang Kechang, Li Shiyu, Chen Qiushi, Cai Rixin, Shen Wenjie, Xia Guoliang, Wang Deyi, Cheng Deyuan, Ling Dating, Yu Zijie, Na Shaomei, Yang Shi, and Yin Shi, among others, and were received by representatives of the five organizations: Li Sihao, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Binhe. Attendees from various circles included Zhao Jinqing, Jin Xiongbai, Chen Shaoyu, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhang Deqin, Xu Jianping, Ding Fubao, Shen Siliang, Chen Riping, Gu Nanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Liqiu, Wu Huanru, Zhang Yi'ao, Zhu Yangwu, Zhou Bangjun, Kuang Zhongxian, Shen Jinzhou, Yuan Jianbo, Xie Xiaochu, Song Zhuozai, Chen Panjun, Zhao De'ao, Xia Yinqing, Yang Fusheng, Zhou Mengbai, Zhou Fubi, Bao Guochang, Chen Chengzheng, He Wuliang, Wu Yong'an, Zheng Jie, Zhu Yongkang, Fan Yifeng, Zhang Shizhi, Luo Huanzhang, Yu Yaoqiu, Liu Zhifang, Yang Guan'ao, Yang Heqing, and Shi Yucun, totaling several hundred people, gathered in a lively atmosphere. After formal greetings, Li Sihao, representing the various organizations, delivered a welcome speech, followed by thank-you speeches from Minister Peng, Deputy Secretary-General Hu, Deputy Director Man, and Director Tsukazaki. The gathering adjourned at 5:00 PM.

Li Sihao's Speech

Li Sihao, representing the various organizations, stated in his welcome speech: "Distinguished officials and guests: In recent years, local civic organizations in our city often hold welcome and farewell tea parties for government officials who have been promoted or transferred. Some may view this as a formality, but it actually carries two more positive meanings. One is to use this opportunity to strengthen relationships and clarify opinions between officials and civilians, so that there is no gap between the government and the people. The other is to express the enthusiasm of the people and encourage officials to love the people and seek happiness for them. Today's welcome tea party is a happy occasion to welcome five officials, all of whom are old friends of long standing, making the atmosphere particularly warm. We have special expectations for each official.

Minister Peng of the Ministry of Social Welfare previously assisted former Minister Ding and is known for his outstanding political achievements. Now, as Minister, he will undoubtedly be able to achieve even more with his experience. Shanghai has a great deal of social welfare work, and has had a very close relationship with the Ministry of Social Welfare in the past, which will continue in the future. The advancement of social welfare requires funding, and we hope Minister Peng will do his best to assist. We also hope that Minister Peng will provide more help in the current evacuation of Shanghai's charitable organizations.

Chief Aide-de-Camp Lu of the National Government's Aide-de-Camp Office has served in Shanghai's police administration for a long time and has gotten along very well with the people of Shanghai. We hope that even after his transfer to the central government as Chief Aide-de-Camp, he will not forget those far away and will provide guidance at any time.

Deputy Secretary-General Hu of the Municipal Government has served as the Director of the Municipal Food Bureau and Secretary-General, and is already familiar with the situation in the city. This time, he has returned to assist Secretary-General Luo and support the Mayor in promoting government affairs, which will surely meet the expectations of the citizens.

Deputy Director Man of the Police Bureau has also served in Shanghai's police administration. He is talented and efficient, and handles matters with seriousness. His promotion to Deputy Director is by no means accidental. The security of Shanghai is very important, and the maintenance of social livelihood is closely related to police administration. We especially rely on Deputy Director Man to provide assistance, give full play to his ambitions, and work together with senior police officers from allied nations to establish a good reputation for the police.

Director Tsukazaki of the Fire Department has served in Shanghai for more than 30 years and has a wealth of experience. At this stage when the decisive battle is becoming increasingly tense, enemy air raids, explosions, and fires are all expected. Therefore, fire prevention work is extremely important. We have heard that Director Tsukazaki is planning to implement a comprehensive plan to strengthen fire prevention based on his experience, and we urge him to implement it as soon as possible to reduce disasters. On the citizen's side, we will do our best to raise awareness and promote cooperation.

Finally, I wish all the officials a successful future, good health, and happiness."

Minister Peng's Speech

Minister Peng stated: "I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to gather with the elders and leaders from all walks of life at this warm reception hosted by the five organizations, and to receive your valuable insights. I am humbled by Elder Li's excessive praise and high expectations. The Ministry of Social Welfare is a new institution established since the National Government returned to Nanjing. There are many social problems at present, and Shanghai is different from other places. In Shanghai, leaders from all walks of life have stepped forward to plan and organize social welfare, while in other places, it all relies on the government to promote it. This is due to the economic limitations in those places. In the future, I hope that the elders and leaders in Shanghai will continue to cooperate with the Ministry with the same enthusiasm as they assisted Minister Ding in the past, and provide assistance. The Ministry will do its best to support social welfare in Shanghai to meet your expectations. I have limited talent and ability, so please do not hesitate to give me your guidance. I would be most grateful."

Deputy Secretary-General Hu's Speech

Deputy Secretary-General Hu of the Municipal Government stated: "I am extremely grateful for the welcome tea party hosted by the five organizations today. I served in Shanghai with Mayor Chen for more than two years after the Incident. I am not only deeply honored to return to this place and meet you all again today, but I also hope that you will give me more guidance in the future. Shanghai was originally one of the world's and China's major cities, and its importance is greater than that of other places. At present, Shanghai's social problems are also very serious, such as the food and security problems. The colleagues in the Municipal Government have long regarded these as the most important issues, in order to meet your expectations. I will follow Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo and do my best to contribute to all of you elders and leaders. Regarding the two major issues mentioned above, both the government and the citizens should 'cross the river in the same boat' and be 'of one heart and one mind' to jointly cooperate in the war. Cooperation in the war is of course important, but maintaining local security is even more important. I hope that all citizens can unite and endure hardships. With the determination to cross the river in the same boat, it will not be difficult to reach the other shore. I would like to report these two issues to you today and hope that we can cooperate together."

Deputy Director Man's Speech

Deputy Director Man of the Municipal Police Bureau stated: "I am deeply grateful for the reception hosted by all the seniors and leaders today. I will accept your expectations and take this opportunity to briefly report to you. The current Municipal Police Bureau seems to have achieved a little more than before. This is the result of Mayor Zhou's determination to rectify it, but it is also the manifestation of the strength of all of you seniors. I would like to express my gratitude for this. The police bear a great responsibility and are the pivot of local security. The quality of local security depends on the quality of the police. Shanghai is the economic center of the country, so local security is important, and the mission of the Municipal Police Bureau is even more important. In the future, the cooperation of leaders and seniors from all walks of life will be very urgent. I hope that you will not hesitate to give me your guidance in the future so that I can fulfill the mission I bear."

Director Tsukazaki's Speech

Director Tsukazaki of the Fire Department stated: "I feel that I am not competent to be in charge of fire prevention, but I will work hard to be dutiful since you have given me your enthusiastic expectations. The most important thing in Shanghai right now is air defense measures, so we should actively complete a solid air defense posture, and fire prevention work is one of the most important tasks in air defense. For example, cities in Europe and Japan have considerable training, so that officials and civilians can cope with bombings. But in Shanghai, no one can guarantee whether enemy aircraft will bomb us in the same way. We should pay close attention to the air defense mission so that we are prepared for any eventuality. Our office is working hard to enrich the facilities, and we hope that those with money will contribute money, and those with strength will contribute strength, so that the military, officials, and civilians can work together to promote the completion of a solid air defense posture. I will work hard in my position and hope that everyone will cooperate."

### Second Phase of Affordable Coarse Grains Continues from Yesterday, Prices are Lower on Average Than the First Phase

In view of the soaring rice prices in Nanjing and Shanghai, which have greatly affected the entire social economy, security, and people's livelihood, the National Government authorities have taken emergency measures a few days ago, and consulted with relevant parties to fully assist. It was clearly ordered that the Rice Monopoly Association and other groups should stop purchasing, and the restrictions on movement were directly lifted. After the implementation of this decisive measure, rice prices in various places gradually fell, and there is still a tendency to continue to decline. The Shanghai Coarse Grains Industry Association, in response to the government's policies, has automatically reduced the prices of red beans, mung beans, broad beans, corn, and other coarse grains in line with market prices. Starting from the 17th of this month, as a first-phase trial, all wholesale and retail members were ordered to sell at affordable prices and must not refuse. The second phase of affordable coarse grain sales has been held since yesterday (20th). All the prices in the second phase are lower on average than the first phase, by about 10,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight). It is reported that the stock of coarse grains in Shanghai is quite abundant, and the Japanese side will also release it. A universal distribution method is also being promoted quickly in conjunction with all parties, in order to hold it as soon as possible to supplement the shortage of rice sources.

### Second Phase of Gold Certificates Can Be Cashed Starting Today

The Central Reserve Bank's fourth phase of gold certificates has been issued for three consecutive days since yesterday (20th). This phase of gold certificates will be issued in Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou for two days from today (21st) to the 22nd. The price is the same as the Shanghai listing. It is learned that the second phase of gold certificates issued by the bank on May 21st has reached the end of its one-month term. According to the provisions of the issuance regulations, gold will be cashed starting tomorrow (22nd).

### Old Zhabei Police Station Cracks Down on Street Vendors

The Old Zhabei Police Station has decided to crack down on street vendors along the road in order to maintain traffic safety. At the same time, the entrances of various neighborhoods in the area are full of street vendors, which not only obstructs traffic at the entrance of the street, but also poses a danger in the event of an unexpected incident. In order to renovate the city appearance, the branch director has ordered a crackdown. Except for fixed stalls that have licenses, all other temporary stalls will be cracked down on. Those who violate the rules will be detained and fined.

### Penalties for Late Payment of House Tax

In view of the fact that citizens often pay house tax late, the Municipal Finance Bureau has formulated temporary regulations for the collection of house tax in order to rectify tax administration. These regulations have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, stipulating that each household should pay the full amount within ten days after receiving the house tax notice. Those who fail to pay within the time limit will be charged a late payment fine of 10% of the tax amount. Those who are more than ten days late will be charged a late payment fine of 20% of the tax amount. Those who are more than twenty days late will be charged a late payment fine of 30% of the tax amount. Those who are more than one month late will have staff sent to pursue the payment, and will be charged a late payment fine of 50% of the tax amount. It is hoped that all householders will pay attention to avoid government penalties.

### Soap Distribution in Nanshi Starting From Tomorrow

The Daily Necessities Control Committee of the General Chamber of Commerce has decided that from June 23rd to 27th, soap retailers in the urban area will start selling one piece of Huang Xiangmao household soap with the No. 43 comprehensive distribution certificate. The price is set at 500 yuan in national currency, including retail tax. Citizens in the area can purchase soap from the soap retailer with the same number as the number on the certificate.

### Soaring Prices in Shanghai Affect the Exchange of Materials

The movement of materials in and out has been very smooth under the controlled permit system. Although the quantity of materials moved in the Central China region has gradually decreased compared with last month, the transportation tools are significantly smoother than before. The movement of materials into the North China, South China, Huaihai, and Wuhan regions is still normal. It is reported that due to the impact of soaring prices in Shanghai, the price of materials in various parts of Central China has reached equilibrium. Therefore, wholesale and retail traders have no profit to operate, and the export volume has decreased accordingly. However, this price equilibrium has adverse effects on wartime material exchange. If the price of goods in Shanghai is not suppressed, the supply of materials needed by the people will lose its original purpose of exchange.

### Economic Police Arrest Criminals in Illegal Discounting Case, Will Be Severely Punished for Disrupting Finance

The Economic Police Corps of the Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the current shortage of cash in the market, and the fact that general non-financial institutions, money exchange shops, vendors, and even illegal merchants are using the allocation slips of the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank Joint Reserve Association and the Money Industry Reserve to obtain huge amounts of interest, exploit the people, and seek illegal profits, has instructed all detachments to mobilize the entire economic police force to conduct strict investigations in all areas, markets, and shops of the city, and strictly crack down on this illegal behavior. It is learned that the detachments have arrested dozens of criminals one after another. All of them have been detained and no one is allowed to be released on bail. The matter has been submitted to the superiors for instructions. It is reported that they will be severely punished according to the law for disrupting finance. In addition, all silver and money industry firms have automatically stopped the illegal discounting of allocation slips for profit.

Financial Inspection Office Has Found Solid Evidence

In view of the increasingly rampant practice of discounting allocation slips issued by various banks and money houses, the Central Reserve Bank has found that unscrupulous financial institutions and money exchange vendors are charging high interest rates for swapping allocation slips, reaching as much as two corners, disrupting finance and exploiting citizens. In order to eliminate the evil practice of discounting and stabilize finance, the Central Reserve Bank has sent Zhang Guru, the director of the inspection team of the Financial Inspection Office, along with his staff, to various financial institutions to conduct inspections and strictly crack down on it. Real evidence of illegal discounting by a certain financial institution has been found and reported to the department for strict punishment. According to a reporter's investigation, although the Central Reserve Bank is conducting strict inspections and crackdowns, unscrupulous financial institutions are still secretly discounting. The general public hopes that the Central Reserve Bank will continue to thoroughly investigate and crack down on it, and at the same time increase the amount of cash withdrawn by various financial institutions, prohibit the abuse of allocation slips, and supervise the financial institutions to release the amount of cash withdrawn by customers as much as possible in order to adjust the cash needs of the market.
