### Vicinity of Kadena, Okinawa: Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Ships; Over 40,000 Enemy Casualties in Landing

South Seas Islands Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese air units are continuing their attacks on enemy ship groups and airfields near Okinawa. At dawn on the 16th, near the sea off Kadena, they sank one large warship and set one destroyer ablaze, which is presumed to have sunk. Enemy airfields in the central and northern parts of the island were also attacked by Japanese air units on the 16th before daybreak, resulting in thirteen fires, two explosions, and one large fire. It was also observed that several destroyers were on fire in the sea off Kadena, drifting aimlessly. In the evening of the 16th, enemy ships were engaged and one transport ship was sunk near Kume Island. Approximately 200 enemy aircraft have attacked various locations along the island chain since the 16th.

Southern Frontline Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese garrison on Okinawa Island is engaged in fierce battles against superior enemy forces, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On average, over 2,100 enemy troops are killed daily. In the six days from the 8th to the 13th, Japanese forces on land killed 12,600 enemy troops, shot down six aircraft, damaged two, destroyed 93 tanks, destroyed 57 automobiles and armored vehicles, destroyed 11 artillery pieces, destroyed 38 mortars, and destroyed eight fuel and ammunition depots. In addition, numerous light and heavy machine guns and rifles were destroyed. These remarkable achievements, combined with the damage inflicted since the enemy landed on the island on April 1st, amount to 47,300 casualties. This number is nearly half of the enemy's landing force.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The ground battles on Okinawa Island intensified on the 15th. According to a dispatch from Guam, the American offensive has slowed due to heavy casualties. According to a Reuters dispatch from the Okinawa front, the Japanese forces launched an offensive after inflicting heavy artillery fire on the American naval forces. The Americans mobilized all available personnel, and only advanced 200 meters. However, American casualties in this battle were very high. In one company of 240 men, only two survived. This battle was the most intense on Okinawa, and the troops in front of Naha have no hope of reinforcement or resupply due to the heavy Japanese artillery fire.

### Desperate Battles Unfold Between Naha and Shuri: Day and Night Struggle for Every Inch of Ground

Central News Agency dispatch – In the southern region of Okinawa Island, since the Americans launched their so-called third general offensive on the 9th, both armies have been engaged in a bloody battle day and night to seize every inch of ground. Especially after the 13th, the American offensive concentrated on the areas of Kyozuka and Sawaedi, as well as the Tenkyu area north of Naha, increasing pressure on the main Japanese defensive line in the mountainous area between Naha and Shuri. This highland area is a strategic fortress on Okinawa Island, and the battle for this fortress is causing a major change in the overall situation on Okinawa. Therefore, Japanese and American forces are engaged in a desperate offensive and defensive battle. The American artillery and troop strength are numerically superior, and the shells fired from their warships almost engulf the area. The Japanese forces lure the enemy in deep and then annihilate them, making the battle extremely brutal. British and American war correspondents have also provided detailed reports. A New York Times correspondent, Lorris, reported on the 17th: "American forces are fighting hard to seize the high ground targeted by naval bombardment, but as soon as American soldiers make any progress, they are subjected to heavy artillery fire. For example, the 77th Regiment was subjected to a hundred rounds of mortar fire from the Japanese in four minutes. A tank company, deployed to support the 77th Regiment, sent out 21 tanks and flamethrowers to attack the caves on the high ground, but after the attack, only seven of the new American tanks remained. Before the infantry can advance, the hills must be burned with gasoline from the tanks, but after reaching the high ground, machine gun fire from the Japanese in the caves rains down." A Reuters correspondent reported on the 17th: "American forces in southern Okinawa have encountered a fierce Japanese counterattack. Even the cooks who normally bake bread for the American forces have been sent to the front lines to resist the Japanese counterattack. After this battle, American forces had to retreat 200 yards from the Naha front."

Although the American authorities underreport casualties, one can imagine the bloody scene by observing their published battle reports. In the past month and a half, the 96th Division and 27th Division of the American 24th Army Corps have been battered and are in disarray. The loss of naval personnel is also extremely severe, which will have a significant impact on future operations. This is a very obvious fact.

Despite heavy attacks by Australian naval guns, aircraft, and artillery, the landing forces suffered heavy losses, and the Japanese troops launched repeated night attacks."

Philippine Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 14th, the enemy launched intense artillery bombardments and aerial bombings against the heights of Laoag.

As of the 14th, 2,500 enemy troops have been killed on land, 87 tanks, armored vehicles, and other vehicles have been abandoned or destroyed, over ten enemy aircraft have been shot down, and four transport ships have been sunk or damaged at sea.

### American Journalist Discusses Japanese Special Attack Tactics

Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The American magazine *Time* published a diary entry by its correspondent Sherwood on April 30th, describing the intensity of the Japanese special attack units. The article stated that the American forces fighting on Okinawa Island, who were deploying Pacific naval forces for the first time in the landing operations, suffered even more casualties than the ground troops. This was due to the repeated and fierce attacks by Japanese special attack units on ships off Okinawa. The main Japanese attack method is to ram American ships, which is the so-called "special attack" or "body-crashing" tactic. This unique Japanese tactic, the "special attack," may be considered a "game of death" by us Americans, but it is indeed a special Japanese tactic, and the Japanese place great hope on this "attack." The Japanese are mobilizing all aircraft and pilots in the Okinawa campaign, pouring all their efforts into attacking the Americans. This is not an exaggeration. According to experts, even the slowest Japanese bombers are being deployed, with a total of fifteen types of aircraft flying in the air. I first experienced the power of the "Japanese special attack" last winter. At that time, a Japanese special attack aircraft flew past our fighter planes and approached the warship I was on. One of them carried out a suicide attack on the warship. Black smoke billowed up 300 meters high, and there was a huge explosion. Less than an hour after this attack, Japanese aircraft attacked again. Our forces immediately concentrated fire on the aircraft, which caught fire. However, the aircraft continued to charge forward regardless, and soon an American warship was engulfed in flames and heavily damaged.

### Turner Promoted to Admiral

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Washington, Admiral Turner, the commander of the American Pacific amphibious forces currently on Okinawa Island, has been promoted to admiral by President Truman.

Editorial

### Making a Big Official vs. Making a Big Impact

Sun Yat-sen once said: "We must aspire to make a big impact, not just to become a big official." Although this was said to Lingnan students as far back as December 21, 1923, it is still very applicable to political figures in this time and place. I remember that at that time, warlords and politicians across the country colluded with each other, the national politics were corrupt and dark, and in foreign affairs, they sought temporary peace by yielding and compromising, while internally, they fought for every inch of land, killing each other. Everything was neglected, and the people suffered. Sun Yat-sen was deeply grieved and made this statement, "We must make a big impact, not just become a big official," to encourage young students. At that time, he not only encouraged young students in this way, but also constantly gave the same advice to Kuomintang members and armed comrades. For example, in his address to the Kuomintang Alumni Association in October 1923, he also admonished party members with the words, "Party members must not be minded to become officials," and encouraged everyone to resolve to carry out the great cause of saving the country and the people. He was saddened that some social leaders and intellectuals at the time were seeking fame and positions, attaching themselves to warlords and bureaucrats, and becoming politicians at all levels, while neglecting the urgent tasks of the country and society. The literati and officials were just as apathetic and complacent as the bureaucrats and politicians, leaving the country and society in disarray. Therefore, he encouraged everyone not to become big officials, but to make a big impact. At present, when we assess the current situation of the country and society, we cannot help but recall Sun Yat-sen's words and be alerted.

Originally, "since the Three Dynasties, there have been no virtuous individuals." Most people's eagerness to become big officials, when investigating the motivation, initially, it is not necessarily the case that everyone wants to use official power to pursue personal gain, but they are fascinated by the desire for fame. Later, when they enter the corrupt and dark officialdom, they involuntarily pursue power and profit, so that the original ambition to make a name for themselves and achieve merit is swept away. In fact, seeking fame is not a bad thing in itself, if it is done in the right way. As Sun Yat-sen said: "The height of the reputation of people in ancient and modern times is not in the greatness of the office they held, but in the success of the cause they pursued. If a cause can be successful, one can enjoy great fame." We are specifically mentioning this old saying at this time and place, hoping that those who are already in the officialdom will have an attitude of serving the country and the people and pursuing a career, and establish themselves through words and deeds. Those who are seeking official positions should still realistically do something beneficial for society. In this era of turmoil, we especially hope that people with aspirations will experience Sun Yat-sen's legacy and determine their path of life and career.

As for what counts as making a big impact? Sun Yat-sen also said, "As long as you have the ambition to serve the people, and focus on one thing, to help the country become rich and strong," that is an extraordinary undertaking. Simply put, anyone who works hard and steadfastly adheres to their position is pursuing a great personal undertaking. In addition to working hard in one's position, simultaneously serving the public interests of the country and society is pursuing a great cause for the country and society. For example, recently, the National Government appointed Mr. Min Daoding and Mr. Ding Mo Village as heads of Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, respectively, to carry out reforms in local areas, establish security, and stabilize people's livelihoods. All of this is based on the desire to serve the country and the people and to earnestly make an impact. Secondly, the most urgent tasks in Shanghai today, such as the dispersal of the population, the relocation of industries to the interior, the improvement of transportation, the implementation of agricultural loans, the purchase of relief bonds, and the promotion of charitable relief efforts, all of these are also great undertakings that social figures in this time and place should pursue. Therefore, we specifically put forward Sun Yat-sen's legacy, wishing everyone: "Aspire to make a big impact, not just to become a big official!"

### Japanese Military Makes the Enemy Bleed, Gradually Taking Effect: Minister Matsushima Discusses the Okinawa Battle

The Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department held its routine press conference yesterday afternoon, where Minister Matsushima explained the latest battle situation on Okinawa Island. The enemy has suffered unprecedented losses, with nearly half of the landing soldiers having died, and resupply of troops has become extremely difficult. The Japanese military has gradually achieved its goal of making the enemy bleed. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows:

Most of the Landing Enemy Forces Killed

Recently, in the battle situation on Okinawa Island, in the west at Naha, in the center north of Shuri, and in the east in the area of Yonabaru, Japanese and enemy forces are engaging in fierce battles. The enemy is attacking from the south, mobilizing four army divisions and two naval divisions, attempting to break through the lines, but each time they are attacked and suffer considerable damage. As of May 8th, according to enemy publications, 2,648 soldiers have died, and 13,741 have been injured or gone missing, for a total of 16,389. According to Lieutenant Colonel Hu Shideweida, a military doctor of the enemy's Tenth Army, another 3,967 injured soldiers have died, for a total of 6,615. In the past, when the enemy published the number of their soldiers killed or injured, it was usually only one-tenth of the actual loss. Therefore, based on this, it can be estimated that the enemy's loss of soldiers is at least 50,000 to 60,000. Of the 100,000 soldiers that the enemy landed on Okinawa Island, most have been killed or injured, and the resupply of troops has become quite difficult. The enemy lacks hospital ships and field hospitals, so they are unable to accommodate the injured and are using about ten transport planes a day to transport the injured. The enemy has also announced that in addition to the aforementioned number of deaths and injuries, 2,000 soldiers in the army and 4,000 in the navy are suffering from diseases. Based on this, it can be said that the Japanese military's efforts to make the enemy bleed have gradually taken effect, and the continuous attacks on their ships are also inflicting unprecedented damage on the enemy.

Enemy Navy is Unable to Strengthen

The enemy's mobile units attacked Kyushu on the 13th and 14th. Their force was composed of two groups consisting of six formal aircraft carriers and four battleships. Because of the Japanese military's fierce attack, the enemy has suffered serious damage. At least two aircraft carriers and several other ships have been sunk and are retreating south. At the same time, the Japanese military continues to fiercely attack the troops that have landed around Okinawa. On the 16th, it was seen from the land that a large enemy ship was sunk at sea, and another was on fire. The enemy has lost more than 500 ships and is experiencing considerable pain due to the lack of troops. Even if they can mobilize troops from Europe in the future, they will ultimately be unable to strengthen the first-line forces of their navy. The battle centered on Okinawa is now becoming increasingly heated, and the battle situation in the next one to two weeks is particularly worthy of attention.

Enemy America Attempts to Dominate Two Oceans

Based on the end of the European war, the enemy has repeatedly announced that they will move a large number of troops and simultaneously promoted the effects of aerial warfare. Of course, this kind of statement is not impossible in the future, but the specific realization will definitely not be as simple as the promotion. Especially recently, the political relationship between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, coupled with shipping problems and distance problems, are all very big tasks in enemy history, which cannot be easily undertaken. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 14th, American Navy Commander-in-Chief King requested in the Senate that the United States should establish several naval bases from the Philippine Islands all the way to the mouth of the Atlantic Ocean. King's request is nothing more than the manifestation of America's ambition to dominate the two oceans. The various kinds of peace they tout are merely a facade for a world peace theory that cannot give up weapons. At the San Francisco conference, the opinions of various countries were divided and unable to reach a consensus. The cooperation issues between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, the Polish problem, the Austrian problem, the Argentine problem, etc., could not be coordinated. On the 14th, the Polish regime automatically sent 1,000 Poles to Frankfurt on the Oder River in Germany. This kind of move was sudden and unexpected.

Finally, Colonel Matsushima said that according to a New York broadcast on the 16th, there was news that American troops had occupied Okinawa Island, and that Chongqing troops had occupied Fuzhou. This was actually false propaganda.

### Co-Prosperity Sphere Students Enter Kyoto Imperial University

Kyoto, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Kyoto Imperial University previously recruited more than forty new students from various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The entrance ceremony was held on the 15th. In order to adapt to the world situation, a Student Education Council was established to hold seminars and various exercises.

Students from China and Manchukuo have moved into the Rakuto Apartments, and students from various southern regions have moved into the International Student Friendship Association.

### Japanese Submarines Participate in the Atlantic Waters

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A dispatch from Washington states that the American Atlantic Fleet Commander, Ingram, met with a group of reporters on the 16th and announced that Japanese submarines were cooperating with German submarines in the Atlantic waters, which caused great shock. According to Ingram's statement, a certain American naval vessel encountered a Japanese submarine in the waters south of Long Island last summer. This is the first time that Japanese submarines have been discovered participating in the Atlantic commerce raiding war.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The American War Bulletin stated that the American Department of the Navy announced today that one American destroyer escort ship was sunk by a submarine in the Atlantic Ocean. The bulletin also stated that the American side had lost 308 ships in this war.

As of now, the confirmed results of the battle are that 9 enemy aircraft were shot down and 22 were destroyed."

Nagoya, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – One hundred B29-type aircraft from the Mariana Islands base attacked Nagoya at dawn on the 17th. On this day, the enemy aircraft, flying at an altitude of 3,000 or 5,000 meters, attacked Nagoya from the west from about 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM, singly or in small numbers. They dropped large 50-kilogram incendiary bombs and 22.5-kilogram electron-type explosive bombs, blindly bombing part of the main hall and company premises of Atsuta Shrine, and attacked the southern area, directly bombing the urban areas and some factories in the Nakamura, Atsuta, Mizuho, Denchuan, Showa, Nakae Harbor, and Chigusa districts. The Japanese military and civilians worked together to fight the fires and extinguished them at dawn. The enemy aircraft took their usual deceptive action. When the alarm was sounded, they flew west from the direction of Lake Biwa and did not appear over Nagoya, but an hour later, they suddenly changed course and intruded into Nagoya. At the same time, they scattered tinfoil to disrupt the Japanese radio wave detectors. However, the Japanese air defense forces immediately launched a fierce attack on them, and ground fire also fired fiercely into the air. As a result, nine were shot down and twenty-two were destroyed.

Aerial Attacks on Korea and Taiwan

Seoul, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Korean Military District Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 17th: "At around 11:00 AM on the 17th, four large enemy aircraft, in formations of two, attacked the west coast of North Jeolla Province and the western and southern coasts of South Jeolla Province.

### Grasshopper Extermination in the Outskirts of the Capital Actively Underway

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Under the close cooperation of various relevant departments, the grasshopper extermination work in the outskirts of the capital is actively underway. Since the 15th, most of the students of agricultural schools in the capital have also voluntarily gone to participate in the extermination. It is reported that there are currently two extermination methods being implemented in the area. One is the encirclement method, which involves placing a white flag in the area with the most grasshoppers and having villagers surround the area, holding bamboo whips and killing them as they move forward, with the white flag as the center, until they are completely exterminated. The other is the ditch method, which involves digging ditches around the area with the most grasshoppers, with a narrow bottom and wide opening, and filling them with water. Oil is placed on the surface of the water, and the grasshoppers are driven into the water and drowned. In addition, the Chinese Cooperative recently prepared dozens of bolts of white cloth, cut them into rectangles, and ordered farmers to use them in areas with many grasshoppers to attract them to jump onto the cloth, then pour them into bags and burn them.

The Shangchuan and Shangnan Road Management Office of the Municipal Construction Bureau, having repaired and refurbished all the passenger cars and locomotives running on Shangchuan Road, specially invited officials of the competent authorities and reporters from various newspapers to visit Qioning Temple at 9:30 a.m. yesterday to observe the new facilities, inspect traffic order, the condition of the terminal, and tour the locomotive factory. Afterwards, a simple ceremony was held.

Those visiting included Xu Jidun, Director of the Construction Bureau, as well as Wang Lian, Chief of the First Section, Shang Zheng, Chief of the Third Section, Liang Miaozhang, Chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Government Secretariat, and more than ten reporters from various newspapers. The hosts included Zhao Haiqing, Director of the Shangchuan and Shangnan Road Management Office, Zhang Pengcheng, Director of Training, Shi Youxin, Director of the Business Section, and Cheng Yiping.

Process of Renovation

The Shangchuan Railway was built in 1925, initially as a commercial venture, and was transferred to municipal ownership four years ago. It is 48 li long and takes one hour to travel. It is a type of light railway similar to those used in mines. The locomotives and passenger cars were all produced in Germany more than 20 years ago. These vehicles have long been weathered and repeatedly damaged. Currently, there is one locomotive that has been completely repaired and is like new, three 40-foot passenger cars, one 28-foot passenger car, and one 28-foot freight car. The repair costs and replacement parts cost only 3.47 million yuan. In addition to the new doors and windows and other fittings, the newly renovated locomotive runs faster and consumes less coal. The entire line currently uses about 180 tons of coal per month, of which 80 tons are allocated coal priced at 40,000 yuan per ton, and the remaining 100 tons or so are purchased at the black market price of about 200,000 yuan per ton. There are also two old locomotives and seven old passenger and freight cars that need to be repaired, but the required parts are difficult to find and the purchase price is too high, which still requires the assistance of the authorities to resolve. Some of the sleepers have already been replaced, and the current price is about 20,000 yuan per piece. To reduce the risk of derailment, they also urgently need to be replaced, and they are currently planning to purchase old sleepers from the China Railway.

Current Business Situation

The current train departure times are 12:00 noon and 5:30 p.m. from Qioning Temple, passing through Jinjiaqiao, Xinlu, Shaojiaxiang, Caojialu, Dawan, Xiaowan, Muziqiao, Chuansha, and Xiaoyingfang to Jiangzhen. Departures from Jiangzhen are at 9:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. The passenger ticket price from Qioning Temple to Chuansha is 790 yuan, and the full fare is 940 yuan. Freight tickets are halved. A 10% transfer tax is collected with the ticket. Military and police personnel are given preferential treatment and are issued exchange coupons to exchange for military and police tickets. Tickets are sold as much as possible, and those who are found to be deliberately evading tickets will be fined five times the fare. Before the reform, in addition to many people riding without tickets, there were also strange phenomena of military and police ordering forced stops and boarding at any time and place. Now, however, the trains depart and arrive on time. Most of the passengers are farmers, and some are small merchants. What they bring is mostly soap, cigarettes, matches, etc., and what they transport are mainly salt and rural products.

Employee Benefits

The two road management offices currently have a total of more than 240 employees. When Director Zhao first took office, there were only 180 employees. After the reform, the affairs were busy, and the income also increased sharply. In February, it was 21,494,232 yuan, in March it was 46,613,144 yuan, and in April it reached 50,257,280 yuan. The surplus profit turned over to the municipal treasury in March was 10,040,830 yuan. The treatment of employees has also been thoroughly improved. In addition to the basic salary, 10% of the turnover is allocated each month as employee subsidies. This subsidy was about equal to one month’s basic salary last month. Middle-level employees receive more than 70,000 or 80,000 yuan each month, and they can also receive three dou of free rice. In the past, there were incidents of employees starving to death. Recently, seeing the generous treatment, technical workers who had left the locomotive factory have returned one after another. Thanks to the stability of life and effective supervision, road construction is proceeding in a tense and enthusiastic manner.

As Director Zhao said, "The two roads are like a sick man, and it is very difficult for the doctor." However, in just three months, with the tireless work day and night of all employees, there has been a great improvement. Yesterday, Director Xu of the Construction Bureau praised it very appropriately, saying: "It is not surprising to achieve something in a good environment. It is very commendable and respectable to be able to achieve such achievements in a short period of time after great destruction under conditions where funds, materials, personnel, and politics are very difficult!"

### The Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads: Reorganization Work Completed; Yesterday, the Press Was Invited to View the New Trains

Since the establishment of the Municipal Construction Bureau through the merger and reorganization of the Public Utilities Bureau and the Public Works Bureau, it has been actively developing public utilities and improving vehicle traffic, achieving remarkable results. Previously, the Upper and Lower Sichuan Railways suffered from poor management, and the trains and military vehicles were in disrepair for many years, causing inconvenience to passengers and greatly affecting the business of merchants traveling between the urban area and the suburbs. Therefore, the newly appointed director of the Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads Administration, Zhao Haiqing, was instructed to strengthen the internal organization, rectify road administration, and repair locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. After three months of effort, not only has the internal reorganization been completed, but also one old No. 1 locomotive, one 40-foot passenger car, one 28-foot passenger car, and one 28-foot freight car on the Upper Sichuan Road have been repaired, painted, and are as good as new. They were put into operation yesterday (the 17th). Director Zhao of the Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads Administration specially invited Municipal Construction Bureau Director Xu, Secretary Liang Miao-zhang, First Section Chief Wang Lian, and Third Section Chief Shang Zheng to visit yesterday, and also invited reporters from various newspapers in the city to visit the new trains in operation. Details are as follows:

Visiting the Locomotives

Yesterday (the 17th) at 9:30 AM, Director Xu of the Municipal Construction Bureau, section chiefs, and reporters from various newspapers gathered at the Outer Bund No. 14 Municipal Ferry Terminal. They were warmly received by Director Zhao and others from the Administration. At 10:00 AM, they departed on the "Chunjiang" Municipal Ferry to cross the river. At 10:40 AM, they arrived at the Qingning Temple Pier. After disembarking and resting briefly at the Roads Administration, they were accompanied by Director Zhao to visit the newly renovated locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, and inspected the repair situation. At 12:00 PM, after the new trains started running, they inspected the condition of the terminal station and visited the locomotive factory facilities. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, Director Zhao convened a meeting of the heads of various sections and senior police officers of the two roads to introduce them to Director Xu for instruction and training. Director Zhao also reported on the rectification of road administration, the repair of vehicles, and the future plans for promoting road administration. Afterwards, photographs were taken, and a luncheon was hosted. At 3:00 PM sharp, they returned to Shanghai by the "Jiejiang" ferry.

Director's Address

Director Xu of the Municipal Construction Bureau gave an address, stating in brief: Transportation is of great importance to the promotion of national politics and the prosperity of industry and commerce. The progress of railways in various countries around the world has become like spider silk, because railway progress is inextricably linked to culture, economy, politics, and military affairs. Our country's railway administration is lagging behind other countries in the world and should follow the road administration of other countries and strive for progress. The Upper and Lower Sichuan Railways are local railways and should be improved with local resources. Although they cannot be compared with foreign railways, if we can maintain the existing railway conditions and promote them gradually, it will be our duty. We must manage and promote with our own strength. In the past, a certain director of the Public Utilities Bureau promoted them and achieved good results. Now, Director Zhao is actively reorganizing, and in the shortest period of three months, he has achieved practical progress, which is due to the efforts of everyone and the assistance of our allies. I hope that there will be even greater progress in the future, that vehicles will be increased, and that the exchange of materials will be smoother. I hope that the local people will cherish the railway.

Director's Report

Director Zhao of the Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads Administration reported, stating in brief: I was ordered to manage the road administration of the two roads. First, during the reorganization period, I strengthened the internal organization, adjusted personnel, increased salaries, stabilized work, and strengthened the spirit of road protection. Second, during the construction period, I renovated locomotives and repaired roads to ensure the safety of passengers. Both of these periods have been successfully completed. In the future, we will continue to replace sleepers along the road and connect the Jiangzhen to Zhengzhen directly to the Shijiawu sections. This time, the renovation of six locomotives and passenger cars cost 3.47 million yuan in repair expenses.

Business Conditions

It is reported that the station names along the Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads are as follows: The Upper Sichuan Line starts from Qingning Temple and passes through Jinjia Bridge, Xinlu, Shaojia Nong, Caojia Road, Gongjia Road, Dawan, Xiaohui, Muzi, Chuansha, Xiaoyingfang, and ends at Jiangzhen, a total of twelve stations. The Lower Sichuan Line starts from Zhoupu and passes through Tianhua'an, Sanlin Tang, Yangxing Bridge, Dadaokou, and ends at Zhoujiadu, a total of six points. Recently, due to active reorganization, traffic safety and passenger convenience have increased, and business is becoming more and more prosperous. In recent March and April business, the monthly passenger count reached 80,000, with over 20,000 pieces of freight, generating an income of approximately 50 million yuan.

A meeting of all staff of the Inspectorate was convened, and the former Director Guo gave an introductory speech, followed by an address by the acting Director, encouraging the staff to be dutiful and law-abiding, and to work diligently in their positions. Subsequently, former Director Guo convened the inspectors individually for introduction, and acting Director Zhan gave detailed instructions on the work policy. It is known that Mr. Zhan previously served as the director of the Wuhu County Police Bureau in Anhui Province, the magistrate of Zhongjiang County in the Shanghai Special Municipality, and was recently transferred to the position of counselor in the municipal government.

### No Fees Charged for Population Census Forms

Since the municipal government re-determined the jurisdiction of the urban area, the distribution area of the Municipal Goods Distribution Office has also changed accordingly. The area west of the Shanghai-West Railway, east of Zhongshan Road, and Baishuijing in Pudong has been incorporated into the urban area and has been approved by the municipal government for distribution. Recently, in order to investigate the population of the newly designated urban area and the shantytowns, the office has printed population census registers, which are being distributed by the Baojia (community) organizations to be filled out, so that they can be used for issuing certificates. However, it has been heard that some people are falsely charging fees for the census registers and procedures. The reporter specially visited the person in charge of the office yesterday and was informed that the population census registers are printed and distributed by the office and no fees are charged. If such a situation is discovered, it can be reported at any time, and it will be dealt with severely.

The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Staff Loan Office is jointly established by fourteen financial institutions in the city, with the main purpose of providing loans to alleviate the urgent needs of industrial and commercial staff. Since it started accepting applications on January 15 this year, up to April 30, a total of 845 people have applied. A total of 457 people have been approved for loans, with a total loan amount of 17,325,000 yuan, including 3,535,000 yuan for tuition fees, 6,045,000 yuan for medical expenses, 1,480,000 yuan for small business operations, 1,355,000 yuan for funeral expenses, 4,780,000 yuan for repatriation expenses, and 130,000 yuan for other purposes. The situation of loan repayment is also very good. A total of 4,170,000 yuan has been received. In summary, within three months, almost all of the matured bills have been recovered, which proves the creditworthiness of industrial and commercial staff. Now, the office, in view of the good past performance and the current high prices, has decided to increase the loan limit to 100,000 yuan if necessary, starting from the 16th of this month, and extend the repayment period to a maximum of ten months. For loan guarantors, if they are reliable, the number can be reduced to one, and the guarantor is exempted from signing the application form and endorsing the check, so as to provide quick and easy convenience for honest and diligent industrial and commercial staff. However, at the same time, it is hoped that the service organizations will provide proof and deduct salaries as much as possible, and the office will also use written guarantee procedures to ensure proper handling. The daily application time is still from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, and it is closed on Sundays and bank holidays. The address is on the fourth floor of the Silk Industry Building, 470 Hankou Road.
