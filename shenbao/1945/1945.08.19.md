### General Conditions of Qibao Town

— Lu Shenting

Qibao is a town located southwest of Shanghai, and it was once a major source of rice for Shanghai. It is situated 24 li from Xujiahui and approximately 70+ li from Wusong. It is bordered by Caohejing to the east, the old Shanghai County to the south, Songjiang County to the southwest, 　　County to the northwest, and Pu Song County to the north. The river "Puhuitang" runs horizontally through the territory, dividing the town into northern and southern parts. There is a large stone bridge on the river, named "Tang Bridge," which serves as the link between the northern and southern parts of the town. As it is located in the center of the town, it is the most prosperous area. The town has a population of approximately 10,000 people.

Transportation

There is no significant transportation within the town, only several stone roads such as South Street, North Street, East Street, West Street, and Pawnshop Street. Outside the town, transportation is divided into land and water routes: Land routes are accessible by trucks, cars, rickshaws, tricycles, and bicycles. To the east, a highway leads to Chenjiaqiao and Caohejing, providing access to Shanghai. To the south, a highway leads to Xinzhuang, where one can take the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. To the northwest, a highway provides long-distance bus service to Qingpu County. Water routes allow various types of civilian boats to navigate west along the Puhuitang River, reaching Sijing and, via a detour, Qingpu and Songjiang. Navigation eastward along the Puhuitang River leads to Shanghai, but due to years of disrepair, the river is silted up near Xujiahui, resulting in stagnant and foul-smelling water. Only the Suzhou River and the South Huangpu waterways remain navigable.

Politics

The southern part of Tang Bridge is under the jurisdiction of the Songjiang County government, while the northern part is under the jurisdiction of the Qingpu County government. Each has district and town offices. The district office is headed by a district chief, appointed by the county government, and assisted by two assistant staff members and ten office workers, all hired by the district chief, who jointly administer district affairs. The town office is headed by a town chief, who is selected by the local people for their talent and integrity, and is responsible for resolving disputes among the people. In addition, there are about seven or eight collecting agencies, such as the Land Bureau, Grain Bureau, and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, as well as a police station to maintain law and order.

Products

The products of Qibao Town and its vicinity are mainly agricultural crops, with rice, cotton, and soybeans being the most important. Other crops, such as wheat, broad beans, corn, and vegetables, are also produced in considerable quantities. Fruits include watermelons, cantaloupes, and honey peaches. In addition, residents also raise a considerable number of pigs, sheep, geese, chickens, and ducks. Aquatic products include crucian carp, carp, shrimp, crabs, and eels. Special products include spiced dried broad beans, milk ice, and clams.

Industry and Commerce

Commerce is centered around Tang Bridge, with various vegetable stalls, snack shops, and general merchandise stalls on the bridge. Tea houses, hotels, restaurants, flour mills, rice shops, butcher shops, tofu shops, clothing stores, department stores, cigarette and paper shops, candy stores, and barbershops are located on the north and south sides of the bridge. Due to the lack of electricity, it is not possible to install motors, so only light industries such as old-fashioned straw paper mills, iron shops, coppersmith shops, incense making workshops, wineries, cotton ginning factories, oil presses, and woodworking shops exist. The market is doing fairly well, but is not extremely prosperous.

Education

Next to the big temple on the north side of Tang Bridge is the county-run central elementary school, with seven classrooms and over 300 students. Principal Lu Kangchang works hard to teach, with considerable success. However, the county government is severely short of funds, so teachers' salaries are not only low, but also often delayed. To the west of Pawnshop Street in Tangnan is the San Shan Tang Elementary School, whose principal is the local celebrity Xu Yonglin. This school is a charitable organization with its own property, so teachers' salaries are very good. Unfortunately, the number of students is small, only about 100. In addition, there is also a Catholic Elementary School, with more than 100 students, divided into male and female schools, completely separate, and presided over by Father Ma. The teachers in this school are all "fathers" and "mothers," and the teaching and management are quite strict, with student achievement exceeding that of ordinary schools in Shanghai. The school buildings are spacious, and the location is quiet, with a very good environment.

Combining the above three schools, there are only five to six hundred elementary school students, which is approximately one-twentieth to one-thirtieth of the total population. The opportunity to receive education is scarce, which can be seen in general, as parents have historically not valued sending their children to school.

Folk Customs

Most of the local people are farmers, with a small number going out to do business, so they are mostly honest and simple in their ways of thinking and frugal in their lives. Men have a habit of visiting tea houses and eating mutton and drinking liquor every morning before work, such as carrying rice and loading goods, or even crawling through barbed wire.

The people's lives are relatively stable, hence the saying: "Live in a thatched cottage without worry, eating aged rice." In recent years, influenced by Shanghai's "evil slaves' civilization," drugs are prevalent and gambling is rampant. A large number of people smoke opium and heroin, and mahjong and pai gow are everywhere. It is heard that the authorities are strictly cracking down.

Eighty to ninety percent of the people believe in Buddhism. They do not know the true meaning of Buddhism, but only the form of worship. There are "Guandi Temple," "Land God Temple," "Jiuli Temple," "South Temple," etc., and there are also frequent gatherings of the "Guanyin Society" to eat vegetarian food and pray. In addition, there are also the "Qibao Catholic Church" and the "Gu Jia Catholic Church," both built by the French before the war, but there are few believers.

Every year on the fifteenth day of the third month, there is a "market" at the big temple square in Tangbei. Merchants from all directions gather here to sell bamboo utensils, ironware, and all kinds of useful items. People from all over come from thousands of miles away, and there are also Beijing opera, animal shows, magic shows, and martial arts performances for entertainment. Once this time has passed, all kinds of entertainment cease, and at most there are storytellers and blind singers.

If Shanghai citizens develop this place, work hard to build it, and promote education and reform politics, then its future prosperity and development can be expected in the near future.

### Military Affairs Commission Propaganda Committee Takes Over Two Railway Party Headquarters; Sends Representatives to Instruct on All Matters

He Minhun, of the Propaganda Committee of the National Government Military Affairs Commission for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, after establishing a temporary office in Shanghai a few days ago, has actively launched propaganda work. On August 17, he appointed Lü Xiao as special commissioner and Gu Huigong as commissioner to be responsible for taking over the special party headquarters and trade unions of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. After receiving the order, Lü and Gu have taken over operations in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. Railway employees in Shanghai gathered yesterday (18th) morning at the former site of the railway hospital at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Fusheng Road, where Secretary Ji Hengzhi, specially appointed by the office, conveyed the central government's intentions and instructed on all matters on behalf of Commissioner He. The gist is as follows:

Main Points of the Instruction

"All employees of the two railways should remain in their original positions, continue to serve, and must not be shaken, fearful, or alarm each other. They should be responsible for maintaining transportation, protecting the railways, treating passengers well, and taking care of all railway equipment to prevent damage, so as to return the lifeline of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways to the country intact. The central government has decided to adopt a lenient and benevolent approach, especially protecting the employees of the two railways. All employees should earnestly reflect and awaken, and serve the motherland again." After hearing the instruction, all employees were invigorated and filled with enthusiasm.

It is also reported that Lü Xiao and Gu Huigong, as former employees of the two railways, have been responsible for party affairs for many years, and it is believed that they will bring new developments to the party affairs and trade unions of the two railways, which have been interrupted for eight years.

### Notice Issued to Protect Factories

The Shanghai Special City Police Bureau had previously ordered all branch bureaus to dispatch police to properly protect the city's public and private factories. It has now been learned that the police bureau issued a notice yesterday (18th) to protect factories, which has been posted in various factories. The original text is as follows: By order of the central government, special protection is provided to the city's factories. No one is allowed to disturb or destroy them. Violators will be severely punished.

### Prices Have Fallen After Credit Tightening

Since the city's banking and financial industries stopped lending to industrial and commercial customers on overdraft, market prices have fallen frequently. The past practice of manipulating speculation and hoarding has also been fundamentally eliminated, and people's livelihoods appear to be stabilizing. It is understood that the financial industry's suspension of lending is merely a self-protective measure. The downward trend of prices is a natural phenomenon, and it should also be said that it is a situation that should exist in a stagnant market transaction. Therefore, the business of banks and financial institutions has been unusually slow recently. Their respective business operations have not been promoted, and the number of bills exchanged by the Yinlianhui Qianzhun Treasury has decreased even further. Banks and financial institutions pay in cash both internally and externally, and the issuance of bank drafts is very cautious. Customers also mostly use cash for depositing and withdrawing funds from banks and financial institutions.

### Two Banks to Be Closed

The Shanghai Fuxing Bank has been resolved by the board of directors to begin liquidation immediately, and depositors are requested to withdraw their deposits for the purpose of closing the bank. Also, the Sino-Japanese Industrial Bank has also been resolved by the board of directors to be closed.

### Group Purchase of Miscellaneous Grains Transported to Shanghai

It is an undeniable fact that the current level of education has declined compared to the past, and that there is a lack of qualified teachers. If we want to investigate the reasons for this, it ultimately comes down to the problem of livelihood.

It is also a well-known fact that teachers bear great responsibility but receive meager compensation. Although teachers often encourage each other: "We must teach for the sake of education, not for the sake of money. Do not neglect your responsibility because of low pay." But who can truly endure hunger and devote themselves wholeheartedly! Therefore, generally knowledgeable and talented teachers are forced to seek other means of livelihood and change careers. As a result, the elementary school ranks feel empty, giving mediocre talents like me and people who are not teachers the opportunity to step in and fill the ranks!

The salaries of elementary school teachers are indeed pitifully low! -- Especially in general private elementary schools that "enter as much as they pay out." -- For the employment of teachers and staff, one semester is the fixed term, and there is absolutely no possibility or hope for a salary increase in the middle of the term. Taking the first semester as an example, the salary in private elementary schools is only about 10,000 yuan per month (without providing food and lodging). At the beginning of the spring semester, it seems that one can still maintain personal life. Afterwards, prices skyrocketed and became increasingly expensive. By the end of the semester, one month's salary is not enough to maintain one day's life. Are teachers bound by employment contracts able to ask for subsidies and salary increases like other employees!? -- If you don't want to do it, there are still many people envying this meagerly paying profession, waiting for the opportunity.

Of the tens of thousands of teachers and staff members in the city, who does not hope that the authorities will grant priority rations and affordable rice, in order to remove the daily threat to the lives of teachers and staff members and allow them to work in peace.

### Fu You Orphanage Appeals for Generous Donations from All Circles

The Shanghai Fu You Orphanage, established for four years, has successively taken in over 1,700 orphans and impoverished children. Currently, there are still over 330 children residing in the orphanage. Thanks to the support from people of all walks of life, the orphanage has been able to provide both education and care, and its scale is gradually taking shape. However, due to the recent surge in commodity prices, it is facing difficulties in maintaining its operations. Therefore, it is publicly appealing to all circles for a donation of 10,000,000 yuan in funding. Although many donations have been received from various sectors recently, the amount is still far from the target. It is sincerely hoped that kind-hearted individuals from all walks of life will generously donate, so that the fundraising target can be achieved as soon as possible, and the orphanage's relief efforts can continue. This is earnestly desired. Collection points: Room 432, Ci Shu Building, Nanjing Road; Social Services Department of this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao newspaper.
