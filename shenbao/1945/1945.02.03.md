### Japanese Forces Launch Mobile Warfare, Courageously Engaging the Enemy in a Decisive Battle; General Headquarters Announces the Latest Situation in Luzon

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced the latest situation on Luzon Island at 5:20 PM on the 2nd as follows: (1) The enemy forces of seven or eight divisions that landed in the Lingayen Gulf area are still mainly attacking the Japanese military positions in the mountainous area east of the Pangasinan Plain. Approximately two divisions are gradually moving south toward Manila Bay. A portion advanced into the area in front of Clark Field and near San Fernando in late January. Another enemy force landed near Subic Bay on January 30th. The Japanese troops in the eastern region of the Pangasinan Plain inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In late January, they retreated from the positions near San Fabian to the mountains of Lower Balangay. Subsequently, along the battle line from near Damortis, eastward to Rosario, and near San Manuel, they repulsed enemy attacks. Furthermore, since January 16th, they have been engaging in fierce fighting with enemy mobile units that have invaded the northeast region of Mount Bacabac, repulsing these units with mobile warfare tactics. A unit of the Japanese tank forces bravely conducted a night raid on enemy troops near San Manuel on the night of January 27th, inflicting significant losses. (3) The losses inflicted on the enemy forces that landed in Lingayen Gulf, as far as can be determined, include 11,200 casualties, and the destruction or capture of 114 tanks and 71 artillery pieces of various types.

Philippine Islands Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The two divisions of the enemy's 14th Army, operating in the Clark Field area, are attacking the Japanese military positions in the highlands west of Bamban. The two armies are engaged in a bloody battle for the highlands. A portion of the enemy forces invaded Angeles, south of Clark Field, from the 27th. Utilizing fast-moving tank units, they invaded San Fernando, a key point on the road to Manila, on the 30th. Their vanguard advanced several miles from there toward Manila, reaching the vicinity of the Pampanga River, the largest river on Luzon Island, about 30 kilometers from Manila. The enemy forces that are rapidly invading Manila are now in a state where their rear communications rely solely on air transport. It is observed that the Japanese army is launching mobile operations against the isolated enemy vanguard from the flanks of the enemy's advance route and the front of Manila, in order to crush them in one fell swoop. The situation around the Pampanga River for the past few days is worthy of close attention.

Enemy Forces Attempt to Land Near Subic Bay

Luzon Front, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Approximately twenty enemy transport ships, under the cover of one battleship, two cruisers, and nine destroyers, invaded Subic Bay, about 100 kilometers northwest of Manila, on the afternoon of the 29th at 1 PM. After maneuvering overnight, at around 8:50 AM on the 30th, one of their battleships, seven destroyers, and seven transport ships approached the coast and began shelling with naval guns. At 11:45 AM, they landed on Grande Island in the center of the bay, encountering fierce resistance from the Japanese forces, and fierce fighting is currently underway. The enemy's attempt to land this time is to realize their ambition to recapture the Philippines and to echo the enemy forces that landed in Lingayen, in order to sweep across the Luzon Plain and advance south toward Manila. However, the enemy forces in the Lingayen area have suffered heavy losses due to repeated attacks by Japanese commando units and are unable to advance according to their original plan, making their future operations very difficult.

Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - As of the 1st, the results of the Japanese army's battles on Luzon Island are as follows: In the Rosario area east of Lingayen, the enemy continues to stubbornly attack, but the Japanese army's morale is high, and they are determined to crush and heavily damage the enemy's attacks. From around the 30th, the enemy began attacking the highlands northeast of Rosario, gradually invading and attempting to control the Camp One Pass, repeatedly shelling the area. The enemy's intention in this area is to control Kennon Road and invade Baguio City. In the central area, the enemy has advanced to the Saint Nicholas-Tayug battle line on the upper reaches of the Agno River. The enemy is fiercely shelling the Japanese army's positions in the Urdaneta, Umingan, and Muñoz areas, especially engaging in close combat near the Caragan Mountain highlands. At the same time, the enemy is landing subsequent troops in Sapaong. Since the morning of the 30th, the Sapaong bridgehead landing site has been ablaze due to Japanese attacks. In the eastern region of Lingayen Gulf, the enemy's casualties have reached over ten thousand due to Japanese attacks. In the Clark area, on the highlands west of Bamban, the Japanese army continues to fiercely attack the main force of the enemy's 14th Regiment which is heading south. The enemy air force's activity in this area has become full-scale. The enemy army is launching fierce counterattacks on the Japanese army's positions from both the air and the ground, and fierce offensive and defensive battles are currently underway. After the enemy invaded Sapaong around Manila, they continued south with tank groups under the cover of the air force. The enemy vanguard has invaded Bulacan Province, which is adjacent to the Manila area from Calumpit. At the same time, on the 30th and 31st, the enemy landed two divisions on the coast of San Ildefonso and the west coast of Grande Island in Subic Bay, attempting to cut off the northern part of the Bataan Peninsula, mix with the 4th Regiment moving south, and then use the forces landing on the west coast of Batangas to suppress the southern part of Manila from the southwest, planning to attack Manila from both the north and south. However, the Japanese army is engaging and attacking the enemy in all areas with all-out close-quarters combat, and fierce fighting is currently underway.

Japanese Forces on Luzon Prepare for Strong Counterattack

Philippine Islands Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the enemy forces launched mobile operations to seize the Manila area, the center of the battle on Luzon Island has gradually shifted to the southern region of the Luzon Plain around Clark Field. The enemy's two divisions, with tanks as the main force, have been engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in the area west of the Bamban-Manila-Calumpit-Clark Field battle line since the 27th. In order to strengthen the offensive against the Japanese army's positions from the front and sides of the Clark area, on the morning of the 30th, the enemy used battleships, cruisers, destroyers, etc. to invade Subic Bay in the northwestern part of the Bataan Peninsula and carry out shelling. At the same time, they are preparing to land in that area with forces inside and outside the two divisions and warships. According to enemy intelligence, they have already begun landing in that area. At the same time, near Corregidor Island, there seems to be a group of enemy small boats. The Japanese army is prepared for a strong counterattack, and a major bloody battle with the enemy will unfold.

### Taiwanese Youths Hold Enlistment Ceremony

Taiwan, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The first enlistment ceremony for Taiwanese youths after the implementation of conscription was held on February 1st. For the 70 years since Taiwan was governed by Japan, the 6.7 million islanders have worked tirelessly, day and night, to cultivate the spirit of good citizens. Since the beginning of the China Incident and the Great East Asia War, their spirit of dying for their country has become even more passionate. When the special volunteer soldier systems for the army (implemented in Showa 17 [1942]) and the navy (implemented in Showa 18 [1943]) were implemented, there was an unusually enthusiastic response from volunteers on the island. After the implementation of the conscription system on the island in September of Showa 18 [1943], all youths on the island were finally able to fulfill their highest wish. Now, a number of young men from the island, after being processed into eight camps on February 1st, will be assigned to units in Taipei and other areas to assume the great responsibility of guarding the territory.

### Japanese Army Ministry Announces Commanders of Various Military Districts and Appoints Chief of Staff of the China Expeditionary Army

### Air Raid on Syonan Island (Singapore)

Japanese Military Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - At 11:00 AM on the 1st, ninety B-29 aircraft flying from a base in Calcutta invaded Syonan Island (Singapore) in nine formations. Using the Seletar area as the center, they conducted blind bombing from an altitude of 9,000 meters. The Japanese anti-aircraft artillery units launched a fierce counterattack, and at 12:30 PM, the enemy aircraft began to flee to the northwest. The Japanese air force shot down one of the aircraft over Kranji and continued the pursuit, expanding the results of the battle. The damage on the Japanese side was minimal. It is believed that the enemy aircraft's bombing and reconnaissance operations since November 11th were intended to constrain the operations in the Philippines.

### Japanese Diet Enters Second Half of Session

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Diet has now entered the second half of its session after reconvening. On February 1st, the House of Representatives did not hold a plenary session, only convening committees on wartime civil affairs, the Central Cooperative Bank for Agriculture and Forestry, seamen's insurance, and equipment corporations, to deliberate on various bills. Similarly, the House of Peers did not hold a plenary session. During the Budget Committee meeting, members raised questions about strengthening wartime food production, reforming bureaucratic politics, and mobilizing students. Prime Minister Koiso, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada, and Minister of Welfare Hirose responded to the questions.

Japanese Scientists Strive for Wartime Research

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Dr. Yagi, President of the Japanese Technology Institute, stated on the 1st in the House of Representatives Pension Law Committee, in response to a question from Mr. Kino, regarding the Technology Institute's wartime posture, that the capabilities of Japanese scientists, if fully realized, are definitely not inferior to those of the United States. Since the implementation of the wartime researcher system the previous year, more than 200 wartime research projects have been conducted at the Technology Institute, mobilizing 6,000 wartime researchers who are determined to conduct research. Hundreds of others are conducting preparatory research. Under the direction of the Japanese Aviation Technology Promotion Association, they are engaged in wartime research. Researchers have abandoned all miscellaneous tasks and are focusing solely on wartime research. This is the spirit of scientific personnel's requisition and conscription, dedicating themselves to research.

### Director Matsushima Discusses Impressions of Return Trip to Japan: 100 Million Japanese People Have Soaring Fighting Spirit

The Japan-Allied Nations Army and Navy Joint Information Conference was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Hui Zhong Hotel, attended by Director Matsushima, Captain Shioda, Captain Matsumoto, entrustees Lin Junfu, Sakazume, Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, and dozens of reporters from various newspapers.

Captain Shioda Promoted to Important Position

Director Matsushima began by introducing the new Accounting Captain Matsumoto, of the Fleet Information Department, to the reporters, stating: Captain Shioda will soon be honorably transferred, and Captain Matsumoto will succeed him in his position. Captain Shioda has held this important position for the long period of two and a half years, making special contributions to Sino-Japanese friendship. At this time of great urgency in the war situation, the work of Sino-Japanese friendship is particularly important. We cannot help but feel regret at Captain Shioda's transfer to another position. His departure is also unavoidable due to promotions and other factors. The new Captain Matsumoto graduated from the Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University and has served on ships for the past two years. I hope that everyone will maintain the same connection with Captain Matsumoto as they had with Captain Shioda, so that Captain Shioda's achievements can be further developed. The coming and going of a person is a common occurrence, but at this time of farewell to Captain Shioda, we have a feeling of regret. On the one hand, we wish Captain Shioda more effort and struggle at the next level. We also have high expectations for Captain Matsumoto.

Nationwide Japanese Fighting Spirit Soars

I went to Tokyo in late January and would like to share what I heard and saw: I had not returned to Japan for a long period of one year and three months. This time, I saw a Japan in a state of pure decisive battle. One hundred million people were extremely excited, with a special attack spirit. Although the Japanese people have repeatedly suffered enemy B-29 bombing raids, their fighting spirit is soaring and has not been frustrated in the slightest. Even the most revered Ise Grand Shrine was affected, which has further galvanized the Japanese people's fighting spirit. Recently, the political system for decisive battles has been completed, as can be seen in the parliamentary Q&A. Secondly, what is most noteworthy is that although the enemy has tried hard to promote the air control of Japan, no damage has been seen in Tokyo and other cities. What is even more noteworthy is that in the cities, whether it is residences, shops, or factories, due to evacuation measures, there is a slightly desolate appearance, but the people running on the road are all lively and energetic, advancing to complete their tasks. In the past 2,600 years of Japanese history, it has never been invaded by foreign enemies. Although it has now suffered bombing, the general public is not confused at all and is extremely calm. This kind of vitality is also true of women and children, and they feel lonely when there are no air raids.

Astonishing Achievements in Increased Production

Furthermore, what I was most worried about before was the production problem. Having seen and heard it, I learned that the production side, although repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft, has not been affected in the slightest. The reason for this is that the Japanese air force's interception is effective, the air defense equipment is perfect, and the handling of incendiary bombs is thorough. The production ratio from last December to this March is cleverly shown. At the same time, Japan's material distribution method is complete, the neighborhood association organization is perfect, and to the general public. What is most appreciated is that the general male and female students are all diligent in public service, with the spirit of reaching victory. Even the general public has a firm will to win the war and overcome any difficulties.

Japanese Military Tactics Cause Enemy to Bleed

Regarding the Philippine battle situation, the enemy is using every means to attempt to attack Manila, but in fact, the fate of the Philippines is not in the Manila battle. Japanese tactics are to force the enemy to bleed more. Now, the Great East Asia War has undergone changes in its mode of operation compared to the past. Whether in terms of time or location, it is different from the past. General Yamashita once said: The enemy also has questions about this operation. On January 9, San Francisco radio referred to me, saying that the most optimistic Colonel Matsushima said that the US attack on the Philippines would cut off Japan's southern resources. I am not talented, but I am very honored to have been noticed by the American radio station. I have never made such a statement, so I am even more grateful for their broadcast.

Southern Route Unaffected

Now, the Japanese-American operations are both attrition warfare. Even if the Philippine operation cuts off southern resources, Japan has long been prepared and has combat power. What I saw on this trip is that if southern resources are cut off, what Japan will feel lacking is aluminum raw materials, but Japan has already prepared substitutes and it will have no impact. The enemy propaganda says that Rabaul Island has been completely cut off, but there are still many Japanese troops there. The Japanese army has the power of autonomy and self-reliance. Although it is difficult to predict how the war situation will develop in the future, the Japanese operations will definitely lure the enemy to a close range and destroy them. This policy will never change.

Enemy Aircraft Brutally Strafe Civilian Ships

Then, Captain Shioda said: Regarding the inhumanity of the American military, it has been shown repeatedly in the past. Recently, it has even indiscriminately bombed Chinese civilian ships that are completely defenseless. On January 16, a ship of the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company carrying 240 passengers was sailing upstream on the Yangtze River. Four enemy aircraft discovered that the ship had no equipment and that all those on board were civilians, and they carried out indiscriminate bombing and machine gun strafing. According to the captain of the ship: At about 2:00 PM on the 16th, four enemy aircraft were discovered at an altitude of 2,000 meters. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft descended to a low altitude of 100 meters. The captain took contingency measures, but the passengers were unable to escape. After thirty minutes of repeated machine gun strafing, 34 passengers were killed and 45 were injured. Originally, there is a distinction between combatants and non-combatants in warfare. Japanese military operations have always made this distinction on moral grounds, but the United States is not the same. They found that the people on board were civilians, but they thought it was a good opportunity and did not hesitate to take brutal measures. All the injured passengers were Chinese. Like the blind bombing of Hankou and Shanghai, they are all inhuman tramplings. In the future, the American enemy will probably continue to do so. I remember that a hundred years ago, an American ship called the Australia transported thousands of Chinese from Shanghai to the United States, and all of them died in their hands. The inhumanity of the United States is a consistent style in its history. Japan and China must cooperate closely to crush this brutal enemy wearing a human mask. Finally, he expressed unlimited regret for the 79 victims and their families.

Editorial

### Significance and Impact of Connecting the Canton-Hankou Railway

On December 10th of last year, Japanese troops in China and troops in Vietnam met at the Sino-Vietnamese border, opening up the international continental route. Since then, the north-south longitudinal line of the East Asian continent, except for a small section of the Canton-Hankou Railway centered on Shaoguan, has been completely opened. Recently, Japanese troops in Hunan and Guangdong continued to advance, and the Japanese troops from the north and south met between Lechang and Shaoguan on January 27th. From then on, the continental longitudinal line was unblocked.

This operation shows the strength of the Japanese forces. Although the Japanese army in the Philippines must use elite and large forces to resist the US air, land, and sea offensives, it can still continue to advance in mainland China with rapid and powerful momentum, and continue to obtain great results.

On the other hand, it increasingly exposes the fragility of the Chongqing army. This operation was launched at the beginning of January, and by the middle of January, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack, completing a major mission in just ten days. The junction of Hunan and Guangdong along the Canton-Hankou Railway has many steep mountain roads and is said to be guarded by natural dangers, but now it is unable to defend it. It is also said that when the Chongqing army retreated, important military facilities and transportation equipment, such as tunnels and bridges between Yuechang and Baishi, were not destroyed, which shows how panicked they were.

After the Canton-Hankou Railway is completely opened, it will have a great effect on the Japanese army, whether for continental operations or for the war against the US in the islands. In the future, the mobilization of Japanese troops in the north and south and the transportation of supplies will be more convenient, and the relationship between the ocean and the mainland can be more closely connected. The enemy's attempt to contain the Japanese army in mainland China has repeatedly failed. At present, the Japanese army not only opened up the Canton-Hankou Railway, but also captured the important places of Haifeng and Lufeng near the South China Sea southeast of Guangzhou via Huizhou, and controlled the coastal areas of Guangdong Province, giving the enemy's delusion of landing on the coast of South China a head-on blow. The Japanese army took the lead, and if the enemy dares to commit an offense against the coast, they will surely suffer a painful annihilation. Therefore, the battle of the Canton-Hankou Railway is helpful to the Japanese army's operations in the Philippines and is extremely huge.

Furthermore, the Japanese army also occupied Suichuan in the southwest and is advancing towards Ganzhou. Suichuan and Ganzhou are important air force bases for the US in China. Most of the enemy aircraft that attacked central and southern China came from the airfields of these bases. This is obviously a great blow to the enemy's air guerrilla warfare.

Looking at the results of the Japanese army's battle, it can be proved that the strongholds needed by the Japanese army in terms of strategy have the power to be in hand at any time. At the same time, the operation to open up the Canton-Hankou Railway was not only to attack Chongqing, but more actively to prevent the enemy's landing attempt and fulfill the responsibility of defending East Asia.

Recently, due to the urgency of the European war and the tension of the Philippine operations, the public's attention has been focused on this. Therefore, those who are good at creating rumors and causing trouble have the opportunity to spread rumors. With the success of the Japanese army's continental operations again, it can shift the public attention and break the rumors of the rumor mongers.

### Minister of Justice Wu Discusses Administrative Policy: Determined to Do His Best to Abolish Extraterritoriality

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The new Minister of Judicial Administration, Wu Songgao, met with Chinese and foreign reporters at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to report on his administrative plans after taking office. His original words are as follows:

This time, I was ordered to be transferred to be the head of the judiciary, but I firmly declined, but I took office in the ministry yesterday. I am a man of few words, and I only want to say to the people in this ministry my hopes: I have always been serving the Party and the country with all my might as my tenet. Before, I was sent to receive various concessions and plan the unification of the Shanghai municipality and other work. I only thought that I would do my best in this area to benefit both the country and the people. The relationship between the judiciary and the people is even closer. If the court's judgment is not fair and the prison management is not perfect, directly or indirectly, it will increase the suffering of the people. In the future, I will follow my original intention and, based on the current environment, try to improve the judicial administration to reduce the suffering of the people.

Gradually abolishing unequal treaties to strive for China's freedom and equality is what the Founding Father showed us. In recent years, with the painstaking efforts of the late Chairman Wang and Acting Chairman Chen and the central authorities, and with the help of allies in good faith, the concessions of various countries in China have been gradually recovered. What is now most urgent to prepare for is the abolition of extraterritoriality. There are more than one reasons why this kind of unequal treaty can still exist in our country, but the imperfection of our country's judicial system, the foreigner in order to make an excuse, is one of the reasons. At present, the Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality in China has been established, and all affairs will be actively carried out. I happen to be taking over the law at this time, and I will make my best efforts in all aspects so that all preparations for the abolition of extraterritoriality can be twice the result with half the effort. I feel that my personal ability is weak, and the responsibility is not light. I still hope that all the wise men and leaders of the legal community will give me guidance at any time so that I can complete my mission as soon as possible.

Once the negotiation is completed, the rice will be transported to Beijing.

### The Enemy's Pressure on Chongqing's Internal Affairs from the United States Increases

Tokyo, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Regarding the United States' mediation for compromise with the Chinese Communists, in addition to harboring certain political ambitions, it also seeks to interfere in Chongqing's internal affairs. On the other hand, based on its war against Japan, it also feels the need to realize this quickly. The U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, due to the loss of bases in Central and South China in the second half of last year, urgently seeks to replenish them and must start base construction. Thus, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists has become an indispensable prerequisite. According to recent news from Beijing, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing has recently set up three bases in Lanzhou, and is also preparing to set up bases in Ningxia Province. As this work becomes increasingly acute, the United States' pressure on Chongqing is bound to increase.

### Domestic Briefs

Hankou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Since last year, the Hubei Provincial Government has decided on a rural production increase plan in order to vigorously launch a production increase campaign. The original production increase committee was reorganized, and officials with Sino-Japanese military ties reorganized it into the highest planning agency for rural production for both China and Japan. The adjusted personnel of the committee are recorded as follows: The chairman is concurrently held by the governor of the province, and the standing committee members are concurrently held by the director of the Department of Political Affairs, the director of the Department of Construction, the mayor of Hankou, and the consultant stationed in Hankou of the Maeda Economic Committee.

Suzhou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The U.S. planes stationed in Chongqing bombed the Pukou area, which recently suffered heavy losses. Many people were killed and injured. Governor Ren allocated 1 million yuan to relieve the refugees in the area and ordered Cao Chongsan, the magistrate of Jiangpu County, to distribute it properly.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Zhijiang Enemy Airfield, Destroying Ten Planes

Continental Base, February 1st, Central News Agency: Japanese bombing units took advantage of the adverse weather to attack the advanced base of the enemy's U.S. Air Force at Zhijiang Airport. Despite the interception by enemy fighter planes and intense anti-aircraft fire, all bombs hit the target, burning three unidentified aircraft, one large aircraft, and one small aircraft, and destroying five aircraft. The Japanese returned safely.

Continental Battlefield Becomes Fortress

Hunan Front Line, February 1st, Central News Agency: The opening of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway has now been completed. The last base of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, Suichuan, was occupied by the Japanese army on the 8th. The results of this operation are as follows: (1) The division of the third, fourth, and ninth war zones. (2) The entire Yuehan Railway between Hankou and Guangzhou was opened. (3) The Suichuan-Ganzhou base cluster, the last base of the U.S. Air Force in southeastern China, is now completely occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's continental north-south operation has completely occupied southeastern China. According to reports, the third and seventh war zones, and a part of the fourth and ninth war zones, are corridors of the seventh war zone and the common front of Yu Hanmou, Gu Zhutong, and Xue Yue. The purpose of these generals was to coordinate with the Chongqing army in southwestern China, with He Yingqin as the new commander in Xinde, and to attack from both the front and the rear, and cut off the Japanese army's continental north-south route. However, after the end of this operation, these internal and external war zones of the Chongqing army have been completely divided, so the Chongqing army's plan has also been shattered. This time, due to the rapid operation of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army did not have time to destroy the railway tracks and iron bridges of the Yuehan Railway, and completely occupied them. At this point, when the construction of the northern section of the Yuehan Railway between Hankou and Hengyang is completed, the opening of the Yuehan Railway can be expected in the near future.

In addition, the Suichuan-Ganzhou base cluster, centered on Suichuan and Ganzhou, is the last base of the U.S. Air Force in southeastern China. The enemy army used this to bomb the airfield in the Japanese-occupied area and the navigation routes in the East China Sea, and tried to block them. Now, due to the loss of Suichuan, the strength of the Suichuan-Ganzhou base cluster has been reduced by half, and the remaining base clusters are under the threat of the Japanese army and it is difficult to exert their power. Now, the Guangzhou-Hong Kong area is connected to Hengyang, and the key points along the coast of South China are also connected to the Japanese army's line of operation that runs through the center of the mainland. Therefore, even if the enemy army touches the mainland, the Japanese army can exert the power of the continental artery between Korea, Manchuria, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, and annihilate them. This operation can be said to be the result of the Japanese army's offensive operation in the past four months. At this point, the goal of continental fortification has been completed.

Japanese Army's Operations Become More Active

Guangzhou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The Japanese army's opening of the Yuehan Railway this time is a major stage since the Greater East Asia War. The Yuehan Railway area, which runs through Hunan and Hubei, is a major producer of rice, peanuts, wheat, tung oil, and tungsten coal in terms of materials, and the yield is extremely rich, becoming a source for cultivating the anti-Japanese strength of Chongqing in South China. The 980-odd kilometers of the railway had been heavily attacked by the Japanese army. They have occupied 630 kilometers, and the remaining 350 kilometers have completely lost their transportation capacity under the fierce bombing of Japanese planes. The only remaining part is from south of Chen County to Yingde in Guangdong Province. Since the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing has connected the Yuehan Railway with the Henggui branch line for 10 kilometers eastward, and intersected with the Guiyang line on the south bank of the Qin-Gui line and the two major highways of Longzhou, Nanning, and Guilin, forming a southwestern construction common station line. However, at present, the Yuehan Railway from Hankou, through the key points of Changsha, Hengyang, and Shaoguan, to Guangzhou, has been completely opened, and it is connected to the Pinghan Railway. The great railway running through mainland China will become a favorable transportation route for the Japanese army, and the past major artery of Chongqing's resistance has now been completely severed. The Japanese army uses this major artery to increase its active forces in this operation.

Japanese Commando Teams Endure Hardships

Hunan Front Line, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Since the main force of the Japanese army began operations in the southern section of the Yuehan Railway this time, its southward advance team reached Lechang in just five days, broke into the famous Dayu Ling Mountains, and suppressed the natural barrier between Baishi and Lechang. During this period, they waded through ten bridges and tunnels on the railway for ten kilometers. Their activity is admirable. The easternmost part of the Xiang-Yue border to the highest peak of the Dayu Ling Mountains, a steep mountain of 1,200 meters, constitutes the difficult pass of about 30 kilometers between Baishi and Lechang. Passing through five tunnels and bridges in the Yuehan Railway required enormous labor and materials, and it took considerable months to build successfully. Therefore, the Japanese army in this southern operation was indeed painstaking. The Chongqing army tried its best to ensure these bridges and tunnels before destroying them, while the Japanese southward advance team secretly carried out special training, cut off the Chongqing army's retreat with several commando teams, and in order to ensure the bridges and tunnels, they first began the operation, and gradually decided to sneak in, and cleverly broke through the Chongqing army's heavy surveillance, and endured the hardships of the dangerous mountain roads. Nineteen days after half a month, they began to be active with the Baishi-Lechang Railway as the target. The commando teams, like in a no man's land, suddenly secured ten bridges and tunnels in turn. Therefore, this heroic and arduous spirit is the key to determining the success of this operation to open up the Yuehan Railway.

### The Focus of the Eastern Front Shifts to the Warta River Bend; Soviet Pioneers Reach Küstrin

Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Haitong Agency reported: Although the fighting southwest of Hongdu was fierce in 24 hours, there was no change. The Soviet offensive in the south has not slowed down, and the main goal is within the Upper Silesian industrial area. The Soviet army from Rybnik to Glogau is approaching the Warta River, and the Soviet vanguard is attempting to cross the river at several points, which the German army is resisting. There is no particularly important military development in East Prussia, and the German army is still in an active position. The German army has established a corridor west of Königsberg, so that the garrison in this area can make contact with the German army elsewhere in East Prussia, and the Soviet army is attempting to close this corridor. General Sukhov's troops have the ambition to break through the German defense line and directly approach Berlin. The fighting in this area has attracted worldwide attention. The Soviet commander also knows that going deep alone is risky. The battle of Posen is still fierce. The Soviet vanguard has crossed the Obra River a few days ago, and recently tank formations and strong infantry forces have also crossed the river westward to assist the vanguard in fighting in Sulechów, Świebodzin, Międzyrzecz, and Schwiebus. Therefore, the main battlefield between the Soviet army and the German army defending the border has shifted westward to the center of the Warta River and Warthe River bend. There should be a large-scale battle in this area at present. On the Netze River front, there is also military action between Friedeberg and Schneidemühl. Schneidemühl is still in the hands of the German army. The Soviet vanguard passed through this city and rushed into the Deutsch Krone district, but has been blocked. The Soviet army, which has crossed the Netze River, immediately moved westward after crossing the river, has rushed past Landsberg and entered the Neumark district. The Soviet light troops have reached the Soldin-Küstrin (Küstrin is north of Frankfurt) line. The mission of the Soviet army north of the Netze River is obviously to protect the troops fighting in the Warta River and Warthe River bend. We can see the importance of this situation by opening the map. From a careful observation of the Soviet commanders' actions, we know that the Soviet general is already considering that the German army is about to launch a large-scale counter-offensive.

East Prussian War Intensifies

Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: German Agency reported that a German military spokesman claimed on Thursday that the Soviet army in East Prussia has reduced the German front line again. The Soviet army is currently attempting to advance towards Pillau, the main entrance to the Königsberg harbor. Fierce fighting is taking place there.

Pomeranian Front Stabilized

Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Haitong Agency reported: The mountainous roads of Bohemia-Moravia have been cleared of snow, and military transportation has become smoother. A large number of troops and supplies of heavy weapons are being rapidly reinforced to the Silesian front, so the Soviet bridgehead on the west bank of the Warta River has been unable to expand. The most important of the bridgeheads, such as a part of the German armored forces fighting east of the Warta River, has now been transferred to the west bank of the river to assist in the battle. There are now four or five divisions of German infantry gathered there, and it seems impossible for the Soviet army to cut off the traffic between Silesia and the north. In addition, the bridgehead in Steinau and the bridgehead in Ohlau are tasked with surrounding Breslau. The Soviet army has specially transferred the 3rd Tank Army east of the forest near Rothenburg and Kosel north to assist the former two bridgeheads, which shows their importance to these two places. The Soviet army gathered on both banks of the upper reaches of the Warta River also has thirty-five infantry divisions and two tank battalions, preparing to enter Moravia. On the one hand, the German army is also rapidly reinforcing to protect the industrial center, and it is expected that the Soviet army's attack will be severely damaged.

### German Minister of Propaganda Publishes Thesis Encouraging National Struggle to Save the European Crisis

Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: German Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels, in the latest issue of the "National Weekly", strongly stated the fact of the European crisis, and demanded that the people resolve to resist, the main points of which are as follows: Europe, the political heart of the world, has been forced into a difficult stage before Stalin's offensive. Eastern Europe must not hesitate for a moment. At present, the only one who can confront the material strength of red anarchy is Germany. If Europe does not save itself, it will have to let communism do whatever it wants. The European war situation has reached the most dangerous stage. If we want to save the European crisis, we have to fight to the death.

### Berlin Transforms into a Fortress; Citizens Embrace the Determination to Resist the Enemy

Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Haitong Agency reported: The eyes of the world are now focused on Berlin, which is approaching the front line. This city of millions of residents is now preparing for war. I toured Berlin for a week in the underground tunnel and witnessed an endless stream of workers rushing to the factories in the underground transportation center. In front of a large factory, there were 10,000 workers waiting for shifts to leave the factory to rest and work in the factory. The two teams were silent. At noon, I arrived in the commercial center and saw the department stores still busy, and people were watching the price list in front of the restaurants. There were also many people watching the newspaper in front of the newspaper office. The headline of the newspaper was that the war had entered the Brandenburg Province. Berlin is still outside the main front and no artillery fire can be heard. The pilot still has 70 kilometers to reach the eastern front, but he feels that he is approaching the front line more and more. The roads leading to the east are all armored forces, and troops and supply teams are also gathered in the transportation center. The police on duty are wearing helmets and carrying guns, and the strength of the city's defense is strengthened. The people of Berlin all go to the suburbs to serve as members of the people's assault team. Important bases outside the regiment are also building fortifications. Trenches are being built around Berlin. Those who have not gone to participate in the people's assault team are being trained to use machine guns, etc. Everyone is determined to make every house a fortress, ready for a bloody battle. However, there is still no barbed wire set up in the city, which shows that the military leaders believe that the Soviet army has no intention of breaking into the city. Most foreign civilians and prisoners of war can still come and go freely in the city without restrictions, and there is no panic.

### Roosevelt and Churchill Begins Meeting in Cairo

Lisbon, February 2nd, Central News Agency: According to Australian broadcasting: Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin began their meeting in Cairo on the 1st.

Rumor of Announcement regarding Germany

Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: German Agency reported: A foreign news agency close to German officials recently published an article saying that it is rumored that Roosevelt and Churchill will issue a declaration to the German people at the meeting. Although the declaration will require unconditional surrender, the conditions of this condition will be deleted, and its explanation will be more detailed. The German side has long expected this move. If it comes true, it is only because the British and Americans have greatly criticized the unconditional surrender and said that it is a serious mistake that will cost the anti-Axis countries millions of soldiers. The British and Americans changed their attitude in order to save the blood of their own soldiers. The declaration may say that the anti-Axis countries will only destroy the National Socialist Party and not the Germans, but no matter what its content is, the attitude of the Germans will never change.

Political Problems are not Easily Solved

Madrid, February 2nd, Central News Agency: German Agency reported that the correspondent of the Spanish "Ya Bao" in the capital of Argentina wrote an article on the Argentine newspaper's view of Hopkins' speech in Rome, saying that the anti-Axis countries now fear peace as much as they feared war before, because the political problems that have been delayed and unresolved have now suddenly become urgent.

### General Situation of Zhoupu (Part Two)

— Yifei

Industry

The industry in Zhoupu is well-developed, comparable to Datuan. The majority of the factories are cotton mills, weaving mills, flour mills, rice milling plants, and oil mills. The largest cotton mill is the Lifeng Cotton Mill in Zhoupu town, with a capital of 13,000,000 yuan. It has 2,000 spindles. The machinery was originally owned by the former Wing On Cotton Mill in Shanghai. Its products bear the "Sailing Boat" brand and are sold in Shanghai and rural areas. The Mao Xin Cotton Mill has a capital of 50,000,000 yuan and 800 spindles. Other smaller cotton mills, such as Daxin, Tongxin, and Hexin, which is about to be established, are mostly concentrated in Jimin Town, about 18 li from Zhoupu. In addition to cotton mills, the town also has Zhong Wanyuan and Qia Xing Flour Mills, and Xianglongsheng Oil Pressing Plant. The town is full of factories and is known as "Little Wuxi," which it truly deserves. In Zhoupu, there are flour mills such as Liji, Yuanfenghing, and Gonghe. The He Feng Dyeing and Weaving Factory is a weaving mill. The large and magnificent Dahua Match Factory is also located in the area.

Education

The development of education in Zhoupu is largely due to the efforts of the current district head, Wu Xianhe. Mr. Wu is a local and has been serving in the education sector for many years. Currently, in addition to serving as the district head and principal of the No. 2 Middle School of the County, he also serves as the manager of rice shops and money shops. He spares no effort in promoting education and was the first to advocate a semi-compulsory, completely free enrollment policy for school-age children. His enthusiasm for education is admirable.

Zhoupu currently has three middle schools: the No. 2 Middle School of the County and the private Shihua and Yaguang. The No. 2 Middle School and its affiliated elementary school have specially built school buildings, located near Zhoupu Park, with a beautiful and ideal environment. There are a total of fifty-three elementary schools in the district, with county-run schools accounting for two-thirds.

From this semester onward, all public, private, elementary, and middle schools in Zhoupu will be exempt from tuition and fees, and the heads of each township will be responsible for supervising the enrollment of school-age children. At the same time, to ensure that teachers can teach with peace of mind, their salaries will be increased. In addition to their stipends, each teacher will be given five to one dan of rice per month (based on the amount of coursework they handle). Under the supervision of the district head, staff from the Civil Affairs Section will visit various locations once a month to inspect. Teachers with excellent performance will be rewarded separately.

According to District Head Wu, after the newly established measures are implemented, the total office expenses for each school will require a subsidy of more than 100,000 yuan per semester. The cost of rice for teachers will be 700 dan per semester. The source of funding for the former subsidy will be from a new "Educational Brokerage Fee" (i.e., when land is bought and sold, the district office will collect a fee of 2% of the sale price from the buyer as the "Educational Brokerage Fee") to make up for the deficit. As for the rice for the students, the heads of each township will be responsible for raising it from wealthy gentry and merchants, with each bao contributing approximately three dan every six months according to the current budget. After the rice is raised, the local township and bao leaders, together with local gentry and school representatives, will form a management committee to be responsible for its safekeeping and distribution to the schools on a monthly basis. This method is very good, with very little corruption, and is worthy of promotion.

The qualification review of teachers was also implemented on January 28 to eliminate teachers with inadequate qualifications and prevent them from continuing to delay the future of students. (The End)

### Chairman Chen of the Rice Control Association Discusses the Current State of Procurement Work: Efforts to Break Through Difficulties and Maintain the City's Food Supply

At the beginning of his tenure, Mayor Zhou repeatedly expressed his determination to improve the people's livelihood in the city. In particular, he actively sought to smooth the source of rice and grain. At the same time, in order to first stabilize the lives of civil servants and journalists, he specially included them in the key distribution list, expressing his best efforts to solve the overall livelihood of the citizens in the short term. Seeing that the municipal government had expressed its determination to maintain the people's food supply, but that the source of rice and grain still depended on the assistance of the Rice Control Association, the reporter interviewed Chairman Chen of the Rice Control Association to understand the progress of the association's procurement of rice and grain, and how it would cooperate with the municipal government to stabilize the people's livelihood in the future. The following is Chairman Chen's response:

Current Status of Procurement Work

(1) Regarding the current status of the association's rice and grain procurement work, January and February are the peak procurement season. Therefore, in order to actively promote the procurement work, most of our staff have been dispatched to various rice-producing areas to assist in the work. With the cooperation of the Allied Self-Defense Forces, the procurement of rice and grain should be completed as scheduled, and transported to Shanghai to ensure the food supply for the people. This is the current status of the procurement work. However, there are currently three difficulties that prevent the city's rice supply from being opened up in the short term. (1) The gold problem was the prerequisite for purchasing rice and grain. The association has been working hard to plan for this matter. Currently, this problem has been solved. With sufficient funds, the progress of rice and grain procurement will naturally not be a problem. (2) Transportation problems. In the past, the association's rice and grain transportation to Shanghai relied entirely on inland waterway ships. Recently, due to the arrival of winter and the severe cold weather, the rivers have frozen, and ships cannot pass, thus hindering the arrival of rice and grain in Shanghai. However, this is a seasonal problem and will soon be restored. (3) Public security problems. Due to the poor public security in the rural areas, the transportation of rice and grain from several rice-producing areas has encountered difficulties, and it is impossible to transport them to Shanghai continuously. The above points are the main reasons hindering the transportation of rice and grain to Shanghai. However, the association is currently working on solutions to these difficulties and will solve them in the short term. (2) As for the municipal government's determination to increase the amount of rationed rice, the association's only cooperation is to actively increase the source of rice and grain. With Mayor Zhou's decision, we will do our best in our position to ensure that supply and demand are equal.

Household Rice and Grain Can Be Distributed

(3) The reason why household rice has not been distributed for a long time is because the distribution agency has recently been replaced. The new authorities are engaged in internal reorganization, which has slightly delayed the date. The association has long prepared the rice and grain, so it will be distributed as scheduled. (4) Regarding suppressing rice prices, the municipal government has expressed its determination, but this problem depends on the cooperation of the entire city's citizens to be effective. The association actively smooths the source of rice and grain and maintains the distribution of household rice and grain as scheduled. After the food supply is solved, no one will be interested in black market rice and grain, and the drop in black market rice prices is inevitable. However, the food supply in Central China has not been sufficient in the past and has relied on Siam rice from abroad. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, foreign transportation has been cut off, but the consumption quantity is still the same as before. In addition, the rural areas have had poor harvests in recent years, and the lack of rice and grain is inevitable. In the past, the government authorities launched a flour movement to encourage people to supplement with flour in order to remedy this defect. This movement has long been implemented in North China, so the food panic in that area has been resolved in recent years. The people in the southern regions of the Yangtze River have not been able to follow suit, so the rice and grain shortage still cannot be resolved. In addition, some merchants in the city have taken the opportunity to hoard, and the original grain transported to Shanghai for supply has been manipulated, making it impossible to universally supply the market. This point is the main reason for the high rice prices. Therefore, my opinion is that suppressing rice prices depends on the cooperation of all parties in the private sector to achieve the ideal work.

### Mayor Zhou Held a Banquet Yesterday for Allied Officials in Shanghai to Thank Them for Their Assistance in Promoting Municipal Administration

In order to thank the Allied overseas authorities in Shanghai for their assistance in promoting municipal administration, and to strengthen friendly relations, Mayor Zhou held a banquet for the Allied authorities stationed in Shanghai at the Central Reserve Bank on the fourth floor at 6:30 p.m. yesterday (2nd). Secretary-General Luo and many bureau chiefs of the municipal government were also invited to attend. During the banquet, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves.

### Police Bureau Distributes Free Police Rice

In order to improve the treatment of police officers, the Shanghai Police Bureau has decided to implement the free distribution of police rice to national police officers starting in February. In order to ensure the accuracy of the number of people and prevent fraudulent claims, the following three measures have been stipulated to ensure the proper use of public funds. (1) The current number of personnel will be divided into three categories: (Category A) Married with children, (Category B) Married, and (Category C) Unmarried. The forms will be filled out and submitted within three days of the order. It is stipulated that part-time personnel may not receive it concurrently. The number of personnel should be indicated if there is a part-time job. (2) The Supervisory Office will send officers to various branches and teams to conduct a careful count and verification. It must be submitted within one week, paying particular attention to the following two points: (1) Whether there are part-time personnel claiming police rice under aliases, (2) A thorough count and verification must be conducted, and no perfunctory favoritism is allowed. (3) If the responsible officials report inaccurately or the personnel sent by the Bureau engage in favoritism or perfunctory behavior, they will be severely punished according to the law.

### Rickshaws Are Strictly Prohibited from Soliciting Business

In order to conserve electricity, the Shanghai Urban Transportation Company has temporarily changed the tram operating hours to two shifts, morning and evening. After all trams and trolley buses stop running from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., most citizens hire rickshaws or pedicabs for transportation. Therefore, the business of rickshaws in the city has benefited several times over. In particular, rickshaws soliciting business on busy streets are not only violating regulations but also obstructing traffic. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities issued a notice to all rickshaw companies yesterday, strictly prohibiting soliciting business and requiring them to comply with the rickshaw rental price approved by the authorities on January 16, which is 300 yuan for a minimum of 30 minutes, plus 50 yuan for every 5 minutes thereafter, and 600 yuan per hour. If there is any extra demand, citizens can report it at any time, and the authorities will deal with it severely.

Wanxingming expressed forgiveness, etc. Afterwards, Luofuji sent a thank-you banquet worth 40,000 yuan in China Reserve Certificates as a token of gratitude. We believe that mediation is a matter of friendship and should not think of rewards. In addition, at a time when frugality is valued, there should be no unnecessary waste. We firmly refused to accept it. We have decided to allocate the entire amount to the Xinwen and Shenbao subsidy funds to benefit the above two parties. Enclosed is a check for 20,000 yuan in China Reserve Certificates. Please accept it on our behalf."

Jilin is known for its spirit of Bushido and has also performed well in Group A, especially their 8-0 victory over Wendu, which is considered their masterpiece. Therefore, although Lianyi is likely to win, it must also guard against an upset. According to the latest news, Luo Shoufu is still unable to play due to illness and will be replaced by Gao Xiuqing.

Zhengxing Girls' Middle School has always promoted physical education, and with Mr. Liu in charge, it will surely add a unique splendor to women's sports.

### Several Things That Should Be Implemented Amidst the Advocacy for Thrift

— Yao

In recent years, due to the difficulty of obtaining materials and the exhaustion of people's livelihoods, the call for thrift has permeated society. On the government side, the Ministry of Social Welfare is advocating from above, and among the people, there is also the establishment of the Shanghai Citizens' Thrift Association, with celebrities speaking out and newspapers promoting it tirelessly. However, upon careful examination of the reality, it is found that those who are truly practicing thrift are none other than the general wage-earning class whose purchasing power has fallen to the brink of starvation. These people, without the persuasion of others, have already cut back to the point where they can no longer cut back any further. On the other hand, observing those merchants who have obtained war profiteering, they continue to be extravagant and unrestrained in their spending, never even thinking about conserving resources. This phenomenon urgently requires social leaders to take it as their responsibility to change customs and habits, to lead by example with practical action, and not to engage in empty talk. The spirit of the thrifty arrangements made by Mr. Wen Lanting when he married his granddaughter-in-law on the 24th of last month, is perhaps close to this ideal.

We believe that advocating for thrift measures that are too lofty will be difficult to achieve real results. Here, we propose a few practical and easily implementable examples, hoping that everyone will actively promote them.

It is often seen that when a family experiences a bereavement, they often publish obituary advertisements in the initial days of mourning or send out obituary notices everywhere. As a result, relatives and friends have no choice but to spend money on transportation to attend the funeral and offer condolences. When the "Fifth Seventh Day" memorial service (35th day after death) arrives, they even more grandly publish advertisements in the newspaper a few days in advance and send out obituaries everywhere, causing relatives and friends to spend money again. This kind of double expenditure of money and time is too far from the principle of thrift and should be urgently reformed.

We propose that in the future, when a member of society unfortunately experiences a bereavement, if an obituary has already been published or obituary notices have been widely distributed at the time of the initial mourning, there should not be the issue of sending out obituaries and holding a memorial service on the "Fifth Seventh Day". If the memorial service is deemed important, then there is no need to widely announce the bereavement at the beginning, so as to avoid relatives and friends making multiple trips, wasting time and money. On the part of the notified relatives and friends, if they have already attended the wake and given gifts during the initial mourning, then there is no need to attend the "Fifth Seventh Day" memorial service.

2.  The Lunar New Year has been abolished for a long time, but social habits are difficult to change. In the past few years, even during wartime, the old custom of New Year visits still persisted. At present, transportation costs are high, and even a short journey costs one or two hundred yuan. The "tea money" (tip) alone, at each household, cannot be less than one hundred yuan. If, within the four days of the Lunar New Year, an average person visits ten relatives and friends for New Year visits, then each person must spend at least three thousand yuan. Moreover, according to custom, etiquette requires reciprocity. If relatives and friends of similar status come to visit you, you should return the visit. Therefore, statistically, the amount of waste generated for the sake of New Year visits within these four days must be shockingly large. Furthermore, based on usual observations, those who go out to pay New Year visits are mostly those who seek favors from others. These people mostly live on their salaries and are already very difficult in ordinary times. How can they afford this extra expenditure?

We propose that this year, the bad habit of New Year visits should be thoroughly eliminated so that the general middle class can ease their burden slightly and take advantage of this early spring holiday to allow these people, who are busy all year round, to rest a little. The implementation of this matter hinges on the senior staff of various organizations and factories taking the lead in advocating and clearly showing their subordinates and relatives and friends their determination to abolish New Year visits this year, so as to lead by example, so that subordinates and those who seek favors from me do not have the hidden concern that not paying New Year visits will affect their prospects. The Shanghai Citizens' Thrift Association should also loudly appeal and actively advocate for practical results.

In addition, giving New Year gifts among relatives and friends at the end of the lunar year, holding birthday celebrations for people who have long passed away, holding memorial services for deceased relatives, or actions that are close to madness or wasting time and money are all not in line with the principle of thrift, and these should be strongly eliminated without further ado.

### A Visit to the Shanghai Poor Children's Home

The "Shanghai Poor Children's Home," which has a history of more than thirty years in Shanghai society, has long been known to the reporter for its spirit of hard work and practical action. The reporter took time out the other day to visit and learned that Mr. Chen Zhongfu, the director of the home, and others have worked hard in recent years to maintain the home. However, in such a serious period of social malaise, it is truly fortunate that poor children can enjoy the happiness of both education and care in such a paradise.

The address of the home is on Jumen Road in Nanshi. Opposite it is the Qu Zhenren Temple. The home's foundation has more than forty mu of land, which is rare in the urban society of Shanghai. Unfortunately, most of the home's buildings were destroyed during the recent incident, so now there are only ten or so rooms. The most noteworthy thing is that it has partnered with the financial community ××× and others to open a farm. There are dairy cows, bees, vegetable gardens, and nurseries. Students from the Department of Agriculture in their duties practice on this farm.

On that day, Director Wu of the home led me on a week-long tour of the home. I learned that the home, in its makeshift manner, has seven classrooms, two offices, and a total of four dormitories for students and teachers, and three kitchens, storage rooms, etc., which is a decent scale. Because it was during the winter vacation, I was unable to witness the actual teaching situation at each level.

At present, the home has more than 300 students in its primary school department. The home's affiliated students, that is, commuting students, not only do not pay tuition, but also have textbooks provided by the home. Therefore, the poor children living near the home benefit greatly. Mr. Wu said that the admission procedures for the home's students are universal. Families of any poor children can apply to the home, so the home's students are more numerous than those of other child welfare organizations. Mr. Wu also said that the home's method of teaching students focuses on "spiritual training" and "the combination of hand and mind." Therefore, graduates of the home are generally diligent and reliable in their service. For example, the Minhang Wanchang Soy Sauce Garden has employed four graduates as apprentices due to the excellence of their work.

The reporter also inquired about the home's organization and financial situation. According to Mr. Wu, the highest organization of the home is the board of directors. The board of directors elects two people to serve as the president and supervisor of the home to carry out the home's administrative work. Therefore, the home's affairs are equivalent to the board of directors being directly responsible. However, because the home's regular income consists of only more than 200 mu of land, the rent received in a year, as it stands now, is not enough to cover expenses for one month. Therefore, it can only seek assistance from society. Mr. Wu also said that the home was established in the first year of the Qing Xuantong era and has been in operation for 37 years. It has never publicly solicited donations. At present, due to the extremely high prices, the board of directors is truly struggling to cope and has no choice but to appeal to enthusiastic people in society. The reporter listened to Mr. Wu's words and also deeply agreed. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in society will generously offer their benevolent assistance and create blessings for orphans and the poor. This is truly an act of accumulating boundless merit!

It is also heard that the famous movie star Miss Li Lihua, in view of the importance of the home's work and the difficulty of its funding, has decided to personally perform Peking Opera on stage at the Golden Grand Theater on the 5th of this month, and has invited famous amateur and professional performers to join in the performance in order to do her utmost to raise funds. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion on the day of the charity performance! (Guang Wen)

I am grateful for the generosity of relatives and friends, but at this difficult time, how can I accept such congratulations? Therefore, I humbly transfer the gifts to various beneficial undertakings to benefit relatives and friends. Considering that the greatest virtue of heaven and earth is life, your organization handles maternity assistance funds, which benefit the people and are of great merit. Therefore, I donate 20,000 yuan to be used for the assistance fund.

(2) Ms. Guan Guiwei, in view of the current high cost of living, the fact that general poor pregnant women are unable to obtain appropriate and reasonable obstetric care when they are about to give birth, which seriously affects the health of pregnant women and infants, specially generously donated 50,000 yuan to the maternity assistance fund of this office to help poor pregnant women and provide free obstetric care. Ms. Guan's enthusiasm is admirable, and we would like to express our gratitude on behalf of her.

### Showing Compassion for the Unemployed Donating Small Business Loans

Mr. Zhou Ganfu, in view of the recent industrial and commercial downturn and the sudden increase in unemployment, felt deeply moved and specially donated 10,000 yuan to this office for small business loans to help those who are struggling to start a small business but lack funds, so that they have the opportunity to make a living. Mr. Zhou's donation embodies the intention of helping the unemployed, which is especially urgently needed in the current social situation. Mr. Zhou is enthusiastic about public welfare.

### Benefiting Elementary School Teachers

(1) Dr. Li Feixiang, a dentist, wrote in a letter: "Regarding, in order to treat poor elementary school teachers who have dental problems, my clinic has set the following minimum medical fees: 1,200 yuan for each filling, and only the cost of medicine for each dental treatment. The above measures will be in effect from February 1st to the end of the month, limited to two people per day. A certificate from your office or a citizen's card is acceptable.

### Charity School and Scholarship

Youth Association Opens Second Middle School The Youth Association Middle School at 599 Sichuan Road has added a second middle school. The total tuition and miscellaneous fees are only 4,000 yuan. The curriculum is exactly the same as that of general high and junior high schools. Graduates will be issued graduation certificates. It is now recruiting transfer students for grades 1 and 2 of junior high school and grades 1 and 2 of high school. Both boys and girls are accepted. The examination date is set for February 7th. Registration can be made at the school from now on, which is truly good news for students from families who are unable to afford the fees at present.

Changzhou Native Place Association Scholarship The Changzhou Shanghai Native Place Association is offering scholarships for poor students this spring for the third year. Due to the increase in tuition fees at various schools by four or five times, the number of applicants for scholarships has also increased, and the association's funds are severely insufficient. The association has temporarily borrowed funds for use. The association's board of directors has resolved to continue the fundraising methods of previous teams, with each team responsible for 200,000 yuan.

### Come On, Kids!

— Xiaobo

The meaning of "genius" is that a skill can be understood and mastered without deep learning, as if it were a congenital response, as if it were innate. This is originally a comparative statement. Some people may oppose this view, but in fact, there are indeed surprising miracles!

It is rare to hear of a child who is only six and a half years old being able to play the piano, but it is a miracle to be able to play more than 40 world-famous songs and compose his own music, which is unanimously praised by professional musicians. If it is said that this child has musical talent and is a divine intention, it would not be an exaggeration!

His name is Han Qiaozhi. His two older sisters, Meiling and Shafei, both play the piano well. He grew up in a family with a strong musical atmosphere. At the age of five, he stood beside his sister listening to the piano, reluctant to leave, as if he had understood something. After his sister finished playing and left, he sat on the piano stool and actually played a sonorous tune, which surprised his sister's music teacher. His little bag was already full of music pieces, and he was eagerly looking for an opportunity to express them. Later, the teacher taught him, and he quickly mastered it. On the day of his sixth birthday, his parents held a concert for him, and he played the piano on the spot, which even more surprised many musicians. Isn't this a genius?

Now, his parents want to use the child's power to help poor children and have decided to hold a piano charity concert at the Lanxin Theater on February 6th. Qiaozhi will be the main performer, and his two sisters will accompany him. The proceeds from the ticket sales will be entirely donated to children's welfare charities. This office is selling honorary tickets, which are divided into three types: 5,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. We hope that ladies and gentlemen who love music, especially children and little sisters, will come and enjoy the performance. Everyone will be happy. Tickets can be purchased from this office or the social service section of the Xinwen Bao and Xin Zhongguo Bao newspapers.
