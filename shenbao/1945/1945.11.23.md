### Du Yuming Commands in Suizhong; National Army Advances Below Xingcheng, Pressing on Lian Mountain; Tense Atmosphere Surrounds Jinzhou and Nan Kou

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] It is widely rumored that the Soviet Union's response to the Central Government has been delivered, stating that it guarantees non-interference with the Central Army entering the Nine Northeastern Provinces and will abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty. However, the airport near Changchun presents operational difficulties, so air transport cannot yet be effectively realized. The Communist army is currently building defensive fortifications in the Shenyang area. Du Yuming's forces have advanced to Lian Mountain and are continuing towards Huludao. Communist army movements are frequent around Jinzhou and Nan Kou, and the situation is extremely tense. The Communist army on the northern shore of the Shandong Peninsula is commandeering all ships to travel between the Shandong Peninsula and Liaodong Peninsula. Contact has been made in various areas of northern Shandong. The Central Army has entered Yucheng, and attacks are encountered everywhere on the North China transportation lines. Except for air transport, the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao route and the Beining Road have been impassable for the past week, with the tracks frequently damaged.

[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] Military news: After the National Army entered the Northeast, it occupied Xingcheng, 180 li outside the Great Wall, and is advancing towards Lian Mountain, 45 li away. Xingcheng is a key town on the Beining Road, and Lian Mountain is only 24 li from Huludao, which the army controls. After the National Army recovers Huludao, it can gain a landing base. At the same time, another National Army is concentrating towards Nan Kou to advance on Zhangjiakou, which is occupied by the Communist army. It is reported that the Chinese side has requested Soviet permission for the air transport of 45,000 National Army soldiers to Shenyang. In addition, the defending forces of Baotou and Gui Sui have repeatedly repelled the Communist army's new offensive.

[United Press, Tianjin, 22nd] The National Army entered the Nine Northeastern Provinces today and is advancing towards Jinzhou, a vital point on the Beining Road. It is expected that the Communist army will put up a strong resistance there. Another National Army force has outflanked the railway and reached Suizhong, 135 li north of Shanhaiguan. So far, there have been no major battles between the two sides. According to a certain foreigner who came to Tianjin from the Northeast, the Eighth Route Army in the Nine Northeastern Provinces receives direct and indirect supplies from individual Soviet soldiers. This foreigner was repatriated and came to Tianjin. The Communist army's withdrawal from Central China in recent weeks suggests that they will spare no expense to protect the Northeast, and their elite troops are now concentrated in Shenyang and Harbin.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 22nd] Well-informed sources claim that Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security, is personally directing operations in Suizhong and is expected to occupy Huludao soon and attack Jinzhou within four to five days. At the same time, it is also rumored that Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist army, has arrived in Shenyang to personally command the Northeast war. The National Army vanguard is only 105 li from Jinzhou, and a major battle is predicted to unfold there. Well-informed sources say that the armed Communist army in the Northeast numbers only 500,000, which is not a strong force. Moreover, some of these 500,000 are former soldiers of the puppet "Manchukuo" army and workers from various factories, and their loyalty to the Communist army is questionable.

### No Progress in Sino-Soviet Negotiations

[Reuters, Chongqing, 22nd] Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Kai stated yesterday that negotiations between Chongqing and Moscow are still ongoing regarding the issue of the National Army taking over the Soviet-occupied areas in the Northeast. Regarding the Vietnam issue, Liu stated that the government is still consulting with the French authorities to discuss the withdrawal of the National Army from Vietnam and other matters related to overseas Chinese in Vietnam. Liu also stated that a final decision has not yet been made regarding China sending a diplomatic envoy to Siam. China has also not officially recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia.

[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] According to the *Shishi Xinbao*, China and the Soviet Union have recently been conducting negotiations on the Nine Northeastern Provinces issue in Chongqing, Moscow, and Washington. The atmosphere in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is tense, with lights burning all night. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, there is still no progress in the negotiations regarding the National Army entering the Nine Northeastern Provinces. When a reporter asked whether negotiations were necessary, given that the Soviet Union had declared its respect for China's full sovereignty in the Nine Northeastern Provinces and recognized its territorial and administrative integrity, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the spokesperson declined to answer.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 22nd] According to a certain newspaper, negotiations on the Northeast issue are currently underway in Chongqing, Moscow, and Washington. In Chongqing, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie represents Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and meets with Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, almost daily. In Washington, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wei Daoming, is also holding talks with U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. Those responsible for negotiations in Moscow are Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Fu Bingchang, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.

It is said that the Communist army there is obstructing the authorities' takeover of seaports, airports, railways, and factories that have already been taken over by stirring up strikes. Commander Wang also said that he will soon go to Chongqing to report on the war and intends to ask Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to refer to the example of Taiwan and establish Hainan as a province. He said that by the time of the Japanese surrender, the Japanese had completed one-third of their six-year construction plan for Hainan.

### Zhou Enlai Requests to Return to Yan'an for Instructions; Political Consultative Conference Postponed; Discussion on Holding it on the First of Next Month

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] The Political Consultative Conference has been postponed until the first of next month because Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai requested to return to Yan'an for instructions on the list of attendees and other matters.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Chu Fucheng, Director of the Guizhou District of the National Senate's Economic Promotion Committee, arrived in Chongqing by plane from Kunming on the 21st. He stated that he is eager to provide some opinions outside the conference as a non-representative when the Political Consultative Conference is convened. He believes that China cannot tolerate any more wars after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, as this would hinder the progress of national construction. Humanity should also make the greatest effort to avoid the catastrophe of a third world war. All problems should be resolved through political consultation, and war must not be resorted to.

### Communist Army Attacks Yu (Henan) and Jingfu (Hubei) Counties; Special Organizations Disrupt Transportation

[Central News Agency, Luohe, 22nd] (1) Li Xiannian's main force of the Communist army, totaling more than ten regiments, has gathered in the Huyangzhen and Heilongmiao area northeast of Zaoyang and is constantly attacking, with fierce fighting. A regiment of the Communist army's Pi Dingjun's force has infiltrated Zaoyang from Pingshi, southwest of Biyang, to support Li's force in its operations. (2) More than 4,000 Communist troops, equipped with more than 40 light and heavy machine guns and more than 10 mortars, occupied Lishan and Sanlicheng in eastern Hubei on the 3rd. Four regiments of the Communist army are now concentrated in Lishan. (3) Shuibichong and Panxindian south of Luoshan City in southern Henan have recently been surrounded by the Communist army, and Jingfu County is also under siege. (4) More than 200 Communist troops in Huangwenshan south of Wulidian in Xinyang are causing disturbances everywhere.

[Another Dispatch] (1) When the Communist army attacked Taikang, the National Army seized its important documents, including an instruction from the YU East Office of the JILUYU Administrative Office of the Communist Army, which arbitrarily changed the names of the counties in eastern Henan. Qi County was changed to Zhipu, Chenliu to Kewei, Tongxu to Dasheng, Fugou to Taixi, Huaiyang to Huaitai, and Taikang to Qingyang, deliberately confusing the names to disrupt our administrative system. (2) Since last month, the Communist army in Chayashan, west of Suiping, has been forcibly collecting grain, regardless of the amount of land, and assigning each village to pay tens of thousands of catties. They also levy heavy amounts for cotton clothing and shoe materials. (3) Shahedian, under the jurisdiction of Suiping, was attacked by the Communist army at the end of last month, and many goods were looted from merchants and civilians, and many family members of public school personnel were killed. (4) In Liuzhuang, under the jurisdiction of Queshan, the Communist army is forcing people to pay grain, with each mu of land paying 160 yuan in legal tender.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] In order to prevent the National Army from entering and recovering the areas, the Communist army has recently organized "Transportation Control Teams" in various areas to carry out sabotage. Its highest command organization is the District Regiment Headquarters, which has a "Staff Department" and an Action Department, consisting of five companies forming a district regiment, with the company as the unit of activity. It also divides the railways, highways, and main highway lines in the provinces of North China and assigns the Communist Army Transportation Control Team on the highways to be responsible for destruction. In the provinces of South China, the Communist Army Transportation Control Team of the New Fourth Army is responsible for destruction.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 22nd] According to Cheng Shaozong, a Communist Army squad leader who defected to the National Army, Xiao Ke was killed by the National Army in the battle to attack Baotou on the 13th.

Communist Army in North China Indiscriminately Issues Banknotes

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] Recently, wherever the Communist army goes in North China, it arbitrarily and indiscriminately issues banknotes, disrupting local finances and deepening the suffering of the people in the recovered areas. The following is an excerpt from the notice issued by the so-called "Taiyuan Administrative Office of the Jinjiluyu Border Region Government" for the issuance of commercial circulating notes: In order to quickly restore the agricultural and industrial undertakings in the newly liberated areas and to facilitate the social economy, the Taiyue Economic Bureau is specially approved to issue commercial circulating notes of 100 yuan, 50 yuan, and 5 yuan, with all the property of the area as a fund and guaranteed by the Taiyue Jinan Bank.

From September 15th, all public funds, taxes, deed taxes, apportionments, collections, and public and private debts, commercial, trade payments, etc., shall be used equally with the Jinan Bank notes. Violators will be severely punished.

### Returning from the Northwest

— Fang Canglang

1.  Mourning Unnamed Heroes

During the Yili Incident last winter, the bandits who participated in the siege of the city, in addition to some Kazakh bandits, were reportedly part of the bandit Ma Zhongying's force and some Mongolian bandits. The defenders of the city were the 7th Reserve Division of the National Army. The division was besieged for more than a month, and even after running out of food, they still held on and refused to retreat. On January 8 of this year, the city fell. The Deputy Division Commander, Du Defu, and Chief of Staff Cao Rixun broke through the siege and escaped. After traveling 20 li, they could not bear to see the civilians in the city being brutally slaughtered, so they turned back and desperately charged into the city to rescue more than 10,000 old, weak, women, and children from the siege. At this time, the bandits were approaching, and bullets rained down from the sky and the surrounding mountains. Deputy Division Commander Du ordered the civilians to flee quickly, while he led the troops to cover their retreat, bravely engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the bandits. Later, the bandits came in large numbers, and the entire division suffered more than half casualties. Due to the severe cold and deep snow, the soldiers were neck-deep in snow. The ancient descriptions of the scenery outside the Great Wall, such as falling fingers and cracked skin, and the miserable scene of ice on the beard, were fully presented. According to the surviving soldiers of the division, the surrounding mountains of the battlefield at the time were covered in white snow, and the waterfall of blood was a patch of vermilion, making it impossible to distinguish whether it was snow or blood. They fought until late at night, and with exhausted strength and no reinforcements, the officers above the rank of company and platoon leader, as well as Deputy Division Commander Du Defu and Chief of Staff Cao Rixun, all committed suicide to repay the party and the country. At the same time, more than 4,000 to 5,000 civilians were killed, and the rest were taken captive by the bandits. Since the Anti-Japanese War, no event has surpassed this in terms of the tragic death of our soldiers and civilians. Deputy Division Commander Du was from Hunan and was a top student in the third class of the military academy. Chief of Staff Cao graduated from the sixth class and the fourteenth class of the mainland branch of the military academy. The generals died on the frontier. This article is dedicated to mourning the thousands of unnamed heroes who died in that division.

2.  The Disaster Situation in Gansu

After the Yili Incident, many people from Xinjiang fled to Lanzhou via Hexi. The nine cities of Yili were the granary of Xinjiang. After Yili was lost, the price of grain and general goods in Dihua jumped and soared, making it impossible to control. The cost of living this summer was more than five times higher than that in Chongqing. During this period, most of the people from other provinces who were working in Xinjiang sent their families to Lanzhou. Therefore, from spring to summer this year, the originally calm and quiet Lanzhou prices could not withstand the continuous attacks of the low-pressure system from the west and soared wildly, matching Chongqing. Originally, the price of flour was only 3,000 yuan per 100 catties, but in less than two weeks, it rose to 7,000 yuan. In addition, Lanzhou and various counties in southeastern Longdong have been experiencing a prolonged drought with no rain this year, and the two wheat crops have withered. There is no hope for the spring harvest. Disaster reports from various counties are pouring in. The areas with more serious disasters include Gaolan, Yuzhong, Jingyuan, Lintao, and more than 20 other counties. Once a drought occurs, grain prices are bound to rise. The thing that speculators in the Northwest and special people with large amounts of idle funds like to do most is hoarding. They have extraordinary patience. Some Shanxi merchants still have hoarded goods from 27 or 28 years ago. These people saw that the price of grain in Lanzhou was bound to rise, so they fueled the flames and competed to hoard grain. In less than a month, they directly raised the price of flour in Lanzhou to more than 24,000 yuan per 100 catties. As a result, more than one million disaster victims in Gansu almost starved to death. Fortunately, the Gansu authorities made preparations for disaster relief very quickly, and there was no chaos. Perhaps pitying the disaster victims, these hoarders actually showed "compassion" shortly after Japan surrendered and sold the grain they had worked so hard to buy. The lowest record was 1,300 yuan per stone of wheat and 30,000 yuan per liang of gold, and 200 yuan per foot of Indanthrene blue cloth. It is said that some of the goods came from Qinghai and Hezhou.

The price of grain in Lanzhou gradually declined amidst the sound of firecrackers. Civil servants and the common people celebrated each other. Speculators and hoarders were filled with sorrow, and several people who borrowed money to hoard grain jumped into the Yellow River. I spent two weeks investigating the disaster situation in other counties in Gansu. I believe that even if the price of wheat falls to 1,000 yuan per stone, there will still be at least 300,000 starving people awaiting food this winter and next spring. Droughts in Gansu seem to be cyclical. Past disaster records show that a major drought occurs every 30 years and a minor drought every 15 years. There was a major drought in 1928 and 1929, and this year is considered a minor drought. The red land stretches for thousands of miles, which is considered a minor drought. The severity of the water conservancy problem in the Northwest is so terrible. Although the victory has diluted the disaster situation in Gansu, let us not forget the hard work of transporting grain from east to west on the Gansu-Xinjiang road.

### Returning to the Capital; 2,000 People to Depart Before the End of This Month

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] Various agencies have been busy preparing to return to the capital. Officials above the section chief level of the units under the Executive Yuan will depart first with 2,000 people before the end of this month, mainly from the four ministries of Communications, Finance, Economy, and Food. Files and archives will not be moved for the time being. The Executive Yuan has ordered the strengthening of telecommunications equipment in both Nanjing and Chongqing. In the future, the files will be accessed using telegraphs and wireless telephones as much as possible. The distribution of office buildings for various agencies after arriving in Nanjing is being discussed by Mayor Ma with the heads of various agencies based on the actual situation of receiving enemy and puppet property, and a unified allocation method will be adopted.

### U.S. Emphasizes the Current Situation; Considers Sending a Military Delegation to China; Gass et al. Arrive in Chongqing, Wedemeyer Returns to Shanghai

[Associated Press, Beijing, 22nd] Remarks recently made by U.S. Army Commander in the China Theater, Wedemeyer, and Under Secretary of the Navy, Gass, are considered here to imply that the United States has adopted a "realistic" and tough stance on the situation in North China and has eased the tense situation caused by the concentration of the Communist army in North China. Gass said in Qingdao that the U.S. military may be drawn into a vortex in China. Some observers believe that the U.S. military not only does not intend to withdraw its troops stationed in China, but may even increase them. It is said that the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China would not help solve the Chinese problem, but could instead lead to the loss of peace in the Far East. The United States occupies an important position in the West Pacific and has a great responsibility for post-war world peace and cannot ignore the current chaotic situation.

[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] U.S. Under Secretary of the Navy, Gass, accompanied by the new commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Barbey, the chief representative of the U.S. Reparations Committee, Pauley, and others were originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai from here yesterday, and to attend a banquet hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife in the evening, but due to bad weather, the plane they were on was forced to land in Beijing and arrived here safely this afternoon. Gass and his party will be guests of Chairman Chiang and his wife. It is believed that the Chairman and the visiting U.S. officials will conduct informal discussions on the situation in North China and Sino-Soviet relations.

[Central News Agency, this city] U.S. Army Commander in the China Theater, General Wedemeyer, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing at 7:40 PM last night. Also, Commander Tang Enbo of the Third Front Army was unable to make the trip because he could not catch the plane in time.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, in response to a question about the withdrawal of U.S. troops from North China, said that the information he had received was generally the same as what he had announced two weeks ago, and that reports of the war in that area were somewhat exaggerated. When a reporter asked about reports that the U.S. plans to send a military delegation of 2,000 to 6,000 personnel as advisors to China, Byrnes replied that, to his knowledge, this matter was under consideration, but the number of delegates had not yet been determined. Byrnes also discussed the North China issue, saying that the U.S. is willing to fulfill its obligations to implement the surrender of the Japanese army in China, and that the U.S. military is in North China to carry out this mission. Finally, when Byrnes was asked about the Soviet Union, he replied that there was no progress on the Soviet Union's participation in the Far East Advisory Committee, but that talks were continuing.

### Editorial: Stabilizing Shanghai's Commodity Prices

Since the latter half of September, the prices of goods in Shanghai have continued to experience drastic fluctuations. To curb inflation, the Shanghai Municipal Authorities adopted a price control policy, stipulating that the prices of various commodities should not exceed the original prices of September 12th. However, since the implementation of this measure, not only has there been an occurrence of goods evading the market, but there have also been instances of superficial compliance with actual disobedience. As a result, commodity prices have been rising in the past two months, and the general public has felt the heavy burden of life, making it unbearable. Although the current price situation is gradually showing a stabilizing trend, fluctuations still occur from time to time. Amidst his myriad daily tasks, Chairman Chiang has shown deep concern for the trend of Shanghai's commodity prices. He has sent a telegram to Mr. Du Yuesheng, head of the Shanghai Local Association, expressing his hope that individuals familiar with the Shanghai market situation and enjoying a good reputation would express their opinions, unite all sectors, and find ways to assist the government in lowering prices. We, the citizens of Shanghai, groaned under the tyranny of the enemy and puppets for over eight years. Today, with the restoration of our land, we celebrate the recovery of the people's livelihood. However, unexpectedly, commodity prices have soared, and the people's suffering has become increasingly serious. Chairman Chiang, concerned about the people's plight, could not bear to see the citizens of Shanghai burdened with economic hardship on the day of political liberation. He sent a telegram to Shanghai's civic leaders, asking them to find ways to help curb inflation. After reading this, our gratitude is immeasurable.

We must first point out that all citizens have a responsibility to curb Shanghai's commodity prices. We cannot push this responsibility entirely onto the government. Even if the government has excellent measures to curb Shanghai's commodity prices, if the citizens do not sincerely support them and work together to implement them, then these excellent measures are, in reality, only equivalent to empty words. The measures are there, but commodity prices still cannot be stabilized. Citizens complain about the government, saying it is incompetent, but they do not ask themselves whether they have complied with the government's decrees or whether they have cooperated in their implementation. The result of this kind of deduction is that the citizens themselves suffer. Therefore, in the effort to stabilize Shanghai's commodity prices, this responsibility belongs to everyone: to the government, to business operators, to Shanghai's civic leaders, and to all the citizens of Shanghai.

Here, we also need to point out what measures the government itself has taken to stabilize Shanghai's commodity prices. First, all measures must be carefully considered to prevent loopholes from arising. In particular, before implementing them, the opinions of all parties in Shanghai should be solicited. If these measures are indeed sufficient to stabilize commodity prices, then all citizens should cooperate in implementing them so that both the government and the citizens can benefit. Second, in the midst of calls to curb inflation, public utilities directly operated by the government must uphold the President's virtuous intentions and not change prices for the sake of revenue. Since Shanghai's restoration, the reason for the continuous rise in commodity prices is not simple. However, the increase in public utilities operated by the government itself, such as the postal, telegraph, and railway services increasing prices by more than tenfold, is also a factor stimulating the rise in commodity prices. Our wise President is concerned about the people's suffering and does not forget those far away. All departments of our government should also uphold the President's virtuous intentions and not increase prices for the sake of revenue. This is a very important step in the effort to curb inflation.

However, the fluctuation of commodity prices is ultimately not a simple matter. Various factors are at play. Commodity price fluctuations are an economic phenomenon and naturally cannot escape the control of economic laws. To stabilize commodity prices, we must first stabilize the value of currency. According to the current situation, although the value of currency has fallen significantly compared to before the war, there are no signs of further decline recently. The expansion of the legal tender circulation area is sufficient to reduce the amount of legal tender issued that has accumulated in certain areas. This is another form of currency contraction. In terms of currency, what we need to do now is to prevent further inflation of the currency so that our currency value can maintain its current level and not fall further. Once the currency value can be stabilized, then we can talk about adjustment. In the effort to curb inflation, the ultimate means should be the adjustment of the currency system.

However, the current fluctuation of commodity prices is not a simple monetary issue. The imbalance between commodity supply and demand is undoubtedly one of the main factors. Especially in the current Shanghai, the main cause of the imbalance between commodity supply and demand is mostly artificial. The closure of warehouses prevents the circulation of stockpiled goods, resulting in factory shutdowns and a sharp decline in production. The failure to connect various places with Shanghai prevents the free import of goods. All of these are the reasons for the imbalance between commodity supply and demand. Actively increasing production and restoring transportation should also not be ignored in the effort to curb inflation.

What has been said above are all factors related to the economy. In the current fluctuation of commodity prices, economic factors are certainly very important, but what is even more important is probably the psychological and moral factors. In terms of psychological morality, merchants inevitably neglect government decrees, superficially comply while actually disobeying, or even take advantage of loopholes to seek temporary pleasure. They do not know that raising commodity prices is devaluing the currency value. The result of this deduction is that all the people suffer, including the merchants who take advantage of loopholes. Gaining profit for a moment harms the public. In the current fluctuation of commodity prices, we want to specifically point out these psychological and moral factors. The role it plays in commodity price fluctuations is probably even greater than purely economic monetary factors and supply and demand factors. This is what must first be restrained and eliminated in the effort to curb inflation. In terms of purely economic factors, the government can find ways to control them. In terms of these moral or psychological factors, everyone's cooperation is needed. Without the support of the people, even if the government has perfect measures, the result will still be unable to be thoroughly implemented. Therefore, in the effort to curb inflation, all of us citizens have a responsibility that we should fulfill. We cannot push this responsibility entirely onto the government.

Furthermore, Shanghai is the largest city in the country. The fluctuation of Shanghai's commodity prices is related to commodity prices in other countries and regions. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai bear a greater responsibility in cooperating with the government's efforts to stabilize commodity prices. Our government, from the President down, is extremely concerned about the stability of the people's livelihood after the war. We, the citizens of Shanghai, who have survived the trauma, should especially set an example in assisting the government to stabilize commodity prices, so that both the government and the people can benefit and live up to Chairman Chiang's expectations. Each of us should start with ourselves and not think that if others are not doing it, then I will not do it either. If everyone is like this, then there will never be any achievement. This is a simple theory, but the key to the effort to curb inflation lies in these small places, these close places. May everyone encourage each other.

### Araki and Kusuu Surrender Themselves to Sugamo Prison

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] After General MacArthur ordered the arrest of eleven Japanese war criminals on Monday, Araki and Kusuu surrendered themselves to Sugamo Prison today. Araki is sixty-eight years old. He served as Minister of the Army from 1931 to 1934 and as Director-General of Education from 1938 to 1939. He thoroughly reformed the Japanese education system along ultranationalist lines and was regarded as an ultra-militarist and an ardent nationalist. Araki denied supporting former Prime Minister Tojo in the Pacific War. Kusuu has been the leader of the fascist Black Dragon Society since 1937 and the president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association since 1944.

### Regulations on Exchanging Vietnamese Currency: The French Side Does Not Comply: We Have Lodged a Protest

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd Dispatch] The exchange rate between the national currency and the Vietnamese currency was previously stipulated by our military authorities stationed in Vietnam as one national currency unit equaling 7.5 Vietnamese currency units. Recently, commodity prices have soared. In order to stabilize the financial situation and curb inflation, our authorities specifically negotiated with the French side, agreeing that the French Banque de l'Indochine would lend 600,000 Vietnamese currency units daily to the three banks of China, China-France, and Banque de l'Indochine, for public exchange at the legal exchange rate, starting from the 20th. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 20th, the China-France and Banque de l'Indochine banks suddenly received a notice from the French military authorities stationed in northern Vietnam, refusing the exchange. The stipulation on daily loans of Vietnamese currency units was also not fulfilled. Our authorities lodged a protest with the French side on the afternoon of the 20th, urging them to fulfill the agreed-upon method of stabilizing the financial situation and reserving the right to take various urgent measures. However, the French side has not yet replied. Our price bureau convened a meeting of all relevant parties in Vietnam on the 22nd to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that concrete decisions have already been made.

If this is done, the inaugural meeting of the United Nations organization can be held in mid-January of next year. The various proposals received by the Executive Committee must be adopted after intense debate. Among the various issues, two are likely to cause debate: First, the various proposals for the establishment of the Temporary Trusteeship Council. Second, the permanent address of the United Nations organization. The Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries strongly believe that the Preparatory Committee has no right to decide on the issue of the Temporary Trusteeship Council. The Western European countries, led by Britain, will strongly oppose the Executive Committee's decision to locate the United Nations headquarters in the United States.

[Reuters, London, 22nd Dispatch] The meeting of the Executive Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations, originally scheduled for today, has been postponed to tomorrow (the 23rd) due to the inability of the representatives of the Soviet Union, Mexico, and Iran to report on time due to heavy fog and inclement weather. Also, the Preparatory Committee itself will still hold its first meeting on Saturday of this week, as originally scheduled.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st Associated Press Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated that other countries among the five great powers will not jointly request the United Nations organization to establish an atomic energy committee with countries possessing atomic energy. When asked by reporters whether the Soviet Union, China, and France would be asked to jointly submit this proposal, Byrnes replied that, according to the current plan, there is no such intention. The U.S., Britain, and Canada have not yet received a reply after notifying the Soviet Union, China, and France of the three-power atomic energy declaration last week. The recommendation to establish an atomic energy committee will be submitted at the first general assembly of the United Nations organization to be held in London on January 2nd next year.

(2) The Chinese government hopes that the atomic energy control committee established by the joint statement of the three countries will be established as soon as possible to ensure that atomic energy is not used to achieve destructive purposes but can be used by us to promote peace and humanitarian causes.

### The Philippines Gains Autonomy: A Factor of Stability in the Far East: Remarks by the U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines Before Taking Office

[U.S. News Service, San Francisco, 21st Dispatch] U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, flew to Manila today to take office. Those traveling with him include his economic advisor, General Belgrave, Major General Rose, and Rear Admiral Stockton.

[United Press, Honolulu, November 21st] The U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines told reporters here today that the Philippines suffered losses of approximately 800 million to 1 billion U.S. dollars during the war. He also stated that the recovery process will be guided by industry leaders and the Philippine government, with the Commissioner's Office serving as the coordinating advisor. During the resistance against the enemy, the Filipinos had two major forces behind them: one was the belief that the United States would be able to make a comeback, and the other was the deep-seated conviction in European and American democratic ideals. This is our obligation to the Philippines. We have repeatedly promised the Filipinos political independence and economic assistance during the war, so this can also be called our war debt. If we have not yet fulfilled this agreement, we will not only break our word in the eyes of the Filipinos but also in the eyes of people all over the world. Other countries in the world are watching the Philippines, and of course the Soviet Union is among them, as well as Britain, the Netherlands, and China. Various places in the East are currently restless and unsettled. The autonomy of the Philippines may be a stabilizing factor, and democratic ideals can be broadcast from the Philippines. The Philippines is also America's economic outpost in the East. The great powers and the people of their Eastern colonies can regard America's treatment of the Philippines as a major test of America's colonial policy.

### Our Country Can Send a Military Delegation to Germany

### Japan Decides to Return Artworks Plundered from China to Our Country

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] Many kinds of artworks plundered from China by the Japanese army are currently being protected and stored in places such as Kyoto and Nara because they were moved there when Tokyo was subjected to heavy bombing. Some of the stolen treasures were presented to the Imperial Museum in Tokyo by Japanese warlords and various puppet governments. The Ministry of Education admits that during the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, precious artworks were plundered from China and transported to Japan by the Japanese army. However, the amount of looted goods previously held by the Japanese government is small compared to those purchased from the Japanese army by demobilized soldiers and wealthy civilians. The Imperial Museum has accepted about thirty kinds of gifts from the Japanese army and various puppet governments in Manchuria and Mongolia, but since the start of the war in 1937, it has refused to accept valuables of dubious origin and ownership. The Imperial Household Agency has decided in principle that all Chinese artworks plundered from China should be returned to China, but it has not yet decided whether to return those looted during the rebellion in January 1910 or those looted after the Sino-Japanese War in 1927. Many Chinese artworks have been received since 1937, but details are unknown because the records are all in Nara and Kyoto.

### Britain Unwilling to Give Up Tariff Preferences: The Crux of Anglo-American Negotiations

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st Special Dispatch] The hope that the Anglo-American loan negotiations might succeed after British Prime Minister Attlee's visit to the U.S. has been shattered by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's statement today. Byrnes said that several issues involving commercial relations make an agreement difficult to reach. Regarding the current stage of negotiations, Byrnes only said that they are progressing smoothly. The biggest obstacle to negotiations is the British Imperial tariff preference system, which Britain is unwilling to give up without a U.S. guarantee of reducing U.S. tariffs. The U.S. side said that under the current situation, the U.S. cannot compete with Britain in British Imperial trade. On the other hand, Britain must maintain a large amount of export trade in order to obtain foreign exchange to pay for its large imports of goods and raw materials. The reduction of British shipping and overseas insurance businesses, as well as the clearing of wartime foreign deposits, has reduced its U.S. dollar foreign exchange. The U.S. Congress has the final say on tariff issues, and Britain is still unsure of the future tariff policies of the U.S. Congress, so its decision to abandon the Imperial tariff preference system is still pending. All agreements must still be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, which is unwilling to charitably provide to the world without compensation.

### Iranian Government Asks Soviet Union Not to Interfere in Its Administration and to Respect Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Iran's Ambassador to the United States, Ala, told reporters: The Iranian government has sent a note to the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, asking the Soviet Union to respect the territorial and sovereign integrity of Iran, avoid interfering in its administration, and stop interfering in the actions of Iranian military and police. According to a report from Moscow, Iran is dispatching military police to northeastern Iran to restore order and security, but Soviet troops have prevented Iranian troops from entering Azerbaijan. Ala quoted a statement from the U.S. State Department, saying that if the Soviet Union interferes with Iranian troops, a period of serious testing will soon arrive. Ala said that the U.S. State Department believes that when the above-mentioned action begins, the U.S. government will take action.

### Trial of Major War Criminals Continues Yesterday; Göring and Hess Still Smirking

[United Press, Nuremberg, 22nd] The International Tribunal continued the trial of Nazi war criminals today. Doctors reported to the court that Streicher, the Jewish tormentor, was mentally sound. Presiding Judge Lawrence immediately ruled that Streicher should be tried as usual. At the same time, the defense requested a postponement of the trial for Bormann, Hitler's missing representative, but this was rejected by the court. For the first time since the trial began two days ago, the defendants looked happy. Göring was smiling throughout and chatted with his defense lawyer. Hess also changed his dazed state and smiled, talking to former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. U.S. Assistant Prosecutor Storey announced that U.S. investigators had collected 2,500 German documents and would present hundreds of them to prove Hitler and his party's conspiracy and aggression, which led to World War II within a generation. The documents ranged from the notebooks of Nazi philosopher Rosenberg to secret documents of Hitler's High Command, encompassing everything. After Storey presented his views, Lawrence conferred with the judges and then announced to the court that the U.S.'s method of proof was accepted. Another U.S. Assistant Prosecutor, Albrecht, presented successive orders from the Nazi Party, proving that the Nazi Party's headquarters were in control and determining that German leaders could only be selected from the Nazi Party. He also stated that Göring and Hess were designated by Hitler as his successors. When Albrecht made this statement, Hess leaned forward, as if he had heard something, towards Göring, who was sitting next to him.

### Morning Friends Cup Basketball; Exciting Games Today; Hualian Meets Donghua; Desheng Battles Overseas Chinese

Starting at 5:30 p.m. today, there will be two A-group games of the Morning Friends Cup basketball tournament at the YMCA gymnasium in Baxianqiao. The authorities, recognizing that the Hualian-Donghua match will surely attract a large crowd, have sent a letter to the military and police authorities to maintain order. On the other hand, the ticket price has been raised to 200 yuan in legal tender to show a restriction.

Starting at 5:30 p.m., Desheng will play Overseas Chinese. The former has such strong players as Lu Dazhen, Tao Shaosheng, and He Xiaoguang. The strength of their team is naturally extraordinary, and Overseas Chinese is also a rising force. The back-and-forth competition will be heated, and who will win or lose is unpredictable.

Starting at 6:30 p.m., Hualian will compete with Donghua. Hualian is far superior to Donghua in basketball skills. However, recalling the previous year, when the two teams met, Donghua was able to win by one point. This scene and this situation are still in the memories of the fans, and Hualian's organizers and players still consider it a regret. Today, when they meet again, they will definitely go all out. Donghua is known for its speed and stamina. Its players are mostly football players, such as Zhang Banglun, Jia Youliang, and Li Yao, who are also good basketball players. When the two heroes meet, it will be a fierce battle. Who will win or lose cannot be decisively determined and will depend on the luck on the spot and the strategy of the battle.

Desheng vs. Overseas Chinese (A) 5:30 p.m.

Hualian vs. Donghua (A) 6:30 p.m.

### Building a New Educational Authority

— Dong Renjian

Our current education is of course dominated by the old educational forces. It is lurking everywhere, and there is not a moment when we do not feel its authority: its authority, like the authority of the old religion, old politics, and old economy, is mostly entrusted in the three aspects of people, books or other tools, and the system.

In terms of people, it is the teacher. If a teacher can represent or build a new educational authority, he is a master, he is definitely not a teaching craftsman, he is certainly not a tail, let alone a low energy; he should be a guide, commander and fighter, a scientist artist and philosopher, a scholar, teacher and especially a pioneer of the times.

In terms of books and other tools. In the past hundred years, how much new creation, new invention, and new utilization has there been in the Chinese education community! Zhang Zhidong's "Exhortation to Learning" is still a unique creation, and how many teachers can leave the textbooks, teaching books, blackboards, chalk, paper, notebooks and other tools to implement teaching! It is a pity that they have many new educational tools such as cameras, radio broadcasting machines, film projectors, as well as ships, railways, cars, and airplanes. They seem to be oblivious to their relationship with education and do not use them; they are only confined to the word paper and eating chalk dust all day long, we should be able to imagine the efforts of the old educational tools to bind our thinking and feel its full authority.

### Grand Tea Party in the Cultural Circle; Yesterday to Welcome Zhang Daofan

Future Work Requires Everyone's Efforts

Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 p.m., Shanghai cultural figures held a reception at the Kangle Restaurant to entertain Zhang Daofan, Director of the Central Cultural Movement Committee. More than 300 representatives from the city's education, art, drama, film, amusement, and news circles attended, gathering together in a grand occasion. The meeting was first chaired by Zhao Zhiyou, who delivered a welcome speech, followed by Zhang, the Director, giving instructions to the cultural representatives present.

Zhang, with a smile on his face, gladly stood up to speak, saying that the people in the Shanghai cultural circle were able to remain strong and unyielding during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and were not threatened or enticed by the enemy. They were also able to continue to strive for cultural work in a very difficult and arduous environment. This spirit of loyalty and unwavering devotion is admirable. I would like to express my respect to the people in the Shanghai cultural circle.

The situation of the cultural circle in the rear area, I believe, is welcome news to everyone. Since the start of the war, whether it is in Chongqing, Kunming, Xi'an, Guilin, and other cities in the rear, the performance of cultural work has made great progress. Although news, publishing, film, drama, art, music, and other aspects have been limited by various unfavorable conditions such as manpower and resources, there has still been significant progress. This is what cultural workers have achieved through great hardships. At the same time, the Shanghai cultural circle has also made progress under the constant high pressure of the enemy and puppet regime, which is a very commendable phenomenon. However, there is a situation of estrangement caused by mutual misunderstanding, which must be eliminated quickly. When I was in Chongqing, I heard of the so-called "Chongqing people" and "Shanghai people." I think it is probably because the words and actions of a few people from Chongqing were not cautious, which caused misunderstandings, so that when people from the rear came to Shanghai, they were looked at differently. In the rear, there is also a wrong view that indiscriminately treats people who stayed in Shanghai as traitors or puppets. However, this is only a mistaken view held by a few people, and I hope to forget it quickly. The soaring prices in Shanghai have many factors of their own. Many people attribute it to the purchases of people from Chongqing, which is also a misunderstanding. We hope that everyone will immediately eliminate this misunderstanding.

There is also one point, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, many of our places have been occupied by the enemy, and unfortunately, traitors who sold out their country have emerged, and the cultural circle is not exempt. When the government sent personnel to various places to take over, the newspapers in the rear shouted loudly, "Why don't you arrest the traitors first?" We need to understand the situation at that time. If there are no pre-determined steps, it is easy to create many unreasonable consequences. We need to do it step by step. Today, whether it is enemy officials, criminals, or traitors, none can escape. The dregs of the cultural circle who act as accomplices to the enemy should be severely punished.

We should reward those who are loyal and unwavering. We need to handle this matter very carefully, and it is best to ask the cultural circle to "self-examine" to avoid omissions. As for the future cultural work, it depends on everyone's efforts. It is hoped that the domestic cultural undertakings can be discussed and worked together with concerted efforts. In terms of international culture, we should pay special attention to it. International cultural cooperation is very important. The United Kingdom and the United States both have cultural construction institutions, and we should quickly establish them as well. The Chongqing International Cultural Association has already started preparations and is going through the procedures for registration. It is planned to formally establish it after the return to the capital, Nanjing, and people from the Shanghai cultural circle are welcome to participate. Furthermore, many outstanding young cultural workers have emerged during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. It is hoped that advanced leaders in the cultural circle will guide them and continue to work hard for cultural work. Finally, I deeply thank you for the reception.

Representatives from the cultural circle, Hu Pu'an, the art circle, Zhu Yingpeng, the drama circle, Gu Zhongyi, the education circle, Chen Kemei, the film circle, Gu Zhongyi, the Peking Opera circle, Zhou Xinfang, the amusement circle, Zhang Yexiong, and the news circle, Feng Youzhen, successively delivered speeches, elaborating on the difficult situation of the Shanghai cultural circle in the past eight years under various oppressions against the enemy and puppet regime.

Two points were reported. Zhang stood up again to supplement between the speeches of the representatives: (1) A tea party will be held at the same place at 2:30 p.m. on the 28th of this month to report on the progress of culture in the rear in a more concrete report. (2) Regarding the elimination of wartime cultural relics losses, there were also many losses in the country. It is hoped that important cultural relics lost by both public and private entities will be reported to government agencies, so that there will be an opportunity to clear and compensate in the future. Finally, miscellaneous performances were performed, and the event ended happily at around 5:00 p.m.

### Shanghai Municipal Bank Prepares to Handle Industrial and Commercial Loans

In order to relieve the poor and unemployed civilians in the city, the Shanghai Municipal Bank has decided to launch the "Small Industrial and Commercial Loans" business. The measures are being drafted and will be implemented soon. The capital amount is temporarily set at 30 million yuan, and the borrowers are targeted at stall vendors, etc. Each household can borrow 10,000 to 50,000 yuan in legal tender each time, but only those who have obtained a license from the police station or other competent authorities can apply. The time limit is three months to half a year, and the guarantee procedures are simple.

### Six Enemy and Puppet Financial Institutions Have Been Completely Taken Over; Trust Bureau Accepts Reports of Hidden Property

Six enemy and puppet financial institutions in the city, including the Imperial Bank, etc., were ordered by the Finance and Banking Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in the Nanjing-Shanghai area to be taken over by the Central Trust Bureau. Tan Bureau was ordered on September 25 to take over six institutions, including the Imperial Bank (i.e. Mitsui Bank), Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsubishi Warehouse Co., Ltd., and Dongmian Foreign Firm, etc., and they have now been completed. Currently being taken over are the Sino-Japanese Trade Federation and the Mongolia Trading Company. The main task of the bureau now is to accept voluntary reports of cases of enemy and puppet concealed property. This type of reporting is completely different from secret reports. Secret reports refer to cases where a third party knows that the enemy and puppet have materials hidden in a certain place and exposes them. Voluntary reporting refers to people who have had direct contact with the enemy and puppet who realize that it is illegal to hide materials or be used to store goods and surrender themselves. It is heard that there are quite a few such voluntary reporting cases, reaching more than 40 cases to date. The bureau, on the one hand, is taking measures to concentrate and sort out possible mobile properties in one place, and on the other hand, is sealing and keeping bulky objects that cannot be moved.

### British Six-Wheel Ship Company Resumes Foreign Shipping Routes

Far East British Shipping has been seeking to resume shipping, but due to shipping routes and shipping rights, it is difficult to realize it for a while. Therefore, six companies, including Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, British, Changxing, Shihe, and Moller, organized the British Far East Shipping Management Office under the auspices of the British Embassy to open foreign routes. All ships of the six companies sailing to Shanghai are represented by the Management Office. In the past, several ships have been responsible for transporting coal. The "Tai Mala" arrived in Shanghai the other day, bringing a large amount of supplies from the UK. The British ship "Alanpe," which arrived in Shanghai last week, is scheduled to sail back to the UK on the first of next month. The ship is a cargo ship, so there are only about 20 passenger seats. Oil is the most suitable cargo to load. This return to Europe is the first voyage to Europe since the war.

### Nanshi Buses to Be Trial Run in the Middle of Next Month

The city's transportation is gradually improving recently. In addition to the British Tramway Company and the French Tramway Company restoring the original routes to the extent possible, public buses are also being restored. Yesterday, Yi Zhuozhi, director of the preparatory office of the Public Bus Company of the Public Utilities Bureau, told reporters that in the middle of next month, the Nanshi Ring Road bus will be first trialed to reduce the inconvenience of residents in the area. These vehicles are modified by using the bodies of the former "China Metropolis" public buses and the Japanese military trucks handed over by the Third Front Army, totaling 20 vehicles. They are currently being repaired by the Xuehuali Road machine room and the Jiangwan Road machine room. The upper part of the body and the compartment are painted milky white, and the lower part is light green.

### Trolley Car Headless Case; Defendant Claims Innocence

In the case of a Chen woman being decapitated by a U.S. military truck on the Xiafei Road trolley car on the 20th of last month, the authorities filed a public prosecution against the driver, Russian Fei Huofu Siqi. The court session opened for trial yesterday, and the defendant claimed that he had been working for the U.S. military for two and a half months, driving a car for 20 years, and had never had an accident. He did not know that he had committed a crime on the 20th of last month. Only after being notified by the U.S. military police the next day did he know that the truck he was driving had cut off a person's head. There was very little blood on the body, and he did not believe it was human blood. During the trial, a U.S. military officer testified that according to the investigation results of the U.S. military's criminal investigation team, the defendant was indeed innocent. After the defendant's lawyer defended, the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the 26th of this month.

### Lu Jingshi Flew to Chongqing Yesterday

Lu Jingshi, Director of the Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Special Commissioner of Nanjing and Shanghai, was recently summoned by the Central Government and flew to Chongqing by China Aviation aircraft at 7:30 a.m. yesterday. It is reported that the purpose of this trip is to consult with the Central Government on issues related to worker unemployment relief and industrial and commercial rehabilitation, and he is expected to return to Shanghai within ten days.

### Mayor Qian Hosts Chengdu Journalist Delegation Yesterday Afternoon

Yesterday at noon, Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun hosted the Chengdu Journalist Delegation at a dinner at the Municipal Police Bureau. Various committee members and secretaries from the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, as well as various officers and group leaders from the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps, along with the Municipal Government's Secretary-General, various bureau chiefs, and directors, totaling sixty people, were in attendance.

Narrating the Takeover Situation

During the meal, Mayor Qian delivered a speech, stating, "I extend a warm welcome to the Chengdu Journalist Delegation for their long journey to Shanghai to inspect the situation in the recovered areas. Today, I have especially invited members of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps to gather at the Municipal Police Bureau for a meal to provide you with a summary of the city's takeover and the current focus of the Municipal Government's work. (1) Since the recovery of Shanghai, the takeover work has been divided into military and party-government sections. The military section is primarily managed by the Third War Area Army, while the party-government section established the Party-Government Takeover Committee, with myself serving as the director. This committee was further divided into fourteen groups, each responsible for handling all takeover matters. After completing most of its tasks, the Party-Government Takeover Committee concluded its work at the end of last month. From the first of this month, all unfinished takeover matters and the handling of enemy and puppet assets have been transferred to the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Assets Review Committee and the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Assets Management Bureau.

Maintaining Local Peace

(2) Regarding municipal measures, upon assuming my post, I received instructions from Chairman Chiang, stating that the only important task in the recovered area is to properly restore local order and maintain social peace. Following Chairman Chiang's instructions, we have been actively working since the establishment of the Municipal Government. After several thorough discussions at municipal meetings, we have decided that the current central tasks are to maintain social peace, promote local autonomy, assist in the development of industry and commerce, reorganize public utilities, establish a public treasury system, plan educational funds, promote public sports, encourage cleanliness and hygiene, establish more public hospitals, construct public housing, complete land registration, and commemorate the victory of the War of Resistance, totaling twelve items. Because Shanghai is an international trading port with a complex mix of Chinese and foreign residents, and especially because Shanghai had been occupied for eight long years, social order and the livelihoods of citizens are extremely unstable. In the past two short months, thanks to the joint efforts of the party, government, and military, everything has fortunately progressed smoothly, and the local area is relatively peaceful. This is a source of comfort to you all. Some may not be very familiar with the situation in the recovered area due to various rumors. I do not wish to make any detailed explanation. Now that the Chengdu Journalist Delegation has come to Shanghai for inspection, what you see and hear will allow you to provide an accurate and detailed report on the various aspects of the Shanghai area upon your return. In addition to welcoming you to inspect the various departments of the Municipal Government, I also welcome your guidance."

Emphasizing Social Order

After Mayor Qian's speech, Luo Zuojie, the representative of the Chengdu Journalist Delegation, delivered a response. He first described the delegation's journey from Chengdu to inspect the recovered areas and then discussed the delegation's observations and impressions since arriving in Shanghai. He emphasized the importance of social order, commodity prices, and cultural publishing. He stated that they would prepare a constructive report, detailing Shanghai's new atmosphere for millions of readers in the rear. After the meal, Sun Qinchi, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, and Xuan Tiewu, the Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, accompanied the delegation on a tour of the Municipal Government and its various departments, which concluded at 4 PM.

### Factories Forcibly Seized by the Enemy and Puppets Will be Returned After Verification; HSBC Bank Buildings Will Also Be Returned to Original Owners

The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Assets Review Committee held its eleventh meeting yesterday. Director Peng Xuepei presided over the meeting, and the following were approved: (1) Factories forcibly seized by the enemy, provided that the original factory owner provides proof of the seizure and that the receiving personnel confirm from the receiving documents that there is no evidence of a sale to the Japanese, may be returned to the applicant upon obtaining a guarantee from a reliable guarantor and publishing a public notice for three days. If there are no other disputes after two weeks, the properties will be returned to expedite the confirmation of property rights. (2) If the houses of Allied nationals or Chinese citizens were occupied by the Japanese puppets, leased to others, or forcibly seized by others, the Enemy and Puppet Assets Management Bureau may, upon the request of the owner, send a letter to the police bureau ordering the occupants to move out within a specified period and return the property to the owner. (3) The request from the British-owned HSBC Bank to return the sealed buildings is approved. If any government agencies need to lease the buildings, they can directly contact the bank. It is also reported that the committee passed draft measures, including the "Temporary Measures for Agencies to Obtain Withdrawal Certificates for Withdrawing Materials from Sealed Warehouses," the "Measures for Returning Ships of Allied Nationals and Merchants," and the "Measures for Handling Sealed Materials in Chinese Merchants' Warehouses." These drafts are currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### Domestic and International Telegrams Mostly Flowing Smoothly

According to the Telegraph Bureau, domestic telegrams have recently been flowing more smoothly than before, with no more interruptions to places such as Nanjing and Guangzhou. However, the sending and receiving of telegrams is still temporarily suspended in places such as Huzhou, Fenghua, Xiaoshan, Dinghai, Chongming, Zhenhai, Shashi, Yuyao, Ningbo, Cixi, and Nanchang. Furthermore, international telegrams have been permitted to resume using public codes since yesterday. Telegraph services have been restored to various parts of Europe, as well as the United States, Singapore, Australia, India, Canada, Mexico, and other places, with communications becoming smoother every day.

### Shanghai Briefs

The Minlian ship departed from Chongqing on the 22nd, bound for Shanghai, carrying 841 passengers, including over 500 personnel from the United States Information Service and other receiving personnel from various agencies. Director-General Jiang Tingfu of the Administrative Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and Deputy Director-General Han Leisheng of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration were delayed in Beiping due to business and are expected to arrive in Shanghai within the next two days.

The Shanghai branch of the Chinese National Diplomacy Association held its fifth preparatory meeting yesterday, deciding to hold its inaugural meeting on the 12th of next month. They also welcomed Ms. Zhou Wuailian, the association's newly arrived representative in Australia, to Shanghai.

### Joint Government-Business Relief Effort; Textile and Dyeing Industry Expected to Recover; Key is Rationing Raw Materials

The local textile and dyeing industry has recently been affected by a shortage of raw materials and insufficient electricity supply, resulting in intermittent operations. Although electricity supply has gradually increased, the shortage of dyes and raw cloth is more severe than before. To understand the current situation of the textile and dyeing industry, a reporter visited Mr. Pan Shihao, the standing committee member of the Textile and Dyeing Industry Association's Reorganization Committee. Mr. Pan stated that since the resumption of work, textile and dyeing businesses have faced numerous difficulties due to the shortage of raw materials, and collapse is imminent if relief is not provided quickly. The association has submitted requests to the relevant authorities to promptly release and ration the seized enemy and puppet assets at reasonable prices. For example, the dyes from Defu Foreign Firm were historically supplied to the textile and dyeing industry, and a large portion of the yarn and cloth stored in the enemy warehouses was plundered from our industry members at the time. The association proposes that some of these materials be allocated and sold at reasonable prices to factories with superior production capacity to help private enterprises. Yesterday, we spoke with Mr. Wang, a specialist from the Economic Department's Wartime Production Bureau for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, regarding the production situation of the textile and dyeing industry since it started operating. He inquired in detail about the monthly raw material requirements and promised to find ways to entrust dye factories with the dyeing of some raw cloth. He also promised to assist in coordinating with the handling authorities to provide a reasonable amount of dyes and raw materials and instructed us to verify the number of cloth bolts that could be dyed and provide detailed names and quantities of the required raw materials. He also mentioned that adjustments to industrial funding are being considered and planned, and the association has scheduled a meeting to plan and implement these measures. The concern of the relevant authorities for the textile and dyeing industry is deeply appreciated. If raw material rationing and industrial loans can be implemented simultaneously, not only can the textile and dyeing industry recover, but commodity prices will also stabilize due to increased production.

### Coal Market Soars Again; Strong Arrivals of Firewood and Charcoal

The price of white coal lumps continues to soar in the coal market, with white coal dust following suit. Anthracite coal, sold through actual sales accounts, follows the previous trend and advances to a high peak. Coal balls, due to the rising price of their main raw material, white coal dust, have had their new prices adjusted by the manufacturers. Firewood, from various parts of eastern Zhejiang, is arriving in large quantities due to favorable winds. Charcoal, from Yonglu, Linhai (Taizhou), Haimen, and Huangyanjiang, is arriving in Shanghai, and slippery green river charcoal from Yuhang is also arriving. On land routes, loofah-packed charcoal from Haining, Xiashi, Changan, and Linping, via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, is arriving in Shanghai. Shanghai's actual sales accounts are also healthy in absorbing these goods, and both supply and sales are smooth, with prices trending stable.

### First Shipment of American Cotton Arrives

The cargo ship Quicksilver Victory, with a deadweight of 10,500 tons, arrived in port today. The ship contains 5,000 bales of Mexican cotton from Los Angeles, the first shipment of American cotton since the end of the war. It was ordered by Clayton & Co. and will be used by various yarn factories in the city.

### Rice Prices Reach 10,000 Yuan Mark

Falling by About 1,000 Yuan Yesterday

According to rice industry sources, local food reserves have gradually increased. Rice merchants and rice shops have stocked large quantities of goods and are selling them in the market daily. At the same time, personnel are being dispatched to various production areas to procure goods. According to unofficial estimates, the city's daily rice consumption is around 25,000 stones. This inventory is sufficient to meet the city's needs for more than three months. The dramatic increase in inventory and sluggish sales have significantly changed market conditions. Yesterday, trading in the rice market was light, with buyers and sellers seeking to offload goods. Merchants' ability to absorb goods weakened, and rice prices fell across the board, decreasing by about 1,000 yuan per stone compared to the previous market. Some rice prices have already reached the 10,000 yuan mark. At the same time, the authorities are paying close attention to the management of food issues and have formulated effective measures to address both symptoms and root causes, which are being gradually implemented. Currently, they are making every effort to clear supply channels. In addition to assisting rice merchants in procuring large quantities of goods from various rice-producing areas, they have also consulted with water and land transportation authorities to allow priority loading of rice and grains, which has already been approved.

### Price-Controlled Sugar

Sugar Merchants Seek Allocation

After the victory, there was a significant quantity of sugar produced by the enemy and puppets in storage. The first batch was entrusted to four major auction houses, including Louis Smollan, by the responsible authorities and was successfully auctioned on the 21st. The second batch is also being prepared. However, local sugar merchants believe that public auctions inevitably result in the sugar flowing into the hands of speculators. The industry association convened a meeting of its members, which resolved to request the authorities to follow the example of price-controlled cloth and daily necessities by selling the stored sugar to sugar merchants at reasonable prices, who would then allocate it to retailers for public sale at reasonable prices, with the aim of ensuring widespread availability and preventing hoarding. This is presumably what the authorities would like to see as well.

### Economic Briefs

Since the liberation of the city, the number of employees of the Municipal Government and its affiliated agencies has reached tens of thousands. It is reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs has initiated the organization of a Municipal Government Employee Consumer Cooperative to handle the procurement and sale of essential daily necessities at reasonable prices to alleviate the pressure on living expenses. A large number of employees from various agencies have volunteered to join, and Mayor Qian has also highly praised this initiative, allocating funds to facilitate its operation. The preparatory work is largely complete, and the cooperative is expected to be established on December 1st. At a time of soaring prices and significant pressure on living expenses, this initiative is indeed worth promoting and implementing.

Recently, meat prices have soared, and the slaughter tax collected by the Bureau of Finance will also be increased, which is currently being studied.

Someone has initiated a large-scale wool spinning, weaving, and dyeing factory, named Meilun, organized as a joint-stock company with a capital of 80 million yuan.

### A Glimpse of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver Coin Market: Yesterday (the 22nd), the market continued to weaken, lacking the strength to recover. Northern merchants continued to supply goods, and prices remained stable midway. However, the exchange rate for puppet-issued banknotes was set at five to one. Tianjin gold was quoted at 350,000 yuan, equivalent to only 70,000 yuan per tael of legal tender. With a constant flow of goods from the north, market participants, with little interest after days of small trading volumes, lacked enthusiasm. The entire market was constantly pressured by sellers, especially in the afternoon, resulting in a decrease of 15,000 yuan per ten taels compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold was also lowered by 2,000 yuan, to 88,000 yuan per tael.

Silver dollars also lacked vitality, struggling around 450 yuan throughout the day, with silver bullion quoted at 750 yuan.

The foreign currency market was still affected by gold prices. Additionally, the discovery of counterfeit American dollars also dampened sentiment. American dollars initially opened at 1,400 yuan, gradually rising to 1,405 yuan due to continued buying by mainland visitors. However, the falling gold market ultimately caused it to collapse, resulting in a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars initially saw active buying due to reports of the resumption of Shanghai-Hong Kong flights, but the final result was similar to the previous day. Old coins and small notes from 1935 were about 10% lower than those from 1930. Australian pounds were around 3,300 yuan, while rupees, divided into Burmese, Ceylonese, and Indian types, ranged in price from 1,200 yuan to 400 yuan. In recent days, some Indians have been preparing to return to their home countries, resulting in frantic buying. However, all of these were over-the-counter transactions at exchange shops, and it is difficult to obtain accurate prices due to the lack of trading volume. Overnight call loans remained relatively stable, fluctuating around 0.10, with gold certificates used as collateral. Interbank loans remained at 0.30, (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.9% per 1,000 yuan).

Securities: Public prices remained stable, but there were many sellers at high prices. Large investors were more cautious yesterday. Prices fluctuated in the middle, but ultimately more stocks rose than fell compared to the previous day. The price differences between various stocks continued to narrow.

Chinese stocks continued to be traded privately. Sentiment remained strong due to reports of resumption of operations soon. The market opened strong, but ultimately the negative performance of the gold market made it difficult for buying interest to last, resulting in little change compared to the previous day.

Foreign stocks fell with gold prices, with very little trading volume. The final selling price was about 0.5% lower.

Yarn Market: Yesterday, the yarn market initially rose and then fell back. The market opened higher because retail shops were strong on 20-count yarn, pushing prices up by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. There was also some trading in fine yarn from big packages of Changsha and inland origin. Shanghai yarn shops were cautious. However, prices dropped by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan as hoarders sold off, and customer sales slowed down. The result was an increase of 10,000 to 15,000 yuan compared to the previous market.

Spring and Autumn

### Spring and Autumn Notes

— Huang Jiayin

In yesterday's Free Talk, the editor mentioned several simple principles for editing newspaper supplements. Spring and Autumn is another supplement of Shen Bao, and of course, it also plans to edit and select manuscripts according to these principles. However, we hope that Free Talk and Spring and Autumn will each have its own characteristics within a considerable range.

Free Talk focuses on the introduction of knowledge and the reporting of news background, while Spring and Autumn will publish more short literary essays, miscellaneous feelings, essays, and articles on youth cultivation. We hope that Free Talk is like a rich side dish, while Spring and Autumn is like a bowl of lighter hot and sour soup, with a bit of pungency, which has the effect of refreshing and provoking deep thought. Spring and Autumn is published every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, while Free Talk is published every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. On Sundays, the entertainment section is published, so that readers have the opportunity to rest their bodies and minds and adjust their lives. We hope that under such an arrangement, several supplements of Shen Bao can somewhat supply the spiritual food that readers need every day.

Literary essays are a higher level of reading, but we hope that the texts published in Spring and Autumn can be lively and moving, easy to understand, not rigid, and not boring, so that most readers can appreciate them and benefit from them. In terms of miscellaneous feelings and essays, we also hope to use realistic materials as themes to avoid empty and irrelevant rhetoric. We will ruthlessly expose and criticize the darkness and irrational phenomena of society, but we hope that what we say is constructive. We will also praise and encourage the bright side and good phenomena of society. Our purpose is nothing else, we only hope that China can become a more decent country, and the world can become a more beautiful world.

Spring and Autumn will strive in this direction in the future, and we hope that all writers will contribute more articles, and all readers will give us advice at any time!

### Hands

— Jian Wei

Sha Lan showed me her hands, small, delicate, and pale without a trace of blood. I love these hands, because they once pressed out countless world-famous pieces on the ivory keys for me.

But Sha Lan was not proud of her beautiful hands. She lay in the hospital bed, and when she saw me visiting her, she was very happy and held out her hands to show me, saying:

"You don't have to ask anything else, just look at the ugliness of my pale hands, and you'll know how sick I've been."

She said this very cleverly. I went to see her almost every day, and I never paid attention to her hands. When I asked about her condition, she always smiled sadly. I loved her frowning smile, sometimes with a flushed complexion.

"Let me kiss your hands," I said

She quickly pulled her hands back.

"Don't touch my hands. How wonderful it would be if I could touch the piano now."

I paid attention to her face, which was still recovering after her illness. No one could read or tell what her longing expression was like now. I pressed her hand, silently opened the piano lid, and pressed a key with my index finger. A monotonous note rang out.

Extreme joy appeared on her face. "I'm so glad I can hear this music again," she said with a smile. "I've been sick for so long, no one has ever played such a single note for me."

"But how wonderful it would be if I could play a few famous pieces as skillfully as before with my own hands!" This time there was no joy in her voice.

She was looking at her own hands, those weak, delicate white hands. A pianist's hands are her life.

I expressed my sympathy to her. Because I longed for her to play for me. But I couldn't help her with her pianist's hands that had lost their strength.

"Why can't I enjoy your artistic speech as before after you recover from your illness?" I said blankly.

Sha Lan didn't answer, and stretched out her hands blankly. These are weak hands after illness, which need heroic rest and blood, if their owner doesn't want to hurt the life of her art.

### Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

One Gold, White Jade, Earth

"What do you love most?" I asked them, the three little sisters with different surnames.

"I love white jade the most," Kai Lan said.

Yi Lan closed her eyes halfway, lowered her long eyelashes, and pondered for a moment; she told me: "Beautiful earth."

I was stunned, how could these three daughters with pure souls also have such secular thoughts? No wonder… ah! No wonder!

They smiled, a knowing, wise smile; they added a note for me:

"I love a heart like gold."

"I love a mind like white jade."

"I love the beautiful earth—our hometown."

Two Balsam

Balsam! Thanks to the blessing of the south wind, your seeds are sent far, far away...

However, Fengxian said plaintively: "It was the south wind that blew me to this quiet corner, under the wall, at the end of last summer."

If you unintentionally leave someone with a trace of unhappiness, he will always remember it, even if you have given him great favor.

This world is so desolate. No wonder the south wind blows through, carrying so much melancholy.

Three The Boatman's Words

In the golden oblique light, I met the young man, the boatman who had just learned to row a boat.

He wiped the sweat from his forehead.

"Do you feel tired?"

"A little tired," he replied to me.

"I encountered a headwind today."

"It's much easier to have a tailwind than a headwind?"

"Of course, if you don't encounter a headwind, you won't know how much difficulty it takes to row this boat in the river; if you always have smooth sailing, it won't be so easy."

I gained something. Thank you for the boatman's guidance. We are floating in the vast sea of people, the situation is no different from this. I hope that every boatman in the sea of people can remember these few simple and profound words.

### A Needle

— Jia Ji

Once, the central government was discussing the education problems in China. Someone said that China's education was abnormally developed. Mr. Wu Zhihui added a sentence: "There is deformity, but the development is not enough!" It won the praise of the audience.

### The Pullers

— Shangguan Shen

On the river bank, a large group of dark-skinned trackers are swaying and moving forward under the ropes, and the songs are reverberating in the air.

They were barefoot, their trousers rolled up high, striding through the weeds and thorns step by step, their toes kicking on the gravel, breaking and bleeding, and they stepped down, the sand covered the wound.

When encountering a headwind, their backs were lowered even more, almost touching the water with their noses. The rapid current was hitting under their feet, and they felt a little dizzy. However, they held their breath and pulled forward step by step, and the water splashed up.

On snowy days, a layer of ice formed on the river bank, and they walked silently on it, their feet frozen and burst open, and bright red blood dripped on the ice, and a long string of blood stains permeated along their journey.

They sweat all year round, labor all year round, and starve all year round. They don't seem to be pulling the rope for life, but just to make the few people riding in the boat feel convenient and comfortable. They take them forward, using their own hard work to exchange for their comfort.

They are the owners of the boat, but they are slaves to the guests on the boat.

### Work

— Lean Juan

The essence of being human lies in doing, in having work to do. Morning and evening, diligently and earnestly, completing one task after another, one day after another; only this can be considered being human, this is the way of being human.

The great American inventor Thomas Edison dedicated his life to work, constantly seeking work to do. One summer evening, he returned home after finishing work, looking very tired. His wife said to him, "You work too hard, you should go on a vacation." Edison asked, "Where should I go?" His wife said, "Decide for yourself on a place you think is suitable." Edison nodded and said, "Okay! Then I will go tomorrow." The next morning, he returned to his usual laboratory for work.

Work, work, constantly working. Edison's success is the best example for young people around the world.

Young people, may you strive to find work to do! May you strive to be human!

### Small Chronicle

In the past, students went on strike and petitioned. Now, students petition to attend classes. This is called "the present is not as good as the past."
— Zhensheng

More than three months after the victory, the puppet United Reserve Bank of North China issued new 5,000-yuan banknotes. (Tianjin Resident)

In the past, "government offices" emphasized "late arrivals and early departures." Now, shops emphasize "late openings and early closings."
— Zhang Shichong

"The people regard food as heaven." If this is understood, everything will be easy to handle. (Commoner)

"The higher the position, the wider the space, the more leisure, the more joy; the lower the position, the poorer, the busier, the more suffering." Some say this is a government official's mantra.
— Zhou Fu

(Small Chronicle' welcomes submissions)

### Habit

— Wu Dai

Habit is like sowing seeds.

Whatever seeds you sow, that is what you will reap in the future.

In ancient Greece, there was a flute player who charged double for students taught by inferior musicians because correcting bad habits is twice as difficult as forming good habits.

A person's good habits should be cultivated from childhood.

### Long Time No See, Shen Bao!

— Yang Chunlu

Long time no see, Shen Bao!

Today, you are gloriously re-published. Reuniting after a long separation is naturally a different kind of feeling.

In the past, you had a bright and long history, like a bright lamp, illuminating the whole country, serving as a mentor to tens of millions of people. Unfortunately, after the fall of the isolated island, you were occupied by traitors, lost your freedom, and fell into a dark trap. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and light has reappeared, I can meet this newspaper again, as if meeting an old friend, and my joy is boundless.

I am a reader of Shen Bao and also a writer for Shen Bao because my writing has been published in "Small Chronicle." Since the fall of the city, I have stopped writing for three or four years, which almost suffocated me. Today, as soon as I heard the news of this newspaper's re-publication, I hurriedly picked up my pen, wanting to express my innermost feelings, but with thousands of thoughts and emotions, I don't know where to start.

Okay, let's sincerely extend our hands, let's shake hands first, and say: "Long time no see!"

Short Masterpiece

### The Enemy (2)

But at this moment, the door opened, and Hana came out, wearing a dark blue woolen sweater over her kimono. She walked over affectionately, took his arm, and smiled silently. He had met Hana in America, but only fell in love with her after he was sure she was Japanese. If her race was not pure, his father would never accept her. He often wondered what kind of person he would have married if he had never met Hana, and was even more surprised at how, by a sheer chance, he had found her at the home of an American professor. The American professor and his wife were very kind people, wholeheartedly wanting to help their foreign students, and although the students found it annoying, they accepted his kindness. Sadao often told Hana that he had almost not gone to Professor Harley's house that night because the room was small, the food was bad, and the professor's wife was always nagging. But he finally went, and there he saw Hana, who was a new student at the time, and he felt that if possible, he would fall in love with her.

Now he felt her hand on his arm, and also felt the joy that this gesture gave him, even though they had been married for many years and already had two children. They had not married hastily in America. After they graduated, they returned to Japan, and after seeing his father, the marriage proceeded according to the old-fashioned Japanese customs, although Sadao and Hana had discussed everything beforehand. They lived very happily. She leaned her face against his arm.

Just then, they both saw a black thing coming out of the mist, a person. He had been thrown out of the sea—as if thrown out by a reef. He staggered a few steps, his body outlined in the mist, his arms raised above his head. A roll of mist then covered him again.

"Who is that?" Hana cried. She released Sadao's arm, and both leaned over the balcony railing. Now they saw him again. The man was crawling on his hands and knees. Then they saw him fall forward and lie still.

"Maybe it's a fisherman washed off his boat by a big wave," Sadao said. He quickly ran down the stairs, Hana following behind, her wide sleeves fluttering. There were fishing villages one or two miles to the left and right, but here there was only a deserted coastline with dangerous rocks. The waves near the shore were full of nail-like rocks. This man had managed to get through these rocks, he must be very badly injured.

As they approached him, they knew they were right. The sand on one side of him was stained crimson with blood.
