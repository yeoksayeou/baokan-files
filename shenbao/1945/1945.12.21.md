After Marshal Marshall appeared, the U.S. military band immediately played the Chinese and American national anthems, and Marshal Marshall and all those present stood at attention to pay their respects.

The enthusiastic atmosphere was unprecedented in the city recently. After Marshal Marshall arrived at his residence, he rested briefly and went to General Wedemeyer's cocktail party at 6 PM.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] During the war, the enemy puppets implemented a policy of poisoning the people. The recovered areas are permeated with poisonous fumes, and the number of addicts reaches over thirty million. If this huge number of opium addicts is not restored to productivity, it will be an obstacle to national reconstruction.

[Another Telegram] According to the Ministry of Interior, the Beiping Puppet Opium Prohibition Bureau was the central agency for the enemy puppets' poisoning of the provinces of North China. When our Beiping Pacification Office took over, it sealed up over 860,000 taels of opium. In addition, the Shanghai Puppet Opium Prohibition Bureau was the agency for the enemy puppets in Nanjing to transport and sell opium. After the takeover, it sealed up over 200,000 taels of opium. The Ministry of Interior has drafted measures for supervised public burning and submitted them for approval. Furthermore, all those in Shanghai who plant, transport, sell, or hide opium are required to apply for self-renewal and submit opium and tools before the end of the year to avoid punishment. Those who fail to do so will be severely punished according to the law. Opium addicts are required to quit before the end of February next year.

According to Mr. McNutt speaking to this reporter: The United States has decided to allow the Philippines to become independent in 1946, but if the natural, uninfluenced by external factors, request to retain the original form is made, then we may especially consider the request. This time, I plan to come to Shanghai to discuss issues related to the connection between China and the Philippines with General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater. There are many overseas Chinese in the Philippines, and mutual assistance is necessary in commerce and other aspects. The reporter asked if it was true that there was anti-Chinese sentiment among the people of the Philippines. Mr. McNutt replied: This is a baseless rumor.

At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, eleven representatives from the association, including Mr. Li Huade, went to Special Envoy Marshall's residence on the tenth floor of the Cathay Hotel to present the petition of respect. They were received by Special Envoy Marshall's representative, who expressed his gratitude, and then they withdrew. The full text of the petition of respect is recorded as follows:

Dear Special Envoy Marshall: We are so anxiously awaiting your arrival, for the sake of our country's future and the guarantee of world peace, waiting for you to eliminate the shadow of peace and the crisis of victory. When we heard the news of Ambassador Hurley's resignation, we felt very surprised and even astonished that the American diplomatic policy would shift. Then, when we learned of the report that you would be appointed as the special envoy to China, this made our momentary doubts about the United States completely disappear and at the same time increased our confidence. Because every Chinese person deeply believes that the special envoy will use the determination to command operations and complete victory to uphold justice and resolve all the difficulties at this stage. We want to cheer, cheer that the sacred War of Resistance has won a comprehensive victory, cheer that the anti-aggressors have truly grasped the fruits of victory. In the process of the war, our country's strength has made a powerful response and argument to the aggressors' foolish neglect, and it has an indispensable factor in stabilizing this turbulent situation. Past facts tell us that small fuses can have huge consequences, and today's China is not the China of eight years ago, especially the China at this stage. Special Envoy Marshall, we hope that you will pay attention and deeply understand, and use your past enthusiasm for caring for China to help us. In the past eight years, the Chinese people have suffered unprecedented catastrophes, and people who have been displaced all hope to go home and live a peaceful life quietly. But they are disappointed, and their wishes have become bubbles. What the newspapers bring are only tragic news. The Jinpu and Pingsui Railways have all been destroyed by the Communist army, obstructing the work of taking over and disregarding the life and death of the people. The Communist army invaded and controlled eastern Sui. Although the War of Resistance has been victorious, the people still suffer catastrophes. We oppose all wars. War has exhausted us. We demand quiet. We want to live a peaceful life. Today, when victory comes, we see the signs of division again. How heartbreaking is this? The Communist Party's non-cooperation and separatist policies have caused disturbances in China. These disturbances are hindering our country's unification, casting a gray shadow over victory, and making us feel sad about our country's future. The United States is our loyal friend. In the war to destroy aggression and undemocratic forces, it has always helped us. We also have the utmost confidence and believe that our friend will definitely assist us in completing peaceful unification. Finally, we ask Special Envoy Marshall to appeal to the U.S. government to understand China's current situation, assist the central government, build a new, democratic, free, and prosperous China, establish a permanent foundation for world peace, and complete the highest and most beautiful ideal of Datong. Dear Special Envoy Marshall, we respectfully extend our infinite love with familiarity and wish Special Envoy Marshall good health! (Central News Agency)

[United Press, Peiping, 20th] As Christmas approaches, the Nine Eastern Provinces are once again shrouded in mystery and a slight pessimism. Chinese newspapers are mentioning the delicate relationship of Sino-Soviet negotiations. National Army troops are awaiting orders to enter Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin, but currently, they cannot avoid futile hope. Chiang Ching-kuo is scheduled to go to Changchun again on the 21st. Dong Yanping, Director of the Chinese Military Representative Office, after a two-hour meeting with the Soviet Chief of Staff in Changchun on the 18th, has made some progress in liaison matters between Chinese and Soviet troops in the Nine Eastern Provinces, and another meeting will be held in the coming days, but there seems to be no hope for a quick resolution. Even after the Northeast territorial issues are resolved, China's desire to restore the economy of the Eastern Provinces and enable them to become self-reliant faces many difficulties. After Japan occupied the Northeast, it issued 500,000 million yuan in counterfeit currency, which increased the price index by 70 times. In July of this year, knowing that they were defeated, the Japanese issued another 300,000 million yuan in counterfeit currency and prepaid two years' worth of salaries for key government officials to purchase "essential goods." As a result, the price index increased another 30 times.

The details of the discussions remain highly confidential, but Soviet newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with the situation in Japan, China, and Vietnam, suggesting that the Far Eastern situation is indeed one of the topics of conversation among the three powers. Soviet newspapers seem to advocate joint governance of Japan by the major countries with interests in the Pacific region.

[Reuters, London, 20th] Although not yet officially confirmed, observers in London and Moscow generally believe that the Spanish issue will be on the agenda of the three foreign ministers' conference. It is hoped that the three powers can decide on a unified policy toward the Franco government, allowing France to join as well. At the same time, the Moscow conference remains shrouded in secrecy, but the frequent contacts among the foreign ministers of the three countries, as well as the extraordinary busyness of experts and advisors from various countries, suggest the intensity of the conference.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The proposal for the United States to fully participate in the United Nations organization has been passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. There were slight differences in the content of the bills passed by the two houses, so a joint committee was organized to adjust them and complete the entire bill, which was passed without objection by both houses within half an hour. The bill has now been sent to President Truman for his signature and implementation.

[United Press, London, 19th] At today's meeting of the United Nations organization committee here, the Soviet Union and the Philippines prevailed in their dispute with countries possessing colonies, and it was decided to authorize the United Nations Trusteeship Council to elect spokespersons for the various nationalities in the colonies on the colonies' own soil. This type of election is not of a delegated nature, but the new regulations for this procedure of the Council recognize this principle. The United States, Britain, South Africa, and China voted against this proposal.

[United Press, London, 20th] The U.S. delegation to the United Nations organization preparatory committee had originally advocated that all countries concerned should enjoy equal rights when territories under the League of Nations mandate were transferred to the United Nations Trusteeship Council. At today's meeting, the U.S. delegation announced that it was abandoning this original proposal and instead advocated that the United Nations General Assembly notify the mandated countries to take the same action as other directly related countries to hand over their mandated territories to the United Nations for management. In this way, the United States and other countries without mandated territories will be in a secondary position in future discussions on Palestine and the Pacific islands under Australian and New Zealand mandate. The United States believes that the above approach does not affect its position on the mandated islands of百本(likely a typo and should be 南洋, the South Seas), as these territories can be regarded as territories "separated from enemy countries," and the major powers have a significant responsibility for them. In addition, the British representative proposed that the permanent headquarters of the United Nations organization should be located in a small town in the eastern United States. The Indian representative stated that there should be no restrictions in the location of the United Nations organization that would be regarded as prejudiced. The British representative agreed with this.

### Security Council Report Approved

The report is divided into four parts: (1) recommendations, (2) provisional agenda, (3) instructions to the Military Staff Committee, and (4) provisional rules of procedure. The main point of this final report is the drafting of instructions to the Military Staff Committee.

### Acheson Issues Statement on Negotiations between Netherlands-Indonesia and Britain-Siam; Hopes for Renewed Efforts for Reconciliation; Requests Britain and Siam to Postpone Signing Any Agreements

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson met with reporters today to discuss the situation in the Dutch East Indies, which is the State Department's first statement on the policy it is taking on the Dutch East Indies issue. Acheson stated that the United States is increasingly concerned about the situation in the Dutch East Indies and hopes that all parties will renew their efforts to achieve reconciliation. The primary responsibility for reaching an agreement on the Dutch East Indies issue should be borne jointly by the Netherlands and the leaders of the independent army. The United States cannot but pay close attention to whether a major issue that affects the world can be resolved. The United States' only hope is that the East Indies issue can be resolved peacefully, so as to contribute to promoting world security and prosperity and improving the well-being of the people. Solutions can only be achieved through realistic, tolerant, and cooperative negotiations, and differences can only be eliminated through peaceful means. Acheson also solemnly declared that the United States has a considerable relationship with events occurring in Southeast Asia and has requested Britain and Siam to postpone peace negotiations. It is believed that although the United States has not been able to directly participate in the negotiations, it should have ample opportunity to express its views to Britain in advance.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Undersecretary of State Acheson announced today that the United States has requested Britain and Siam to postpone signing any agreement until U.S.-British negotiations are concluded. The United States has repeatedly made this request. On one occasion, when Britain and Siam seemed about to formally sign a truce agreement, the United States also requested a postponement. The United States has two reasons: (1) the United States and Siam have always maintained friendly relations, and the United States expresses its sympathy for Siam's desire to establish an independent and democratic government; (2) the United States has expended great effort in fighting against Japan, and the United States has a major concern for the overall peace and stability of the Far East. The United States has been regularly receiving reports on the development of British-Siamese negotiations, but recently, due to weather conditions, news has been interrupted. British officials here believe that the British-Siamese agreement is expected to be signed within the next week.

British-Siamese Treaty to Be Announced Soon

[Reuters, London, 20th] The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph reported today that an agreement on the terms of peace between Britain and Siam is expected to be announced on Christmas. The terms are believed to include the following: Siam should reimburse all allied forces' supply expenses, compensate for all losses suffered by British property during the Japanese occupation, and the export and production of commodities such as rice, teak, and rubber should be subject to the control of the Allied authorities until the world no longer lacks these products. The correspondent also stated that U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson's remarks in Washington yesterday caused considerable confusion among London officials. It is reported that Acheson said that the U.S. government had requested Britain and Siam not to conclude any agreement "while discussions with the U.S. were ongoing," and that the United States had a clear and legitimate interest in the situation in Siam, but it is understood that no discussions regarding Siam have taken place with the United States, and Britain has informed the United States in detail of the progress of the negotiations with Siam, and the United States has expressed its agreement to this.

### Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor to Go to London Soon

[United Press, The Hague, Netherlands, 20th] The Deputy Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, will travel to London in a few days to continue discussing the East Indies issue.

[United Press, Sydney, 19th] The manager of a Dutch shipping company announced today that approximately 300 East Indies sailors have refused to work on Dutch ships and will be repatriated as soon as ships are available. The company has agreed to provide the sailors with food and accommodation until they board the ships.

### Konoe's Memoirs Describe the Causes and Consequences of the Great War; The Emperor Failed to Suppress the War Faction, Leading to Disaster

[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] The following is recorded in the memoirs left behind by Fumimaro Konoe after his suicide. He claimed that apart from the Emperor himself, no one could make the Japanese militarist war faction obey, but unfortunately, the Emperor did not take active action, which ultimately led to disaster. Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States and Japan were working hard to conduct peace talks. At that time, even the Japanese army and navy authorities, as well as the diplomatic community, deeply felt that the Emperor was taking a completely non-interfering attitude. There is no doubt that the Emperor sincerely hoped for peace, but he took no active action to achieve peace. Konoe did not blame himself for the failure of his second and third cabinets but instead criticized the Japanese government for not allowing the Japanese army to act arbitrarily, as if completely detached from the other ministries of the Japanese government. While the Japanese government was doing its best to negotiate with the United States, the Japanese military was actively preparing for war, as if the negotiations had already failed. Moreover, the Japanese cabinet had no idea what preparations the military was making at that time, and the Japanese warships were moving frequently, and the army and navy had entered a state of mobilization. When the United States, which was negotiating with Japan, learned of Japan's preparations for war, it gradually became suspicious of Japan and thought that Japan had no sincerity in seeking peace. In September 1941, when U.S.-Japan relations were most strained, it was crucial for Japan to decide whether to make peace or go to war. Prince Higashikuni, the Emperor's brother, advocated taking a conciliatory policy and said: "There is no better way than the Emperor's decisive action." According to the Japanese army, peace talks were bound to fail, and they wanted to fight. The navy, while deeply afraid of defeat, was unwilling to publicly advocate peace and oppose the army. Marquis Kido, the Japanese Minister of the Imperial Household, told United Press reporter Beles that the Emperor often did not oppose the army's views. However, according to our observation, if the Emperor had truly ordered the army to stop preparing for war, war could not have been avoided. Konoe said in his memoirs that he had heard the Emperor tell Higashikuni several times that the Japanese army's actions were truly regrettable and had expressed the same to Konoe. Konoe also said: Higashikuni had questioned the Emperor, asking why he was indifferent to the overall situation, and if he thought the situation was bad, why didn't he stand up and publicly announce the bad situation. Konoe thought of explaining to Higashikuni that the Emperor rarely expressed his opinions, and people might suspect that the Emperor was hesitant in the face of events. Prince Saionji, a senior Japanese statesman, had considerable influence on the Emperor, so that the Emperor even intended to make his personal position the same as that of the King of England. Saionji and others had advised the Emperor that he should not take the initiative unless it was absolutely necessary, because when the Emperor ordered the formation of a cabinet, he only emphasized the following three matters in particular and gave no other instructions: (1) Respect the Japanese Constitution, (2) Do not be too insistent on diplomatic matters, (3) Do not cause drastic changes in the financial sector. Konoe argued that the Japanese Constitution was slightly different from the British Constitution, that is, the Japanese Constitution took the Emperor's personal rule as its center. Especially in military affairs, the Japanese government had no say in the military, and only the Emperor could manage both the Japanese government and the military at the same time. The Emperor could be conservative in ordinary times, but at the critical juncture of the country's peace or war, the Emperor's passive attitude was enough to put the country in extreme difficulty. Konoe made this final judgment on the Emperor: "The Emperor's attitude was passive, but his heart always wished to maintain peace. He hoped and tried to prevent Japan from falling into any great war of uncertain outcome."

### U.S. Congressional Leaders Support Merger of Army and Navy; Navy Expresses Opposition

[United Press, Washington, 20th] U.S. congressional leaders have agreed to consider President Truman's proposal to merge the Army and Navy early next year, but it is believed that there will be fierce debate beforehand. Members of the Navy Committees of both houses are the most vehemently opposed, believing that the Army will annex the smaller Navy, making it a secondary unit. Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, called this plan "a coercive expression of power politics." He said: "If this plan were introduced by an allied democratic country, we would view it with suspicion and fear." Vinson continued: This plan "will sink the Navy to the bottom of the sea."

### U.S. Railroads to Use Radio from the End of the Year; Enables Trains and Vehicles to Communicate, Increasing Safety and Saving Time

[United Press, Washington, 19th] U.S. railroads will begin using radio from the 31st of this month to enable trains and vehicles to communicate, increasing safety and saving time. This "railroad radio" is being established under the auspices of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. According to the committee, this measure will prevent accidents and increase traffic efficiency. It is believed that it will be widely used in American trains, and 129 applications have already been approved for trial.

Experimentation with radio on railroads has been going on for years, but it only saw a significant increase in scale and nature during the war. The war has made radio equipment stronger rather than weaker. Its success in tanks, aircraft, and amphibious vehicles shows that the vibration of trains is also not an obstacle.

The American Railroad Association has announced that radio equipment will not be widely used next year because training radio operators and ordering and installing equipment will take time. Here are some examples of how radio can increase traffic safety:

(1) Smoke is seen in a car of train A by train B passing by. Through communication between the two trains, the crew of train B can immediately notify the engineer of train A. The noise of the train will not affect the engineer, because the required personnel can be immediately summoned using a portable radio telephone with a loudspeaker.

(2) If a conductor on a mile-long freight train sees an object about to fall on a middle car or other dangerous situation, he can order the engineer to stop the train through communication between the vehicles. This avoids using the rear brake of the car, as using this brake before the engine stops can often cause the car to split in two. Also, when a long car is backing up, it is necessary to have communication between the engine and the rear of the car.

(3) In the event of an accident in a remote area, you have to go several miles to make a phone call. A train equipped with radio can immediately send a distress signal. In 1943, a train overturned, and the conductor walked three miles to get a phone to call for help. In addition, radio has the benefit of increasing the speed of traffic. Engineers can issue orders to open switches at track switches via radio, and those controlling the brakes do not have to stick their heads out of the car in the cold to talk to the engineers.

### MacArthur Orders Japanese Government to Postpone General Election; Japanese Cooperation Party Established

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Authoritative sources told the Central News Agency reporter exclusively that General MacArthur's headquarters has asked the Japanese government to postpone the upcoming general election. According to a recent announcement, the election is scheduled to be held on January 30. It is believed that General MacArthur's headquarters wants more time to create a list of members of Japanese political parties who are prohibited from participating in the election.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Marquis Yoshichika Tokugawa has formally notified the Social Democratic Party that he has decided to leave the party and join the Japanese Cooperation Party, which was established two days ago.

### Emperor Hirohito Breaks Historical Precedent, Regularly Meets with Japanese Reporters; Imperial Palace Guard Strike Contains Political Undertones; Shidehara Claims to Base Decisions on Public Opinion

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Emperor will meet with Japanese journalists on the morning of the 23rd. This is the first time in Japanese history that the Emperor has met with Japanese journalists.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 20th] Fifty members of the Imperial Palace Guard went on strike today, and the remaining five hundred and fifty members threatened to strike as well, demanding the dismissal of key officials and the adoption of other democratization measures. This unprecedented situation has panicked court officials, who are at a loss as to how to explain it to the Emperor.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Prime Minister Shidehara stated today that he and his cabinet will not resign. Shidehara said that he would heed public opinion and only resign if the people wanted him to. Political observers believe that Shidehara's statement indicates that he intends to remain in his current position until he is forced to step down during the general election in the last week of January next year.

### Japanese Government Plans to Reduce Food Rationing for the People

Likely to Cause Serious Repercussions

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Japanese government is reportedly reducing its food rations because farmers are refusing to submit this year's autumn harvest to the government. Up to December, farmers accepted orders and sold only 11% of the total rice to the government at market prices. Japan will face a severe rice shortage in February next year. The government is forced to reduce food rations to the people in mid-January. However, this measure by the government will inevitably cause a strong backlash from the general public, especially in urban areas.

### London Enthusiastically Participating in Fundraising for Aid to China Fund

### Local Correspondence

Wuxi

Telegram Requesting Relief for the Silk Industry

Xue Mingjian, a National Councilor and the current Chairman of the Sunan District Branch of the Chinese National Federation of Industries, stated that Wuxi's silk industry has always been well-developed. However, during the occupation, most of the silk reeling factories were destroyed by the enemy. Moreover, the villagers in the rural areas, due to the low value of silk cocoons under enemy control, have lost interest in silkworm rearing and have converted mulberry fields to grow rice and wheat, resulting in severe and unbearable losses. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the homeland has been restored, reviving the rural economy and providing relief to the silk industry is an urgent task. Yesterday, he specifically put forward several key points in a telegram requesting President Song of the Executive Yuan and Vice President Weng to review, consider, and adopt them for implementation.

### "Little Shanghai" in a Corner of Jiangnan: The Newborn Posture of Wuxi

— Our Reporter, Canglong

Wuxi—the "Little Shanghai" in this Jiangnan region. Since the arrival of the Third War Area General Headquarters, its important position on the Nanjing-Shanghai line has been further enhanced. This time, the Third War Area News Liaison Group, as the Jinghu Garrison Area Pacification Work Supervision Group, is about to start working. It specially invited the Shanghai Journalists Group to Wuxi to participate in and cooperate with the reporting work of the various groups of the regiment. The motion to send reporters was only decided on the eve of departure. Everything seemed hasty and unprepared. Although the stay in Wuxi was only for two full days, the general outline of Wuxi cannot be said to be entirely vague.

On the evening of arrival in Wuxi, at the banquet hosted by Commander Tang for the staff of the Supervision Group, I heard his determination to restore local order and organize the people's armed forces. He explained the need to implement the baojia system, and he expressed his agreement to the requests from various localities to issue firearms for self-defense. However, he would encourage the construction of pillboxes and the proper use of these firearms as much as possible. Finally, he repeatedly encouraged the staff members to uphold the virtues of the central government to appease the people, not to increase the burden on the people in any way, and to ensure that all measures meet the needs of both the government and the people. At the lunch hosted by Regiment Commander Sun Yuanliang the next day, I heard about the organization and work of the Supervision Group. I learned that the Supervision Group is a collective organization of the party, government, and military, with the duty of inspecting and supervising the various troops and local party and government organs within the Jinghu Garrison Area, with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the pacification work. It is estimated that the inspection and supervision work will last for about two to three months. In addition to reporting on the news in the supervised areas, the reporters from various newspapers participating in the Supervision Group will also have to undertake part of the mission of inspection and supervision. The work is arduous and the responsibilities are heavy, but in two or three months, when the Jiangnan region, which has been turbulent and chaotic for many years, once again bears the fruit of tranquility, how happily will we celebrate together?

Let the People Breathe: The County Magistrate Worries About Daily Necessities

Since the liberated areas were temporarily exempted from land tax, and the central government could not provide subsidies for a while, local governments have generally experienced financial panic, and Wuxi is certainly no exception. According to County Magistrate Fan, the county government's current tax revenue only comes from entertainment, slaughter, licenses, and house rentals, which are less than one-tenth of the expenditures. However, he is unwilling to collect taxes from the people in rural areas. He said that the people in rural areas had five or six burdens at the same time in the past. Now, they have finally taken a breath from eight years of suffering. He is really unwilling to impose even a small burden. He believes that only by reducing the burden on the people can the hearts of the people be won back. Therefore, he borrowed 35 million yuan from the city chamber of commerce to temporarily make up for the deficit. However, just maintaining the more than 5,000 staff members of the various departments under the county government feels strained. In addition, the more than 600 brothers in the county security team need to urgently purchase a batch of cotton uniforms because the weather has suddenly turned cold, which requires an expenditure of more than 40 million yuan at once, which is really difficult to raise. He said with great emotion that he is simply a county magistrate who worries about daily necessities!

In addition, he felt another difficulty: the lack of cadres and incomplete laws and regulations. He said that the war has been extended for eight years, and the cadre talents have been lost. Some of them have taken on the air of the puppet regime, and some truly talented people dare not come out rashly because the local security is not stable, which makes him feel lonely and unable to support himself. Furthermore, the incompleteness of laws and regulations makes many administrative measures lack a basis. But I think that the future of national construction is arduous. "Many difficulties" can "revive the country," and "many difficulties" may not be the first step in building a great Wuxi. County Magistrate Fan said it well that the county government's only current policy is how to make the people live and work in peace and contentment. All other measures and plans are ancillary.

Visiting Japanese Prisoners of War at Huishan: Eliminating the Cancer of Democracy

On the afternoon of the 17th, in the roaring northwest wind, our group visited the Huishan Japanese Prisoner of War Concentration Camp. The Japanese prisoners of war concentrated here all belonged to the 27th Division of the Japanese Army. The mastermind of the division—Lieutenant General Ochiai Seijuro—lived far away in a desolate temple on the top of Ji Mountain. We climbed the mud path step by step, and all along the way were endless tombs. The temple was on the peak of the tombs. When we stepped into Lieutenant General Ochiai's room, we saw several bottles of foreign wine and some valuable cigarettes on the wall shelf. He sat peacefully in a rattan chair, while the reporters stood around him, firing questions at him like a string of pearls. However, he nonchalantly answered evasively, followed by a series of hackneyed clichés of gratitude for the leniency of the Chinese side towards them. I am simply tired of hearing these stereotyped thanks for leniency. Is that all that is in the head of Lieutenant General Ochiai, who once served as the "Director of the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board," a "young officer," and a "China expert"? I was at a loss. I deeply realized the success of the Japanese military's national education in controlling the thinking of their soldiers. Control! Control! This terrible cancer of democracy, we should completely eradicate it. We should reform the minds of Japanese soldiers.

Back to the Huishan Japanese Prisoner of War Concentration Camp, it was almost five o'clock. It is said that there are more than 17,000 Japanese prisoners of war here, who were once famous elite divisions of Japan. When we entered the camp for a visit, most of them were already lying in bed covered with quilts. It is said that each Japanese prisoner of war can be rationed 700 grams of rice a day, which is about the same as the ration of Chinese soldiers. When we visited their food warehouse, we saw that there were still considerable quantities of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains stored.

Visiting Various Newspaper Offices: Woodcuts are Particularly Exquisite

This time, because it was a visit by the Shanghai Journalists Group, the Wuxi press circles were busy hosting banquets. The Wuxi press circles currently have three daily newspapers: "Da Xi Bao," "Jiangsu Min Bao," and "Da Feng Bao." There is one evening newspaper: "Wuxi Wan Bao." In addition, there is also the Xishan News Agency, which has a long history. Two newspapers, "Zhen Zhong Daily" and "Liangxi Daily," are in preparation. It is said that the "Ren Bao" and "Xinwen Huibao," which were published before the War of Resistance, will also be relaunched. With so many newspapers published in a city with a population of only about one million, the situation cannot be said to be not flourishing. We visited all the newspaper offices once. Only "Jiangsu Min Bao" has its own printing press. What is admirable is the craftsmen who carve the characters. The large-sized sample titles can be carved in a proper form, and even general celebrity photos, because there is no plate-making equipment, are mostly carved with woodcuts, which can also be carved vividly, but the cost is far below that of plate-making. These are also valuable products under the conditions of short materials and equipment.

Factories Have Resumed Work: Many Chimneys are Not Smoking

During this trip to Wuxi, because I came and went in a hurry, I regret that I could not make a field tour of the factories that Wuxi is famous for. I only got some fragmentary concepts from oral statements. It is said that about six or seven out of ten factories have resumed work. However, due to the lack of fuel, the damage to machinery, and the shortage of raw materials, the production volume of each factory is far less than two or three out of ten before the war. Some places show even more obvious contradictions. For example, due to the cost of power (electricity for industrial use in Shanghai is more than 40 yuan per degree, while in Wuxi it costs 240 yuan), the flour production in Shanghai is not only greater than that in Wuxi, but also reverses the previous practice of flour being transported from Wuxi to Shanghai, resulting in a backflow phenomenon. Therefore, unless power, fuel, and raw materials are fundamentally resolved, the prospects for Wuxi's light industry are difficult to rejuvenate. On the afternoon of the 18th, the reporters hurriedly embarked on the return journey again. In the wriggling of the engine wheels, they stretched their necks and looked at the many chimneys outside the city of Wuxi. Many of them were not smoking, and only a few that were smoking were thin. This scene symbolizes the industrial circles of Wuxi. But I am looking forward to the coming of next spring, when Jiangnan will become a pure land, the people will be working hard, "living and working in peace and contentment," and Wuxi will restore its industrial prosperity. Every chimney will be emitting thick black smoke, no longer just a "Little Shanghai" willing to follow, but a "Great Wuxi" that can stand alone.

### Kaohsiung, Taiwan's Second Largest City, Rebuilt in the Rubble

— United Press Correspondent, Edward F. Haulk

Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city, was bombed by American explosive bombs and incendiary bombs, and eight-tenths of the city has been destroyed. These days, the citizens of the city are carrying shovels, hoes, and baskets to clear this pile of rubble.

Teachers and students of the school, like ordinary workers, are working shoulder to shoulder under the command of the mayor. They filled the bomb craters and swept away the rubble piles. Then, the engineering team broke and flattened the towering dangerous walls. In this way, Kaohsiung is like a military field, because 32,000 of the city's 40,000 houses have been destroyed.

The previous American bombing not only caused material damage to Kaohsiung but also caused economic damage at the same time. Although the number of Taiwanese people killed or injured in the daily bombing since January of this year was only about 500, the more shops destroyed, the more difficult it became to buy food every day. Before the Japanese surrender, local prices rose sharply. After the Chinese army was stationed, the Japanese price limit mechanism failed, and prices jumped endlessly. Five years ago, it only cost 15 cents to buy a pound of rice, but by August of this year, it had risen to 3 Japanese yen. In our opinion, 3 yuan is only a small amount, but the average Taiwanese worker only earns 1.5 or 2 Japanese yen per day.

A Wave of Price Increases

The prices of other commodities also rose along with rice. Fish now costs 16 Japanese yen per pound, which was only enough for 1 yuan five years ago. Pork has risen from 1 yuan to 32 yuan per pound, beef from 50 cents to 10 yuan per pound, and chicken has also increased 20 times.

After the Chinese army was stationed, the authorities immediately tried to solve the food problem. They successively convened several meetings of local leaders to discuss various measures to avoid serious food shortages. However, the black market is still rampant, and the price increase is still in progress, because of the overabundance of Chinese currency in the northern part of the island, the prices have been raised even higher.

Since the beginning of the war, although the exchange rate between Chinese currency and Japanese yen has not been officially set, merchants are generally willing to exchange 1.5 Japanese yen for 1 Customs Gold Unit. As for the exchange rate for US dollars, there is no regulation in the local area, but 1 US dollar can be exchanged for 1,500 Chinese currency, which is then converted into 112 Japanese yen. These black market exchange rates are the same as the situation after the Chinese army was stationed in Vietnam. At that time, commercial trade could only use the black market exchange rate. Later, General Lu Han issued a notice, which made the black market a legitimate exchange rate.

Currently, many store owners in Kaohsiung have built wooden sheds in the ruins to do business, while some have moved to small towns or rural areas, and some are simply sitting and not doing business.

Looking for a Job

The factories in Kaohsiung are still closed, and those workers who have not left are trying to find jobs. The Japanese said that food is becoming scarce day by day, and their agricultural experiment stations have been robbed, which is something that has never happened before. The Chinese authorities said that this robbery was a manifestation of the people's hatred and contempt for the Japanese.

After the new Chinese mayor took office, his first measure was to prohibit shops from closing down in order to stabilize the local market. At the same time, he also ordered all schools to resume classes and all industrial factories that are under construction to continue construction.

Politically, it was previously reported that an independence movement had occurred in Taiwan, but there is no sign of it now. It is said that these elements have hidden themselves due to the stationing of the Chinese army. They led demonstrations and incited the people to demand independence in the days before the Japanese surrender. However, the people of Taiwan currently show no signs of dissatisfaction with the stationing of the Chinese army in appearance. After the Chinese receiving officials arrived in Taiwan, they conducted research on the political situation in the local area with the investigation team. According to those close to Chief Executive Chen Yi, although he himself is a geologist and chemist, he came to Taiwan to study the development of local agriculture, but his main task is politics. It is said that another Chinese military intelligence officer has also come to Taiwan to study the political situation.

When they inspected a certain industrial factory in Kaohsiung, they instructed the representatives: all senior Japanese staff must be dismissed completely, the sooner the better. The majority of the local citizens of Taiwan are Chinese, and most of them demand a position in the Taiwan Provincial Government. There are also some employees who previously worked in factories managed by the Japanese army, and they demand that the authorities take over the factories from them.

The Chinese authorities have repeatedly said verbally that the senior Japanese staff in the industrial circles of Taiwan will be dismissed separately. If this measure is implemented, it will create very serious problems, because those senior positions require trained experts to take over, and China does not have so many talents for a while. It is remembered that the Japanese technicians at the Kaohsiung Agricultural Experiment Station said that they would not want to stay in Taiwan if they were not under the leadership of Dr. Iso Eikichi. Iso Eikichi is the former director of the Agricultural Experiment Station and is one of the world's rice production authorities. He has lived in Taiwan for thirty-five years and may be appointed as the honorary minister of the Ministry of Agriculture in the future. He himself also expressed that if he has the opportunity to continue research, he is willing to stay in Taiwan to work. (Special Translation by the Newspaper Translation Department)

### Black Smoke Obscures the Sky, Cannon Fire Falls Silent: Hong Kong's Terrifying Memories - A Painful Recollection Before and After the Fall

— Lu Danlin

Hong Kong experienced the outbreak of war on December 8, 1941. Kowloon fell in less than four days. Hong Kong, being an island surrounded by water, was difficult for the enemy to land on, thus it was able to defend itself for a longer period. However, because the local military strength was weak and there were no reinforcements, it was difficult to defend. Nevertheless, the British troops were united in their efforts to resist the enemy. Even after enduring two so-called "peaceful offensives" from the Japanese invaders, who dispatched so-called "peace envoys" to Hong Kong to negotiate terms, the Governor of Hong Kong sternly rejected them, refusing to cease fighting until the very end.

Several oil depots in Causeway Bay (Prince Edward Road) were set ablaze, the black smoke soaring into the sky, not ceasing for days and nights. In Stanley, Shau Kei Wan, and other locations, Japanese troops landed, leading to several days of bloody battles. The enemy forces increased without diminishing, and gradually advanced westward. The cannons firing from Kowloon towards Hong Kong continued with dozens of blasts in succession, battering the area near the Stubbs Road automobile route (a trestle-like road) to pieces. Japanese troops invaded and controlled areas around Blue Pool Road and Causeway Bay.

**Artillery Silenced, City Cloaked in Gray**

I was living on Sing Wo Road in Happy Valley. Just a dozen or so yards from my doorstep, two temporary howitzer positions were set up. Each time they fired, the walls shook, and the glass windows and doors rattled. Enemy planes frequently dropped leaflets from the sky, attempting to confuse and mislead people. However, on the 24th, the situation in the city changed somewhat. Air raid personnel disappeared. On the roads, in the ditches, and in the open spaces, there were many air raid personnel and police hats and uniforms scattered haphazardly. The service personnel guarding the air raid shelters announced to the refugees inside that they would no longer maintain order that evening. This made the refugees uneasy. Because the local order was disrupted, the Hong Kong side artillery was no longer firing much. Several Indian artillerymen in front of my residence had taken the firing pins away from the cannons, leaving only two cannon bodies behind. The shells were also removed. The entire city was cloaked in a layer of gray, and everyone's heart was filled with extraordinary fear, fearing a great disaster and that the bitter fruit was about to be tasted.

As expected, at around 9:00 PM, the advance cavalry of the Japanese troops was setting up defenses in Happy Valley. Several Taiwanese interpreters, acting like tigers, were going from house to house, urging residents to hang medicine flags and forcibly write the words "Welcome the Great Japanese Imperial Army" and paste them on their doors. The manager of the Kim Yoke Lau restaurant was seized and taken to guide them to the homes of important people. Happy Valley was close to Causeway Bay, so the vanguard of the Japanese troops arrived in Happy Valley first.

On the morning of the 25th, British soldiers, Indian soldiers, volunteer forces, etc. (the air raid personnel had disappeared) retreated westward without being pursued by the Japanese troops. Half an hour later, Japanese troops followed and entered the central district, firing several shots into the air. At the same time, planes showed off in the sky, and the Japanese artillery positions in Kowloon fired dozens of shots. Thus, Hong Kong fell into the clutches of the demons. When the British soldiers left the artillery positions, they destroyed all the machine parts of each cannon, thoroughly damaging the muzzles. They also damaged machine guns, armored vehicles, and cannon shells. Knowing that a time of hardship had arrived, they drank heavily to stimulate their nerves.

**Japanese Troops Paste Seals; No Payment, No Unsealing**

After entering the urban area, the Japanese troops immediately took out prepared wooden boards, writing on them such things as "Military and Civilian Affairs Department," "Navy Department," "Army Department," "Reporting Department," etc., and nailed seals to various banks, large shops, warehouses, government offices, schools, hospitals, large restaurants, newspaper offices, bookstores, and large buildings. Many entrances were sealed with more than one board, and some had seals in the name of several departments, indicating their chaotic activity. At the same time, it also showed their struggle for territory and power. Therefore, later, to unseal the place, one had to contact each unit that had nailed a wooden board and pay a fee before it could be processed. If one unit didn't agree, even if the so-called "Governor of Hong Kong" approved, it would be of no use. The lack of unified command among the Japanese troops and their pursuit of self-interest and struggle for power were evident. All public and private institutions and large buildings in Hong Kong were occupied. Barbed wire was laid at key traffic points on various roads, and pedestrians were subject to inspection. Streetcars and buses stopped running, electric lights were dim, and tap water came intermittently. Some places had their water supply cut off. Shops closed down, and small shops only opened one door.

Japanese soldiers, especially Martin (husband), dragged a bayonet and, under the pretext of searching for military supplies, went to various houses to harass the residents. Watches, fountain pens, cameras, flashlights, telescopes, etc., were taken as soon as they were seen. If they weren't found, they were forced to be found. The seizure of Hong Kong currency was initially not considered important by them. All public and private cars were parked in Happy Valley and the open space next to HSBC, numbering no less than several thousand.

Women were trembling with fear of the arrival of Japanese troops and disguised themselves to conceal their identities. Some used the water of "gardenia" to paint on their faces and hands, pretending to be sick, or changed into male attire and cut their hair short. Some ran to Catholic churches, asking Italians for protection. Those of mixed race did not dare to walk on the street, fearing that they would be mistaken for British or American citizens and sent to concentration camps.

The scoundrels who had been imprisoned at Wang's news paper office were released and engaged in vigorous activities, resuming publication immediately and shamelessly praising the Japanese army. Beating face-sized wash basins was a cry for help indicating harassment by Japanese soldiers. Transportation between Hong Kong and Kowloon was restored that day, but only for the Japanese army. Vendors only sold small items in the streets and alleys. Pork and beef were out of stock for half a day. Those who understood a few words of Japanese made a fortune writing shop signs for others.

**Enemy Appeasement Policy - Like Sugar-Coated Arsenic**

The Japanese army issued its first proclamation, adopting a policy of appeasement, wanting to please the Chinese people, using both the Showa and the Republic of China year designations. It also declared that the Chinese were third parties, not enemies. However, the harassment by the Japanese army and the activities of secret agents were contrary to its proclamation, like poison in sugar-coated pills.

The declaration that 100-yuan and 500-yuan Hong Kong banknotes were temporarily suspended from circulation caused many people to frown, and they were forced to use "military currency." The ratio of military currency to Hong Kong dollars was one to two. Gloucester Building and the Hong Kong Hotel were the places where the Japanese chieftains operated and stayed. The so-called Hong Kong gentry were also forced to come out to maintain order. The common people suffered the most because the factories had already stopped working, and some savings had been used up. They dared not walk outside, fearing that they would be taken to do hard labor. Because the war had lasted for eighteen days, no one had cleaned the roads, garbage piled up, flies swarmed, and the stench was extreme. It was necessary to find coolies to clean it up. Many people threw anti-Japanese books and publications on the road, not daring to keep them, so the streets and alleys were full of filth.

Some people with a penchant for storytelling said that Hong Kong's eighteen days of fighting were predetermined. Because the Chinese character for "fragrant" (香) is a combination of the characters "one" (一), "ten" (十), "eight" (八), and "day" (日), this is another example of a clever play on words. I mention it in passing to end this article.

**Disbanding and Returning to the Fields**

A Japanese soldier in the midst of battle, his face overflowing with a joyful expression, helped his family harvest rice in the fields. However, you have to pay attention to the fact that he is still wearing the old work clothes from his military service. This is probably because he has no other clothes to change into. Since Allied Supreme Commander MacArthur ordered the disarmament of all Japanese troops, this uniform has probably been put down like a weapon.

### Northeastern Industry and Agriculture Support 40 Million People

The Northeast has a large amount of raw materials, magnificent electricity, and developed railways and shipping lines, all of which are sufficient to support industrial production.

Speaking of the Northeast's agriculture, it is still the main resource of this region, and its importance is no less than that of industry. Since China has just been ravaged and agriculture is still awaiting revitalization, the Northeast's agriculture will be more necessary than industry in the next year or two. Northeast agriculture has been greatly developed by Japan, and it can now produce 3 million tons of wheat and about 5 million tons of soybeans annually. In addition, there is a large amount of rice, corn, millet, and sorghum.

In summary, the Northeast's industry and agriculture now support 40 million people, and its remaining capacity can still sustain the lives of 30 million people. Therefore, if China can manage it well, it can not only obtain food but also alleviate the difficulty of overpopulation. China may obtain raw materials to serve as the basis for developing inland industries, and in addition, it may obtain some machinery to be dismantled in Japan in the future. (New)

Editorial

### After Special Envoy Marshall Arrived in China

President Truman's special envoy, Marshal Marshall, arrived in Shanghai by plane yesterday afternoon. General He Yingqin, former Chief of Staff of the Chinese Army, represented the government to greet him at Jiangwan Airport. At 6:00 PM, Mr. Marshall, introduced by General Wedemeyer, met with leaders of the Shanghai community at the Cathay Hotel, and they talked cordially with each other. Marshal Marshall is a first-rate military talent in the United States today, and he has a special mission to China this time. Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang have already flown to the capital one after another, and their meeting with Mr. Marshall will not be far off. Marshal Marshall has a deep understanding of the international situation. He must already have a clear idea of what the crux of the China problem is, and how he can accomplish his mission, and live up to the US President's desire to promote China's peace and unification. Standing on the position of a Chinese citizen, we feel both happy and ashamed to welcome Marshal Marshall today. However, as soon as Mr. Marshall got off the car, he widely solicited opinions, and we cannot but briefly state what we have in mind to help him have a better understanding of China. The current situation in China is somewhat similar to the early days of the founding of the United States. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, for fifty years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, have been striving to build a prosperous, happy, unified, and democratic China. Unfortunately, over the past thirty years, this nation-building work has been constantly hindered by Japanese imperialism and the division of local forces. The Chinese Kuomintang inherited the will of the Father of the Nation, launched the Northern Expedition, completed unification, and established the National Government. The invasion of Japan became even more urgent. Now that the enemy has surrendered, it is time for us to actively build the country, and our great ally has sent an envoy like Marshal Marshall to China, which truly reminds us of when France, whose nation-building ideals were similar to those of the United States, also sent an outstanding military and political figure to the United States at the beginning of the founding of the United States. We hope that the impact of Marshal Marshall's arrival in China can be the same as the impact of Lafayette on the American people. Modern democracy is a new experiment in China, and we need the assistance of allies who have experience in democratic politics and share our nation-building ideals, especially the assistance of a military genius with a democratic spirit like Marshal Marshall. We hope for the following points after Mr. Marshall's arrival in China:

First, President Truman's statement pointed out that the US government and the United Nations only recognize the National Government as the only legitimate government of China. This is what the Chinese people have always held, only recognizing the National Government as the only legitimate government. Therefore, future efforts should not be to weaken the power of the National Government, but to make it stronger; all efforts must be centered on the National Government, so that all parties tend towards this center, so that it becomes more stable and strengthened. The so-called "coalition government" that includes all parties and factions will only weaken the National Government, thinking of replacing the National Government with a new institution. This is contrary to the intentions of the general Chinese people, and is a conspiracy to deliberately distort President Truman's statement. The National Government's employment of people was originally not limited to members of the Kuomintang, and there are many talents who do not belong to the Kuomintang, and they sincerely welcome people from all parties and factions or no party. The reason why there are still political disputes is that there are some minorities who attempt to weaken or overthrow the existence of the National Government. Now that President Truman has issued his statement, and his special envoy Marshal Marshall has arrived in China, all efforts should be directed towards strengthening the National Government, which goes without saying.

Second, the so-called "democracy" is seen differently by people with different ideals. China takes the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle for nation-building, which already contains the essence of Western democratic politics. Among them, the exercise of civil rights, such as initiation and referendum, are all systems adopted by the Father of the Nation after studying the application of American democratic politics. The experience of American democratic politics contributed greatly to the process of the Three Principles of the People. The common ground between the Chinese and American people in thought and behavior is probably more than any other nation. The Chinese people's respect for the tradition of freedom is no less than that of the American people. Because they love freedom, all forms of centralism or collectivism are not valued by the Chinese people. The development of the Chinese Communist Party in China relies on force, not on its doctrine, because the tradition of the Chinese people is incompatible with the so-called tradition of Marxism-Leninism. Not only do the Chinese see it this way, but the representative of the Third International, Joffe, made it clear when he came to China and issued a joint declaration with the Father of the Nation. And the Chinese Communist Party itself has long said that it is willing to fight for the Three Principles of the People, whether it is true or false, it can be seen that communism cannot be practiced in China, which is already known to all. Therefore, we cannot overestimate the strength of the Communist Party. At least, there are four to five million Catholic believers and one million Christian believers in China. Although they do not have a political organization, their ideals of life are fundamentally different from those of the so-called Marxists-Leninists. In short, in the process of democratization in China, the only means is not a new political experiment, but the full implementation of the Three Principles of the People.

Third, no country allows the existence of a state within a state and an independent and autonomous army. President Truman pointed out in his statement: "The existence of independent and autonomous armies like the Communist Party's army is incompatible with China's unification and makes political unification impossible." Therefore, in the process of building a strong, unified, and democratic China, the prerequisite, as the New York Times said, is that the Communist Party hand over its army. Because as long as an independent and autonomous army like the Communist Party's army exists, their attacks on the national army have not stopped for a day, and the occurrence of bloodshed in China cannot be ended for a day. In order to avoid bloodshed, for the sake of China's unification, and for the construction of a democratic China, the Communist Party's army should be immediately disbanded and reorganized. President Truman has a clear expression on this point, and it has almost become a foregone conclusion in China. We hope that it will be realized as soon as possible.

We know that the convening of the Political Consultative Conference still needs to wait, and there is still no news about the meeting of the three-person group to resolve military issues. We sincerely hope that after Marshal Marshall's arrival in China, he will first promote the early holding of these two meetings.

### Securities Black Market

— Minor Recovery

Last month, on the 19th, a special decree from the Ministry of Finance ended the securities black market.

The securities market was originally an institution to attract floating capital and regulate enterprise finance. However, once it becomes a black market, it inevitably carries the danger of harboring dirt and filth. Moreover, the identities of the companies whose stocks are currently circulating on the market are still questionable. The exchange rate of valuable securities based on counterfeit currency is even more uncertain. Allowing them to circulate on the market would indeed hinder both political and economic orders.

Now, the black market is gone forever. Before "being summoned by the Lord," the money supply in the market was tight, and the black market call loan interest rate averaged over 20% per month. After "being summoned," the financial situation immediately eased, and the call loan interest rate gradually decreased, recently hovering around 12-13%. Although the tightening and loosening of the money supply have other causes, the demise of the stock market is not entirely unrelated.

Before its demise, the stock market concentrated on so-called "hot stocks." After its demise, floating capital suddenly favored government bonds. This shows that floating capital fears having no outlet. When neither east nor west is viable, changes are inevitable. Speculating in goods is outdated, and there are no stocks to manipulate. Legitimate business investment has not yet "become a trend." This floating capital, after rushing back and forth, chose government bonds. Although this is still a black market, it cannot be denied as a welcome phenomenon.

However, the black market's corpse is not yet cold, and another black market has already been born. This shows that economic issues cannot be completely resolved by political means. The current strategy for stabilizing prices should prioritize stabilizing the value of currency, followed by increasing the supply of goods, and thirdly, guiding floating capital towards savings and legitimate investment. Since the black market is illegal, there should be a legal alternative to replace it. Otherwise, backroom deals can transform into alleyway deals; alleyway deals can transform into teahouse deals; and teahouse deals can further transform into street deals. There is black within black, and law outside the law. Merely beautifying the surface is of no help.

The reorganization of the securities industry has already begun. However, all it has done is reorganize a group of securities practitioners. It has not reorganized the operating target of the securities industry—valuable securities. The Ministry of Economic Affairs still has no concrete measures for reorganizing companies issuing stocks based on counterfeit capital. The issues of resuming and reorganizing the stock exchange are still kept secret. I fear that after the pervasive "bearish mentality" passes, the rampant floating capital will indeed provoke change. "If it does not return to Mo, it will enter Yang." This cannot be ignored.

Education and Sports

### Director Huang of the Department of Social Education Discusses National Education Rehabilitation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] National education rehabilitation work is actively underway. According to Huang Rujin, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, the cost of rehabilitation and equipment enrichment for all levels of education nationwide is approximately 80 billion yuan, which does not include the rehabilitation expenses of various provinces. The central government has approved 1.1 billion yuan to assist provinces in rapid rehabilitation, to be used for urgent needs this year. The Ministry of Education had previously formulated a plan for the relocation sequence of schools in the rear areas, but due to transportation issues, it will be difficult to implement according to the original plan. Currently, most universities in the rear areas are preparing to relocate to their original sites starting in May or June next year. If transportation is smooth by then, the relocation may be completed at the beginning of the next academic year. As for national middle schools in the rear areas, which were temporarily established due to the war, the Ministry of Education has decided in principle to close all except for those in border areas, which will temporarily maintain their original status. The faculty, staff, and students of the closed schools will be distributed to various national schools according to their place of origin and aspirations. The funds will be transferred to the provincial education departments based on the number of classes of students distributed (50 students per class) for their use. The schools are currently conducting surveys and registration to establish standards for future distribution. The Ministry of Education will centrally provide travel expenses for faculty, staff, and their families.

### Deputy Minister of Education Hang Liwu Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing

[Local News] Hang Liwu, Deputy Minister of Education, flew to Shanghai from Chongqing on the 17th and is residing at the office of the special envoy of the Ministry of Education for the Beijing-Shanghai region at 40 Yuyuan Road. He has been inspecting and guiding education rehabilitation in the city, working diligently. On the 19th, a reporter visited Deputy Minister Hang at his office on Yuyuan Road, where he made the following statement: "I am about to go to Beijing to arrange for the rehabilitation of the Ministry. I came to Shanghai first because I feel that the Shanghai education community was a center of arduous struggle during the war. I am here to visit and express my sympathy to people from all walks of life in education and culture. I am also planning to inspect the schools that have opened and the schools that are being rehabilitated."

### Education Association Actively Promotes School Building Protection Campaign

[Local News] The city education association’s citywide campaign to protect school buildings is progressing actively. The latest developments in the campaign are: (1) The campaign was launched to relieve schools from pressure from landlords or occupation by troops. Schools that are suffering from these issues are requested to submit written reports to the association, which will provide practical assistance. (2) Regarding school building rents, they should not exceed 40 times the rent of 1937. The association has consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rent Commission and has decided to handle this matter thoroughly. (3) Landlords must not terminate leases or take back school buildings for their own use without reason. A request has been submitted to the government to include this point in a specific law. It is also learned that the association will make a solemn and effective representation regarding military occupation of school buildings that have not yet been vacated.

### British Aid for China's Nutritional Relief: Central University to Pilot

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Airmail] British nutritional relief funds are planned to be piloted at Central University. The procedures have been decided: students from poor families with severed economic resources can apply with the certification of five other students who do not wish to apply for the relief funds. Consequently, over 600 people have registered to apply in recent days. The university plans to use these relief funds to subsidize some self-funded students. However, most students believe that the purpose of these relief funds is to improve the nutrition of Chinese students, and they should be used to improve the nutrition of all students. Subsidizing only a portion of the students goes against the original intention of the allied countries' aid. Therefore, they have risen in opposition and unanimously advocate that the relief funds should be distributed equally to all students in the dining halls for a "treat." The student union is currently negotiating with the university about this matter.

### Hankou Municipal Government Establishes Substitute National Schools

Private Elementary Schools and Private Schools to be Closed by Deadline

[Dahua News Agency, Hankou] The Hankou Municipal Government has noticed a recent increase in the population coming to Hankou from the rear areas, with a corresponding increase in the number of school-age children. To ensure that these children can enroll in school as much as possible, in addition to establishing 27 municipal elementary schools, it has promulgated a temporary method for establishing substitute national schools, which will be implemented immediately. The method provides detailed regulations for the funding, equipment, personnel, and curriculum of substitute national schools. All private elementary schools and private schools in the city must close by the end of this year.

### Inside American Universities: Hearing Children's Cries, Smelling Cooking

[United Press, Newport, 19th] In the historic buildings of Yale University, one can now hear the cries of children and smell the aroma of cooking, seemingly adding a family atmosphere. The school's plan is to allow married veterans to return to school and continue their studies without disrupting their normal family life.

Veterans Bring Families to Live with Them

Since the beginning of this semester, 80 such veterans have brought their families to live in 17 specially renovated dormitories, and more than half of them have children. Veterans can receive government subsidies to return to school, which is already legally based, but the legislators did not anticipate the current housing shortage and high prices to such an extent. Therefore, Yale University intends to help implement this law. At the beginning of the fall semester, 600 veterans enrolled, and more than half were married. Counting those who had already enrolled in the previous semester, there were 800. University officials were overwhelmed because there were few vacant apartments in Newport to provide for returning veterans, not to mention students from out of state or their families.

Surviving the Housing Panic

According to Miller, who manages housing on campus, "The school's supply is far from ideal, but we have done everything we can in a short time. The school can barely help married students through the difficulties of the next two years, and we have to wait until the housing panic is resolved." However, the students are very supportive of this plan. One housewife said, "As a soldier's wife, I am already experienced. Before my husband deployed overseas, I always followed the barracks, moving east and west to take care of him and live with him. Now that we are at the university, this is the first time we can say it is our home." The amenities and rent in the dormitories vary depending on the building and room size. Each family usually has two or three rooms, but two families share a kitchen and bathroom. The rent ranges from $30 to $55.

Student Stipends Insufficient

The most expensive rent is for only two families, who occupy the entire top floor, with four private rooms, all utilities, heating, refrigerators, and the use of school furniture, such as tables, chairs, bookcases, beds, and bedding, included. Each student receives a monthly stipend of $75, which everyone feels is insufficient, so wives have to go out and find some work, which is especially difficult for those with children. A Senate subcommittee is currently considering increasing the stipend by $15, but even with the increase, most families still feel it is not enough because food costs $2 a day, which is $60 to $70 a month. And that's just calculating for those without children, so what can be done? One student said, "We can only use our previous savings, mortgage war bonds, or even borrow money." Atherton, who served as a Navy lieutenant in Europe, said, "I still have two years to get my engineering degree, and I have to take on $800 to $1,000 in debt each year. Sue is two and a half years old now, and Michael is just 15 months old. Don't think they don't add to my extra burden. Next spring, I can get some work, which will bring in $40 a month, but the situation is still dire." Everyone agrees that this is a difficult education, but everyone thinks it can be endured and is worth doing.

### Chengyou Team Basketball: Two Exciting Grade A Games Today; Xiexing and Shantou Teams Meet; Chengyou and Donghua have Similar Strength; Recent Trends have been Revealed

The Chengyou Cup Grade A basketball competition has been underway for four weeks, with one month remaining. However, the division between strong and weak teams is already evident. In the first game today, Xiexing and Shantou will meet. Both are strong teams. Shantou has won all four of its games, maintaining a winning record. Players like Chen Qingjiang, Ma Canxi, and Lin Weicong are top-notch players in Shanghai. The team's cooperation is also better than other teams, and they have great ambitions for this cup competition. Xiexing has played five games, winning four and losing only one to Hualian. However, recently, He Jingui and Li Ruixiong, former members of the South China team, have joined, adding to their strength. If they can manage their lineup effectively today, Shantou may not be so optimistic. In short, this game is very important for the Grade A championship.

In the second game, Donghua and Chengyou have similar strength. Donghua has physical strength, while Chengyou has a good spirit. Both sides have well-known players with experienced skills. A fierce battle is inevitable. The schedule for today is as follows:

Xiexing vs. Shantou (Grade A) 5:30 PM

Chengyou vs. Donghua (Grade A) 6:30 PM

### The People's Food Problem

— Zhao Yuanrou

As someone engaged in people's education work, I have personally visited the people to encourage them to learn. Many people have given us such answers: "I work in the fields all day long, where do I have time to study!" "Prices are so high, life is so difficult, if I study, won't I have to eat food? It doesn't matter if I don't know how to read, you teachers are really meddling!"

In fact, the hardworking people, why don't they want to study! Why don't they know the benefits of studying! But they don't have this fortune, they must do hard work, their stomachs cannot be discounted!

I feel that: (1) When doing people's education, we should not forget the people's food problem; if we break the people's rice bowls and force them to come to class to learn to read, it is absolutely impossible! (2) Education is aimed at improving life; we should find ways to improve their living skills, and then teach the people to read and read newspapers, that is true people's education. In short, doing people's education should start with improving the people's livelihood!

### The High Court Re-examines Traitor Ling Guangyan Yesterday at the Detention Center

[Report from Our Newspaper] The traitor Ling Guangyan was re-examined at 2:30 PM yesterday at the Shanghai Prison High Court detention center. The presiding judge was Liu Yugui, with Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, Judges Zhu Zonghai and Cao Jun, and Secretary Jin Guoliang in attendance.

Previous Puppet Positions

Prosecutor Lin first read out the main points of the indictment, stating: The defendant participated in the puppet government in the autumn of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], serving as an "Inspector of the Ministry of Internal Affairs." In the winter of the same year, he served as an "Inspector of the Anhui Provincial Government," and in the spring of the 28th year [1939] as a "Secretary of the Pacification Department." In the autumn of the 29th year [1940], he served as a "Colonel Advisor to the Reorganized 10th Army Division," and in the spring of the 30th year [1941] as a "Major General Deputy Brigade Commander of the 20th Brigade." In the spring of the 31st year [1942], he served as a "Military Supervisor of the Pacification Army," and in the spring of the 33rd year [1944] as a "Military Judge of the Xiwuchengqing Rural Command." In the summer of the same year, he also served as a "Colonel Advisor to the Second Army." In summary, the defendant participated in the puppet government, holding various military and political positions for six years. Although he repeatedly claimed it was due to enemy coercion, there is no reason why he could not have escaped after so long. Therefore, the defendant is guilty of colluding with the enemy to betray the country, as per Article 2, Section 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Although the defendant surrendered himself to the Shanghai Military Police, it does not meet the requirements stipulated in the Regulations for the Surrender of Traitors. The court is requested to severely punish him according to the law.

Attempting to Evade Guilt

Before Prosecutor Lin read the indictment, the traitor Ling Guangyan attempted to state his reasons first, but was reprimanded in court by Judge Liu. Ling then stated his defense, saying he is 38 years old, from Wujiang, Jiangsu. He graduated from Chizhi University in his early years and later studied in Paris. Before the war, he went to Japan in a private capacity to study commercial law. He taught in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he participated in guerrilla work in his hometown, serving as the director of a political training class. He was denounced, leading him to turn to the enemy. Ling claimed that while he held various puppet positions, it was all due to the pressure of the environment, but he always "worked for the benefit of the people." In particular, when the traitor Li Shiqun and the Japanese Navy Marines carried out a rural pacification campaign in the Luli area, he tried to prevent a Japanese massacre. He also assisted the rearguard of the Loyal Salvation Army when it withdrew from Wujiang and was surrounded by the Japanese. He made every effort to relieve the siege. When he served as the "Deputy Brigade Commander of the 20th Brigade," he repeatedly assisted guerrilla work, which was why he was envied by the Japanese. As a result, he was arrested by the Japanese Military Police many times and suffered inhumane torture. This proves that the defendant had no intention of colluding to betray the country. He also stated that after the "20th Brigade" was completely disarmed by the Japanese army in September of the 32nd year [1943], he knew that the Japanese were faithless and unjust. Ling finally requested that two witnesses in Suzhou be summoned. At 3:01 PM, Judge Liu ordered the witnesses to be summoned and scheduled a retrial.

### Most of the Received Japanese and Puppet Ships Need Repair

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to information obtained from the National Ship Allocation Committee of the Ministry of Transportation, China has received over 2,700 Japanese and puppet ships to date. The largest ships have over 4,000 tons, but most of the ships have damaged or missing parts and need to be repaired before they can be used. It is reported that the ships allocated by the Committee currently operating on the Yangtze River include 20 ships on the Chongqing-Yichang line, 20 ships on the Yichang-Hankou line, and 26 ships on the Hankou-Shanghai line, totaling 66 ships. The allocation of ships for foreign waters has not yet been finalized. It is reported that several ships have sailed to the Northeast and Taiwan.

### Application for the Return of Radios Purchased Under Duress

Radios and shortwave radios that were purchased under duress by the enemy and puppet regimes have been seized and are being kept by the enemy and puppet property handling office. Owners can apply to the responsible department with their certificates for their return. However, the total number of shortwave radios is about 15,000, some of which have been transported elsewhere and are currently being tracked down.

### Strict Investigation of Japanese Residents' Household Registration, Issuance of Identification Cards

In order to thoroughly investigate the identities of Japanese residents, the Japanese Residents Management Office, together with the military police, conducted a strict investigation of the household registration of Japanese residents in the concentration area yesterday. The investigation was divided into 30 groups and carried out simultaneously. It is scheduled to be completed within today and tomorrow, after which Japanese identification cards will be issued. Wang, Director of the Japanese Residents Management Office, and Deputy Director Zou, personally inspected the various locations yesterday.

### Relief Supplies Transported from Shanghai to Various Locations

Food, clothing, and other supplies shipped to Shanghai by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) have temporarily filled the wharves and warehouses. They have now begun to be transported to inland cities and coastal areas in dire need of relief. The first nine ships that arrived unloaded 76,000 tons of goods, mostly food. Two more ships are currently unloading. Of the above-mentioned 76,000 tons, all have been moved out of the brick yards, with the exception of 11,000 tons still in warehouses. The remainder has been distributed to distribution stations in Hankou, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Kowloon. Some of the flour has been distributed to bakeries, retailers, and flour mills in this city. Some has also been sold to the Kailuan Coal Mining Company near Tianjin, which is paying workers with flour, resulting in a doubling of coal production. Another 20,000 tons will be shipped out of Shanghai in the next two weeks. Negotiations are underway with three shipping companies to lease 20 inland and seagoing ships to facilitate transportation. UNRRA relief food is distributed by 15 district offices. In large-scale public works projects, it is distributed free of charge to workers. In areas where food is scarce but people still have purchasing power, it is sold at a fixed price. The proceeds will be used for direct relief or to send refugees back to their hometowns. Many foreign refugees, mostly Jews, are currently receiving UNRRA relief. Several hundred more have registered with UNRRA, hoping to be repatriated with its assistance.

### Japanese Prisoners of War and Residents from Hankou Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 8:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese ship "Koya Maru," now renamed "Jiangya," which was taken over by the China Merchants Bureau, arrived from Nanjing carrying a batch of Japanese prisoners of war and residents concentrated in the Hankou area, totaling 2,105 people. This included 1,701 Japanese prisoners of war, 287 Japanese residents, 73 Japanese officer prisoners, and 44 female nurses. After the ship docked at the Qiujiang Wharf, personnel from the Prisoner of War Management Office escorted them to a temporary concentration site in Jiangwan.

The second batch of Japanese prisoners of war and residents to be repatriated has been delayed due to the breakdown of the "Meiyo Maru." According to a message from the Prisoner of War Management Office yesterday, it has now been decided to use the Japanese ship "Eihou Maru" to load them in Shanghai.

### Welcoming Marshall – An Unprecedented Scene at Jiangwan Airport

— Shouren

The welcome for U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall at Jiangwan Airport yesterday was the grandest scene seen since the victory. According to the scheduled plan, Marshall was set to arrive at the airport after one o'clock. The U.S. military press liaison officer prepared ten trucks and two cars at 11:00 AM to transport local news reporters to Jiangwan to greet him. At 11:45 AM, the "reporter's car" departed from Fuzhou Road, fully loaded with more than forty reporters. The U.S. military authorities were very strict, and temporary reporter identification cards were issued. Those without identification were not allowed to enter. Along Jiangwan Road, soldiers of the New Sixth Army could be seen, holding guns and guarding the posts.

Unexpectedly, Commander-in-Chief He

Upon entering the airport, U.S. military police wearing white helmets were guarding various locations. Marshall's black car was already parked on the runway, with eight white military police motorcycles parked in front to clear the way. At a little after one o'clock, a black car drove into the airport. The reporters all knew that it was Mayor Qian's car, but to their surprise, the first person to get out was Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin. Those present had not received news of Commander-in-Chief He's arrival in Shanghai, so they were all a little surprised to see him. The reporters surrounded He, asking various questions and requesting answers. He smiled and said, "I am a soldier, I don't understand political questions." He was very amiable to the reporters. Some said, "Commander-in-Chief He has a bit of an 'American style' with reporters and is very popular with journalists."

Cameras Focus on Marshall

Wang Xiaolai arrived latest among those who welcomed him at the airport. He was wearing a large black cloak and a black hood, and he was chatting very enthusiastically with those present. At a little after one o'clock, the reporters were confined to the designated area. Only ten photography reporters had special permission to work outside the area. A foreign reporter who had just arrived from Tokyo said that when General MacArthur flew into Tokyo, there was no scene as grand as yesterday's welcome for Marshall. At 1:40 PM, the sound of engines could be heard in the sky. A few minutes later, Marshall's silver plane was spotted circling overhead. Shortly after, it landed at the end of the runway. The plane, led by jeeps, slowly drove to the designated disembarkation point. As soon as the plane door opened, Marshall got out. Although he was over sixty years old, his steps were nimble, fully showing that he was a soldier. As Marshall got off the plane, the U.S. military band played the Chinese and American national anthems. Marshall and General Wedemeyer stood at attention and saluted. At this moment, ten photography reporters and ten cameras simultaneously advanced on Marshall. The reporters inside the area were also busy finding angles to photograph Marshall. This grand welcoming event, including Marshall getting off the plane, the playing of music, and the inspection, only lasted a little over ten minutes. After shaking hands with the welcoming personnel, Marshall got into the car and drove away.

Sign the Banknotes

At the cocktail party held at the Cathay Hotel in the evening, there were four or five hundred people in attendance. Marshall, General Wedemeyer, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Robert Smith, Military Attaché Colonel Barr, and Marshall's personal secretary Xue Bulai, stood in a row at the door, shaking hands with the guests one by one. Almost all of Shanghai's Chinese and American leaders were present. Not long after, Marshall came over and spoke with Commander-in-Chief He for a while, and they raised their glasses to wish each other health. At the reception, Commander-in-Chief He and U.S. Minister to the Philippines McNutt were surrounded by reporters. Several reporters even took out brand new banknotes and asked Commander-in-Chief He, Marshall, McNutt, and Wedemeyer to sign them as souvenirs.

Marshall's contribution to China and the world is significant. The grand welcome from Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai yesterday was sincere and heartfelt. It is hoped that the cooperation between China and the United States can be furthered by Marshall's appointment as special envoy, and that more solid guarantees can be obtained for the permanent peace of the world.

### Starting in Mid-January Next Year, More Express Trains Will Be Added to the Nanjing-Shanghai Line; New Passenger Cars and Touring Cars Will Be Added

According to a responsible person from the Transportation Department of the China Railway Management Committee of the Ministry of Transportation, the 20 locomotives and 3,000 freight car materials shipped from the United States to Shanghai will be allocated to the Ministry of Transportation by the UNRRA after their arrival in Shanghai. A considerable number can be allocated to the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, which will greatly benefit the freight transportation on the two lines. Recently, passenger transportation has still been crowded. At present, the slightly damaged passenger cars are being actively repaired. It is expected that an additional special express train will be added around January 10th next year, from Shanghai to Changzhou or Nanjing, to facilitate passenger transportation between Nanjing and Shanghai. The Committee has formulated a concrete plan to modernize passenger transport on various lines in Central China, which will add 191 of the newest passenger cars. The newest American-style touring cars are also being added. The upper half of these touring cars is made of glass, which is extremely convenient for passengers to view the scenery around them. The cars are also equipped with air conditioners, which can adjust the temperature inside the cars to make the temperature comfortable and increase the pleasure of traveling.

### Association of War-Stricken Comrades Performs Plays to Raise Funds

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Association of War-Stricken Comrades has been working very actively. In order to raise funds for various relief projects to help injured and sick comrades, children who have dropped out of school, and unemployed colleagues, a three-day Peking opera performance will be held at the Tianchan Stage starting today. Participants are well-known opera singers and celebrities in this city, performing their most proud and wonderful plays. Performances start at 5:30 PM every day. It is said that ticket prices have been set at 10,000, 6,000, 4,000, 2,000, and 1,000. Ticket sales started on the 18th. It is also said that the association has printed a kind of honorary ticket of 50,000 yuan, which has been enthusiastically promoted by the general manager Wan Molin and others, and has been mostly sold out.

### Cai Zhengya Discusses Commodity Prices - A Fixed Exchange Rate is Needed First

[Report from Our Newspaper] Commodity prices in this city have recently shown a tendency to rise again. Yesterday, the reporter especially visited Cai Zhengya, Director of the Economic Research Office of the Municipal Government, who analyzed the price trend as follows: Cai said that after Japan's surrender, the multiple by which prices have risen is even higher than before the victory. Factors such as the conversion rate of puppet currency, factory shutdowns, traffic obstructions, and poor administrative facilities are the main reasons, and then it has been affected by the soaring of the U.S. dollar. The highest peak of the U.S. dollar gold was on November 1, and the highest peak of daily necessities was on November 27. Afterwards, it gradually decreased, sometimes fluctuating, but always rising and falling with the U.S. dollar, and people's anxiety also played a big part. Therefore, if one wants to stabilize commodity prices at present, the first thing is to determine an appropriate exchange rate, and the second is to stabilize people's minds. If the supply and demand are occasionally insufficient, enemy and puppet materials can be sold at a flat price, which will surely be effective, but the technical problems of flat sales must be improved. If commodity prices fall, flat sales will be in vain. It is necessary to wait for them to move and then quickly sell them at a flat price in large quantities, which will surely maintain the expected level. It is also necessary to ensure that the goods sold at a flat price can directly enter the hands of consumers, so as not to flow into the hands of hoarders. In this way, natural factors will not be a problem, and commodity prices will not rise sharply again.

### Ticket Merchants Must Sign Their Own Names When Purchasing China Merchants Bureau Ship Tickets

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "scalpers" who were extremely active during the war, specializing in black market train and ship tickets, have once again become active. In order to prevent this, the China Merchants Bureau has now stipulated that anyone purchasing a ticket must sign their name or affix their seal on the back of the ticket when purchasing it. When checking the ticket, they must sign their name or affix their seal again. If any discrepancy is found, they will not be allowed to board the ship.

### Police and Bandits Shoot Last Night, One Bandit Killed, One Wounded

[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 6:00 PM last night, police officers Xu Xuebo and Yu Yan from the Taishan Precinct led four police officers to search pedestrians within their jurisdiction. When they arrived at the intersection of Caishi Street East and Zilaihuo Street, they were suddenly confronted by three people, all wearing black robes, who shouted to stop for inspection. However, the suspects were suspicious, turned around and fled. One of them pulled out a pistol and opened fire on the police officers. The police officers drew their guns and fired back. The two sides exchanged fire more than ten times. As a result, the first bandit to open fire was shot twice in the arm. Police officer Xu Xuebo bravely rushed forward and lay down beside a telephone pole on the side of the road. He continued to fire one shot, hitting the bandit in the chest, causing him to fall to the ground and die. At the same time, police officer Yu Yan also captured one bandit, who confessed his name as Pan Zhixiang. He was planning to rob elsewhere. The remaining bandit escaped without a trace.

[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 8:00 PM on the evening of the 19th, three robbers wearing uniforms broke into the home of a Shaoxing woman, Liang Ma, at No. 11 Chunyuan Lane, Qingyun Street, inside the city. Under the pretext of searching, they robbed her of three gold bracelets, a gold watch, and some legal currency and Central Reserve Coupons, totaling a loss of more than three million yuan. When the robbers fled, the victim followed behind and shouted loudly. Hearing the alarm, the nearby police officers quickly gathered and captured the petty criminal Sheng Zhihong (from Tianjin, 17 years old), who had previously served in the Tax Police Corps. He was taken to the Yimiao Precinct. After interrogation, he confessed that there were still accomplices hiding at No. 96 Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. Police officers went to the address and arrested the major robbers Ma Buqing and Li Zhenyi and eight others, and confiscated guns and bullets. The nine robbers are continuing to be interrogated.

(Report from this Newspaper) At approximately 8 PM on the 28th of last month, Zhu Hongming, Tang Bingyun, Xu Chengmo, and three others, armed, suddenly arrived at the Monte Carlo West Bar at 471 Dongda Ming Road. Claiming to be members of the Chinese Investigation Bureau's Detective Team, they stated they were acting on orders, alleging the shop harbored Japanese political prisoners. They came and went three times but conducted no investigation and seemed extremely flustered. The shop owner, finding them suspicious, reported this to the Tilanqiao Branch Bureau. Upon receiving the report, Director Zhang, suspecting the group, instructed the Judicial Section Chief Shi Qingrong to dispatch two plainclothes police officers to secretly observe the shop.

Spring and Autumn

### Remembering Wang Lixi

— Zhao Qingge

A kind, sincere, enthusiastic, and affable great writer has been dead for six years, serving in the war of resistance. He couldn't see victory, couldn't see peace, could only smile in heaven, perhaps with a slight resentment.

I still remember six years ago, at the anniversary banquet of the National Literary and Art Circles' Association for Resistance Against the Enemy, Lixi, his wife Jingqing, and I were at the same table. Because Jingqing could drink, we formed a battle line with Lu Jiye and engaged in a fierce battle with Hong Shen at another table. In the end, we won, but I also got drunk. I left the restaurant dazed and staggered down the road. If it hadn't been for Lixi supporting me, I don't know where I would have ended up drunk. His gentle nature made Jingqing seem more masculine, while he seemed more feminine. Soon after, I invited them to meet at the Sheng Sheng Garden. This time, Lixi himself got drunk, intoxicated by the evening scenery of the Jialing River. I had to hire a car to drag him back, while Jingqing had to leave early due to other matters. Walking on the dark Shangqing Temple Road, he told me that he recently intended to go to the front line, unwilling to suffer slow torment. His excited back disappeared into the flying sadness of Benzi.

In the bloody "May Third" and "May Fourth" of the twenty-eighth year, the surge of every patriot's blood was aroused. Who could remain silent and tolerate it any longer? Thus, the "Writer's Visiting Group" was formed in this blood's frenzy! We, the younger group, unanimously elected the kind and experienced Lixi to lead.

The date and procedures for departure had been decided, but my work didn't allow for leave. But he encouraged me to go, saying, "You said you wanted to go to the front a long time ago, and E'e can't go because of illness. If you don't go, there will be no women at all. You should try your best to find a way."

Leave was impossible to get. Lao She also thought that my health was too poor, and wouldn't it burden the group if I got sick? Lixi also noticed this point, and he said with a warning:

"At the front, if there's no transportation, you have to walk, and you can't worry about storms. Only strong people can endure this kind of hardship, and the group's discipline doesn't allow for leaving halfway. Can you bear it? A physique like mine can handle it!" He patted his chest, looking very self-satisfied, and looked at me with sympathetic eyes. This made me helplessly nod to him, indicating that I accepted his words, and asked to be kept informed.

After I decided not to go, Jingqing didn't approve. She repeatedly asked me to go. I knew her selfish motive: she wanted to be with me, so she wouldn't be separated from Lixi. But in the end, I couldn't go, and Jingqing couldn't go either. I went back to Beibei Hot Springs, and they separated north and south. This entanglement was originally not my responsibility, but unexpectedly, the news of "Lixi's death" came, which inevitably made me blame myself. I thought almost every day, if I had participated in the visiting group, and Jingqing had gone with us, and we were all together, his illness might have been cured. Even if he still had to die, at least Jingqing could have been closer to him for a little longer! Thinking like this, I couldn't help but shed tears. Thinking like this, I felt a kind of uneasy guilt. But in fact, Lixi would never pat his chest again and say that his body could handle it. He would never be able to come back.

Even now, I still can't believe that Lixi has really let go of everything! He had such a strong and mighty physique, such a courageous soul, such a sincere and enthusiastic character, and his kind deeds. With these qualities, he shouldn't have died, he wouldn't have died. I firmly believe that, even now.

Yes, national warriors will not die, especially Lixi. His spirit will live immortally in people's hearts, in the history of the motherland!

### Allusion and Antithesis

— Lu Danlin

Those who advocated for the literary revolution in the past had eight "don'ts", one of which was not to use allusions. But in my opinion, using allusions does not hinder the article itself, only whether it is used properly and whether it is too obscure to be understood. If used appropriately, it can help with the liveliness of the article and the clarity of the language. Now I excerpt a farewell poem by Qiu Canghai (Fengjia) to Wang Songchen returning to Taiwan, which can show a glimpse of this. The original poem says:

"I only wish you were like the moon in the sky, rising from the sea and returning to the east: I don't wish you were like the water flowing eastward, never returning from the sea. The moon has affection, the water is heartless, a dim soul melts away in farewell. Moreover, the family is separated like Hu and Yue, leaving their hometown for a hundred years. Doors are closed to wild geese, rivers block carp, ten thousand gold cannot buy a single letter. Alas, distant traveler, set off in the spring breeze of March. Cannot be retained, the sound of the Xiao flute, cannot be wiped away, the name on the jade. Thousands of dusts and kalpas cannot grind it away, the falling moon on the roof beam is the sorrow of parting. The mountain is always green, but it does not become clear after leaving the mountain; the moon in the sea comes out of the water and becomes bright again. I do not regret your distant farewell, I regret your long and final separation. To know whether you will come back, look at the full moon again."

This poem has only thirteen rhymes. A total of eight allusions are used, all of which are exceptionally appropriate, natural, and common, and each has a deep meaning embedded in it. If we know Qiu Canghai's life experience, we will surely feel that his verses are deeply emotional. This is because Qiu was a national hero and patriotic poet who launched the anti-Japanese militia in Taiwan.

If the use of allusions in writing can be appropriate, clear, natural, common, and have hidden meaning, or even possess all five aspects, then his article will be full of vitality. Otherwise, it will be fragmented, obscure, and leave traces, just showing off talent, which is useless and only leads to criticism. In the history of literature, folk songs, such as the song of hitting the earth in Yao's time (some say it was forged by later generations), "Rising at sunrise, resting at sunset, digging wells to drink, plowing fields to eat," is also very natural in its antithesis. The south wind song in Shun's time, the crow magpie song of He, the wife of the retainer of King Kang of Song, the generous song of You Meng, which was revised by the people of Chu, and the Book of Changes, Rites, and Spring and Autumn, also have many antithetical phrases. Others, such as the poems of the Tang and Song dynasties, also have many antitheses. Even Xiang Yu's saying, "Power to lift mountains, spirit to cover the world, the time is unfavorable, the steed does not go," is also particularly neat in its parallelism.

Writing to this point, I am reminded of clichés. In announcements of mourning, it is always said that one is "delirious on a pillow of earth." A horizontal plaque is sent to a doctor, not "bringing spring to life," but "skilled in Qihuang." A thousand articles are the same, flattering and deceiving oneself and others. And those who are just beginning to write vernacular, when describing the sky, must use azure, and when describing the efforts of laborers, they often use "kang yu" (resistance to breeding), which is also the same cliché. In fact, the most important thing in an article is the content and fluency of the sentences. Other things, such as the use of allusions and antithesis, can sometimes be inserted to catch the reader's eye and make it seem a bit more interesting.

### "Ensemble" and "Harmony"

— Song Chang

The orchestra (Orchestra) is the largest and most complete organization of musical instruments. Because the orchestra includes many instruments, it uses the timbres of various types of instruments to compose, so the volume is large and the expressive power is also very rich. Each instrument is a living, personalized individual, and performing it is almost like a performance of a grand musical drama (Drama).

The orchestra is so complex and intricate, why can it be cleverly coordinated to complete a good effect? This reason lies entirely in the element of harmony. The element of harmony can be said to be the foundation of music. Although each instrument has different characteristics, different timbres, and special emotions, they must all abide by the conditions of harmony. Only in this way can they cooperate and show a spirit of coordination.

I think music is like this, and a group, a country is also like this. Our country is now moving from the period of tutelage to the period of constitutional government. We are looking forward to the realization of democratic politics and the completion of the great cause of nation-building. Each party and faction is a group of political opinions, and naturally each has its own views, but for the sake of the country, we should unite together under the common belief of the Three Principles of the People, like the ensemble of an orchestra, and obtain perfect "harmony" through the cooperative "ensemble".

### A Heartbreaking Affair

— Shangguan Shen

Yesterday, for an urgent matter, I hurriedly got on a pedicab to go to my destination. The morning wind was a bit cold, and I turned up my coat collar.

The driver was pedaling very slowly, his body bent forward, and he was constantly coughing.

He was wearing an old Western suit jacket, with a hole in the elbow, revealing the dirty flannel shirt underneath. The pants were Chinese-style lined pants. His hair was very long, as if he hadn't had a haircut for a month.

After pedaling about halfway, I saw him pedaling slower and slower. The pedicab behind me had also overtaken me. I looked at my watch and it was already past the time I had agreed to. The driver was still pedaling slowly, one step at a time, as if he was pushing. I became annoyed and urged him.

He didn't answer me, he just pedaled harder, but after walking a short distance, he immediately slowed down again. I stamped my feet on the footboard, urging him.

He wanted to defend himself, "I..." but he didn't say anything. He lowered his body and pedaled forward desperately, but immediately slowed down again as if he couldn't hold on.

I almost wanted to scold him. I shouted for him to stop the car. I jumped out of the car, intending to pay him half the agreed fare. When I was counting the money and glaring at him angrily, I was stunned. The weak and pitiful driver standing in front of me was a good classmate of mine from elementary school. My face immediately flushed, and I was very embarrassed and didn't know what to do. He silently lowered his head and didn't look at me.

I called out his name softly. He seemed unable to bear the shame and turned to leave. I immediately realized that I had hurt his self-esteem. He obviously didn't want to admit it to me. I quickly caught up with him and stuffed all the money in my hand to him, but he called me from behind, came over and returned the money to me, and said in a very low voice, "You gave me too much."

He left. I looked at his back, and I felt a burst of heartbreak! We used to be friends, everything was the same, but now, one takes a car, one pedals a car. I gave him extra money with apology, but he returned it to me and said, "You gave me too much," treating me completely as a stranger.

I was silent for a whole day...

Spring and Autumn Essays

### Old Stories

— Murong Sui

This is a very ordinary old story:

An inspection team went to a small town in our hometown to conduct an inspection. The local government carefully sent two guards and hired rickshaws to lead them to inspect the town. As a result, they felt the impression was extremely good!

But they cleverly felt that it was not enough to only inspect the town area. They also discussed with the people in the government to go to the countryside to conduct an inspection. Of course, they were still carefully sent to go. After the result of "Respecting cigarettes in the east village" and "Waiting for tea in the west village", the impression was not bad.

They left. When the villagers went to the street, everyone talked about this and said, "They are just inspecting and inspecting, at most they are just visiting. They are not like Shi Gong and Bao Gong privately visiting the countryside to investigate. What are they doing?"

Here is another very ordinary old story:

A certain visiting group went to a certain town. The local groups held a large joint reception. The visiting group wanted to know more about the local situation in detail, and asked the representatives of each group in detail. Of course, each representative answered truthfully.

But when this visiting group was about to leave, they hired a few porters. Unexpectedly, the porters on the road instead asked the visiting group, "Sir! When can we buy cheap cloth in this town? When can we eat the allocated rice and salt?" The visiting group then felt a little "茫然" (mángrán - at a loss) or "恍然" (huǎngrán - suddenly realized)!

This is just an old story! Of course, it is not the same as before. Many senior officials who care about the people's plight must be able to go deep into the people. They will definitely not be like ordinary villagers who are thinking about those outdated "Bao Gong cases" and "Shi Gong cases".

### White Horse Temple (Temple is in Luoyang)

— Lao She

The Central Plains was originally good soil; the White Horse carried the scriptures. Wild cranes heard the first chants, bright clouds shone on the ancient platform. Sparse bells, silent among the graves, a dream opening up ten thousand fortunes. Calamities are still as they were in the past, burning incense to understand the Buddha's grief! Huang Yifei

### Proposing Suggestions to the Public Works Bureau; Hasten the Construction of Caojiadu Bridge According to the Original Plan Before the War

— Huang Yifei

Recently, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has been actively repairing roads. The main roads in the central urban area have already been completed. The northern end of Yinxiang Road and the section of North Sichuan Road near the railway will also be completed soon. Jiangsu Road, etc., in the urban area will also be completely renovated. This very correct inspiration deserves our support and praise. What we feel most headache about is the cliché of "only hearing the sound of the stairs, but not seeing anyone coming down." Because traffic problems, the big ones are related to the future of nation-building, and the small ones are related to social tranquility; next year is the implementation period of the traffic movement, the author cannot ignore this new measure, and from time to time puts forward a traffic problem in the western district of Shanghai for the reference of the Municipal Public Works Bureau.

Taking western Shanghai as an example, Caojiadu is an important hub for Jiading Nanxiang Zhenru and other places. The source of Shanghai's vegetables is mostly imported from the western district of Shanghai, partly by boat transportation and partly by land transportation. Let's not talk about boat transportation for the time being; first, pay attention to land transportation, and we have to pay attention to a Caojiadu bridge. The damage is unimaginable. If a heavy vehicle passes through, it shakes all over, which is extremely dangerous. Secondly, the southern end of the bridge is obstructed by houses, so cargo-carrying factories and cargo-carrying heavy grass often have the danger of being hit and falling into the river. It is reported that around 1937, the municipal government built this bridge. The original plan was to remove all the obstructing houses. The bridge was made of steel frame, but due to the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, it was perfunctory. Now, traffic members are looking forward to the Public Works Bureau rebuilding the Caojiadu Bridge according to the original plan of the municipal government before the war, demolishing the obstructing houses at the bridge end, opening up roads, so that the traffic inside and outside the city is smooth and convenient, and the citizens will benefit infinitely!

Anti-Tuberculosis Lecture

### A Discussion on Freedom from Worry Regarding Lung Disease (4)

(8) Compressing Lesions as a Fundamental Treatment for Lung Disease

If compression therapy can be applied early in lung disease to eradicate lesions, it is indeed a fundamental treatment. This not only saves economic resources and time but also allows for an early return to health, enabling individuals to engage in production, benefiting both their families and society. Among modern compression therapies, the most widely applied is artificial pneumothorax, commonly known as "air injection," which involves injecting gas into the pleural cavity. The lungs, within the chest cavity, are not adhered to the chest wall. Both their surface and the inner surface of the chest wall are covered by a smooth membrane, creating a separate cavity between them. Injecting gas into this space creates an artificial pneumothorax, causing the diseased part of the lung to be compressed and shrink, becoming quiescent. This reduces tension and provides an opportunity for rest, making the disease easier to cure. If there are already cavities in the lungs, these cavities can also shrink, allowing the surrounding tissues to close tightly, and gradually disappear due to the proliferation of new tissue. Furthermore, the compression of the lesions slows blood flow, and encourages the accumulation of lymph fluid. This can stop bleeding in the affected area, prevent the spread of tuberculosis bacteria within the patient, or to others, and reduce the absorption of tuberculosis toxins. Therefore, the most obvious and earliest benefits that patients experience after undergoing artificial pneumothorax are the cessation of hemoptysis (coughing up blood), a rapid decrease in hectic fever, the disappearance of tuberculosis bacteria in sputum, gradual weight gain, and an improved overall condition. Therefore, artificial pneumothorax is indeed a fundamental treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, suitable for individuals of all ages, without causing any pain. Notably, it allows patients to continue working as usual during the treatment period.
