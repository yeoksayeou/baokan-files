### Special Attack Corps Launch Attacks Day and Night, Fiercely Attacking Okinawan Fleets, Simultaneously Ramming Enemy Airfields, Inflicting Heavy Damage

Ryukyu Islands, Eighth (Central News Agency) - Japan's Special Attack Corps from various bases enthusiastically launched attacks on the enemy fleet off Okinawa early on the 7th. Preliminary results include sinking one large warship. Continuous attacks occurred on the night of the 7th and the morning of the 8th, with further results expected.

Forward Aviation Base, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The newly formed "Shinbu" Special Attack Corps of the Japanese Air Force, to assist the intensifying ground battle in Okinawa, daringly penetrated enemy fleets around the main island on the night of the 6th under the direct protection of fighter planes, braving low atmospheric pressure, achieving anticipated results. The escorting fighters, although encountering enemy fighters, all returned safely.

Ryukyu Islands Base, Eighth (Central News Agency) - As the ground battle on Okinawa intensifies, Japanese air units are descending from the Ryukyu Islands, engaging in fierce aerial combat with enemy defensive fighters. Coordinated with this, Japanese air units fiercely attacked enemy warships around the main island from the night of the 7th to before dawn on the 8th, and it is now confirmed that two enemy ships of unknown type were sunk. Another special unit rammed into an enemy airfield on the main island before dawn on the 8th, inflicting significant damage. Enemy aviation activity in the area is also gradually increasing, with the number of enemy aircraft attacking the island chain reaching over four hundred and several tens since the 7th.

### Southwest Naha Defensive Battles, Over 300 Enemy Soldiers Killed or Wounded

Okinawa Front Base, Eighth (Central News Agency) - In the land battle of Okinawa, the enemy forces, having broken through the Naha-Shuri line, are continuing their strong southward advance, launching offensives under the cover of enemy naval fleets and naval gun fire. The Japanese army is fiercely counterattacking. The current line of confrontation between the two armies is: on the west coast, from the southern end of Naha, upstream to the Kokuba River, then across a ridge about five kilometers south of Shuri, and then to the slopes of the Gushikawa area in the south of Chinen. The central battle line on the south bank of the Kokuba River has not changed significantly. The enemy is attempting to occupy the Oroku airfield, about two kilometers southwest of Naha. Since the morning of the 5th, a portion of the enemy force landed in the southwestern area of Naha, while another portion crossed the Kokuba River near Makabashi, south of Naha, reaching the side of the Oroku airfield, coordinating with the landing force. The Japanese garrison fought bravely, preventing the enemy's advance, and dispatched a large number of suicide attack squads to break into enemy positions, inflicting heavy losses. In the Oroku airfield battle alone, on the 5th and 6th, over 300 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. On the east coast, as of the evening of the 3rd, the enemy had advanced to the area from Ozato to Tomigusuku (five kilometers south of Yonabaru). Japanese units there are fighting fiercely to intercept them.

Heavy Losses of American Ships

Stockholm, Keijo, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The excessive consumption of resources by the United States in the Okinawa campaign has drawn domestic attention. According to a report from New York, the New York Times editorial on June 5th stated that the Okinawa campaign has become an unprecedented battle in the Pacific. From the landing on April 1st to May 25th, the United States suffered 28,556 casualties on land and 9,369 at sea, totaling 37,925. This kind of loss is unseen since the Solomon Islands campaign. We can thus understand that Okinawa is the only defensive base ahead of the Japanese mainland and is much more valuable than any other island. Also, the neutral Swedish newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet, commented on the Pacific War and the heavy American losses on the 5th, stating that the losses suffered by the American forces in the campaign exceeded our expectations, especially the losses of ships and personnel. Furthermore, this campaign seems to have been delayed beyond the original plan, and the number of casualties suffered by the fleet participating in both land and sea battles surpasses the casualties of the army and navy by several months, indicating the intensity of the Japanese Special Attack Corps' continuous wave-like attacks on American warships. At the same time, American army and naval units are still engaged in extremely fierce struggles on land.

British Undersecretary Talks About War Against Japan

Japan's human resources, including all ethnic groups, total 90 million people, plus those who cooperate with Japan in China, Manchuria, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies, will reach 100 million. We will fight a desperate battle with a fanatical and courageous enemy fourteen thousand miles away.

Editorial

### The Source of Japan's Decisive Battle Strength

The decisive battle of Okinawa Island is the prelude to the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland. On the one hand, the American enemy lost more than 560 ships for the landing operation on Okinawa Island before approaching the Japanese mainland, and also sacrificed more than 60,000 soldiers in the battle of citrus holdings on the island, so their combat plan could not but be delayed, and the morale of the entire army could not but be frustrated. On the other hand, because of the brave fighting of the Japanese garrison on Okinawa Island and the fierce attacks of the Air Special Attack Corps, the American enemy's so-called absolutely superior mobile units have repeatedly collapsed, and the landing force also felt difficult to advance or retreat, so the Japanese mainland can be fully prepared. The so-called "iron wall fortification of the Japanese mainland" facility has been promoted step by step and concretely realized because of these favorable conditions of time. We should not only praise the grandeur of the Okinawa Island operation, but also pay attention to the profound significance of the tenacious defense of Okinawa Island in the overall war situation.

Now, the American enemy is trying to break through the Naha-Shuri line and advance south, but the Japanese garrison is doing its best to repeatedly attack. The main force of the Okinawa Island defense is exerting its greatest effect. Although it cannot be avoided the isolation on the supply side, there are still combat elements to the enemy to wait for work, and because of the Okinawa islanders to share the same joys and sorrows, pledged to cooperate to the death, so in addition to the geographical advantage, there are also excellent conditions of harmony. According to the report of a certain special correspondent of the front line, under the shelling of the American enemy, the Okinawa islanders still planted seedlings in the dark night of dusk. This spirit of loving the hometown and increasing production is very respectable. From the point of view of the road, it is possible to imagine the degree of composure of the Okinawa islanders on the front line of the decisive battle.

Moreover, we can speculate from this the attitude and determination of the Japanese mainland people. Under the continuous bombing of Japanese cities, many places have been burned, but the citizens affected by the cities are more enemies. Those who have been evacuated to the countryside are working hard to increase the production of agricultural crops, and those who are determined to devote themselves to the factories in various places are contributing to the increase in the production of military supplies, and the combat power of the decisive battle can be increased a lot. It can be said that the bombing of each city in Japan by the American enemy has created the rapid completion of defense equipment in various parts of Japan. The "iron wall fortification of the Japanese mainland" was able to be completed in a short period of time because of this reason.

The special feature of modern warfare is the continuity of decisive battles. Although the decisive battle of Okinawa Island is much more serious than the previous decisive battles, from the point of view of the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland, Okinawa Island is only the vanguard of the recent Japanese mainland. And every inch of the Japanese mainland is the life of the Japanese people, and the Japanese people will fight a decisive battle to defend their homeland, and give the American enemy a head-on blow. The American enemy mobile unit has been cruising in the sea of Kyushu for more than two months, but still dare not try it rashly, because it knows deeply that the source of the Japanese decisive battle strength is in the Japanese mainland.

Not only are elite troops stationed in various parts of Japan and solid fortresses have been completed, but the entire Japanese people are a united volunteer force. The Japanese people's will to fight is as strong as iron, and the Japanese mainland has thus built an iron wall fortress.

### Eizo Ueyama Said Taiwan Is Becoming a Battlefield

Tokyo, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The Okinawa war situation is becoming increasingly urgent, and the importance of Taiwan Island is also increasing. The enemy forces intend to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the south by attacking Okinawa, and isolate Taiwan. The entire island of Taiwan is now full of strongholds. Under the enemy's bombing, the people of the entire island are resolutely at peace with their industries. Recently, Eizo Ueyama, a director of the Bank of Taiwan, came to Beijing from Taiwan and described it as follows: "After 50 years of governance, the results of Taiwan today are truly amazing. Governor-General Hasegawa's policy to "imperialise" the people can be said to be completely successful. The people of the island all regard themselves as subjects of the island state and are determined to defend the imperial land. For example, the Patriotic Labor Corps is now stationed under the command of the military department, engaged in production and construction with a spirit of recklessness. Now the entire island has been completely transformed into an iron-walled fortress, and this Labor Corps is working in production workshops, devoting themselves to increasing production day and night. In addition, there is the National Volunteer Corps, which has long been formed and is now preparing to be reorganized into a combat unit. As for food, they are making every effort to develop wasteland and factory land to increase production. Therefore, no matter how long the war lasts, there is no need to worry about the food situation. In recent years, enemy aircraft have been bombing persistently every day, but the residents are still as calm as before, with no fear. Although most of the houses in the cities and villages have been destroyed by bombing, the residents are still living their wartime lives in the ruins. All the functions of the bombed cities are restored to their original state on the same day, and field post offices, etc. are also handling postal affairs in makeshift shelters. The entire island of Taiwan has now become a battlefield."

### Ito Masanori Discusses the Significance of Decisive Battle Turning to the Offensive to Break the Difficult Situation

Tokyo, Seventh (Central News Agency) - The Japanese military commentator Ito Masanori discussed the significance of decisive battles in modern warfare as follows: "Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, there have been several decisive battles, which we all know. The battle for Singapore was also a decisive battle. After the battle of Guadalcanal, the enemy and I launched decisive battles several times. For example, the battle for Singapore was a decisive battle for our side to ensure a strategic base for advancing to the south. The decisive battle in the Malay Sea was a decisive battle to reduce the enemy's East Asian fleet, and the decisive battle in the Philippines was a decisive battle to inflict heavy damage on the enemy's army. After going through decisive battles with various purposes, the final decisive battle can be achieved, inflicting fatal damage on the enemy army. Let me give an example, namely the defense battle of the North Danish Fortress during the First World War. Germany began attacking North Denmark two years after the start of the war. The purpose was not to capture the North Danish Fortress. If it attacked this important position, the French army would definitely want to defend the area to the death and gather large forces. If so, the German army could take the opportunity to inflict heavy damage on the French army's combat power and reduce the naval strength. As a result, the German army began attacking the North Danish Fortress and finally developed into a worldwide battle. What the world was paying attention to at the time was not just the point that Germany wanted to deplete the French combat power. The North Danish offensive and defensive duties were eventually forced to develop into a fortress battle. France and Germany each damaged more than 400,000 soldiers at that time. As a result, the German army's decisive battle to injure the enemy army, the German army itself also suffered considerable sword wounds, and the French army was defeated. From this, it can be seen that the purpose and nature of the decisive battle can undergo huge changes due to the strength of the enemy and my armies. A decisive battle is by no means simply fixed and unchanging. If we try to observe the enemy army's tactics in the decisive battle between Japan and the United States, we can see that the US military has adopted consistent and unchanging tactics since the Civil War. Nimitz's so-called 'island hopping tactics' are not newly created, but are based on the old ideas and tactics since the Civil War. At that time, the Union army had achieved success with the adventurous attack tactics of 'abandoning the enemy's well-prepared defensive positions and attacking easily breakthrough battle lines, and then leaping forward'. This is exactly the same as the battle line of attacking Rabaul and Taiwan. Also, the idea of creating a mobile unit is the same. Appearing in various places where the enemy army is not expected and adding attacks, so we can call it a sudden-style battle line. The Japanese army's battle line has many characteristics. In short, this kind of Japanese duty must grasp the opportunity to transfer the offensive. If this kind of opportunity is not created in Okinawa, in order to achieve the goal, it is necessary to find a favorable time and geographical advantage elsewhere. This is the modern decisive battle, and it is an inevitable fact. In other words, it is also the mobility of modern warfare. War must be won by attacking, and decisive battles must be repeated to determine the end. Therefore, in order to break the difficult situation, we must turn to the offensive."

### The Yu Army Is Now Actively Preparing for the General Counteroffensive

Tokyo, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The Yu side set up the Chinese Army Headquarters in Kunming on December 25 last year, and appointed He Yingqin, the chief of staff of the Yu Army, as the commander-in-chief. Under his command are Wei Lihuang's Burmese Expeditionary Force, Tang Enbo's Qian-Gui-Xiang Border Area Army, Lu Han's Dian-Yue Border Area Army, and Zhang Fakui's Fourth War Zone Army. They are all the backbone of the Yu Army equipped with modern equipment. This measure by the Yu Army is intended to respond simultaneously with the Yu Army in the interior when the US Navy realizes the landing operation on the Chinese mainland, so as to attack the Japanese army on the sea and land sides. According to the Yu Army's general headquarters for the counterattack against Japan is located in Kunming, because the US 14th Air Force, which will provide air cover for the operation in the future, and Major General Mai Yia's US combat force stationed in China, which will be responsible for heavy training and guidance of the operation, will both set up their headquarters in Kunming. Based on the need for close contact with each other, the Yu Army cannot act independently, and everything must rely on the cooperation of the US Air Force, so the Yu Army's high-pitched general counterattack against Japan is actually not surprising. However, what we cannot underestimate is that the recent US military assistance to Chongqing has become more active. In addition to strengthening the transportation capacity of the China-India air route, the United States is also planning to connect the India-Myanmar Highway from India to Myitkyina in northern Burma and the old Burma Highway to supply blood to the Yu. The plan has been largely successful. As such, the Yu Army's preparations for the general counteroffensive are progressing step by step. However, because the US Army's landing operation on the Chinese mainland has not yet been materialized, it has not been able to obtain an opportunity, but as the US Army's hard battle in Okinawa deepens, their expectation of the Yu Army's active activities on the mainland is also becoming more and more urgent. Therefore, no matter when the US Navy's mainland landing operation is carried out, the Yu Army's general counteroffensive will be launched sooner or later.

### Stilwell Meets MacArthur in the Philippines

Lisbon, Eighth (Central News Agency) - According to the announcement of MacArthur's headquarters: US Army Ground Forces Commander General Stilwell met General MacArthur in Manila on the way to inspect the Southwest Pacific battle line.

### Proclamation of War by the National Government

On December 8th of the year before last, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with our neighbor, Japan. Since then, we have initiated the New National Movement, engaged in ensuring public safety, and improved the people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and others continue to employ their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts, even colluding with elements in the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American war front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians slaughter East Asians. Recently, as their forces have been successively shattered by the armies and navies of our allied nation Japan, and their bases for invading Cambodia have been lost, they have resorted to even more cunning schemes and are jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the National Government's rule, instigating elements in the Chongqing faction to constantly harass us, hindering the progress of various construction projects, and even directly using their own aircraft, using the Chongqing faction as a base, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming innocent civilians. It is shameful that elements in the Chongqing faction willingly allow themselves to be used by Britain and the United States, becoming traitors to East Asia. Moreover, the deliberate and long-planned actions of Britain and the United States in East Asia, exhausting their ability to provoke and sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, are something that all East Asian peoples should stand against together in righteous anger. Therefore, the National Government declares that, from this day forward, we are in a state of war with Britain and the United States. We will exert all our strength and cooperate with our allied nation Japan to sweep away the tyranny of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the restoration of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share a common understanding of East Asian co-prosperity. In the future, we should further cooperate to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged with British and American forces in the West for years, repeatedly achieving glorious victories. Our nation's participation in the Greater East Asia War will echo their efforts, contributing to a new and just world order for all. All our citizens should understand that this is the only opportunity to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world all depend on this. With one heart and one mind, let us work together from beginning to end to carry out this great mission of this great era.

### Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (2)

— Yi Fei

Journey to Shaoxing (Part 1)

On the Road to Xiao and Shao

Leaving Xiaoshan by car, there were three vehicles in total, each accompanied by five or six members of the allied forces' security team for protection. To inquire about the security situation along the way, the reporter struck up a conversation with fellow passengers. I was informed that recently, on May 7th and 8th, on the Xiaoshao highway near Yangfan Bridge, there had been repeated interceptions by roaming bandits. In addition to the loss of property, a total of twelve passengers were kidnapped or killed, creating an atmosphere of terror. The psychology of the average passenger along the way was extremely nervous. Unexpectedly, only half an hour after the car started, after passing "Qianqing Town," the front car's tire was damaged, and the car stopped for repairs. Because the area was considered dangerous, the allied soldiers all got out of the car and went to higher ground, setting up guns and ammunition for temporary security. Fortunately, the repairs were completed after twenty minutes, and we continued our journey.

After two and a half hours, we arrived at "Keqiao" (fifteen miles from Shaoxing). Along the highway, a small river called "Guantang" runs parallel. In the center of the river is a stone embankment (commonly known as the "Shao Embankment"), still used by boatmen carrying heavy cargo to pull and walk their boats along. Both sides of the riverbank are "pond lands," suitable for planting wheat and barley.

Another half hour, "Fu Mountain" comes into view, and we have arrived in Shaoxing. The car stops in the square next to the "Miss Hu" temple, which is also the location of the Shaoxing branch of the Central China Automobile Company. After getting out of the car, I went to visit the Commissioner's Office of the Fifth District of Zhejiang Province. Commissioner Yu Zhaolin was away in Hangzhou on official business, and was received by Gao Kangzhou, the secretary of the office. I heard that recently, several bridges on the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway, on the other side of the Cao'e River from Baiguan to Ningbo, have been destroyed, and traffic has been suspended for three days. It is difficult to predict when traffic will resume. I can only stay for a short time and wait for a car, while taking the opportunity to investigate.

Population Statistics

The walls of Shaoxing city are gone. The entire county is divided into ten districts. Before the incident, the entire territory had a population of 1.2 million people, but now only over 700,000 remain. Taking the urban area where the county government is located as an example, the situation is the opposite. Before the incident, the entire city had only about 70,000 residents. Since the friendly forces entered Shaoxing on April 17th of the 30th year, public safety has been better guaranteed, while the countryside has been filled with roaming bandits. Wealthy families have all moved to the urban area with their families, especially after the Shaoxing County Government was restored in June of the 31st year, the rate of increase has been even greater. Now the urban area is suffering from overcrowding. According to recent statistics, it has reached more than 135,000 people.

General Scenery

Daqing Road is the most prosperous part of Shaoxing. The entire street is about two li long, starting from "Jiangqiao" in the south and ending at "Qingdao Bridge" in the north. The most peculiar thing is that, although it is the same street, the street names and house numbers of the various shops are different, such as "Qingfeng Li Kou," "Xuanting Kou," and "Dashan Temple Front," with a large number of names, about a dozen or more.

The entire street has a large number of Western pharmacies. The names of famous pharmacies in Shanghai are all present. In addition, there are also many silver shops and department stores, but there are no bookstores or stationery stores.

In addition, Shaoxing still has three things that are different from other places. Even now, there are elderly women close to seventy years old wearing bright red embroidered shoes and walking on the streets. The rickshaw pullers running through the streets each have a bell, dinging as they pass through the market. When customers purchase goods in stores, the shop assistants routinely report the bill, chanting words as if singing songs, echoing the bell sounds of the rickshaw pullers in the streets, which is quite interesting.

Famous Product: Foil Wine

Shaoxing's tin foil and wine are famous far and wide, and were once extremely prosperous. The former is now in decline due to the inconvenience of transportation, the increased transportation costs of raw materials ("spot copper" from other ports), and the fact that wartime people's livelihoods are difficult, non-essential products have seen a sharp decline in sales. The latter, although the local area has the "Jianhu" spring water, which is extremely suitable for winemaking (one dan of water from this lake is heavier than the same amount of water elsewhere, with each dan weighing twenty-four jin more. Because of the heavy water quality, the wine made is easier to preserve and will not deteriorate), the current transportation is not smooth, and the raw material glutinous rice must be obtained from Suzhou and Changzhou, so the source is not smooth. In order to reduce costs, a large number of brewers have successively moved to Suzhou and Changzhou to work, so the local winemaking industry in Shaoxing is now in decline, only reaching one-tenth or two-tenths of what it was before the war.

Education Overview

The entire county has more than two hundred primary schools, one county-run middle school, and three private middle schools. For public education, there is a county-run library and a public education center. The treatment of teachers is as follows: middle school teachers receive a monthly salary of 4,000 yuan, plus only three dou of school rice. Primary school teachers receive the same amount of school rice, but their salary is only 2,000 yuan.

Current Security Situation

Currently, the entire county of Shaoxing is stationed with allied forces, as well as the Third Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Corps and more than 300 county police officers. The security in the urban area is relatively stable, as mentioned earlier. Roaming bandits appear in the suburbs from time to time, which makes it difficult to promote county administration. The 3rd, 5th, and 9th districts under its jurisdiction, due to the special environment, are definitely beyond the reach of the county government's strength. The rest can be called semi-safe areas.

### The Great Powers' Veto Issue Remains Deadlocked; Three-Headed Meeting to Be Held Soon

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Truman announced last night that a meeting of Churchill, Stalin, and himself will be convened within the next forty days.

Central News Agency - According to a London dispatch, a Reuters diplomatic reporter recently received information from well-informed sources: in order to break the deadlock at the San Francisco Conference caused by the great powers' veto issue, the British government has directly submitted a diplomatic note to Stalin. Whether the so-called veto issue, which has become the focus of the San Francisco Conference, will be referred to the three giants Stalin, Truman, and Churchill is still too early to speculate. According to reliable sources, Marshal Stalin has agreed to hold a three-headed meeting in the near future, but the date has not yet been determined. However, the San Francisco Conference has been open for a long time and has not yet ended, and cannot be delayed indefinitely. Although the United Kingdom is eager to achieve a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible, the Soviet Union completely refuses to compromise. Since receiving instructions from Moscow on the veto issue on June 2nd, the Soviet delegation has stated its opposition to the Security Council's retention of the veto issue. Although the United Kingdom and the United States agree to limit the use of the veto to the "action" stage, they oppose expanding the veto to the investigation stage. The Soviet Union's proposal is that the veto should be reserved only for procedural issues. However, the group of small countries that fundamentally oppose the exercise of the veto by the great powers absolutely oppose the Soviet Union's view. The reason why the small countries dare to shout and wave the flag is said to be due to the support of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Chongqing. Therefore, if the Soviet Union stubbornly adheres to its position, it will not be able to gain the support of the conference. Conversely, if it stubbornly opposes the Soviet Union's proposal, the Soviet Union may reject the world organization. Before Marshal Stalin makes a new review of this issue, it is difficult to expect new developments in this issue. World public opinion has already recognized the importance of the veto issue.

### Song's Return to Chongqing to Include Visit to Moscow

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, Song Ziwen, who is currently staying in San Francisco, will visit Moscow en route to Chongqing to meet with Stalin. This should be based on the major resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of Chongqing to improve relations with the Soviet Union, which has close ties with China after the war and possesses powerful strength. However, Song's mission to the Soviet Union is nothing more than the following two points: 1. Compromise on the issue of the Southwest Asia region; 2. Resolution of the Yan'an issue; 3. Decision on military, political, and economic matters in the Northwest. Regarding the resolution of the Yan'an issue, according to the editorial of the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency's Liberation Daily on the 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek still views the Kuomintang-Communist issue as a domestic political issue at the Sixth Plenary Session, without changing his long-held attitude. Regarding this issue, as Zhou Enlai said, if Chongqing does not abandon its political contradictions, namely its dictatorial and reactionary actions, Yan'an will always constantly fight against Chongqing, expressing a tough attitude towards Chongqing. On the other hand, with the end of the European war, the Soviet Union, from its own position, intends to move military, political, and economic forces in the border areas of Xinjiang and Shaanxi to expand its influence. Now, Song Ziwen is ordered to try his best to ingratiate himself with the Soviet Union, but whether it can achieve satisfactory results is still doubtful.

Competition Between U.S. and Soviet Forces

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) - Since Mao Zedong made a shocking declaration at the Seventh National Congress of Yan'an, the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party has reversed, and the political struggle is on the verge of armed conflict. The encirclement of Chongqing's Tenth War Zone by the Yan'an army and the attempt to advance south to Ruijin, Jiangxi Province, have made the Kuomintang-Communist issue attract international attention with the U.S. and Soviet forces as its background. Its trends are extremely worthy of attention. The Dazhong Bao issued by Chongqing's Guangdong Province revealed that when the Chongqing government held the Sixth Plenary Session a few days ago, it formally denied the Republic of Outer Mongolia. According to the newspaper, Chongqing will grant Outer Mongolia the greatest autonomy. Since Outer Mongolia formally guaranteed its status as Chinese territory in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1924, the Republic of Outer Mongolia, which was established in 1921, cannot be recognized. It is also rumored that recently, the Chongqing army in Xinjiang Province had an armed conflict with the Cossack army. At a time when the competition between the U.S. and Soviet forces in Chongqing is gradually intensifying, the Chongqing government's formal denial of the Republic of Outer Mongolia is noteworthy.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to information received here, British Minister of State for Middle Eastern Affairs Grick declared in Cairo yesterday that the British government opposes France's proposal to resolve various Middle East issues through a "Five-Power Conference."

### Director Liu of the Economic Bureau Discusses Recent Economic Policies Answers Questions at Press Conference

The 20th press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held at 10:30 a.m. yesterday (the 8th) in the City Conference Room, with Director Liu Xingchen of the Economic Bureau attending to answer questions raised by various newspapers. The details are recorded as follows:

Policy Guidelines

(Question) What are the future policy guidelines for promoting economic administration? (Answer) The economic administration of this bureau is to follow the central laws and regulations and actively promote them in accordance with the intentions of the municipal authorities. The handling of economic bills will only seek to be legal and reasonable. In terms of affairs, it will be agile and rapid, with the aim of gradually bringing the turbulent economic situation into order.

Priority Rationing

(Question) The priority rationing for the second half of March was out of stock and has not been replenished. Is there any hope of recovery recently? (Answer) We are currently discussing with relevant parties to allocate rice. Once we receive it, we will consider the quantity and restore rationing and replenishment separately.

(Question) After the Municipal Goods Rationing Office was abolished and transferred to the Economic Bureau, are there any concrete plans for household rationing in the future? (Answer) We are still actively handling household rationing. All comprehensive rationing certificates Nos. 61 to 90 are being rushed out. Recently, each household flour per certificate with No. 47 comprehensive rationing certificate is one catty, and the price is still 400 yuan. Other items are also being processed at any time. As long as the source is slightly smooth, they can be distributed one after another.

(Question) When can the priority rationing for this period be distributed? (Answer) Rationing can be done as soon as the rice arrives.

Suppressing Prices

(Question) In the past two weeks, the price increase in this city has become more severe. The market prices sold by manufacturers and stores have exceeded the limited price by about three times, which has a significant impact on people's livelihood. What measures does your bureau have to deal with this? What steps will be taken to suppress prices? (Answer) Recently, market prices sold by stores have exceeded the limited price. The police bureau will send economic inspectors to step up the investigation, and those found to be true will be severely punished. Regarding suppressing prices, in addition to strictly assessing and enforcing limited prices, we have also discussed emergency measures with relevant authorities.

(Question) Shops often raise prices without approval, which fuels the price increase. In the future, your bureau can issue a public notice of the limited price for each item, ordering each shop to hang the limited price list of the goods sold in a prominent position to prevent merchants from cheating. At the same time, the industry associations should also be responsible for supervision. Your bureau has not yet implemented this measure. What is the reason? (Answer) Shops should have labels for the goods they sell, indicating the selling price, and the approved price list should be affixed in a conspicuous place in the house. This bureau has repeatedly ordered compliance. In addition to ordering the various associations to be responsible for supervision recently, we have also presented a report to the municipal government for publication. Those who violate the law will be punished. We are currently strictly handling this, and the police bureau is executing it.

(Question) The large cakes and cooked water businesses are closely related to the lives of citizens. Recently, they have illegally raised prices without authorization. What punishment measures does your bureau have for this? (Answer) The police bureau has been strictly investigating and handling the illegal price increases in the large cakes and cooked water industries.

(Question) It is recently heard that there are people who manipulate the purchase of machine ice and have to pay tips every month. How will your bureau deal with this? (Answer) We will send personnel to investigate thoroughly and deal with it according to law.

Strengthening Associations

(Question) What is the situation of strengthening the institutions and personnel of various industry associations? (Answer) Industry associations are industrial and commercial groups whose main purpose is to assist the government in promoting economic policies and seeking the common welfare of the industry. However, most of the people in charge of general associations only talk about business, and they often focus on the convenience of their business and ignore assisting the government in promoting economic policies. At present, the most important thing is to prevent hoarding and suppress prices. However, in order to achieve this goal, the association itself must be sound and must thoroughly understand the business situation of the industry. Therefore, we are actively strengthening the industry institutions, rectifying the selection of responsible persons for the associations, and adding investigation and registration groups to the various industry associations to investigate the import and export of goods of the industry members. This bureau has completed the investigation of the recent situation of the various industry associations in this city and is currently reviewing the situation of each industry and formulating methods to strengthen the organization and improve personnel in order to adjust.

Commodity Registration

(Question) What is the situation of the registration of major commodities? (Answer) This bureau handles the registration and transfer permission of major commodities in accordance with the major commodity list, which includes eight categories: 1. Fiber, 2. Chemical Industrial Products, 3. Industrial Oils and Fats, 4. Rubber, 5. Hardware, 6. Electrical Materials, 7. Leather Raw Materials, 8. White Paper (Poster Paper), and the four principles approved by the Executive Yuan. We presented it to the municipal government and the Ministry of Industry for approval, scheduled registration, and ordered the various major commodity industry associations to transfer it to their members for handling. As of now, the department stores and chemical industry raw material associations have complied with the order and registered with the bureau. Other associations have not yet submitted the registration forms and are being urged to expedite.

Restoring Factory Electricity

(Question) Factories in various industries have been without electricity for a long time, which has greatly affected production increases. Is there any hope of restoring electricity for general industrial use? (Answer) This bureau submitted the electricity consumption survey forms filled out by the factories to the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company in January and March of this year, requesting that they find a way to allocate electricity. However, the shortage of coal is also a fact, and we are negotiating with them on how to handle it.

Soaring Rice Prices

(Question) Recently, rice prices have been soaring. If your bureau can ration household rice on schedule, it would be the most effective way to suppress prices. Does your bureau have this consideration? (Answer) We are discussing with relevant parties.

(Question) Regarding the two measures of "resolutely suppressing the rice price surge" and "actively clearing the source," what is the specific situation of your bureau's current progress? (Answer) Regarding "resolutely suppressing the rice price surge," we have earnestly implemented it with the police bureau to punish illegal rice merchants. As for "actively clearing the source," we are currently working with relevant authorities to make every effort to plan and implement it.

This newspaper immediately issued a check for 15 million yuan from the Fuxing Bank on June 8 and handed it over to Mr. Le to take back. This newspaper paid the association 15 million yuan for construction on May 30. This is the second time, making a total of 30 million yuan paid to the association.

### This Office Allocates Medical Expenses for Blind Child with Appendicitis

### The Ironclad Japanese Mainland Fortress: One Hundred Million Soldiers and Civilians Await a Chance to Annihilate the Enemy

Just as the decisive battle of Okinawa intensifies, the fortification of the Japanese mainland is also nearing completion. What exactly does the fortification of the Japanese mainland entail? This is something many people would like to know. Since the Battle of Guadalcanal, the elite Japanese troops stationed on isolated Pacific islands have often been gloriously annihilated under enemy shelling, bombing, and overwhelming numerical superiority. Moreover, on the European front, the Maginot Line and Siegfried Line, touted as the pinnacle of modern fortifications, failed to achieve their intended effect, and the defensive lines built by the German army on the Eastern Front also failed to defend Berlin. In view of these facts, even though the Japanese mainland fortress is said to be as solid as a rock, to what extent can it withstand enemy carpet bombing or the assault of mechanized units? One cannot help but have doubts. The reporter is also someone who lacks confidence in this regard. However, this unease and fear completely dissipated after inspecting various locations, and I now firmly believe that Japan is as secure as Mount Tai.

Now, I will specifically describe the combat power of the Japanese military and civilians, focused primarily on building defensive works, to refresh the world's understanding and hopefully achieve final victory.

The Interception Posture Has Changed

Here, it is essential to consider the essence of the enemy's combat power. That is, the strength of the American enemy lies in intense naval gun bombardment, large-scale air raids, and superior mechanized equipment.

From Guadalcanal to Okinawa, the consistent American method has been to expend vast amounts of materiel on shelling and bombing, coupled with assaults by superior mechanized units. Therefore, if they can be rendered useless in bombing and powerless in mechanized warfare, the American army will lose all its fighting power and become no different from "clay puppets." To crush a weak and powerless enemy is not difficult, even without understanding Sun Tzu's Art of War. The only question is how to stop the enemy's naval gun bombardment, make their air raids ineffective, and hinder the invasion of their mechanized units. These are not easy problems to solve. However, Japan's interception posture has now changed. No matter how fierce the American naval gun bombardment, how rampant the enemy air control, or how forceful the mechanized assault, it is now possible to completely neutralize them and annihilate them in the mainland interception battle. As for the specific method, it is, of course, the fortification of the mainland.

Mountains, Rivers, Plants, and Trees Are All Fortresses

This fortification is by no means a fragile defensive line based on traditional strategic thinking, but is entirely based on the Japanese army's unique strategy and conception. That is, the fortresses built on the Japanese mainland are not built in specific places or zones, which differs from the Maginot Line and Siegfried Line. Moreover, construction does not require vast materials and labor like European fortresses, and the time required is also short. Therefore, in times of crisis, formidable fortresses can appear in a matter of days, and the positions can be expanded infinitely depending on the war situation at the time. Thus, areas that are not defensive positions today can become complete fortress zones in a few days. In the rapidly advancing modern warfare, permanent fixed positions such as the Maginot Line and Siegfried Line are not only too slow in terms of time, but even if they were on time, they could not be expected to have much effect. The recent European war is a good example of this. But the fortresses on the Japanese mainland can be said to fully meet the requirements of modern warfare. It is said that Toyotomi Hideyoshi once built a castle in one night. In today's battle situation, where every moment is crucial, the fortress engineering designed by the Japanese army is even more meaningful than Toyotomi Hideyoshi's castle construction and is a decisive factor in victory.

Toyotomi Hideyoshi's castle construction differs from the current fortress engineering on the Japanese mainland in three ways. First, the castles built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi were intended to intimidate the enemy and discourage them, so their form was particularly majestic and awe-inspiring, easily recognizable. However, today's Japanese mainland fortresses are completely concealed. In terms of concealment, it can be said that it has reached the pinnacle. Its scale and sophistication are unknowable to anyone other than the designing officers and the troops stationed there. As a result, even staff officers cannot immediately determine where the defensive positions are and where they are not. As for the enemy, even if they send B-29 aircraft to scout day and night, they cannot ascertain the truth.

When the reporter was first brought into this defensive position, what met my eyes was a peaceful rural landscape, with only the clear and beautiful mountains and rivers dripping with new greenery, with nothing suspicious about it. It was only when I stepped on key points of the position that I realized that everything was a terrifying fortress.

Of course, the reporter is an outsider, and there is no way to know the details of the overall appearance of the fortress or the concept of the deployment. But after inspecting the area, I felt that the mountains, rivers, plants, and trees I saw there were all fortresses, all solid strongholds.

In fact, our mountains, rivers, plants, and trees can all be transformed into fortresses, and their construction is extremely easy, so it is by no means impossible to turn the entire Japanese mainland into a fortress.

Secondly, what distinguishes it from traditional castles is that ancient fixed castles had a front, sides, and back, whereas today's fortresses on the Japanese mainland have no specific face. They can become left or right depending on the war situation at the time. To put it more simply, they are flexible in that they can attack when advancing and defend when retreating. Fortification lines such as the Maginot Line and Siegfried Line only faced the front. Once the enemy broke through at one point and bypassed them, they were at a loss. However, the fortresses on the Japanese mainland can overlook all directions. No matter which direction, east, west, north, or south, they can fully exert their power.

An American Invasion Will Necessitate Much Bloodshed

The final point is that, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, they are not restricted by area. This was unthinkable for permanent fixed positions in the past. The fortresses built on the Japanese mainland today can be expanded and moved as needed. Therefore, even if a certain location is surrounded by the enemy, there is no need to worry. In such a situation, it only takes some time and a little work to freely connect with the neighboring strongholds and respond to the new war situation.

In short, when such a mainland fortress is completed, no matter how much material the American enemy invests or how eager they are to carry out mainland operations, it will be difficult to harm a single Japanese soldier or a single farmer. Even if their mechanized units manage to land, it will be difficult to find Japanese soldiers on the ground. On the contrary, they will be subjected to the Japanese army's accurate artillery fire and will bleed profusely.

Underground Fortresses are Unprecedentedly Strong

Next, let's explain why the Japanese army's defensive positions can withstand enemy shelling, bombing, and the assault of mechanized units. Japan's mainland defense works are all deep underground. Among them are large and small trenches stretching horizontally and vertically, as well as soldiers' living quarters, ammunition depots, food stores, water wells, kitchens, bathrooms, barracks, and everything else. On the outside, there are various artillery positions, all connected by trenches. Therefore, even if the enemy battleship's main guns continue to fire fiercely day and night, they will only dig up the surface soil. It has no effect on the Japanese army's underground positions. The situation is similar with enemy bombing. Although air raids can cause damage to cities and factories beyond imagination, it is impossible to attack positions deep underground with even the largest bombs or incendiary bombs.

Even if the enemy's mechanized units are able to land and launch an attack, they have no way of guessing from which direction they will be attacked by the completely hidden underground fortress artillery fire. Even if the Japanese army's weakness is discovered and they are subjected to a strong attack, the design of the Japanese army's fortresses has long taken into full consideration the power of the enemy's flamethrowers and wind, so they are unaffected. Moreover, the fire nets of each position and the interrelationship between adjacent positions are carefully studied and designed by the Japanese army's unique fortress experts, so there are no blind spots in the entire line. Therefore, once the enemy penetrates this position, they will be subjected to intense artillery fire from all directions and will inevitably be annihilated.

What is particularly noteworthy is that in the mainland interception battle, all Japanese soldiers will use the aforementioned underground fortresses as a base, with large and small artillery pieces, not to mention grenade launchers, and will resolutely defend the underground line, launching a brave interception operation and heavily striking the enemy's combat power. This style of fighting is a major leap in strategic thinking compared to the recent ground battles in Europe. The defense works on the Japanese mainland are an unprecedentedly strong formation in the history of world warfare, and there is no precedent for it in the previous Pacific War.

In short, since the Battle of Guadalcanal, the Japanese army's Pacific War has been mainly a war of attrition to buy time. However, as it evolves into a mainland interception battle, its nature suddenly changes, turning into an operation to thoroughly annihilate the American army. Therefore, if the enemy invades the Japanese mainland, the Japanese army's strong defensive line will fundamentally overturn their material warfare strategy, causing them to suffer a decisive defeat. This is as clear as day.

Military and Civilians are United with High Morale

Next, let me introduce the soaring morale of the Japanese soldiers defending the strong positions.

When the commander-in-chief took office, he distributed the following training to all the troops under his command: "Quickly complete strategic deployment. Thoroughly strengthen fortress construction. Precise training." These are the three principles for annihilating the enemy. Today's war situation is as tense as if the entire country of Japan has become a battlefield. Therefore, in order to fully realize the three principles, even those who are killed or injured are disregarded. Those who are injured as a result are all treated as war wounded.

Encouraged by this, all the soldiers worked day and night to desperately promote the operational plan to annihilate the enemy. The morale of the front-line troops is indeed high! In particular, the soldiers who are natives of the local area, from the unit commander down to the private, are all willing to die for the land, and their soaring morale is so high that it reaches the heavens. Such a military, united with the local villagers who have a blood relationship, is powerful enough to crush tens or hundreds of times the enemy's army. On such a front line, the young company commander has a complete style of a lord. He has mastered the art of managing his subordinates and winning the hearts of the people. The elite troops under his command are also very respectable in their magnificent spirit. Once deployed, they will continue the construction of bunkers and trenches day and night, even without special orders. Moreover, for all fortress construction matters, as long as they are shown the basic design drawings, there is no need to supervise them one by one. The soldiers will add their own creative ideas to create good fortresses that exceed expectations.

Countless Ammunition Stored, the Enemy is Destined to Lose

On the front line, company commanders and squad leaders also personally directed the progress of the defensive works, covered in mud. As a result, the work crews working under their command, including medical officers, veterinarians, and even the unit headquarters secretaries, worked shirtless, wielding shovels in deep tunnels, forgetting to eat and sleep.

Here, the lack of materials and labor are all compensated for by innovative methods. Apart from the belief in certain victory, the soldiers have no other thoughts. In their hearts, the first is certain victory, the second is certain victory, and the third is still certain victory! These tense soldiers show no signs of being affected by the unnatural underground trench life. Although they sleep in the trenches, work in the trenches, and eat in the trenches, none of them have suffered any damage to their health.

The reporter was led to visit a certain artillery observation post. According to a non-commissioned officer, "The artillery positions, as you saw during the visit, have soundproofing equipment. A few days ago, we conducted live ammunition firing trials, and there was no reverberation in the trenches. However, because it was a headwind at that time, carbon dioxide flowed into the trenches, but none of the people in the positions were harmed."

Then, he explained to me the various situations of the artillery emplacement. Finally, he pointed to the chart on the wall of the observation post and said, "The enemy's landing craft, various vehicles, and even artillery are all detailed on this chart. In a unified area, we have now transported enough shells to this position to crush thousands of enemy vehicles. We will not waste a single shell!"

Ha ha, the artillery, which only occupies one point of the position, can also destroy thousands of enemy tanks! From this, we can see the spirit of all the Japanese soldiers.

Preparing Everything and Waiting for the Opportunity to Annihilate the Enemy

Observing this, we can see that in the local battles on the Japanese mainland, the cooperation between the military and civilians is close and the unity is sincere. Moreover, there is absolutely no shortage of food, materials, or labor. This is understood by the European countries, so the Japanese military and civilians will never lose their will to fight due to food and economic conditions.

Therefore, the decisive battle situation in Japan is progressing with each passing day and is becoming increasingly strengthened. This makes me deeply feel the greatness of the potential power cultivated by the three thousand years of history since the founding of the country. We have completed our strategic deployment under a strategic posture as solid as a rock, and have deployed a million elite troops. Now, on our mainland fortress, which is destined to win, all one hundred million Japanese military and civilians are burning with fighting spirit, waiting for the opportunity to annihilate the enemy.

### A Diagram of the Political Disputes in Europe and the Near East

Since the end of the European war last month, disputes have arisen from time to time among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union due to competition for power and profits. The main disputes are as follows:

Yugoslavia's recovery of the ports of Trieste and Istria in the lost territory has been opposed by the British and American occupation forces, who have a desire for dominance.

The French army's entry into Syria and Lebanon has been intervened in by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

Iran's request for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to withdraw their troops has been agreed to by Britain and the United States for consideration, but the Soviet Union has not yet replied.

After Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France signed an agreement to separately occupy areas of German territory (Britain occupies the northwest, the United States occupies the southwest, the Soviet Union occupies the east, and France occupies a corner of the west, with the city of Berlin under joint control by the four countries), the Soviet authorities then demanded that the American army withdraw from the Leipzig and Saxony regions, and requested that Britain withdraw from areas such as Lübeck and Wismar in the north.

### Construction Administration Since the Bing Month
— Xu Jidun

Management of Road Administration and Flood Control Facilities

The road administration in various districts of this city has always been considered perfect, but since the incident, the road construction materials have been exhausted, and economic fundraising has been difficult, resulting in the inability to implement maintenance projects and various road administration plans that should be improved as soon as possible. In the past two months, due to the military importance of suburban highways, they had to be repaired in advance, so all the workers were concentrated in the suburbs. Now that the suburban roads can be completed as scheduled, the repair of roads in the city and the implementation of flood control projects in the western district are being planned. How the plan will be implemented can also be described. It is found that the traffic near the North Railway Station in this city has always been very frequent, and today, the width is even more insufficient. Other roads such as the Hongqiao Road in West Shanghai, and Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Datong Road, Great Shanghai Road, and Taishan Road are all major trunk roads in the city. Due to years of disrepair, they are uneven, making it inconvenient for travelers. The Bureau is now planning to actively repair the trunk lines, and has prepared a budget and submitted it to the municipal government for verification.

The terrain of the western district of this city has always been very low-lying, and whenever there is heavy rain, water accumulates into puddles, which is especially easy to cause disasters during the spring floods. The Bureau is now planning to modify the important sections of the district with large-scale ditches and pipes, and to dredge the main rivers to facilitate the discharge of rainwater. It is found that the underground drainage works in this city are actually due to the excessive pressure of houses, the gradual downward movement of the base, and the rise of the water level of the Huangpu River. To talk about a fundamental solution, we must first dredge the Huangpu River, which is a large-scale project. Over the years, a perfect solution has not been obtained, and it is beyond the current financial and material resources. The Bureau is now establishing a fundamental solution in the midst of a temporary solution, with a view to gradually promoting it and gradually seeking a complete solution.

Management of Construction, Gardening, and Other Facilities

The management of construction enterprises is nothing more than reviewing plans. Regarding the review matters, the Bureau has revised the construction regulations to suit the current environment, and the various building permit fees have also been drafted to suit the actual situation, and new fee rates are being submitted to the government for approval and implementation. In the future, illegal buildings will be strictly prohibited.

It is also stipulated that all kinds of construction drawings must uniformly use the metric system in order to unify them. As for planning matters, in view of the importance of war transportation and the evacuation of the population in this city, the Bureau has repaired the bridges in the Shanghai suburban area, such as the bridges on the Xihulu Road from Bridge No. 166 to Bridge No. 135, Bridge No. 15 on the Jialuo Road, the bridges damaged on the Huthai Road from Dachang to Luodian section, the Majing Bridge and Zhuanqiao on the Luobao Road, the bridges damaged on the Suhu Road from Bridge No. 1 on the South Road to the GuPu Bridge, and Bridges No. 7, 8, and 10 on the Shangsong Road. All the plans have been completed, and construction work will be started as soon as the municipal government approves them.

As for the citizens' request to demolish houses, in the past, the malpractices were very deep. At present, the issuance of this license is very cautious. Unless it complies with the demolition regulations, it will not be issued at will.

Regarding the management of gardening, in view of the dense population of this city and the close arrangement of houses, the establishment of parks everywhere is very important. It is found that the parks under the jurisdiction of the Bureau now include Zhongshan, Outer, Hongkou, Tongbei, Daxing, Taishan, Dihua, and Hengshan parks. After the Bureau's efforts to rectify them, the equipment has gradually become perfect. Recently, in order to think about the citizens' physical and intellectual education, animal gardens, sports fields, fishing platforms, children's parks, music stages, and flower beds have been arranged in various parks, so that citizens can not only use them to regulate their body and mind, but also to increase their knowledge.

Inspection Work Facilities

The scope of work of the Inspection Office of the Bureau is roughly divided into three categories: the analysis and refining of sewage, the preparation of asphalt road materials, and the testing and chemical testing of building materials and fuels. Regarding the analysis and refining of sewage in this city, since most of the houses in various districts are equipped with flush toilets, the sewage drawn from the flush toilets contains countless infectious bacteria. The Bureau has set up three plants in the east, west, and north, using the latest, most effective, and most economical refining method to separate infectious bacteria from sewage, and then introduce the clear water into rivers. The refined sludge contains 3% to 6% of light matter and 1.5% to 2.5% of matter, which is a good fertilizer for farmland.

Regarding the preparation of asphalt road materials, the Bureau has set up an asphalt plant and an asphalt chemical testing room to prepare asphalt road materials. The methods are divided into two types: hot method and cold method. The best one is manufactured by the hot method, but the preparation method is quite complicated, and it requires fuels such as coal and kerosene. At the time when fuel is lacking, this method is no longer applicable. Therefore, research on the cold method of manufacturing asphalt sand has been spared no effort recently. The products manufactured by the cold method have achieved very good results, and no fuels such as kerosene are required during manufacturing. Only old asphalt sand is used with a small amount of mineral oil.

As for the testing room and chemical testing room for building materials and fuels, there are several rooms, and each room is equipped with an electric testing machine, a pneumatic machine, a cement testing machine, and various chemical testing machines to test various materials used in engineering, and fuels for automobiles and boilers. In addition to supplying the Bureau with various tests, it also tests samples sent by the outside world.

Measures to Increase Water and Electricity Prices

Regarding the various public utilities in this city, such as electric lights, gas, tap water, telephones, trams, and public buses, in addition to the former eight districts being operated by the French Electric Light and Tram Company, the rest are within the business scope of the Sino-Japanese joint venture company. Citizens have expressed dissatisfaction with the repeated reduction in supply and price increases of the above-mentioned public facilities. The Bureau also believes that this situation affects the lives of citizens and increases the burden on citizens. As the Bureau's responsibility lies, it cannot but rectify them. Therefore, it has been submitted by the municipal government to the Ministry of Construction to determine the Bureau's management and supervision powers. Before receiving a reply, the Bureau has already closely contacted the relevant companies separately. (End)

### Solving the Food Crisis

Part One: Hu Caijuan

The current food crisis has reached its most critical point. The *Shenbao* editorial has repeatedly discussed how to regulate food supply and suppress prices, offering many insightful and thorough warnings. Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's "A Humble Proposal to Solve the Food Panic" and Mr. Luo Han's "Unmissable Countermeasures for Famine Relief" are also direct responses to reality, urgently appealing for action. I believe many readers naturally feel immense sympathy and admiration for these efforts!

However, what practical help do mere sympathy and admiration offer? Although the power to decide ultimately lies with the municipal authorities, we, the common people, face starvation imminently. When even the most basic needs for survival cannot be met, we should break our long-standing silence and offer our opinions to the municipal authorities. This will let them know that a large portion of the population is indeed suffering immensely. Or, more proactively, we can mediate to alleviate the people's distress. Shanghai is considered a cultural metropolis, especially with many intellectuals gathering here after the war. But what are their responsibilities? Are they afraid to speak up during this time of crisis? I hope that many intellectuals and socially conscious individuals, not just those in the news industry, will enthusiastically contribute their opinions. Those with specialized expertise in food procurement should volunteer their advice and offer their services to the city government. Then, under the united and earnest request of the citizens, the municipal authorities will naturally accept the majority's opinions and implement them one by one. This will ensure public safety, strengthen fighting power, and make victory in the Greater East Asia War attainable.

As a housewife and mother of six, I offer the following suggestions, representing the wishes of the majority of the people:

Expeditiously Reinstate the Household Rationing System: The household rationing system has been practically suspended since last autumn. Regarding food, rice has never been rationed even once, and flour has only been rationed four times. For daily necessities, matches and soap have each been rationed approximately twice. Today, the black market price of rice has exceeded 50 yuan. If food rationing can be reinstated, whether rice, flour, or coarse grains, and maintained consistently, hoarders will naturally release their goods and dump them onto the market. The public's morale will stabilize due to the restoration of the rationing system, eliminating the need to anxiously seek supplies on the black market, and rice prices will gradually decrease. General commodity prices will also follow suit, tending towards stability.

Improve the System of Distributing Government-Subsidized Rice: The original intention of government-subsidized rice was to have various guilds distribute it to their members for the use of low-wage workers. However, the result is that guilds, factories, businesses, and other organizations use the subsidized rice for all employee meals, without distributing it specifically to low-wage workers. This effectively saves business owners money on employee meals. Why should the rice obtained by the city government under extremely difficult circumstances be consumed in this way? Therefore, the current system of distributing subsidized rice must be drastically reformed. All centralized allocation to guilds should be abolished, and the large amount of rice saved should be incorporated into the household rice rationing system and distributed on a regular basis. In this way, all low-wage workers will benefit directly from household rice rationing, and the suffering of the people will be greatly alleviated.

Swiftly and Strictly Investigate Hoarding of Goods and Impose Confiscation and Punishment: The soaring prices in Shanghai are largely due to hoarding by unscrupulous individuals. Although the authorities have issued orders and repeated them many times, they have not achieved practical results. How should decisive measures be taken to prevent the situation from worsening and to relieve the people's suffering?

Although the above three points are not exhaustive, if they can be fully implemented, the rising tide of prices can be defeated in the near future, and the citizens will express their sincere gratitude and best wishes.

Part Two: Bangzhu

Recently, prices in this city have risen again in cycles, especially for rice. If this continues unabated and no measures are taken to stop it, the lives of the poor will become unbearable. I will briefly describe my humble opinions below:

(A) Unblock Supply Channels: Although this point is a cliché, it has not yet been realized, which is deeply regrettable. The frequent reports of illegal obstruction by military police along the way are also a major reason for the obstructed flow of supplies. Local officials are undeniably at fault for employing incompetent personnel. It is hoped that measures will be taken to rectify this and enforce discipline, so that goods can circulate, costs can be reduced, and prices will naturally fall.

(B) Suppress Speculation: Although this sudden price increase is due to rising costs in rice-producing areas, it certainly cannot account for a doubling of prices within a few days. There is no doubt that unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the situation, spreading rumors, and reaping profits. These people only know personal gain and disregard the public good, which is extremely hateful. If speculation is not suppressed, not only will the price of rice never return to normal, but other commodities will also be difficult to stabilize. To eliminate speculation, I suggest that officials be sent to secretly investigate and that households be encouraged to report any speculators they find. This concerns the interests of the citizens, and they will be happy to do so. Once discovered, severe punishments should be imposed. When Mayor Zhou took office, he said in his public announcement to the citizens: "In chaotic times, use harsh measures." In this way, speculation may be eradicated, reducing the threat to people's livelihoods.

(C) Distribute Rationed Rice Early: Today, the rice consumed by citizens is largely dependent on black market supplies because there is no hope of household rice rationing. This is also a major reason for the rampant black market rice trade. I do not know why the Commodity Rationing Office is silent, making citizens wait in vain. The urgent task is to find a way to distribute rations early to alleviate the people's distress and to avoid delays in the future, so that citizens do not need to rely on the black market, which will then have no opportunity to flourish.

I hope that the authorities will adopt the above points, and the citizens will be fortunate!

### The City's Fire Hydrants Urgently Need Repair

— Zhu Mingliang

According to the report in the newspaper on the 16th of this month about the fire in Yuyao, "The four fire hydrants on Yuyao Road could not produce a drop of water due to years of disrepair. After searching around, they finally found a fire hydrant in front of No. 1171 Kangding Road at the Jin Situ Temple. However, the hose was not long enough, so they were busy finding a hose. By the time the hoses prepared in each district were delivered, a lot of time had been wasted." In the end, the fire spread and could not be contained, resulting in the most extensive disaster in recent years. From the above, it is clear that the fire hydrants needed urgent repairs. I would like to briefly describe my humble opinions below, to avoid repeating the mistakes and hoping that the municipal authorities will study and adopt them.

Immediately order the fire department to promptly inspect the fire hydrants for damage and disrepair. If any are found, personnel should be dispatched to repair them quickly.

If the fire department has not inspected the hydrants or notified the neighborhood associations to inspect them, each neighborhood association must report to the fire department any damaged or unrepaired fire hydrants within its jurisdiction, awaiting dispatch of personnel for repairs, or, within its capabilities, fund the repairs themselves.

Each district's fire department should keep on hand a number of hoses with lengths equal to the distance between two fire hydrants, to prevent emergencies. Even if one fire hydrant is damaged, it will not cause much disruption.

If the above three points are fully implemented, it will be a small help in the event of an air raid or fire in the future, wouldn't it?

### Bangle

— Hou Qianli

Mrs. He felt heartbroken whenever she thought of that gold bangle.

Indeed, that gold bangle had been with her for twenty years after her marriage. Those dreamlike long years had been filled with countless tears. Apart from her daughter, that bangle was probably her closest companion for over a decade after her husband died.

Earlier, that bangle had a companion. When she brought them as part of her dowry, the pair of bangles were packed in a very delicate box and tied with red and green silk threads. When her mother personally untied the box and put the bangles on her daughter's wrists, when the gold bangles glittered and dazzled people's eyes, would it – and its owner – have imagined today?

Less than five years after her marriage, her husband died. In extreme financial difficulties, Mrs. He very painfully destroyed one bangle and used it to pay off all the expenses, to send away those hideous faces of the creditors. How painfully she destroyed that bangle!

From then on, only one of the pair remained. Mrs. He said:

"No matter what, I can't destroy that bangle again. Even if I have to eat tree bark, I have to keep it." She kept the remaining bangle, but sold off the rest of her dowry. After her husband's death, the few acres of land in her hometown were said to be enough for her and her daughter to live on, but these days, people with land could only sigh when looking at it. She had no choice but to move the furniture she had brought as dowry, piece by piece, out of the house, and when large sums of money were needed, she had to reluctantly pick out one or two pieces from her limited jewelry.

Only that gold bangle, which had lost its companion, was always wrapped in red paper.

"Even if I have to eat tree bark, I have to keep it."

Every time she opened her small handbag and rummaged through it, Mrs. He thought this way.

Of course, she should keep it – not for herself. Mrs. He had a daughter, and she placed all her hopes on that young daughter. She was living for her daughter.

"A-juan," she said to her daughter more than once, "I have no other hope in this life. Your father didn't leave me anything, but I, I can't not think of you. I'll borrow money to send you to school, so that you can make something of yourself in the future."

"Have we paid Uncle Zhang the 50,000 yuan?" her daughter asked in surprise.

"We've paid a total of 48,600 yuan in installments, and I don't know what to do to pay the rest," her mother said painfully. "Fortunately, Uncle Zhang is looking out for your deceased father, otherwise, who would let you bother them twenty or thirty times? You see, things are different with other people. When you try to reason with them a little, they act like it's a huge deal."

"Mom!" A-juan said tentatively, "I'll find a job. There's no point in going to school. Tuition is so expensive. Why borrow money to go to school? Besides, I can earn some income..."

"What kind of job is there to do these days? Besides, going to school is always good. You won't be afraid of not finding a job if you study! Besides, you're about to graduate from high school. Why bother trying to find a job just one year before? We haven't reached the point where we really can't afford tuition."

"Some of my classmates have opened a small school. I can go teach there."

"Why not wait until you graduate? You've worked hard for more than ten years, and you've finally made it to high school graduation. I can't let you complain in the future. Complain that your mother didn't let you study properly."

This lady's stubbornness should be forgiven. She had brought up her daughter with hardship and care, and sent her to school. She placed all her hopes on her daughter. Besides, why was she willing to keep that bangle even if she had to eat tree bark? Did she want to wear it herself? Mrs. He had always imagined that one day, she would also personally untie a delicate box tied with red and green silk threads, and put a pair of bangles on her daughter's wrists, letting that bangle shine brightly in front of many people.

She would keep this bangle until then, and save up some money to make a pair.

However, the house was gradually emptying out. Mrs. He could no longer exchange furniture for rice. She didn't care about firewood and rice. For her daughter, for that little bit of hope, Mrs. He could indeed eat tree bark if she had to. The problem was something else.

A-juan's tuition fees!

A-juan had applied for a scholarship from a newspaper office, and she could always find a way to make up for the insufficient amount. But this time, the difference was really big. The school stipulated that if the tuition fee was not paid by the end of May, she would not have a place in the next semester. This meant that Mrs. He had to pay another 20,000 yuan before the end of May.

Mrs. He wanted to discuss with the principal to pay later, but her daughter advised her not to do that kind of ineffective thing. She went to the homes of some relatives and friends, but before she could even open her mouth, they began to complain about their own poverty. It seemed that the heavens intentionally put all the poor people together. Of course, Mrs. He was too embarrassed to ask them for help, especially since she already owed them money.

"I'll, I'll find a job! I won't go to school!" her daughter said ruthlessly.

"No! Absolutely not! You're only one year away, don't change your mind!" Mrs. He said firmly.

But within a few days, she had to come up with 20,000 yuan. Moreover, within a few days, she had to buy two or three dou of rice, and some people would come to her to settle accounts – for example, the tailor, the sub-landlord, etc. In other words, in these few days, she had to come up with hundreds of thousands of yuan.

Her daughter went out to find a solution. Mrs. He sat in that empty house, sighing at her daughter's pile of books.

The landlady came in, not mentioning the rent, but first shouting:

"Mrs. He! Do you know what the price of gold is today? One million!"

Mrs. He shook her head along with her, indicating that these days were really terrible.

"That's why I say," the landlady said, "these days, whoever has one or two taels of gold will become rich. If I had that little bit of gold, humph! I'm not afraid to tell you, Mrs. He..."

Mrs. He suddenly thought of that bangle.

When she destroyed the first bangle fifteen years ago, she remembered the store telling her that it contained six qian of gold. The remaining one would of course be the same, so it would be worth 600,000 yuan!

Six hundred thousand! With that, everything would be taken care of, her daughter's tuition fees... She would have a way to cope, that bangle would be enough for everything.

But, could she bear to destroy that last bit of property she had?

That bangle, which had been with her for twenty years, which she originally wanted to let accompany her daughter until she was old, which she had once said she would keep even if she had to eat tree bark, could she destroy it now?

She planned to discuss it with her daughter again.

As soon as her daughter entered the door, she told her mother that she had met a classmate on the road, who said that she was the only one who had not paid the tuition fee. If she didn't pay it tomorrow, she shouldn't come to school next semester. Therefore, she was going to tell the school that she would not go to school...

"No, I'll pay!" Mrs. He interrupted her daughter hastily, deciding everything in that instant, "I'll go pay tomorrow, don't go say anything."

"The money?" her daughter asked, puzzled by her mother's excited emotions.

"I'll go destroy that bangle," Mrs. He said heavily.

Her daughter didn't respond, and both mother and daughter's eyes were filled with tears.

That night, Mrs. He and A-juan solemnly took out the red paper package from the handbag. Mrs. He stroked it with trembling hands, stroking it. Her daughter stood beside the table with her head lowered.

"A-juan, if you have money in the future, have another pair made," Mrs. He said softly, "I really didn't expect that even the last little bit of something couldn't be kept."

She felt that she couldn't think about the future anymore. The future, who knew what it would be like. But she felt sorry for her daughter, that even a gold bangle that had been kept for more than a decade couldn't be left for her. However, when she thought that this was for her daughter's tuition and school fees, Mrs. He felt relieved again, and she hadn't let her daughter down!

"This can be considered for her use," she thought, "I finally let her graduate from high school."

Walking out of that pawnshop, Mrs. He felt as if she had lost a heart at the same time.

### Wave

— Huang Sha

There is no cheerful song, my throat seems to be blocked, I would rather bury my passion in silence.

There is no laughter, my innocence seems to be severed, I would rather fill my chest with hatred and confusion.

There is no hope, illusions are nothing more than a fabricated shadow, it is better not to exist at all, and immerse myself in inaction.

There is no heaven and earth, only a line of space that is too narrow and too dark is my own! The world is so vast, why did I fall into this deep abyss of mud?

Unbreakable worries; unsolvable sorrows; the pulse of this era has not yet ignited my own, I would rather be frozen in a sad curse and tear up my original beautiful dreams.

Do not look for love, do not look for leisure, this may only be swallowed by loneliness, my own blood and tears!

Do not seek tenderness, do not trust lightly, this may only be a spring of pain, only a waste of emotion, an erosion of youth.

I am young, but I have the heart of an old man. I no longer admire the happiness of others, no longer envy the success of others, I am only my own everything, everything depends only on my own hands and feet, plus my own reason, but without that childish enthusiasm.

I want to learn to be more mature, to forge myself to be stronger, to see things more realistically, to do things with my feet on the ground, to be tense and enthusiastic, to be busy and running around, to be healthy and stubborn.

The path of youth is ultimately different from that of old age, and also different from that of childhood. It is ultimately the most powerful path of this era. Walking and walking, I will walk the path I have grasped.

I will not be lonely, I will not get lost, I will not sink, because -

Relying on this courage alone, I firmly believe that many aspiring young people of this era are partners, albeit unfamiliar partners, but partners on the same path.

Isn't it so, my sincere friend? Tell me about it!

### Me and Society

— Wu Kunming

I stepped out of the school gates and began to step into society.

The first step into society is, of course, finding a job. With my diligent and dedicated nature and spirit, I thought I would definitely find an ideal position.

So I busied myself, running around in society every day, for my own new life.

Our company intends to hire several employees. They must be hard-working and able to endure hardship, have no bad habits, and will be provided with food and lodging, in addition to a generous monthly salary. Interested parties should send a detailed resume with two recent half-body photos to Box No. ×× of this newspaper. If suitable, we will send a special letter to arrange an interview. Unsuitable applications will be returned. ×× Company

I read this advertisement several times over and over, carefully pondering each sentence. I felt that a golden opportunity had arrived. I have no bad habits, I am able to endure hardship, and "food and lodging provided, plus a generous monthly salary." Such treatment could not be considered bad.

I sat at my desk, picked up my small calligraphy brush, and wrote a letter of self-promotion without hesitation; every stroke on the letter was carefully written. I finished the letter, attached the photos inside, and then carefully sealed the envelope, affixed a stamp, taking a full hour. I placed all my hopes in this letter.

Filled with enthusiasm, I personally dropped the letter into the mailbox. Then I waited patiently at home, paying attention to the mailman every day. A week passed, no reply; ten days passed, no reply; half a month passed, still no reply. I began to suspect that the letter must have been written with the wrong mailbox number, or the post office had lost it.

Another month passed anxiously, and in the end, there was no news at all, as if it had sunk into the sea. Seeing that there was no hope, I gave up on this idea. But one afternoon, during a casual conversation at a friend's house, I finally understood the truth of the matter. It turned out that the company had already hired its staff before publishing the advertisement, and those employees were all friends or relatives of so-called important figures in the company. The advertisement published in the newspaper was merely a superficial formality. In reality, all the letters from a group of unemployed "interested parties" were discarded without even being looked at.

Understanding the stark "truth," I truly admired their cleverness. I had no resentment, no frustration, only hatred, hatred for this deceitful society.

I finally found a job at a trading company as a bookkeeper.

On my first day of work, I happily served with a sincere heart. I encouraged myself, comforted myself. I carefully sat in my chair, carefully held the pen, carefully recorded each number. I devoted my spirit and enthusiasm to this career.

Going out early and returning late every day, life was very disciplined, and entertainment and work were also balanced. Moreover, my daily duties also enriched me with much valuable knowledge.

But, something happened. One day, the company received a shipment of goods worth 800,000. As I was about to record it in the books with the invoice, the manager suddenly ran to my desk, and with a smile, quietly told me to write 1,000,000 in the cash section of the account. After hearing his "polite instruction," I immediately stood up to object. I said that it was clearly 800,000, how could I add 200,000? And the invoice also stated this. If the numbers were changed in the books, wouldn't that be inconsistent with the facts? Whose responsibility would it be if the accounts were audited in the future? But my words were to no avail. He insisted that I write 1,000,000. I argued with him for a long time, and a sense of responsibility and justice led me to the conclusion: I have no reason to do this! So I can't do this. As a result, things came to a standstill. In the end, he became angry, slammed the table, and told me to get out immediately. I am a straightforward person and could not yield like this. I gritted my teeth, and angrily exposed the secret of his intention, and I gave him a great lesson, I destroyed his dignity, tore off his mask, and then I strode out of that trading company.

On the way home, I felt both hatred and pleasure. The pleasure was that I had so boldly lectured a manager, the hatred was for the hypocrisy and meanness of this society.

After these two setbacks, I not only did not become depressed because of unemployment but instead increased my courage to challenge unreasonable things and gained a deeper understanding of society.

Through a very fortunate opportunity, I joined a bank. I never thought that I would actually do this so-called "golden rice bowl" job.

Spinning around in calculators, bills, ledgers, and cash every day, but I didn't feel tired. On the contrary, I was very happy because my life was finally stable here.

A year passed peacefully. In this year, I spent several so-called "once a year" festivals. Every year during the holidays, colleagues were busy buying seasonal items. I curiously asked them why, and they all showed surprised and embarrassed expressions and said to me, "There's no choice! It's for gift-giving." I couldn't help but be stunned, wondering to myself: Is gift-giving really an "unavoidable" practice? But the reality was clearly presented before my eyes. For the sake of their jobs, for the sake of their future, for the sake of winning the favor of their superiors, yes, there was no choice, they had to give gifts.

But, exceptionally, I did not give gifts during the holidays. My stubborn nature forbade me from doing something that "I had no choice" about. I wanted to see what would happen.

The second year began, and of course, the first to come was New Year's Day. As usual, there was some restructuring in the bank: some were laid off, some were promoted, and some were transferred. On the third day of my vacation, I received a letter from the bank. I opened it and, sure enough, as I expected, the bank laid me off for "cost-saving" reasons. Ha! Not even thirteen months!

Tearing up the letter, I felt nothing else. I only had hatred! Hatred for this snobbish society.

Society, a society where gold is everywhere. Is society beautiful? I can't say, I can only sigh.

Everywhere is filled with deception, hypocrisy, meanness, and darkness. There is no place for me to stand in society; there is no place for a young, honest, talented, and spirited "ignorant of the times" young man to stand.

I hate this selfish and self-serving society. I can't get sympathy and help, and all I receive is a series of mocking and contemptuous sneers. Like a lonely traveler in a desert, all around me is a vast desert that disappoints me.

But, I am stubborn!

I am not desperate, I am even more not depressed, I still have a pair of strong arms, I still have a strong body, I still have a rebellious soul. Let the shadows of the past die. Although I have failed, I am still at war with society to see who will conquer whom? I just live so stubbornly, living to turn over a new page in my life.

### Night Watchman's Call

— Zhi Xing

Midnight, boundless darkness. In the vast silence, the mouth of the alley vibrates with a desolate night watchman’s call. Sparsely, it resembles the faint bell of an ancient temple in the remote countryside, spreading heart-stirring sound waves after the drumbeat.

In this lonely midnight, we crave the night watchman’s call. It lets us know that even in this long darkness, there is still the dim lamp of the night watchman, and at the end of the night watchman’s call, there is dawn, which the sleepless yearn for.

### Deception

— Wo Chuan

Spring has arrived. I counted, Lin has been gone for three years.

I remember, at that time, Lin and Li and I became the best classmates because of our compatible personalities.

Li had a wealthy family and was a gentle and innocent young man. Lin, on the other hand, had been drifting outside since he was a child. His gaunt face seemed to be smeared with a layer of desolate wind and dust, but he was younger than Li.

Whenever school was out or during holidays, Li always invited us to his house to play. But I had a quirk, which was that I felt uneasy whenever I went to wealthy people’s homes, so I rarely accepted the invitation. But Lin was the opposite of me, perhaps the years of wandering made him think of the happiness of having a home, not to mention that Li’s home was so warm. In this way, Lin and Li became even closer.

Sometimes under the lamp at dusk, in a small and exquisite room filled with warmth, the three of us sat knee to knee, and casual conversation would burst forth spontaneously. This laughter and conversation would continue until late at night, and I would happily walk home, while Lin would often be asked to stay overnight.

But Lin was a bit proud and unwilling to be treated coldly. After discovering a couple of times that Li’s family seemed to dislike him, he was no longer happy to agree to Li’s requests to stay overnight. And because of his repeated rejections, Li often felt inexplicable disappointment and confusion in his heart.

The reason why Lin was disliked by Li’s family was probably because he was becoming increasingly poor! His complexion became more sallow, and his clothes also became tattered. When Li saw him like this, he often wanted to help him financially, but he rarely accepted. Lin also began to realize that his social class was very different from Li’s. Although he still maintained a good friendship with Li, he was no longer as persistent and enthusiastic as before. He became more depressed and quietly grieved himself.

On the day before the winter vacation, Li invited Lin and me to his house, as if to say goodbye, but Lin still locked his thick eyebrows, looked at us with lifeless eyes, as if he had endless thoughts he wanted to tell us, but he finally didn’t say a word, and finally left very early.

He didn’t come to see us during the winter vacation. We went to his house, but some other people lived there. It turned out that they had moved.

When school started, Lin didn’t come again. Later, we received a letter from him, with only a few words, telling us that he had dropped out of school today.

With one less person among the three of us, the days became more lonely, especially for Li, who completely changed his innocent and carefree habits and was dispirited for a long time. I comforted him, saying that Lin would definitely come to see us soon, but he said with certainty: “Lin is a very stubborn person. When he loves you, he loves you with all his heart; when he hates you, he hates you with all his heart.” I said, “He will never hate us.” Li said, “Just watch.”

However, to Li’s surprise, Lin actually came to his house on a spring holiday.

His eyes were full of red streaks, his cheekbones were high, and his face was covered with the dark shadows of life. He was wearing blue overalls stained with oil, and his arm was wrapped in a piece of black cloth.

“My father died last month. I can’t forget his eyes looking at me eagerly when he died, as if he was instructing me to take on the responsibility of the family from now on. Now I work and earn a little pitiful wage to support my family. I will never have a day like you to study again!”

In order not to make him sad, we all welcomed him happily. We asked him to stay overnight, and this time he agreed very readily.

Li sincerely asked him if he needed some money, saying that a small amount would definitely not be a problem. Lin just shook his head firmly. So Li simply took out some money and stuffed it into his pocket, saying: “If you still acknowledge that I am your good friend, you should accept it.”

He quickly and angrily threw it back to Li, saying with a dignified tone:

“I have no reason to accept your money. I admit that you are my best friend, but there is an invisible membrane between us, and this membrane can definitely not be removed by this method.”

That night, Lin and I both stayed in Li’s bedroom.

But what was strange was that after that day, Li’s attitude towards me suddenly changed. He gradually became distant from me, looked askance at me, and often spied on me in secret. This situation lasted for a month or so. I really couldn’t bear it anymore, so one day I solemnly asked him: “Do you have any doubts about me? Please tell me directly!”

He pretended to be surprised to look at me, and then denied it.

I couldn’t figure out why he suspected me. I racked my brains to reflect on myself, but I still couldn’t get anything. Finally, I thought: Why do I have to get along with you? Since you suspect me, let’s just separate. So we gradually became not good friends anymore. But, one day, Li suddenly ran over and handed me a letter, gasping for breath and saying, “Look, look! Lin would actually do this! …” Then he said to me in a forgiving voice: “Please forgive my past.”

I hurriedly unfolded Lin’s letter, which read as follows:——

“… I am the biggest liar! I deceived the friend who trusted me the most, and I also deceived my conscience! My conscience is urging me every day, and I have to tell you this. That is: on the night of our reunion, I stole your money and ring. Will you be stunned when you see this? Yes, you will never think that I did this, because you have always given me the greatest trust! What words can I use to cover up my ugliness? None! I can only say to you that I suffered from the harm of “pride”! That night you gave me money, how could I not need it? Can I bear to watch my mother and younger siblings cry to me with empty stomachs? However, I look down on money, and I look down on friendship represented by money, so I rejected you. But thinking about the future life, the life locked up in hell, I once again understood the power of money! But since I have already rejected you, how can I open my mouth to you again? Later, I remembered the watch and ring you put under your pillow, and I touched them confusedly and stuffed them into my pocket! … This matter will cause me pain for a lifetime. What good is mere repentance? I cannot ask for your forgiveness, I only hope that you will forget me forever in the long days to come! …”

Oh, so that’s how it is! No wonder Li was so suspicious of me those days?

This is a brand, deeply engraved in Lin’s pure dew.

The facts made me understand: In this unequal society, there are places that people in different positions can never understand each other, even if they are the best of friends.

I still cherish the friendship he gave me in the past; but since then, I have lost him.

It’s the spring of the third year. Will the spring breeze bring me news of him?

### Tomorrow's Charity Soccer Match: How Should White Horse Fight Overseas Chinese Association?

The second charity soccer match to raise education funds, sponsored by the Football Association, will be held tomorrow at the Happy Valley field. It will be a second meeting between White Horse and Overseas Chinese Association. These two teams met during the eighth welfare match. With the superb skills of both teams, it created a heated situation. This time, the two teams bravely fight for the education fund, which is commendable. The great attraction is naturally expected, and the benefits to the education fund are not small!

White Horse Borrowing Troops, Embracing the Determination to Win

Recently, the departure of Sun Jinshun from Shanghai and the injury of Li Yao have affected the strength of the White Horse team. But Mr. Cheng Bo'an, the main backbone of the team, has the determination to win, so he has borrowed Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, and Luo Shoufu from the United Association. The difference between gains and losses is still minimal. At that time, there will be ideal results.

After the White Horse team invited the soldiers from the Liaison, they still lack left-wing personnel, so it is worth studying how to allocate the lineup. My personal opinion is as follows:

White Horse First Lineup

Zhang Zhuang Youren Yongfu Li Yichen

Bang Fu Dai Qing

Lun Zhang Lin'gen Song Sheng Han Longhai

The above-mentioned lineup is considered to take into account both offense and defense. After the vanguard lacks A-Sun and Li Yao, there is always the regret that it is difficult to be complete. In terms of technology, Li Yichen and Wu Qixiang are the only ones. Because the Overseas Chinese Association goalkeeper's skills are extraordinary and his skills are agile. In addition to the feet, they must also have experience, intelligence, and the ability to defend against assassination, so Li Yichen has extremely fast, tricky, and strong feet. Wu Qixiang has repeatedly acted as a winger in the past, and his sprinting power and diagonal shots have excellent performances, and should not be disappointing. The distribution of the central defense line is considered ideal. Song. Xin. Qu. are all good. On the defender side, Lin Gen must retreat. Fortunately, Youren has been in good condition recently, and the old partner will not make much mistakes. With the strength of the central defense line, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Zhang Banglun's skills as a goalkeeper have always had remarkable results, and he can handle it happily, there should be no objection.

White Horse Second Lineup Zhang Wu Qixiang Yongfu Li Yichen Bang Fu Dai Qing Lun Zhang Lin'gen Song Sheng Han Longhai

Mai Youliang

The above-mentioned lineup uses Qi Xiang as a defender to conform to his recent position. Once transferred, or may not be able to catch up, avoid trying, and still kick in the original position, so as to exert its peak performance. And the rear defense is also impeccable. In the position of left wing, there is nothing to do, but to use the young general Luo Shoufu. According to Luo kicking inside forward, there is quite something to be desired. He once tried the left wing, but he was incompatible. I don't know if he can be slightly satisfactory recently?

In general, the above-mentioned two lineups are comprehensive. But the biggest shortcoming of the front line is that on the front line, it is hopeless to get the ball, and the strength is also sufficient. But it is difficult to expect the five forwards of Donghua to cooperate tacitly, and the lens will be inferior.

### Tactical Discussion

Now, in order to hope that White Horse will win again, I will make a brief tactical discussion.

The lineup and application methods of the Overseas Chinese Association seem to be fixed, so White Horse should have a prior plan.

First, let's talk about defense. No matter what lineup White Horse uses, there should be a mutual hint between the left forward and the left defender to prevent the opponent's right forward and right wing. It is necessary to change the style of attack. Therefore, the left side goalkeeper should die, and cut it off. The welcome of the two, and then to prevent their personal vitality, may be obtained. Secondly, the opponent's Tekni center is quite capable of attacking the city. Only the old and tired, I am afraid Tekni will have no way to enter. The Overseas Chinese Association's left forward and left wing are sometimes made up of Ba Ma as the inner forward, Di Pannadu as the wing, and Sheng Yatuomali as the left wing in the chaos. But as a change, neither has the development of expertise, and the situation is also under normal circumstances, and there is not much threat. The most important thing to pay attention to in the defense method is the layout inside the stadium in the residential area. Otherwise, the old general will suddenly use a cold arrow, how can the guest ignore it.

If talking about the way of attack, the reporter has repeatedly said that the Overseas Chinese Association's guard, whether it is the central guard line and the rear guard, is trapped in the rigid method of parallel style. Following the shadow of the ball, it will be front or back. This method is fortunate that its physical strength is sufficient, and there are few loopholes. Otherwise, the enemy's front attack is extremely easy. The way to break it is to use short pass migration more, or make V-shaped and W-shaped advances, then he will inevitably have the worry of forgetting the rear. More than that, White Horse has a special attack method, that is, the use of Longhai's fierce scurry may not be enough to threaten the rear guard with its dull method, that is, the goalkeeper is the most difficult to be overcome. And Longhai at this time on the left side of the front and wing should pay the most attention to standing in the best position to attack the goal. You should use the cover of the Longhai army, and the Young Army aircraft will pick left, sitting and attacking the opportunity. In this way, the Overseas Chinese Association will have no way to deal with it.

The season has entered early summer, and football is not suitable. But the Football Association authorities have made this wonderful competition invitation for charitable purposes, as well as the players' competition in the summer heat, all of which are worthy of our admiration

### Strengthening Friendship and Overcoming Portuguese Merchants

Last Sunday, the friendship and Portuguese merchant football teams played their first match to raise educational funds for the Football Association. Due to a minor dispute between the two teams in the league's A division, the appeal was unexpectedly good. It's a pity that the sun was too harsh for the fans that day. I wonder if future morning matches will be held earlier or moved to the afternoon? Otherwise, I think it might affect ticket sales.

Before the game, everyone thought there would be a very exciting battle between the two sides, even a performance that would raise the standard. The result was disappointing. To put it simply, the friendship team seemed to win as easily as if they had encountered a weak team. Nevertheless, the friendship team finally vented its anger. However, many nervous people may think this was a predetermined plan for both Portuguese merchant team members. I dare not believe it, and I hope it is not true. Now, let's get back to evaluating that battle.

We might as well first look at the points where the Portuguese merchants did not perform well, which is that although they used very well-matched athletes, they did not do it according to the proper method. For example, when central defender Oliveira got the ball, the best opportunity at that time was V. If. Usually, he would have quickly and skillfully relayed it, but that day he insisted on passing it to Vaughn, who was being closely guarded, so everything was over. Their offense and defense looked very hard, but in fact, they accomplished nothing.

Looking at the friendship team's performance that day, no matter what tricks the opponent used, they were always successful. It was clear that Li Yichen, Fei Chunhua, and Xu Wenkui in the friendship frontline all had some unfamiliarity or lack of stamina. But in this battle, all three of them had enough energy. Except for Li Yichen's occasional laziness, of course, scoring two goals against the other team was not accidental. In particular, it was highly possible that the friendship team would win five or six goals that day.

In terms of defense, because the Portuguese merchants did not have the best offense, there was not much effort needed. However, everyone's footwork was clean and their spirits were high, showing the friendship team's revitalization. Wu Qixiang, who had not been seen for a long time and had always been eliminated, showed his heroic posture and powerful shots, which were indeed worth appreciating.

For the sake of cherishing the friendship team's sudden rise and revitalization, let's say a few more words.

In the early stage of this year's league, the friendship team defeated the ambitious Overseas Chinese Union, which excited every domestic fan. Because the friendship team was not doing well last year. In the midst of the fans' distant wishes, the team worked hard to improve, concentrated on accommodation, and practiced on schedule. In this situation, we were looking forward to the team's final success. Unexpectedly, in the subsequent matches, they suffered draws with the German merchants and the Shanghai police. Although victory or defeat is common in military affairs, in fact, the friendship team did not achieve the results that people imagined. By the end, when they had a decisive battle with the Portuguese merchants, it ended unhappily, so everyone sighed. At the same time, they were worried about the future of the friendship team. Unexpectedly, at this time of the season, the team revitalized its remaining strength, reorganized, improved, and worked hard on football, showing the spirit of its heyday. Sure enough, in this battle to defeat the Portuguese merchants, we can be convinced. But I cannot help but hope that they will persist to the end, and their future will definitely be recorded in the history of football. Encourage them! Encourage them!

### Volleyball League: The Situation of the Two Women's Groups in Group A

The volleyball league has been competing for two weeks since it started. Because there are more teams in Group B, and their quality is uneven, there is still little clarity for the time being. However, in the two women's groups in Group A, the first round has been completed, and the great battle of the second round has now begun. To win the championship and fight for fame, there will definitely be a more tense situation. Here is a description of the situation of the women's group A, and a grand outlook for the second round. First, let's talk about Group A.

Group A

In this year's league, the author has already stated in the last issue of this publication that Zhongbei is sure to win the Group A championship. Looking at their performance in the first round, they easily defeated Three Provinces in the first battle, defeated Huayan, and then defeated the White Team, without spending much effort. Then, in the second round, everything will go smoothly, and there will be no problems. As for the runner-up seat, according to the current situation, Three Provinces has a large share. However, the White Team was completely defeated in the first round, but in terms of their strength, they should not be so miserable. There will definitely be unexpected good results in the second round. If the White Team can defeat Three Provinces and Huayan, the situation will change. When Huayan first played against the White Team, they were able to win with the help of foreign generals Gutange and Qiaoqi. After fighting with Zhongbei, only one person, Qi, was seen, and their strength was greatly reduced. When they faced Three Provinces, none of the foreign generals arrived, and it was even more difficult to defeat them. Therefore, in the second round, if there are no foreign generals to help, I am afraid they will not be the enemy of the White Team. If so, the special seat will most likely be taken by the White Team and Huayan.

Women's Group Because there are too few teams, Three Provinces, an old hand, is sure to win the championship steadily. In the first round, they defeated Xinben and Huayan one after another with ease. In both games, their power was not fully displayed. In the second round, Xinben and Huayan will definitely have better results, so Three Provinces may be slightly threatened in addition to winning, so that the team can have more opportunities to perform.

The competition for the ranking of the women's group is only in the battle between Xinben and Huayan in the second round. In theory, since Xinben has already won, they will meet again with the mentality of "he is my defeated general," and they will be able to go straight to Huanglong and compete for the second place. The former should be slightly brave in the three-row and two-corner formation, and there is no need to doubt it. Wang Wuli in the second row should retreat slightly and grab more balls in the backcourt. It is better for them to grab each other without losing than to lose by giving way to each other. If they can do this, it will not be difficult to defeat China. On the other hand, thinking for Huayan, it is also to stand side by side with Xinben in second place, that is, to carry the yellow bag on their backs. Moreover, as a historical team, it is necessary to avenge the defeat to a rising army. Therefore, Huayan hopes that veteran players such as Zhu Wenpei and Zhang Bianyue should all play, and that there should be extremely important work for the scheduling of positions and the receipt of confidential guidance. If not, it is expected that they will be defeated by Xinben again, and they will also be sure to carry the yellow bag this year.

The work efficiency of the cup competition has been greatly increased.

The all-around veteran Lu Hanhou has been busy developing his business since he started running the Zhonghua Table Tennis Room and has been neglecting practice. But once he gets on the court, he still plays with great style, which is also a talent. Lu has decided to serve for the Jiufeng team this time.

### Questions about the Basketball Group B Finals

The finals of the Basketball League Group B were originally scheduled to be completely concluded last month. Unexpectedly, due to the dispute in the preliminary round of the finals between the Pegasus and Zhenyuan teams, there has been no follow-up. It is really puzzling! If the protest filed by Zhenyuan is justified, they should be allowed to replay the game. If their protest is unreasonable, then Pegasus should be declared the winner and play a rematch with the Dragon Army according to the rules. However, the authorities have been silent for more than ten days, making the outstanding teams eager to see through their eyes. (Xundou)
