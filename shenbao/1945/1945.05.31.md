### General Air Attack Continues; Japanese Forces Achieve Great Victory; No Change in Southern Okinawa Island Front Line

Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The general air attack, which began on the night of the 27th, continued on the 28th, targeting enemy ships in Nakagusuku Bay. From 1:00 AM to approximately 9:00 AM, the entire *Shinbu* Special Attack Force, with direct escort aircraft, penetrated the enemy fleet concentrated in the bay, confirming the sinking or damaging of more than four ships. Furthermore, at dusk on the 28th, a special attack force departing from the base also bravely penetrated one aircraft carrier or large cruiser, one destroyer, and four other ships of unidentified types, achieving great results.

Nansei Islands Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – There have been no major changes in the front lines of Shuri and Naha in the southern Okinawa Island area. Japanese air units have continuously attacked enemy ships near Okinawa. From the night of the 29th to the morning of the 30th, continuous attacks have been launched, with successive reports of "penetrating enemy ships" and "all aircraft penetrating." Enemy air raids on the Nansei Islands were limited to only 30 aircraft over Okinawa Island on the 29th, and 60 over Ishigaki Island.

Twenty-One Ships Sunk in Nakagusuku Bay

Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese *Shinbu* Special Attack Force and naval torpedo squadrons fiercely attacked enemy ships concentrated in Nakagusuku Bay, which were urgently resupplying, on the 27th and 28th. According to confirmations from local forces and direct combat aircraft, six ships of unidentified type, thirteen large gunboats, and two medium-sized gunboats were sunk, in addition to numerous columns of fire.

Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Ie Island Airfield, which in the past was mainly used by B-29 type aircraft, has recently seen a small number of medium-sized aircraft. Due to the surprise attack by the Japanese *Giretsu* Airborne Unit on the night of the 24th, F4F "Giant" type aircraft, which lost their bases at the northern and central airfields, appear to be relocating. Only 150 enemy aircraft remain at Ie Island Airfield, half of which are F4F type, and the rest are P-51 type.

### Japanese Garrison Forces Launch Pre-emptive Counterattack; Special Attack Airborne Unit Responds with Fierce Fighting

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Eight days have passed since the several divisions of the Japanese army on Okinawa Island began fighting on the 21st. Under cover of intense artillery fire, a large force of seven divisions (four army divisions and three marine divisions) was concentrated on the front line to launch a persistent attack. The Japanese garrison forces in the area have repeatedly frustrated enemy attempts with skillful pre-emptive counterattacks. Currently, the two armies are locked in a stalemate along the opposing lines, with no major changes. The Japanese garrison forces are tenaciously defending the lines extending from Yonabaru in the east to the south, north of Shuri, and to Naha, continuing their fierce fighting. Furthermore, the *Giretsu* Airborne Unit, which landed at the northern and central airfields on the night of the 24th, has continued its brave and bloody battle while surrounded by the enemy for the past four nights and days, hindering the activities of the enemy base air force. The Japanese garrison forces are also firmly defending their original positions. At the same time, the special attack air squadron, in response to the fierce fighting of the *Giretsu* Airborne Unit, took advantage of favorable weather conditions and launched a heroic and intense attack operation on enemy ships surrounding the island from the morning of the 28th. Due to the fierce fighting of the *Giretsu* Airborne Unit, the enemy has suffered severe damage, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of enemy aircraft intercepted. At the same time, the operational efficiency of the special attack squadron has been extremely good, gradually achieving great results. Due to the skillful and brave fighting of the integrated Japanese air and land forces, the enemy's attempt to control Okinawa Island has been stalled, at least for the past week. The heavy damage suffered on land and at sea is endless, and the anxiety of the enemy's operational command is gradually intensifying. The status of Japanese special attack squadron attacks on enemy ships on the 28th is as follows: Between 7:10 AM and 8:00 AM, a large formation of Japanese special attack aircraft, largely unhindered by enemy fighters, launched a surprise attack on enemy ships at sea around the island, achieving great results. Subsequently, between 7:10 PM and 7:12 PM, a special attack squadron swiftly attacked enemy ships in the eastern sea area. According to reports, one aircraft crashed into an aircraft carrier or cruiser, one crashed into a destroyer, and four crashed into unidentified vessels. Other aircraft also sought out targets and carried out crash attacks.

British Navy Participates in Operations

Nansei Islands Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Due to the intense attacks by the Japanese special attack squadrons, the enemy U.S. mobile force in the Okinawa area, facing insufficient reinforcements, has mobilized the British fleet to be responsible for resupply and escort duties around the islands. The British fleet, extremely fearful of the intense attacks by the Japanese special attack squadrons, has fled the area. Currently, a U.S. fleet with a large number of transport ships has appeared in the area, actively supplementing troops, but due to the inability to land, they are drifting back and forth at sea.

Stockholm (Kyongsong), 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A dispatch from London states that the Polish government-in-exile in London announced on the 28th that the Polish naval forces, under the operational direction of the British Admiralty, have begun operations against Japan.

Ninety Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Raid on Keihin Area

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to an investigation of the results of the Japanese interception of approximately 500 enemy B-29 type aircraft and approximately 100 P-51 type aircraft that attacked the Keihin area on the morning of the 29th, the results are as follows: 20 B-29 type aircraft shot down, 49 damaged; 12 P-51 type aircraft shot down, 9 damaged.

### Ten Maxims for Public Service: Prime Minister Suzuki's Motto

"Bury my old body at the forefront of the nation!" General Kantaro Suzuki, who gave this generous cry, has been Prime Minister for one month, from his appointment to May 7th. During this time, on the front lines in Okinawa and elsewhere, loyal Japanese youth have been building a Great Wall of national defense with their flesh and blood, but the situation in Europe has completely changed dramatically. The world is dancing wildly in this vortex, and Prime Minister Suzuki, stepping on this wave, how has he struggled in this month? In a word, Prime Minister Suzuki is practicing one of his own "Ten Maxims for Public Service," namely: "Let others have the easy things, take the difficult things upon oneself." He must have already been practicing this, but from the moment he vowed to fight alongside 100 million citizens, Prime Minister Suzuki has followed this rule every day for the past month.

On the morning of May 2nd, when he received the information that Hitler had died in battle, Prime Minister Suzuki did not even raise an eyebrow.

"Due to the changes in Europe, the beliefs of the general public must not be shaken. We must advance over the corpses of our comrades!" He used "advance over the corpses of our comrades" to express Japan's attitude toward the death of the head of its allied nation. This is in common with the determination to "bury my old body at the forefront of the nation." The soul of Fuehrer Hitler can be said to have found a confidant in Prime Minister Suzuki.

On the evening of the 2nd, Prime Minister Suzuki seemed to think of something and called his nephew, Secretary Takeshi Suzuki, to open the book "Battleship *Soya*", pointing to a certain page and saying:

"My life of over seventy years has been spent striving for this, and I intend to continue to serve the public in this way."

Self-Authored and Self-Written Ten Maxims for Public Service

That page contained the "Ten Precepts for Public Service" that Prime Minister Suzuki, as commander of the training fleet, had given to young ensign candidates on the "Soya" in the 43rd year of Meiji (1910). They were self-authored and self-written by Prime Minister Suzuki, and the contents are as follows:

One must not change their principles due to success or failure.

Constantly cultivate virtue and refine wisdom, seeking knowledge and insight in everyday matters.

One should be guided by fairness and impartiality, shedding all desire for fame and gain.

One should be guided by harmony and cooperation, always harboring thoughts of love and respect.

One should be consistent in word and deed, practicing before discussing.

One should pay attention to maintaining a healthy body.

One should clearly understand the law and honestly abide by it.

Strictly adhere to one's duties and respect the duties of others.

One should be aware of one's abilities and not be arrogant.

Let others have the easy things, take the difficult things upon oneself.

One should always keep one's heart serene and maintain a calm attitude even in the face of emergencies.

Secretary Takeshi Suzuki respectfully read the ten precepts, and when he reached the ninth precept, "Let others have the easy things, take the difficult things upon oneself," he suddenly understood. This is the belief in public service of the 79-year-old Prime Minister.

"The heart to accept the great command must be here!" Only then did Takeshi Suzuki realize the inner secret of his uncle, General Kantaro. And in order to persist in this war, this old Prime Minister, who claimed to "not understand politics," resolutely fights, which comes from the feeling of "one must not change their principles due to success or failure." Prime Minister Suzuki's "Ten Maxims for Public Service" can be said to be the slogan of the Suzuki decisive battle cabinet without a slogan.

Mentally Strong and Managing Thousands of Affairs

It is well known that Prime Minister Suzuki is 79 years old, but because maintaining a healthy body is also believed to be a path to public service, he is always very energetic. His personal physician recently guaranteed Prime Minister Suzuki's health, saying:

"It is truly inconsistent with his age. His blood pressure is generally around 140, which is similar to that of a young man."

Every morning, he always gets up at 5:00 AM, peruses the newspapers, and reads by the window in the morning breeze. The most recent new book he read was a translation by Lieutenant General Nabetsugu Sakai of "The War Cabinet of Clemenso."

Now, the most important thing in his daily routine every morning is to get dressed and worship the altar. In this altar, nearly a thousand letters donated by various people across the country at the time of the cabinet formation are enshrined. Before the cabinet formation, he used to take walks in short clothes, from his private residence to the Koishikawa Botanical Garden. After moving into the official residence, he can't take walks anymore. This is probably the only sorrow of the old Prime Minister. However, in this cool May, the Prime Minister also comes out for a walk at night. At 7:00 AM, he has breakfast with his wife, and then he deals with important official matters, completely like a busy wartime Prime Minister.

This wartime Prime Minister is respected and loved by those close to him. Prime Minister Suzuki is the "old man" of the family, and is very kind to everyone. The guards at the official residence also say:

"It is truly virtuous. Everyone feels kind and amiable. He takes off his hat to greet everyone he meets, which makes people a little apprehensive. No prime minister in the past has been more amiable."

In addition to sincere integrity, there is also amiability, so this personality radiates warmth. Any cabinet member can empathize with this old Prime Minister and, with him as the center, handle thousands of affairs. When the Prime Minister often orders cabinet members to "listen to the voices of the people," they know that if the voices of the people cannot be reflected in the cabinet meetings, it will break the old Prime Minister's heart, so the cabinet members obey with caution. Listen carefully, listen and act, and act with resolute action. This is Prime Minister Suzuki's policy. The broadcast after the great air raid and after the death of Fuehrer Hitler was not someone advising the Prime Minister to do so, but "to talk as frankly as possible with the people." Moreover, the manuscript of the broadcast was not bothered by the secretary to do it for him, but was written by Prime Minister Suzuki himself. This is also to truly tell his own heart. This matter is certainly taken for granted, but it is very rare.

Since ancient times, the words that Prime Minister Suzuki loved to write were: "Control the air and revitalize the country" and "the sky is wide open." In the future, Prime Minister Suzuki will also be as vast as the sky, "keeping his heart serene," and dealing with emergencies with a calm attitude, without rushing. And Japan's 100 million citizens will also follow this old Prime Minister. (Translated from the May 8th *Mainichi Shimbun*)

Editorial

### The Direction of Japan's Wartime Diplomacy

The characteristic of modern warfare is the comprehensive warfare of all forces. Military, political, economic, diplomatic, and ideological aspects all start from the same motive and move towards the same goal. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, needless to say, is to seek the liberation of the peoples of East Asia. Therefore, the allied nation Japan not only used military force to drive out the old forces of the enemy Britain and the United States, but also used diplomatic means to unite the peoples of East Asia internally and eliminate all international obstacles externally. Although military and diplomacy are expressed in different ways, the diplomatic policy and the military policy are completely consistent. Now the war situation is very urgent, but the direction of Japanese diplomacy is as firm as the will to fight.

It has only been a little over a month since Prime Minister Suzuki formed his cabinet, but in international relations, it has encountered two major changes: The first was the Soviet Union's notification to Japan to abolish the neutrality treaty, and the second was Germany's surrender to Britain and the United States. Although both changes were very important, they could both be foreseen in advance. The former was because the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty was signed in April 1941, and the five-year term would expire in April of next year, and it was necessary to notify whether to abolish it this April. Judging from Stalin's speech on the anniversary of the Soviet revolution last November, it can be predicted. The latter was because the German war situation had been bad for more than a day, and the collapse and surrender had long been expected. And Japan's wartime diplomacy, because of the steady and disciplined nature of the new Foreign Minister Togo, has not felt any wavering or anxiety.

First, because Foreign Minister Togo served as the Japanese Ambassador to Germany from Showa 12 (1937) to 14 (1939), and as the Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 14 to 16 (1939-1941), he is very familiar with the situation in Germany and the Soviet Union, so he can "know the enemy and know himself" and respond to the changing situation with an unchanging policy.

Second, because there is still one year left before the actual abolition of the neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, Japan will definitely fulfill the provisions of the neutrality treaty during this effective year. At the same time, the Soviet Union will not take actions related to international credibility in the last effective year after notifying the abolition of the neutrality treaty.

Third, in the past, because Japan had a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union and a Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, its position was quite difficult. Now that Germany has surrendered to Japan's enemies Britain and the United States and has adopted a final confrontational attitude with the Soviet Union, Japan naturally has the right to act freely, which is very beneficial to Japan's wartime diplomatic position.

Based on the above reasons, Japan's wartime diplomacy, although it encountered these two major changes shortly after the cabinet reshuffle on the surface, actually made the obscure places on Japan's wartime diplomatic future clearer, and Japan's diplomatic policy could be more thorough.

Secondly, between the two changes, and before the opening of the San Francisco Conference, the enemy American President Roosevelt, who had been elected four times, suddenly passed away. This change must have given the Japanese diplomatic community considerable shock and excitement. However, the Japanese diplomatic community, like the soldiers on the front lines, did not reduce their hostility because of the death of the war culprit. Before the San Francisco Conference, the Greater East Asia Ambassador Conference was held in Tokyo, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, making the belief in East Asian cooperation even firmer.

Recently, Foreign Minister Togo convened the ambassadors to China to discuss the operation of the policy towards China. In his instructions, he solemnly stated that "with the progress of the situation, the importance of the issue of Japan's relation with China has been increased. In addition to helping China's unification and completion of its independent, not only seek equality on political aspects, but also seek mutual assistance with economy. To establish a Sino-Japanese intimate relation, Japan must conquer all the obstacle and make it happen because this is related to Japan's ability to overcome the current difficulties." The relationship between China and Japan will therefore become closer, and Japan's diplomatic policy will exert its practical power.

In short, Japan's wartime diplomacy has a definite direction. Whether it is towards China, the Soviet Union, Germany, or the United States, it is completely consistent with the military policy under the highest national policy. It maintains a certain policy in the changes of international politics. To summarize, the victory of Japanese diplomacy is a kind of power to win the total war of Japan, and at the same time, the victory of the total war of Japan is the victory of wartime diplomacy. In other words, the direction of Japan's wartime diplomacy is consistent with the goal of Japan's total war.

### Revision of Provincial Government Organization Law Approved by National Defense Council Yesterday; Profound Expectations for Future Policy Promotion

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Supreme National Defense Council held its 71st meeting on the morning of the 30th and approved many important cases (see the full meeting minutes separately). Among the important ones was the case of the draft revision of the Provincial Government Organization Law prepared by the Ministry of Interior and approved by the 253rd meeting of the Executive Yuan, which was approved in principle and allowed to be implemented first, and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Since the implementation of the provincial administrative organization reform plan, the power of the provincial governor has been concentrated, and departments have been abolished or merged. The distribution of responsibilities and the handling of administrative affairs are not entirely suitable for the current Provincial Government Organization Law. The Ministry of Interior is aware of this and has studied the actual situation of the administration in various provinces, and based on the spirit of the reform plan, has prepared a draft revision of the Provincial Government Organization Law in order to improve the organization and establish a system. The current organizations under the Provincial Government include the Political Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction Departments, as well as the Police Affairs Office. All the work of drafting, reviewing, saving, and dispatching documents and all the contacts between the departments is concentrated in the Political Affairs Department, which causes the responsibilities of the Political Affairs Department to be more burdensome than other departments. Because of the parallel relationship between the department and the office, it is most likely to cause friction between the departments and the office. Now, a Secretariat is established to manage general affairs that do not belong to the various departments, which has profound significance for strengthening the concentrated power of the provincial governor and eliminating the harmony between the various departments in the past. It is also stipulated that the Police Affairs Office and other agencies may be established with the approval of the central government when necessary, and that police affairs shall be handled by the Civil Affairs Department, which should make administrative efficiency more smooth and consistent. Therefore, after this revision, the promotion of provincial administration is deeply anticipated. Also, at yesterday's meeting, the Executive Yuan and its subordinate ministries, commissions, and affiliated organizations' reform plan for the decisive battle period was also retrospectively approved. In fact, the various affiliated organizations that have been abolished and merged are not necessary to exist independently. They not only dispersed manpower and resources, but also had lower administrative efficiency than merging into agencies with similar natures, where power is more concentrated. Therefore, the transfer and merger of the Executive Yuan's Cooperative Enterprise Committee and the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the ordinary administrative personnel training institute, and the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee to the Ministry of Interior, the transfer and merger of the Canal Management Engineering Bureau to the Ministry of Construction, and the abolition of the Administrative Efficiency Promotion Committee and the Ministry of Interior's Baojia Committee and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, are all wise measures.

### Embezzlement Case Occurs in U.S. Gold Supply to Chongqing

Zurich, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington: A scandal has erupted in the United States regarding embezzlement in the supply of gold to Chongqing. It is reported that the decision by Chongqing to raise the official gold price was leaked in advance, allowing Chongqing speculators to reap huge profits in just a few hours. In response to this issue, Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen stated that those speculators would be severely punished. The official gold price in Chongqing was raised from 20,000 yuan to 35,000 yuan per ounce on March 28th, and the leak of information beforehand led to increased purchases. Part of this speculative buying involved the $500 million in gold previously supplied by the United States. This gold was provided by the United States to stabilize Chongqing's currency. Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered a thorough investigation of the incident. The first report has already been submitted, and it is said that its contents are embarrassing to him. Although the details of the incident are well known to the Chongqing authorities, the strict investigation has prevented further details from reaching the United States.

### Authorities Actively Working to Increase Rice Supply; Cracking Down on Merchants Inflating Black Market Rice Prices

Shanghai rice prices have been rising sharply in recent weeks, posing an increasingly serious threat to people's livelihoods. Prices of other essential commodities have also skyrocketed. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry recently came to Shanghai to consult with various parties and decided to take decisive measures to increase supply and stabilize prices. Progress has been made. According to sources, the authorities are purchasing large quantities of grain from producing areas, which will soon be transported to Shanghai in batches. At the same time, they will take strict measures to crack down on merchants who inflate black market rice prices and thoroughly investigate rice hoarding and speculation. The City Commodity Distribution Office will also resume priority rice rations for civil servants of various agencies, and will make up for previous delayed rations. Plans are being made to continue household grain rations. It is expected that rice prices will soon fall.

Assisting Retail Outlets in Selling Household Rice Reserves

The City Commodity Distribution Office, due to the long suspension of household rice rations, has reportedly formulated measures to alleviate the financial difficulties of rice retailers and submitted them to the City Government for approval. The measures involve selling the household rice reserves of rice retailers at low prices on an average basis to each retail outlet to show compassion. The measures are as follows:

Each registered number will be allocated four shi of rice (320 kilograms).

The price per shi is calculated at 30,000 National Currency, deducting the original price of 6,500 yuan. Each registered number must pay 94,000 yuan to the accounting office of this office (regardless of the amount of rice in reserve).

If the rice stored by each retail outlet exceeds the quantity to be purchased, regardless of the amount, the retail outlet must send it to the public sales office designated by this office for verification. The public sales office will collect it and pay back the price (at the original price of 6,500 yuan per shi) and transportation costs (100 yuan per 10 kilograms) to the accounting office of this office.

When retail outlets deliver stored rice, the hemp bags should be taken back after the rice is delivered, and the public sales office will provide bags for storage.

If the rice stored by retail outlets is less than the quantity to be purchased, they should pay the price (at 6,500 yuan per shi) to the accounting office of this office with the delivery order issued by the Second Section of this office, and then pick up the rice from the designated public sales office.

The public fee office should issue a receipt printed by this office upon receiving the rice from the retail outlet.

### Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau Breaks Up Another Gambling Den

The third section of the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau recently received a confidential report that Zhang Zonghan, owner of the Lao Zha Grand Theater at 574 Fujian Road within their jurisdiction, in addition to performing plays day and night, was hosting gambling gatherings nightly after 12:00, with Hong Jiji, a copper treasure gambling expert, as the dealer, on a large scale. Section Chief Song Bingzheng immediately dispatched officers to secretly investigate and confirmed the report. On the 29th, at around 12:00 midnight, plainclothes police officer Feng Shoushan led more than ten plainclothes detectives and officers to the aforementioned Lao Zha Grand Theater. They first sent someone to infiltrate as a gambler, and under extremely meticulous internal and external coordination, they successfully broke up the gambling den. They arrested Zhang Zonghan, the owner of the den, Hong Shouquan, the dealer, and 53 gamblers on the spot. They seized copper treasure gambling equipment and over 400,000 yuan in cash, as well as over 5-6 million yuan in payment slips (which had been torn to pieces). They took them back to the bureau for investigation and interrogation, and temporarily sealed the theater and suspended its business operations.

### All Police Officers Should Strengthen Their Beliefs and Work Hard in Their Positions

Secretary-General Luo Encourages Police Bureau Cadres

Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Luo, at the invitation of the City Police Bureau, gave a speech at 10:00 AM on the 30th on the 8th floor of the bureau to section chiefs below the deputy director and deputy sub-bureau chiefs and above. The main points are as follows:

Regarding the provision of free rice to police officers, in addition to the Commodity Distribution Office actively seeking ways, Director Sugihara is temporarily contacting the Allied military to request a batch of rice, flour, and miscellaneous grains, which, together with the rice borrowed from the Police Confiscation Disposal Committee, will be sufficient to provide free rice for one month to all police officers in the bureau and will be distributed within two to three days. The Finance Bureau's tax revenue has increased substantially after diligent organization, but even with the increased revenue, it is still not enough to cover the ever-increasing expenditures. In the future, after the collection of in-kind land tax from various counties, the rice and wheat collected will be distributed to civil servants and military police as a priority. All police officers should strengthen their beliefs and work with peace of mind. All police personnel should unite, regardless of nationality, eliminate factions, unite in spirit, cooperate with each other, and fulfill the highest mission of the police. The City Government's personnel decisions, assessments, rewards, and punishments are based on ability, integrity, and diligence. In the future, it is hoped that all comrades will perform their duties honestly, abide by the law, and work hard in their positions to serve the local community with courage. The speech lasted for two hours, and all the officers and police were inspired.

Free Rice Distribution Starts Today

The City Police Bureau, in order to improve the treatment of police officers, will distribute free rice to Chinese officers every month. The free rice distribution for the second half of April and the first half of May has been prepared by the bureau's welfare society and will be distributed uniformly starting today. All offices, bureaus, teams, and institutions have been notified to collect and distribute it according to the regulations. However, it must be ensured that the distribution is accurate and in full quantity, and there must be no trickery or deduction of weight. Any violations will be investigated.

Summer Uniforms to be Worn Starting Tomorrow

The bureau, in order to unify police uniforms and enhance appearances, has carefully planned and prepared summer uniforms. The uniforms for all police officers in the city, regardless of material or style, will be completely uniform and will be worn in full starting tomorrow (the 1st).

### Guilds Must Conduct Price Investigations Accurately and in Detail

In order to strengthen the guild system and manage the prices of various industries, the Ministry of Industry has ordered the economic bureaus of various provinces and cities to instruct the guilds of various industries to establish investigation teams within each guild organization to specialize in price investigation and statistics. The Economic Bureau of this city has ordered the guilds of various industries to comply. According to informed sources, the investigation teams of the guilds must be established in fact, and the work of investigating and collecting price statistics must be accurate and detailed. They must also be collected and submitted to the competent authorities within the specified period. If the authorities deem it necessary, they may send personnel to investigate the prices of member businesses, companies, and factories of various industries at any time. If it is found that the prices are inconsistent with the prices investigated, in addition to punishing the business according to law, the chairman of the industry guild will also be held jointly liable according to law. Various guild members have requested the authorities to exempt the chairman from joint liability, but the authorities are unlikely to allow it.

### Theaters and Entertainment Venues Must Still Close at 10:00 PM; Late Business Will Be Punished

In the past, in order to save electricity and adapt to the wartime system, the municipal authorities restricted the operating hours of entertainment venues, requiring them to close at 10:00 PM every night. Later, in order to adapt to the summer season and in response to the requests of various industries, the City Police Bureau revised the regulations to temporarily allow dance halls, cafes, tea rooms, and restaurants in hotels to extend their operating hours until 11:30 PM, but electricity must still be used until 10:00 PM. This has also been announced and implemented. However, it has been found that other theaters, stages, entertainment venues, and various entertainment places have also extended their operating hours without authorization, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the authorities have ordered various sub-bureaus to instruct various entertainment venues, except for the four designated industries such as dance halls, to close at 10:00 PM according to the previous regulations. Late business will be punished.

### Education Bureau Decides to Examine the Academic Performance of City School Students

Director Dai of the City Education Bureau pays close attention to the performance of municipal schools.

The bureau has now assigned several staff members to form a random examination committee to plan the random examination matters, and has formulated provisional measures for random examinations, which have been notified to various secondary schools for compliance. For the primary school section, it has been decided to hold mixed tests, and the competent department has been instructed to prepare measures and appoint personnel to conduct them.

### Ministry of Industry Stipulates Special Power Distribution Measures: Fair Treatment for Both Military and Civilian Needs

In order to show consideration for the general manufacturers in the Shanghai area who need to increase electricity consumption for production, the Ministry of Industry, through the Central China Electric Power Company, previously stipulated and implemented measures for exchanging coal by weight for electricity. Since its implementation, the number of manufacturers utilizing it has been extremely high. However, the handling of coal and the calculation of electricity were not yet perfect and should be revised to promote industrial production. Now, it has been decided to re-draft the measures based on the following three principles, to be implemented starting June 1st:

1.  The methods for submitting coal and the handling of affairs should be made as convenient as possible for manufacturers.
2.  Regardless of military or civilian needs, the distribution of power should be handled fairly.
3.  The method of calculating electricity is changed to exchanging one metric ton of standard coal for 430 kilowatt-hours of electricity.

The detailed conditions are especially valued and of concern to the industrial sector. Here are the details as recorded:

**Special Power Distribution Measures for Coal Exchange for Electricity in the Shanghai Area**

Users who submit coal (including supplementary fuel) for power generation and apply for special power distribution will be handled according to the following measures:

A. Users submitting coal for electricity exchange are temporarily limited to the following industries:

C. Method for Determining Power Distribution:

    (1) The power distribution is temporarily set at 430 "kilowatt-hours" per ton of coal of standard quality.
    (2) When the quality of coal is above or below the standard quality, the power distribution will be increased or decreased according to the following:
        *   When the calorific value exceeds 5,840 degrees, the power distribution will be increased by 2% for every 150 degrees exceeded.
        *   When the calorific value drops below 5,000 degrees, the power distribution will be reduced by 2% for every 50 degrees reduced.
        *   Starting from 30% ash content, electricity generation will be reduced for every 1% increase.

D. Coal Acceptance Procedures:

    (1) When a user applies for coal exchange for electricity, they should fill out an application form according to the format stipulated by the Central China Electric Power Company and submit it to the business department of the company's main office or the electrical branch to obtain its approval.

### A Record of the North China Famous Figures Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition

— Ying Ren

The Xinsheng Hall in Beiping held the "North China Famous Figures Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition" in the Chinese Painting Academy, and has almost exhausted the representative works of famous artists in the north, giving art lovers in the south a rare opportunity to appreciate them.

Qi Baishi, who is well known to southerners, is a master of flowers and insects. The bees, cicadas, shrimps, and crabs he draws are all lifelike. The composition of each object has a shining brilliance, fully expressing the vividness of their posture.

Mr. Chen Banding is a student of Wu Changshuo. He is good at landscapes and flowers. The arrangement is lively and energetic, and the magnificence contains beautiful features. His landscape works are very similar to Shi Tao.

Mr. Pu Xin's calligraphy is magnificent, and the cursive script is continuous, with a sweeping momentum. His landscape paintings are purely Song and Yuan styles. The detailed pavilions in the giant fine works are especially exquisite. He is known as the "Northern Pu." Mr. Xuetang Pu Songchuang are both famous at the time. Mr. Dong Lizeng's small regular script is also worthy of appreciation. There are many other works, and those who love art should not miss this rare opportunity.

Brief Comments

### Strictly Enforce Child Evacuation Laws

The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, in order to awaken citizens to strengthen household air defense facilities, implemented "Strengthening Air Defense Facilities Week" from June 1st to 9th, stipulating that every family should pay attention to preparing fire prevention, disaster prevention, and emergency materials. All of our citizens should try their best to comply with the preparations.

However, we must point out that while future air defense facilities need to be prepared in accordance with regulations, past air defense laws should be strictly observed. If people have failed to implement past laws and the authorities have failed to enforce them strictly, it is very likely to affect the credibility of future laws.

For example, there have been repeated orders regarding light control, and since May 15th, light alert control has been frequently implemented after 10:00 p.m., absolutely prohibiting light leakage. However, in the past half month, during the control hours, there have still been cases of light leakage in high-rise buildings everywhere. We believe that the authorities cannot forgive residents who ignore the law and should strictly enforce the regulations and impose appropriate penalties. If the dignity of the law is not valued at the beginning, it will soon become a dead letter, and then the effectiveness of Strengthening Air Defense Facilities Week will be questioned.

### Buddhist Association Cooperates in Building the Yuyao Road Public Village

Regarding the aftermath of the Yuyao Road fire, the gentry and merchants of this city formed a temporary relief committee, and collectively discussed building a public village to improve the living conditions of slum dwellers and prevent the fundamental solution to future fires. Layman Hu Songnian, a representative of the Buddhist Fellow Association, volunteered to cooperate with the relief committee, each responsible for half of the funds, and build 250 bungalows in the style of the public village built after the Jinjia Lane fire the year before. The construction was entrusted to the original builder. The blueprint was finalized and a contract was signed yesterday at the Fabin Hotel of the Buddhist Fellow Association on Changde Road. Each room costs 500,000 yuan for labor and materials, totaling 125 million yuan. However, the current donations received are still far short, and we still hope that enthusiastic people in society will have compassion for the thousands of disaster victims and generously donate for the sake of benevolence, and quickly provide assistance so that they can observe its completion. All sectors are welcome to donate funds, which can be collected by this office, as well as the Far East Bank on Sanma Road and the Jindebank Bank on Tianjin Road.

The Central Education Morality Association's Relief Work Has Ended

The Charity Committee of the Central Education Morality Association of this city, with the enthusiastic support of major philanthropists, purchased a large amount of cowpeas to provide relief to fire victims in Yuyao Road and Xikang Road, and also held subsidized grain sales for the hidden poor. A total of 3,437 disaster victims on Yuyao Road were given 4 catties of white rice and cowpeas each, totaling 13,748 catties of white rice and cowpeas each. A total of 1,581 disaster victims on Xikang Road were given 4 catties of white rice and cowpeas each, totaling 6,324 catties of white rice and cowpeas each. A total of 4,339 people were approved for registration for the subsidized grain sales for the hidden poor, each receiving 8 catties of grain, with each catty only charged half price at 500 yuan, totaling 35,512 catties of white rice sold. At the moment, all matters have been completed, and the poor people have benefited greatly.
