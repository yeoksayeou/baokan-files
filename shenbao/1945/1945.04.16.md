### Japanese Kamikaze Corps Sorties Day and Night, Continuing Fierce Attacks on Enemy Warships, Sinking and Destroying Numerous Vessels Around Okinawa

Southwest XX Base, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The battle to annihilate the enemy mobile force around Okinawa Island has intensified daily. The Japanese Kamikaze Corps also launched an attack on the night of the 13th. A unit dispatched from the vicinity of Okinawa Island reported: "Attack successful," but the specific results are still unclear. Another Japanese unit attacking the enemy's southern forces on the same island reaped the result of setting three enemy locations on fire. On the afternoon of the 14th, an attack on the enemy mobile force east of Okinawa Island caused one enemy ship to emit black smoke and another to catch fire. Another Japanese unit dispatched on the same day destroyed one enemy large aircraft carrier and set it on fire, causing considerable damage to two other ships of unknown type. Nine pillars of fire were confirmed in the sea south of Amami Oshima.

Central Pacific Base, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the evening of the 12th, the Japanese air force fiercely attacked the enemy fleet near Okinawa Island, sinking two cruisers and damaging two battleships. Later that night, they caught an enemy fleet in the waters east of the island and subjected it to a fierce attack, damaging five warships of unspecified types. They also attacked an enemy fleet in the southern waters, causing eleven ships to catch fire and sinking five of them.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Associated Press reports that the U.S. Navy Department made the following statement to reporters on the 13th: "The brave attacks of the Japanese Kamikaze Corps, confirmed to have begun half a year ago during the battle of Leyte in the Philippines, have been incredibly fierce against American ships during landing operations in Lingayen Gulf, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and elsewhere."

### Okinawa Enters Decisive Battle Phase, Japanese Elite Troops in Major Counteroffensive

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After enemy troops landed on the west coast of southern Okinawa Island and made some progress in land operations, they launched a sudden advance, attempting to break into the main Japanese positions in the south. However, they were met with fierce Japanese resistance, and the enemy's advance was temporarily halted. They then sought another route, deploying a large number of transport ships into the waters off Kadena to actively resupply the rear and reinforce the front lines. In order to open the war situation, they deployed dozens of transport ships and other vessels into Nakagusuku Bay, waiting for an opportunity to strike. However, they were blocked by the Japanese's strong defenses and could only land on Tsuken Island. After that, they increased their forces, attempting to build large-caliber artillery positions. On the 7th, they landed in Nago Bay, attempting to consolidate a foothold in the north. They also coordinated with enemy aircraft and heavy artillery positions built on Kamiya Island, as well as the movements of battleship and cruiser mobile groups, to deplete the strength of the main Japanese positions. The Japanese Kamikaze attack corps, as well as land, sea, and air forces, and naval units, began simultaneous attacks from the 5th onwards, attacking fiercely day and night. Since the beginning of this campaign, it has been confirmed that 326 enemy warships have been sunk or destroyed. After suffering this unprecedented blow, the enemy deployed ship-based aircraft to the Ie Shima area. On the 7th, a total of about 300 enemy aircraft appeared, on the 8th, 500 to 600, and on the 11th, 300. During this period, the enemy's offensive appeared unstable due to weather conditions. The fleet group around the island also gradually decreased, with only a few battleships and other ships seen on the 11th and 12th. Although the enemy's mobile force has been reduced, the enemy has landed tens of thousands of troops since the beginning of the attack on Okinawa Island. This Okinawa operation has claimed occupied areas such as Ie Shima, Kamiya Island, Tsuken Island, and Okinawa Island itself in order to secure land-based artillery positions, heavy artillery positions, and land-based air bases. There is activity of B-24 type and small enemy aircraft at the two airfields in the northern and central parts of the island, and this trend cannot be ignored. However, whether the enemy can secure land-based artillery platforms and airfields before their aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers are destroyed, or whether the Japanese army can annihilate all of their aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers, is related to the entire war situation. But what can decide the situation is the strength of both sides' air power. The battle flag for the decisive battle of Okinawa has been raised. The elite Japanese land forces who have been rigorously preparing in the main positions in the southern part of the island began a major counteroffensive from the evening of the 12th. The Japanese air force also launched a fierce attack on enemy aircraft at the two airfields in the north and center. Today, the war situation has reached its most critical stage. Whether it is Japan or the United States, any hesitation or delay in the front or rear will undoubtedly lead to failure.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from Guam, Nimitz Headquarters announced on the 14th that the U.S. 24th Army Corps on Okinawa Island repelled a fierce Japanese counterattack before dawn on the 13th. According to an Associated Press reporter's report, the U.S. 24th Army Corps has failed to advance a single step for eight consecutive days, which shows how fierce the ground war in southern Okinawa is. This is the largest artillery battle in the Pacific Theater, especially on the 13th, which was the eleventh day.

### Real Situation of Agricultural Loans Handled by the Bank of Communications

â€” Liu Feng

To understand the real situation of rural loans, the reporter was dispatched to the Bank of Communications, which has the best performance in handling agricultural loans. He met with Mr. Zhang Zounong, the head of the Agricultural Economics Department of the bank, who is responsible for promoting this work. Mr. Zhang is an expert in rural economics, and he explained the bank's agricultural loan situation in detail and provided many key points that should be noted when handling agricultural loans. The details are recorded below:

Agricultural Loans Not for Profit

After the Bank of Communications resumed operations in September 1942, it sent personnel to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to investigate the real situation of the rural economy and formulated a policy for handling agricultural finance, including improving the rural economic situation, guiding farmers to establish a financial system and financial institutions that are self-managed, self-owned, and self-enjoyed, supporting the establishment of self-cultivating farmers, increasing agricultural production, and assisting in agricultural improvement and promotion. On May 5, 1943, the Agricultural Economics Department was added to the head office, with Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai as the business areas for the time being. Agricultural economics offices were set up in Jiaxing, Suzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, Dongtai, and other places to guide local agriculture and handle loan investments. Accounting is completely independent, and the business is not for profit. If there is a surplus, it will be listed as an agricultural financial business fund to expand business and reduce loan interest rates. The business fund and initial operating capital were allocated by the bank. Later, the business expansion was insufficient, so in April 1944, a loan of 100 million yuan was borrowed from the Central Trust of China.

Agricultural Loan Targets, Regions, and Numbers

Rural production increase loans were originally designated to rural cooperative organizations, but due to various difficulties, loans were changed to individual farmers. In order to promote this loan, contracts were signed with relevant authorities, banks, farms, and other groups to promote business. As of the most recent loans to individual farmers, the areas are in Yancheng, Dongtai, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Jinxi, Wuxi, Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, Taicang, Wujiang, Songjiang, Nanhui, Fengxian, and Qingpu counties in Jiangsu Province, as well as the suburbs of Nanjing and Shanghai, and Jiaxing, Jiashan, Haining, and Hangxian counties in Zhejiang. A total of 6,754 households have been loaned to increase production. In January 1944, the loan limit per household was no more than 3,000 yuan. Later, due to rising prices, it gradually increased to 5,000 yuan, and recently increased to 20,000 yuan per household. The loan period is based on the harvest period of major crops. Farmers are only required to provide security, and if it is difficult to find security, more than ten farmers can provide mutual joint guarantee. Land deeds or other collateral are generally not accepted, so that loans can benefit poor households and small tenant farmers. However, whether the loan applicant is a truly honest farmer who operates farmland and whether there is a need for a loan is carefully and accurately investigated in advance. When issuing loans, the bank sends personnel to directly issue them to farmers, and for those who have re-loan relationships, the bank also sends personnel to the site to supervise the issuance to show caution and prevent malpractices.

Farmers Universally Recognize the Meaning of Agricultural Loans

The Bank of Communications has been handling agricultural financial business for two years, and it has been operating diligently in various difficult environments, constantly promoting, the area is crystal clear, and the amount of loans has reached more than 160 million yuan, but the expenses are extremely low, and the staff, regardless of the heat, the distance, the amount of travel expenses, and the security, have gone deep into the countryside, investigating the economic conditions of farm families one by one, and issuing loans directly. On average, at least 20 to 30 people are present every day, and the speed of business development is beyond expectations. However, at the beginning of the loan, very few farmers applied for loans. All were afraid of bearing the obligation of loan interest and repayment on time, and there were other burdens, deliberately watching and hesitant to move forward. After a few farmers tried it and found that the bank's loan was purely a good deed, other villagers dared to come one after another. As the news spread, from Yancheng in northern Jiangsu to Hangxian in Zhejiang, applicants for loans flocked in an endless stream. Therefore, in the loan area of the bank, even in remote rural areas, everyone knows about "the Bank of Communications handling agricultural loans." Letters from local government offices, public groups, and money industry representatives transferring farmers to the bank to handle loans in their respective places are like snowflakes. Individual farmers not only repay the principal and interest, but also repay the loans before the due date, with very few overdue, and there are no arrears. It can be seen that in this extraordinary period, rural lending is not as unsafe as imagined, and the creditworthiness of farmers is no less than that of cities.

The Relationship Between Agricultural Loans and Agricultural Production Increase

If we look at the actual effect of the entire loan business of the Bank of Communications, it is better to regard it as assisting in reproduction than assisting in increasing production. At a time when the price index is rising and the purchasing power of money is weakening, the price of agricultural products per mu of farmland in last year's autumn harvest is not even the cost of reproducing the same crops on one mu in this year's spring. Moreover, the rate of increase in the prices of daily necessities exceeds that of general agricultural products. In addition, there are heavy taxes and levies, and the collection of agricultural products at suppressed prices. Farmers are often forced to suppress the price of agricultural products below a reasonable price and sacrifice painfully. Therefore, production is often reduced due to lack of fertilizer, seeds, agricultural tools, cattle, and wages, and even land is abandoned and left barren. It can be seen that it is difficult for farmers to engage in reproduction, let alone increase production. Since the Bank of Communications started lending, farmers have been able to purchase the fertilizer they lack, repair and add to their agricultural tools, and pay the wages for irrigation and harvesting. In addition to avoiding the abnormal phenomenon of "selling green" to make up for the wound, it can also delay the time for selling agricultural products to wait for a good price, and then exchange for the fertilizer and agricultural tools they need, so that they can engage in reproduction, so the effect is very significant.

Mr. Zhang Zounong Provides Advice

Experts in handling agricultural loans and experienced talents are indispensable, but the middle and lower-level staff who have a strong interest in rural work should not be ignored.

The Bank of Communications is handling loan repayment. If half of the loan is repaid in kind, the price of rice will be different in various places in the autumn, and malpractices are easy to occur in the amount, so the issue of integrity is worthy of attention.

The drafting of various detailed rules and the design of forms all take time, so attention should be paid to saving time. As spring plowing is approaching, poor farmers are in great need of funds, and efforts should be made to be swift and avoid various twists and turns.

It is better to lend directly to farmers. The township and baojia organizations are not entirely reliable, and malpractices should be prevented during the investigation.

Farmers are mostly distrustful of agricultural loan work at first, and have a wait-and-see mentality, so workers must carry out patient persuasion work.

It is wise to target rice-producing areas for agricultural loan areas, but the agricultural areas should not be too fragmented to avoid investigation difficulties.

It is best for the government to guarantee the principal and interest to increase people's trust.

### Fierce Fighting South of Mandalay, Japanese Forces Intercepting, Attempting to Stop Enemy Forces Advancing South

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the Japanese army units in Burma withdrew from Lashio, the Burmese war situation has entered a new phase. The current battle line is from Mandalay to the Ledo Road area near Yangon, and fierce fighting is taking place south of Mandalay. After the enemy's newly formed 1st Army invaded west of Lashio, the 50th Division was in the Mamsa area west of Lashio, and the British 36th Division was advancing in the Mongmit area. In the Mandalay area, the 33rd Army attempted to advance south, and the 4th Army advanced south from the Meiktila area. The Japanese army units have completed reorganizing the battle line and re-equipping, and are bravely intercepting. At the same time, the enemy forces advancing south along the Irrawaddy River from the Nyaung-u area are echoing the offensive in the Meiktila area, attempting to invade Yenangyaung. The Japanese army units continue to counterattack, crushing the enemy's attempt to change the direction of the offensive.

Burma Front Base, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The center of the Burmese war situation is gradually moving south from the Ledo Road between Mandalay and Yangon. Before the rainy season, the enemy continued to reinforce troops in the highway area, gradually advancing from the western part of Lashio. The newly formed 1st Army, along with the Irrawaddy River, attempted to advance south to Yenangyaung, echoing the operations on the left and right wings. The enemy forces in the Lashio area have seized the highway between Lashio and Mandalay, and the enemy's newly formed 1st Army is continuing its advance, advancing south along the Laja Highway, and has now invaded Machi, 70 kilometers southeast of Lashio, completing its planned shift. However, the enemy's advance has been blocked by the Japanese garrison's interception, and the enemy's momentum in this area has become noticeably slower. From March 1st to March 20th, the Japanese army inflicted the following damage on the enemy: 1,321 abandoned corpses. Also, the enemy's powerful forces that invaded the vicinity of Meiktila, began a new attack on April 3rd and 4th, advancing south from the Popaywaung area with about 70 tanks as the vanguard. On the 10th, the enemy advanced into the Yemasan area (110 kilometers southeast of Meiktila). The Japanese troops stationed in the area continued to launch fierce counterattacks from the east, west, and south, inflicting great damage on the enemy. The open area south of Meiktila has seen uninterrupted fierce fighting since the beginning of the Burma campaign. The enemy, along the Irrawaddy River, advancing south from the Nyaung-u area, attempted to invade Yenangyaung. The Japanese army is currently deployed along the Sekku-Kyaukpadaung line (30 kilometers southwest of Nyaung-u), continuing fierce counterattacks and crushing the enemy's attempt to advance south. Also, the main force of the 4th Army took advantage of the enemy's weakness and attacked the enemy's rear base at Pipi, destroying five enemy cargo trucks, two gasoline accumulation points, two ammunition accumulation points, and 50 barracks, securing the southwest coast of Ryukei and Akyab Island. Since this spring, the enemy in this area has invaded the coastal area opposite Akyab Island. Part of the enemy forces has gradually advanced into the Taunggok area since late March, and is now advancing into the Arakan-Taunggok area (120 kilometers southeast of Ryukei) in an attempt to advance. The elite Japanese troops have launched fierce attacks on this and inflicted great damage, and turned to the established positions on the eastern highlands, launching fierce counterattacks everywhere, stopping the enemy forces advancing in the rear.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacking Japan Suffer Heavy Losses Since October

Central News Agency News - Today, June 16th of last year, marks exactly ten months since the enemy's U.S. B-29 bombers first raided northern Kyushu, Japan. According to the Navy Information Department here, based on the announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters and its reliable information, an investigation into the enemy's aircraft movements has revealed that the Japanese air defense force has shot down 468 of the 3,712 enemy aircraft that have come to Japan during these ten months, and damaged 929. In mid-March, when enemy aircraft raided Japan four times, 30 were forced to land on Iwo Jima. Based on this fact, it is undoubtedly presumed that at least half of the above-mentioned damaged enemy aircraft crashed into the sea on their way back. Therefore, the total number of enemy B-29 aircraft lost in the past ten months is actually no less than 900. Based on this figure, calculating the loss of personnel and materials, if we assume that the crew of the B-29 is ten people, then there are a total of 9,000 people, and the cost of each aircraft is 600,000 US dollars, then the total loss is 720 million US dollars. Because the enemy aircraft carried out indiscriminate bombing, the damage on the Japanese side is certainly not small, but the enemy's losses are even greater. At the end of last year, the enemy announced that the production volume of B-29 aircraft was 135 per month. Based on this figure, the production volume in the past year is about 1,200 or 300 aircraft. Each aircraft is shot down or damaged by the Japanese side on average after flying only four raids at most. Due to the difficulty of supply, the enemy has now stopped the plan to attack Japan from India or the Chinese mainland, and only takes off from the Mariana Islands base to attack. However, according to a United Press report from Guam on the 14th, the commander of the enemy's 21st Bombardment Squadron, LeMay, claimed that more B-29 aircraft are needed to attack Japan, which proves how significant the consumption of B-29 aircraft air raids on Japan is. It is also extremely important and actually has the intention of encircling Berlin from the north. Its strategic goal is clearly to meet with the Soviet army in Stettin. The development in the Bavaria area has also become apparent. The United States has advanced from the Wurzburg area to the Bayreuth area. Whether General Patton's troops on this road will advance east to reach Prague (the old capital of Czechoslovakia), or turn to the southeast to pass through Nuremberg, FÃ¼rth, and Regensburg, remains to be decided. Therefore, Soviet Marshal Tolbukhin's left wing in Vienna has passed St. PÃ¶lten and is pushing west towards Linz-Regensburg, so its southeast advance also has its possibility.

### Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni Transferred to Military Councilor

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on the 15th that Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, the commander of the defense force, has been transferred to military councilor. According to Prince Naruhiko, after graduating from the Army University, he served as the captain of the 3rd Infantry Regiment of the Military Academy, commander of the 5th Brigade, General Staff Headquarters, commander of the 2nd and 4th Divisions, military councilor and chief of the Air Defense Headquarters. He became the commander-in-chief of the defense force in 1941. During the Sino-Japanese War, he made remarkable achievements in the Battle of Hankou.

### U.S. Forces Close In on Berlin, Only Twenty Kilometers Away, Soviet Army Completes Preparations for Major Offensive

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Radio Luxembourg: Reports that the vanguard of U.S. tank vehicles has now reached a location twenty kilometers from Berlin, but U.S. authorities have not yet confirmed this.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Reuter report: The advance of Patton's army towards the Chemnitz area is a fact of particular importance. The purpose of the Allied Supreme Command is to realize the meeting with the Soviet Konev forces advancing to Silesia as soon as possible, and the actions of General Simpson advancing from Magdeburg towards the Elbe River area and entering the Brandenburg Province from Wittenberg,

### Roosevelt Funeral Held at the White House, Anti-Axis Countries Send Representatives to Attend

Editorial

### Expedite the Organization of Shanghai's Municipal Agricultural Loan Syndicate

The countryside and the city have an inseparable connection. The current decline of the rural economy will have a serious impact on the people and industries of Shanghai, and Shanghai is no exception. In other words, as agricultural production decreases, the supply of food and raw materials needed by urban residents and industry decreases accordingly. As a result, the efficiency of the lives of urban residents and industrial production is directly affected. Therefore, carrying out large-scale work to save the rural economy is indeed a matter of utmost urgency. At present, Shanghai has a large amount of idle capital. If there is no legitimate outlet, it will only become a tool for speculation and profiteering, endangering the social economy. The most important method to save the rural economy at present is to provide agricultural loans and relieve farmers from the pain of high-interest loans. If agricultural loans are provided with Shanghai's capital, Shanghai's idle capital will have a legitimate outlet and will no longer be a speculative tool that disrupts the market. This will not only reduce the abnormal phenomenon of the urban economy but also save the declining and morbid state of the rural economy. The ultimate goal is to promote increased agricultural production so that the food needs of urban residents and the raw material needs of industrial production can be increased and satisfied. Therefore, providing agricultural loans with Shanghai's idle capital is, on the one hand, saving the rural economy and, at the same time, strengthening the city's own economy; in other words, saving others is saving oneself.

Agricultural loan work is not a novel initiative. It has been implemented for a long time in the past. In the past two years, the Bank of Communications has handled agricultural loans in various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces with excellent results. The article "The Actual Situation of Agricultural Loans Handled by the Bank of Communications" published in this newspaper today shows the farmers' urgent need for loans and the relationship between agricultural loans and increased production. Therefore, we feel even more that it is necessary to promote agricultural loan work as soon as possible. Based on the experience of the Bank of Communications in handling agricultural loans, the points that should be paid attention to in handling agricultural loans in the future are explained as follows:

At first, farmers held a wait-and-see attitude towards loans, and there were very few applicants. After a few farmers tried it, they found that it was a well-intentioned act, so they came one after another, forming a situation where even remote rural areas knew about the Bank of Communications' agricultural loans. From this, it can be seen that the meaning of agricultural loans has been widely recognized in rural areas. In the future, there is no need to do any more publicity work, and it can be started at any time.

Farmers can repay loans on time and as agreed, which shows that agricultural loans have established a good reputation among farmers. Farmers are also loyal to the agreement, which will reduce many difficulties in future agricultural loan work and ensure the full use of funds.

In recent years, farmers in various places have been burdened with heavy taxes and levies, and their funds are short. As a result, they cannot obtain sufficient seeds, fertilizers, etc., which are necessary for agricultural production, affecting production efficiency. At the same time, in order to obtain seeds and fertilizers, they have to sell unripe crops to make ends meet and suffer from high-interest loans. With agricultural loans, they can exchange for the necessary tools for production and avoid selling unripe crops and high-interest loans. Therefore, agricultural loans directly contribute to increased agricultural production without any doubt.

The Bank of Communications has handled increased production loans for a total of 6,754 households in more than ten counties in Anhui Province, four counties in Zhejiang Province such as Jiaxing, and several counties in Shanghai, such as Nanhui. Comparing the total number of farm households in the above-mentioned areas with the number of loan households, it can be seen that the proportion of loan-receiving farm households is very small, that is, the number of those who have benefited from agricultural loans is not large. In the future, Shanghai should urgently organize a loan syndicate to handle agricultural loans, expand the scope, and promote the area, so that farmers in various places can benefit universally.

The amount of money lent by the Bank of Communications to each farmer has increased from 3,000 yuan in January of the 33rd year to 20,000 yuan recently. According to the current price situation, the loan amount still needs to be increased. However, the Bank of Communications' total agricultural loan funds are only more than 100 million yuan, which is obviously insufficient. If it is necessary to expand the area in the future, a huge amount of money will be needed, and it is inevitable that a large-scale syndicate will raise a large amount of funds.

We stated in the editorial on the 6th of this month that we should simultaneously crack down on speculation and guide idle capital, and advocated that to crack down on speculation, we must first divert the capital of speculative tools to the countryside. The financial community should be the center, and the Shanghai Municipal Rural Loan Syndicate should be organized as soon as possible to handle agricultural loans in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province. Now that we have seen the actual situation of the Bank of Communications' handling of agricultural loans in the past two years, we feel that it is even more necessary to promote it as soon as possible. We hope that the Municipal Council and the private sector will take action quickly.

Commentary

### Concrete Implementation of Rural Loans

In order to prevent the reckless movement of idle capital in Shanghai and guide it towards production, the issue of rural loans has been raised. This measure can simultaneously save the Shanghai economy and the local economy. It is a two-pronged approach that deserves attention.

It is a well-known fact that Shanghai's idle capital has now lost its normal outlet and is trending towards speculation and hoarding. Turning idle capital into productive capital is the biggest issue for the Shanghai economy, which is very clear and obvious. However, turning idle capital into productive capital is easier said than done. The occurrence of idle capital itself is caused by the economic recession, so it is somewhat reversed to use the recovery of production as a countermeasure. Therefore, the current countermeasure for idle capital must be a new countermeasure. Rural loans can be said to be the most appropriate countermeasure.

Everyone who has contact with farmers unanimously admits how much the countryside needs production funds. Moreover, one can understand the rampant situation of high-interest capital in the countryside. Rural interest rates reach one-tenth per half-year and must be paid in kind. This fact is sufficient to show how exhausted rural finance is and how much farmers need production funds. At this time, several billion funds will flow into the countryside and become farmers' production funds. The contribution to increased agricultural production is undoubtedly great, and it can also complete a very important task in overcoming rural social disasters. Using the capital that causes harmful effects in the city for rural areas and creating constructive effects is the important meaning of rural loans.

The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee is the main body that first proposed agricultural loans and plans to put them into practice. We deeply respect the enthusiastic efforts of the committee members in raising this issue. It is by no means easy to guide Shanghai's idle capital to agricultural finance that does not focus on profits. In the future, difficulties will naturally arise during implementation. For example, farmers can repay half of the loan in kind, which is also a countermeasure that fully considers the investor's position. We hope that the Rice Control Committee and other agencies will correctly recognize this point and provide full assistance. The principle of agricultural loans is feasible, but reducing difficulties in technical aspects depends on the cooperation of all parties. Therefore, we especially hope that all parties will cooperate to realize this loan.

If agricultural loans can be realized and Shanghai's idle capital can make a concrete contribution to agricultural production, the extent to which China's wartime economic system can be strengthened is impossible to estimate today. At the same time, it can also fundamentally eliminate the activities of speculative elements with Shanghai as their lair and the disasters of high-interest capital with the countryside as their base. This can make a great contribution to the soundness of Chinese society. We hope that the promoters of agricultural loans will overcome all difficulties and achieve success.

### Model Team Members of the Municipal Self-Police Corps Hold Spring Review, Commander Zhou Attends in Person and Delivers an Address

The headquarters of the Municipal Police Bureau's Baojia Self-Police Corps held the city-wide Baojia Self-Police Corps Spring Grand Review at the central square of the Racecourse at 9:00 am yesterday (the 15th). The venue was decorated solemnly and the security was strict. Commander Zhou, accompanied by Commissioner Luo, chairman of the Municipal District Baojia Committee, and Secretary-General Gu, attended the review ceremony on time. Other attendees included Deputy Commanders Du Zhengjian and Lu Ying, Deputy Secretary-General Okawa Rinpei, Instructors Hiraoka Isamu and Noguchi Kinjiro, directors of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government, directors of various branches of the Municipal Police Bureau, Chief of the Police Corps Tsukazaki, directors and section chiefs of the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, members of the Municipal District Baojia Committee Lin Kanghou, Zhang Deqin, Xu Jianping, Le Fenghou, Zhou Mengzi, Chen Fukang, and Wu Zhesheng, and members of the Municipal District Baojia Propaganda Committee Chen Binsu, Chen Riping, and Zhang Shankun, as well as representatives from the Allied embassies and consulates and consultant Funatsu, attended the ceremony.

Review Ceremony

The review started on time. After the flag-raising ceremony, the corps flag ceremony was held. The party flag officials marched towards the square in large strides. Chief commanders Xiao Gang and Liu Bingquan reported the number of reviewers to Commander Zhou. There were a total of sixteen units from the cadre training class and various districts, with 145 captains and 6,750 corps members.

Commander Zhou Salutes

### Secretary-General Gu's Speech

Today is the Spring Review of the model team members of the Shanghai Special Municipality Self-Police Corps. We are deeply excited that the Commander and all the leaders have taken the time to attend despite their busy schedules.

The Self-Police Corps of this city was established in haste in the past. Although the comrades of the Self-Police Corps have fulfilled many responsibilities and established many achievements for local duties under various different organizations and institutions, from the overall point of view, without a unified organization and training, the Self-Police Corps still cannot exert greater strength.

Constant Self-Inspection of Spiritual Unity

The headquarters of the Self-Police Corps was announced on September 9th of last year because of the needs of the environment. It began the unified organization and training work, adjusted the organization of the Self-Police Corps in various regions, and connected them together, gradually forming a new atmosphere.

The work of reorganizing the members of the Self-Police Corps in various districts is now coming to an end. At least we have achieved unity in spirit. The issues of clothing and all facilities are also being gradually adjusted. I hope that every comrade has the confidence of unity.

Serving the People and Defending Shanghai

Among the Self-Police Corps comrades, there are many excellent people, especially among our cadre comrades, there are many classmates from various military academies with profound qualifications. They do not seek fame and fortune, bury their heads in hard work, serve the local area, and assist the police bureau in teaching the Self-Police Corps members. Therefore, we absolutely deny that the Self-Police Corps is a "motley crowd", but a great achievement of gathering all the superior forces of the people.

The comrades of the Self-Police Corps are mostly excellent young people who work hard and strive to serve the people. It is indeed a very honorable thing. I hope that the comrades will all be self-respecting and self-improving, and strive for this glory!

Leaders Inspect the Self-Police Corps

### Commander Zhou's Speech

Comrades, I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak to you today. When the review was in progress, I saw that everyone was full of energy and their movements were accurate. They were all full of vitality. I am even more happy. You are just like the sun this morning, with unlimited bright prospects!

Most of you are young professionals with jobs. You are able to use your spare time to participate in self-police and self-defense organizations, work hard, undergo strict training, and engage in difficult work. This spirit of hard work is really admirable!

Recognize the Times and Reflect Intensely

What I want to say to you simply today is: First, we must recognize the times. You all know that the world situation is becoming more and more tense every day. Our own country has not yet completely broken free from the shackles of British and American imperialism and gained independence and freedom. Internally, it has not yet completed peaceful unification. Therefore, we need a lot of efforts in the future. Taking Shanghai, the economic center of China, as an example, all construction and revival also require the double efforts of the citizens. For the survival of the country and the nation, for the revival and construction of Shanghai, we must all reflect intensely, stand at the forefront of the general public, and serve the country and work for the local area.

Take Responsibility and March Forward Courageously

Secondly, I would like to ask you to have the determination to never give up, take responsibility, and march forward courageously. Because we, the people, are the cells of the social country, and you are the strong members of the cells. Therefore, we must take responsibility and serve the country and society. However, no matter what we do, there will inevitably be difficulties and hardships. Because when the war is tense, we must maintain security and air defense and rescue in all aspects with the spirit of hard work and perseverance, grit our teeth, and overcome all difficulties to move forward!

Revive China and Revive East Asia

Thirdly, we must exert our strength and complete our mission. I remember saying before: "The power of spirit and determination can overcome millions of troops." You are all young and promising. As long as we have a consistent spirit and a firm determination, then our strength can surpass everything. At the same time, we also think that the country has reached a critical moment of life and death. Although we cannot directly exert this power to the front line at present, we should start with the self-police and self-defense work that assists the security of Shanghai. To consolidate the rear, and then contribute all our strength to revive China and revive East Asia.

I am deeply grateful for your past contributions to maintaining the security of the market and eliminating thieves. I hope that you will make further efforts to inspire and carry forward, because the construction of Greater Shanghai and the revival of New China depend on your joint efforts.

### Commissioner Luo's Speech

Comrades, I think you all deeply understand the Commander's instructions, and you will be able to put them into practice based on the instructions in the future! Now I will add a few more opinions:

Sacrifice for the Group and Sacrifice the Small Self

First, we must have the spirit of "sacrificing ourselves for the group." We know that "the purpose of life is to serve." People should originally serve the society to seek the welfare of the public. The members of the Self-Police Corps should especially strengthen the spirit of service and have the spirit of "sacrificing ourselves for the group." In other words, we must have the spirit of "sacrificing the small self and taking care of the big self," then the spirit of the Self-Police Corps can be brought to the highest degree, and its strength will naturally be strong.

Be Decisive, Alert, and Strive to Serve

Second, we must have a fair attitude and be decisive in dealing with emergencies. The Self-Police Corps has the closest contact with the people. When persuading and guiding the people's incidents, we must be fair and not be biased, which may cause resentment among the people. At the same time, once we encounter an emergency, we must deal with it decisively and alertly. Now is wartime, and unexpected events cannot be predicted, such as encountering an air raid, etc. When dealing with it, we must use decisive and alert means! Everything must be quick and sure to achieve results.

Work Hard and Complete the Mission

Third, we must achieve unity between the police and the security. The Self-Police Corps is an institution of the Baojia system, and it is also a wing to assist the police. The unity between the police and the security means that the Self-Police Corps and the police are naturally one body, without boundaries, and work together to maintain order and stabilize the local area. This is a way to strengthen the strength. At the same time, "without the unity between the police and the security, we cannot complete the mission that the Self-Police Corps should bear."

Therefore, I am very admirable for your enthusiasm to serve the local area with a spirit of righteousness! But I hope to carry forward this spirit and strive for the country and the nation, and at the same time cooperate in the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

### Deputy Commander Watanabe's Speech

Deputy Commander Watanabe's speech briefly stated: "Today, I am participating as Deputy Commander, and I would like to express some of my thoughts. Looking back four years ago, when I was transferred to work at the police bureau, there was no Baojia organization in the police organization. Later, in order to maintain local security and defend Shanghai, I promoted the organization of Baojia and the Municipal Police Corps. Today's achievements are a great blessing for the good future of Shanghai. In the past, Shanghai was suppressed like a semi-colony under British and American rule, and the police and the people had no contact. Shanghai society became a place of all evils. Since the Baojia Self-Police Corps was established, all terrorist acts, thieves, and adulterers have gradually decreased. This point must be attributed to the efforts of the self-police corps. It has been more than a year since the Shanghai concessions were recovered. In the future, I hope that you will make extra efforts under the leadership of Mayor Zhou to build Greater Shanghai. I am quite pleased with your good achievements today. The current situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the responsibility is very heavy. We should not be afraid of hardships. Recently, enemy planes have come to invade our city from time to time. We should step up our efforts in prevention and take on the responsibilities we bear."

### Last Week's Market Situation

Shanghai's financial commodity market situation suffered violent fluctuations last week due to the continuous evolution of the international situation. Mr. Ogura, the supreme economic advisor of the National Government, came to Shanghai to make a statement, reiterating the determination to eliminate speculation and hoarding. Although the prices of various commodities tended to stabilize, after the news of the death of enemy US President Roosevelt was transmitted to Shanghai, speculative scalpers took the opportunity to use the situation, create rumors, secretly reach out, and frantically become active, and raised the prices of Chinese stocks, black market gold and public bonds, which were regarded as the center of speculation, to an unprecedented peak. According to last week's market conditions, the prices of Chinese stocks, gold, and public bonds were initially slightly stable in the upward trend, but later they surged and continued to advance in the previous week's upward trend. On Tuesday, the international situation became clear, and many rumors had been confirmed to be inaccurate. Speculators on both the buying and selling sides threw and absorbed without restraint, and then immediately turned the rise into a fall, resulting in both rises and falls. On Wednesday, there were suddenly favorable rumors, and those in charge of Chinese stocks and public bonds, gold, and silver soared, and the speculative gains exceeded the usual. Many Chinese stocks also reported a stop-up. On Thursday, the prices of gold and silver in the black market initially declined, and then turned to rise. The stock market and bond market were stimulated by international news, so there were favorable rumors, and the prices soared. On Friday, with the release of the news of the death of the enemy US president, there was still an upward trend at the beginning of the morning market, but then there was a general tragic decline. Chinese stocks fell to the stop-down limit, and there were few inquiries about public bonds. The so-called hot stocks and gold, etc. fell in price, setting an unprecedented record. Then they stepped back to the opening price, and there was no ability to rise again. On Saturday, speculative elements again used the usual trick of creating rumors. For a time, there were rumors of favorable news, and gold soared to a huge 7.85 million, an increase of 1.25 million yuan compared to the previous Saturday's market conditions. Silver also rose a lot, and C-type public bonds rose to 25,000 yuan. Chinese stocks also soared to the stop-up limit. Regarding the market prices of industrial and commercial commodities, they were stable at the beginning and end of the week. Although there was a trend of strengthening and declining in between, there was still no significant

### Brief News

Measures for Self-Installation of Generators: The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that various factories and public places in the city often install engines on their own that do not meet the regulations, which hinders stability.

Disputes over School Rice Distribution and Reporting Procedures: Recently, teachers and staff of various schools in the city often have disciplinary disputes over the distribution of rationed rice, and have sent letters to the Municipal Education Association requesting a thorough investigation. According to the responsible parties of the association, the association will naturally seek a reasonable solution to this issue, but the letters must be filled with the real names and addresses of the reporters in order to have a basis. As for the reporter's name, the association can keep it confidential. Otherwise, anonymous accusations are difficult to accept.

Brief Commentary

### Model Self-Defense Corps

Yesterday, the headquarters of the Shanghai Self-Defense Corps held a spring inspection of the model team members. The ranks were neat, the spirit was full, and the emotions were enthusiastic. It was truly an unprecedented feat.

Most of the model team members of the Self-Defense Corps are working youth who receive training in their spare time. To achieve such results is particularly commendable. This feat is not only unprecedented before the incident, but even at the time of establishing the Self-Defense Corps system, no one would have expected today's achievements. This is due to the efforts of the leaders and participating members, which is worthy of admiration. At the same time, it is deeply believed that after unremitting joint efforts, development and promotion, it will not be difficult to become a strong force for defending Great Shanghai in the future.

Corps Commander Zhou Jian reminded in his speech: The more tense the situation and the more difficult the environment, the more we need to work hard. We hope that all sectors of society will provide all possible support for the Baojia system and the Self-Defense Corps. The members of the Self-Defense Corps also take defending the locality and Shanghai as their duty, quickly taking up the important task of maintaining law and order, achieving self-management and police-like capabilities, and surpassing the police in terms of service spirit, fully demonstrating the ability of self-government.
