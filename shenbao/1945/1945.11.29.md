### Hurley Suddenly Resigns; Marshall Appointed Special Envoy to China; Sino-American Cooperation Will Become Closer

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th, United Press] The White House announced that former Army Chief of Staff General of the Army Marshall would succeed General Hurley as the envoy to China. General of the Army Marshall will go to China as the Ambassador with the status of President Truman's special envoy.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th, Reuters] The U.S. government announced that General of the Army Marshall's succession to General Hurley as the envoy to China is of a temporary nature. He can use this to carry out his special mission. General of the Army Marshall has served as the U.S. Army Chief of Staff since 1939 and was previously the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe. General of the Army Eisenhower succeeded General of the Army Marshall as Army Chief of Staff last week.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] According to the US News Service, Washington, 27th, the US Presidential Press Secretary Ross told reporters this evening that General of the Army Marshall will retain the title of Five-Star General during his temporary special mission.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The new U.S. Ambassador to China, General Marshall, today visited President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes for instructions.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] After Major General Hurley, the U.S. Ambassador to China, resigned, President Truman did not choose a civilian diplomat but chose General Marshall, a five-star general, to succeed Hurley, who only had two stars, indicating that his policy seems to have advanced further. The main task of the U.S. military in China may no longer be limited to disarming the Japanese army. The State Department and the War Department have repeatedly stated in recent weeks that the deployment of U.S. troops to North China is only to facilitate the surrender of the Japanese army and not as a tool of U.S. foreign policy. Before Hurley resigned, U.S. policy toward China was closely reviewed due to the risk of the U.S. military being drawn into the Chinese civil war. Therefore, when the new ambassador, General Marshall, travels from Washington to Chongqing to take office, President Truman can obtain new information on the Chinese situation from two aspects. One is that Under Secretary of the Navy Gates has returned from the Far East and will arrive in the U.S. capital soon. Gates told reporters in Pearl Harbor that he would submit proposals to the President that would affect U.S. policy toward China. The second is that President Truman's personal representative, Locke, who came to China on an economic mission, has also departed from Chongqing to return to China after a two-month investigation. According to reports from Chongqing, General Marshall can make a decisive decision on whether the U.S. military should remain in China.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] After U.S. Ambassador to China Hurley resigned, President Truman immediately appointed General Marshall as the special envoy to China. Washington officials said that this move shows that the U.S. government attaches great importance to resolving the disputes in the Far East. Republican Senator Capehart of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said: "General Marshall will be able to resolve the Chinese situation immediately, and his appointment will surely be passed unanimously by the Senate. Marshall is the most outstanding and capable leader in the country, and President Truman could not have made a wiser choice. It can be asserted that General Marshall will succeed in this trip." Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming said that he had not yet received an official announcement and therefore did not want to comment. This time, Hurley's resignation and Marshall's succession came in quick succession, shocking people in the U.S. capital. According to the White House, Hurley's sudden resignation was unexpected, and Marshall's appointment will carry out some special work that is currently needed in China. It is expected that Marshall will set off for Chongqing to take office in the near future. Under Secretary of State McDermott told reporters that Hurley had expressed his intention to resign yesterday, and Secretary of State Byrnes persuaded him to change his mind and return to China to resume his post. Hurley had already agreed. Byrnes visited President Truman this evening, and the State Department and the Joint Army and Navy Liaison Committee also met today to determine U.S. policy in the Far East.

### Hurley Issues Resignation Statement; Criticizes U.S. Foreign Policy; Supporting the Warmongering Group is No Different from Destroying Democracy; Suggests Public Announcement to Help China Seek Stability

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] After resigning as U.S. Ambassador to China, Hurley issued a formal statement accusing the United States of using Lend-Lease materials and the nation's reputation as tools to end the war in the Far East, aiming only to support imperialism and communism, which is no different from destroying democracy. The professionalized U.S. foreign policy is biased toward the Chinese Communist Party and imperialist groups, causing internal division in China. U.S. professional diplomats have repeatedly told the Chinese Communist Party that my policy of supporting the National Government does not represent U.S. policy. Although our authorities have a clear definition of the U.S. goals, they often go against them when dealing with foreign affairs. At the beginning of our declaration of war, we called for the maintenance of the Atlantic Charter and democratic principles, but the way of fighting is contrary to the professed democratic principles. The weakness and incompetence of American diplomacy has caused the country to be involved in war twice, but it still does not know how to change. Now a third world war is brewing, and I absolutely uphold the principles of democracy and freedom. During World War I, we declared that democracy must be able to exist safely in the world. During World War II, these slogans were also seen in the Atlantic Charter and the Tehran Declaration. Although both wars resulted in victory, the principle of fighting to the end has never been established. U.S. diplomats, due to internal divisions, have been exploited by other countries, who have taken our material assistance with sweet words and secret promises. The war that is now brewing does not even take the protection of democracy as its principle and purpose. The United States not only cannot back up the United Nations Charter, but also actively supports the imperialist group, and a large part of the U.S. State Department advocates universal support for communism, especially the Chinese Communist Party. Hurley then stated that the U.S. activities in Asia should have expanded publicity, especially in China and other countries where he has served for the past four years. There should be more real publicity in many aspects so that there will be no misunderstandings about us abroad, and the most important thing is to make the diplomatic and economic policies of the United States consistent. We should use the strength of the country to support the United Nations resolutions, and never support conflicting doctrines and warmongering groups.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] After resigning as Ambassador to China, Hurley suggested to the State Department that it publicly announce its policy toward China and "clearly state that the United States will stabilize China until the United Nations organization can take responsibility." At the same time, he congratulated General of the Army Marshall on his appointment as a special envoy to China, believing that this appointment "will be of great benefit to the situation."

For Mr. Hurley

### General of the Army Marshall, Special Envoy to China

[Drafted by this newspaper's data room] General Marshall, who is known throughout the world, has now been appointed as the special envoy of the United States to China. It is indeed an unprecedented initiative in American diplomacy for a military officer of the rank of five-star general to be sent as an envoy to a foreign country. This point is especially worthy of our attention.

General Marshall just resigned as Chief of Staff last week, and he has been hailed as "the person who led the United States to victory." His full name is George Catlett. Marshall. He was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania on December 31, 1880, and is already 65 years old this year.

This is not the first time that he has been ordered to China. During the Chinese National Revolution from 1924 to 1927, he was also ordered by the War Department to come to China and served as the commander of the 15th Infantry Regiment in Tianjin. Therefore, he has a very deep understanding of the process and success of the Chinese Revolution.

He was the first person to receive this special honor when the United States established the five-star general rank on December 16 last year, when he was launching the final attack on Germany. The establishment of this military rank by the U.S. Congress is unprecedented in American history, and the reason for giving this military rank to General Marshall is to reward this great military man with appropriate honors for his achievements for the country.

After the United States was dragged into the war on December 7, 1941, General Marshall formed an expeditionary force that traveled across the Eastern and Western Hemispheres and six continents. In addition, he also created air transport divisions, parachute units, and bulldozer units. These new units were things that military personnel had never dreamed of before. In the Allied Joint Chiefs of Staff, he supported the armies of other United Nations countries fighting around the world, made brilliant contributions, and promoted the early collapse of the Axis countries. His brilliant achievements have made the U.S. Army today a thoroughly modernized military force. Marshall's name and his outstanding leadership will be immortalized in history.

During the war, he maintained close cooperation with Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, and overcame the various difficulties caused by the vastness of the Pacific in the war against Japan. He used his outstanding ingenuity to transport reinforcements, weapons, and supplies from the United States through long transportation lines to their destinations according to plan, advancing from the Central Pacific to recover the Philippine Islands, and finally forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally to the Allies, completing its historical mission and laying the foundation for establishing lasting peace in the world in the future.

He is the most beloved leader of his subordinates. Brigadier General Piersons, Congressional Liaison Officer, once said that General Marshall "is indeed the most suitable person I have ever known to hold a military position in a democracy." Whether it is the Senate or the House of Representatives, whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, everyone places complete trust in General Marshall and no one needs to testify for him, because he is extremely cautious in his dealings, has no personal ambitions, and can accept the opinions of others, so everyone believes that he is a symbolic figure who guarantees American security.

Although he is the most famous military man in the United States, he is not a graduate of West Point, because when he took the entrance exam at the age of seventeen, he could not find a Congressman to be his guarantor, so he was rejected. As a result, he went to the Virginia Military Institute to realize his military aspirations. He did not obtain a degree in Uniontown either. In his freshman year at the military school, he was only ranked 35th, and when he graduated, he was only ranked 15th. After graduating from the Fort Leavenworth Staff School in 1906, he began to join the army. Later, he was transferred to the Philippine Islands. When he held an exercise to defend Manila, he wrote to General Bell (Chief of Staff from 1906 to 1910) to state his defense plan, which was appreciated by Bell, who believed that he was a rare staff talent. At the end of World War I, he transported 600,000 people in France in two weeks without any losses, which was praised by General Pershing. After the armistice, he served as an aide under General Pershing for five years. In 1937, he was promoted to Brigadier General and was appointed as the Commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade. In 1938, he was transferred to the War Plans Division of the General Staff. In the spring of 1939, President Roosevelt promoted him to Acting Chief of Staff. On September 1, 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland, he was appointed as Chief of Staff and awarded the rank of Four-Star General. On November 26, 1944, President Roosevelt awarded him the Oak Leaf Medal, and on December 5, Congress passed his promotion to Five-Star General. After the end of World War II, he requested retirement due to old age, and his resignation was approved last week.

### Special Envoy Marshall's Arrival in China Will Surely Be Welcomed by Our Government and Public

Ambassador Wei Daoming Visits Truman [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 pm on the 28th, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Deputy Minister Liu Kai. The main questions and answers are as follows:

Q: Ambassador Hurley has resigned, and General of the Army Marshall has been appointed as the special envoy. What is the reaction from the Chinese side? Has the official heard about the date of General of the Army Marshall's arrival in China? A: Ambassador Hurley is a true and great friend of China. It is regrettable that Hurley has resigned. General of the Army Marshall is a famous American general of our time. His arrival in China as a special envoy will surely be welcomed by our government and the public. President Chiang has invited General of the Army Marshall to visit China several times, and he is confident that President Chiang's meeting with Marshall will be very pleasant. As for the exact date of General of the Army Marshall's arrival in China, I have not heard anything.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming expressed his regret upon hearing that Major General Hurley had left his post as Ambassador to China. Wei also said: "Hurley made great contributions to promoting closer relations between China and the United States. The new Ambassador, General Marshall, will surely strengthen the close relations between the two countries in peacetime."

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] According to the US News Service, Washington, 27th, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming visited President Truman today to discuss general issues in the Far East. He told reporters afterward that China did not intend to ask the United States to assist in resolving China's domestic problems. He told reporters at the White House that the current situation in China has "more clamor than gunfire" and believes that it can eliminate general disagreements "peacefully."

### Xiong Shihui, Chiang Ching-kuo, etc., Await Opportunity to Return to Changchun

National Army Less Than 300 Li from Shenyang

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 28th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters, and Chiang Ching-kuo, Special Envoy for Northeast Foreign Affairs, are now waiting for a flight to Peiping and then to Changchun. Other receiving personnel are also preparing to depart. As for the receiving personnel returning to Beiping, some have already returned to Changchun. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has requested to jointly develop Northeast minerals and other economic undertakings with our country. The reporter inquired about the matter from Zhang Jia'ao today. Zhang replied that the Soviet Union did not make such a request, and the rumors are inaccurate.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 28th] The Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters has moved to Xingcheng along with the advance of the National Army.

[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] According to authoritative sources in diplomatic circles today, an agreement has been established between Chongqing and Moscow allowing the National Army to use the Shenyang and Changchun airfields to quickly travel to the Northeast by air. It is reported that the National Army has passed Miyun and is advancing toward Gubeikou. According to this agreement, Chinese officials can immediately return to Changchun to receive the areas they had previously withdrawn from due to the threat of the Communist Army. Military sources said that the National Army stationed in Beiping will be the first batch of National Army to be transported to the Northeast by air.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 28th] The National Army has entered the three eastern provinces and is reportedly less than 300 li from Pan Yang. According to reports received here, Communist Army Commander Zhu De has arrived in Shenyang to arrange defenses and prepare for a fierce battle with the National Army. The reporter inquired with the Peiping office of the Northeast Security Command but was unable to confirm this statement.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 28th] It was announced here that the National Army arrived in Jinzhou on the 26th, and there are still about 100 Japanese aircraft at the county's airfield. Also, the Beining Railway is now open to Jin County.

### China and the United States Sign Contract to Build a Large Sluice Gate to Develop the Yangtze River Conservancy

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Secretary of the Interior Ickes announced that the U.S. authorities have signed a contract with the National Resources Commission of China, under which U.S. engineers will formulate a plan to build an unprecedentedly large concrete and steel-reinforced sluice gate in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to control the water and save tens of millions of residents in the Yangtze River basin from the perennial ice disasters and famines that have occurred for centuries. The water stored in this sluice gate can also be used to generate electricity. The Chinese government will pay US$500,000 as a technical assistance fund. At the same time, the plan is scheduled to build multiple other sluice gates and excavate thousands of miles of canals for irrigation and other facilities. All planning is supervised by Savage, an American sluice gate design expert, who spent several months in China in 1944 studying the Yangtze River Conservancy plan. The development of this plan will take 25 years and includes a plan to build the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. The sluice gate will be able to control the water and improve navigation. In the future, ocean-going vessels may be able to sail directly to Chongqing.

### Political Consultative Conference Representative Zhang Zhizhong Stays in Dihua; Wu Tiecheng Appointed Instead

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 28th] Zhang Zhizhong, one of the Kuomintang representatives to the Political Consultative Conference, is currently dealing with the problems of the Kazakh and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and cannot spare time to return to Chongqing to attend the meeting. It is reported that Wu Tiecheng has been reassigned to fill his seat.

### Wedemeyer and Barbey Fly to Chongqing to Meet with Chairman Chiang to Discuss Sino-American Military Affairs in North China; Locke Goes to Tianjin and Will Return to Shanghai in the Short Term

[United Press, Shanghai, 28th] U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Barbey and U.S. Forces China Commander Lieutenant General Wedemeyer flew to Chongqing together today to consult with Chairman Chiang. Barbey has been staying in Shanghai for several days since being appointed Commander of the Seventh Fleet. Last weekend, he and Paulley, President Truman's personal representative responsible for reparations, were in Chongqing. It was also announced here that Vice Admiral Barbey's flagship, the USS Estes, is now in Qingdao and will soon sail to Qinhuangdao, where Barbey will go to personally direct the ship's activities in North China. The trip of these two American generals to Chongqing today seems unexpected. Although their mission is unknown, it is clearly related to the U.S. military in North China. Brigadier General Locke, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in North China, has also consulted with Barbey here.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer and Vice Admiral Barbey, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, arrived in Chongqing from Shanghai at 4:30 pm on the 28th.

[Central News Agency, this city] General Locke, Commander of the US Marine Corps in North China, left Shanghai yesterday (28th) to return to Tianjin. After arriving in Shanghai, Locke met with General Wedemeyer, Commander of the China Theater, General Stratemeyer, Commander of the US Air Force in China, and General Barbey, Commander of the US Navy in China. According to Locke, he and Barbey talked for several hours, but the content was not convenient to disclose. Locke also said that the situation in Tianjin is not very peaceful, and there are no pedestrians on the streets after nightfall. After Locke and his Chief of Staff, General Wootton, return to Tianjin this time, they may come to Shanghai again in the near future.

### Editorial: The US Changes its Ambassador to China

Yesterday, news from Washington D.C. stated that US Ambassador to China, General Hurley, has resigned. General Marshall has been appointed as President Truman's special envoy to China to succeed him as ambassador. Another report stated that General Marshall has agreed to undertake a special mission for the US President. Simultaneously, after resigning, Ambassador Hurley issued a formal statement, saying that US foreign policy has been hindered by certain career diplomats. This seems to be the reason for his resignation. Various news reports, up to the present, have been vague and do not provide a basis for judgment. However, before this change of US Ambassador to China, there must have been deep discussions on China policy. The fact that President Truman has specially appointed General Marshall, who has just retired as Chief of Staff, to succeed General Hurley, gives us strong confidence that the US policy towards China, which it has always adhered to, will not only continue consistently but will also be implemented more vigorously.

First of all, we deeply regret that Ambassador Hurley has resigned and will not return to China. Sent by the late President Roosevelt, Mr. Hurley initially had a special mission, which later changed to being ambassador. His enthusiasm and perseverance in assisting China to achieve victory, promoting an agreement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and hoping that China would embark on the path of democratic and peaceful reconstruction, were widely acknowledged by both Chinese and foreign observers. Although our country has now won the war and the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to convene, the National Government's work of accepting surrender has not yet been fully completed, and economic reconstruction is just beginning. Mr. Hurley, however, suddenly resigned and will not return because his ambitions could not be fully realized. We feel like we were gradually entering a better situation, but a good friend has departed. Fortunately, his successor is General Marshall. General Marshall is not only a military genius, but also has an outstanding and constant flow of ideas. He is by nature frank and sincere, taking pleasure in understanding and helping others. His contribution in building the US continental army to safeguard global democratic politics is particularly admired worldwide. He is now sent to China with a special mission. We greatly admire President Truman's ability to recognize and appoint talent, and we particularly admire and welcome General Marshall's willingness to accept this new mission at this time.

US foreign policy is inherently clear, and its policy towards China is especially consistent. President Truman's Navy Day speech on October 27th provided a detailed elaboration. His grand vision of maintaining world peace and opposing any aggression will be relentlessly pursued with a strong military force. In the Far East, he will undoubtedly be pleased to see a strong, prosperous, and democratic China, working hand in hand to share the responsibility of maintaining peace. There is no need for us to elaborate further on this. However, since Ambassador Hurley has recognized the weakness of the US diplomatic authorities and believes that the failure of US policy in Asia is the reason for his resignation, at this time of change of envoys, it would be somewhat beneficial to express our views on Sino-US relations and frankly say a few words to our US allies.

When the great powers attempted to carve up China, John Hay put forward the Open Door Policy, preserving the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. This laid the initial foundation for US policy towards China. Later, during World War I, Japan attempted to gain a unique position in China. Therefore, after the end of the war, the United States convened the Washington Conference, reaffirming the policy of guaranteeing the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. Japan disregarded the sanctity of treaties, attempting to create a deceptive "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" by force, which directly conflicted with US national policy, ultimately leading to World War II. Therefore, supporting a China with complete territorial sovereignty should be the backbone of US Asian policy. To be friends with the Chinese people, it is necessary to assist the National Government, which is universally supported by the people. Therefore, supporting the National Government should be the core of US policy towards China. Former Secretary of State Hull recently stated: "(1) Our solemn obligation is to cooperate with China and preserve its territorial integrity. (2) We have always been friends of China, and China has a population of 400 million. (3) We support international cooperation and the policy of seeking peaceful solutions to international disputes. (4) As early as 1936, we declared that one country's act of aggression is inextricably linked to the interests of all countries. We could have retired to our homes, but I do not want to face you today by recounting what will happen after we retire." This clarification of the US position is extremely frank.

The Three Principles of the People in China are somewhat in line with the American democratic tradition of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. The nation-building efforts of the Chinese people are to establish a new China with complete territorial sovereignty, prosperity, happiness, and embracing the democratic spirit of Western Europe. In this arduous task, the Chinese people hope to receive full support from the United States. This is just as the United States received support from revolutionary France in its early days of nation-building. The difficulties China encounters in its nation-building work are just like the difficulties the United States encountered in its early days, so only the United States can truly understand. In the current stage of China, although our political democracy has not yet reached the ideal state, this is precisely the goal of all our current efforts. In the social aspect, the democratic customs of the Chinese people are essentially no different from those of the United States. Therefore, the Chinese people have always regarded the United States as a friend. It may not be an exaggeration to say that there is no greater harmony of genuine feelings between peoples than between the Chinese and American people.

The traditional friendship, coupled with the profound alliance of fighting side by side to defeat the enemy this time, makes the relationship between China and the United States extremely close. Although armed conflict in the Pacific has ended, the war is not completely over. Although current US policy may inevitably encounter some obstacles, as Ambassador Hurley said, the US policy towards China adopted by the US government to date is generally approved by the Chinese people. This policy is to maintain and support the National Government led by Chairman Chiang, and to assist the National Army in accepting surrender and taking over territories. We know that the Chinese should strive to help themselves, but at the same time, we also know that the US military's execution of this task is based on its own position. The enemies of China are originally the enemies of the United States, and the United States has the obligation to assist China as an ally. Unfortunately, those who incite rebellion are hindering the National Army's work of accepting surrender and taking over territories. They hope to do whatever they want, obstruct the National Government from completing the task of accepting surrender and restoring local order, and even fabricate rumors that the US military is participating in China's civil war, hoping to confuse the public and achieve the goal of withdrawing US troops. Today, we want to point out that this kind of ulterior motive cannot represent the opinion of the majority of the Chinese people. Our US allies will surely see through it. Should the US troops currently stationed in China immediately retire to their homes? One only needs to see if the Japanese troops have been completely disarmed and sent back to their country. It would be unwise to fail to examine the facts and want to return to the old path of isolationism.

In short, based on the traditional friendship between China and the United States, and based on the traditional national policy of the United States, the Chinese people hope that after General Marshall arrives in China, the United States will be able to strengthen its support for the National Government. This is not only China's only legitimate government but is also supported by the majority of the Chinese people. What the Chinese people hope is to realize their ideals of nation-building under the National Government. In this arduous task, we need the cooperation of our allies, especially the United States, which shares similar ideals of nation-building. We deeply believe that General Marshall, for the sake of the consistent national policy of the United States, will be able to fulfill our wishes and prepare to write a precious page in Chinese history and in human history.

### War Production Bureau: Expediting Closure

[Chongqing (Central News Agency), 28th] Weng Wenhao, Director of the War Production Bureau, stated: The bureau is currently expediting its closure, which is expected to be fully completed by the end of this year. Work that is time-sensitive and cannot be completed immediately will be transferred to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

### Period for Exchanging Puppet United Reserve Bank Notes: Four Months; Prices of US Dollars and Gold Fall in Beiping

[Beiping (United Press), 27th] It has been officially announced here that the deadline for the public in North China to exchange "United Reserve Bank Notes" for legal tender is set at four months, calculated at a rate of five to one. The Central Bank and its affiliated banks will be the sole exchange agents, with the period running from January 1st to April 30th of next year. "United Reserve Bank Notes" not exchanged after the deadline will be considered waste paper. Today, the market price of US dollars fell from 1,060 legal tender to 850 legal tender. The price of one tael of gold bars fell from 60,200 legal tender on Monday to 59,000 legal tender.

### Representatives of British and French Governments Hold Talks in London; Exchange Views on Colonial Issues; British Government to Announce Policy on India Soon

[Paris (Reuters), 28th] The British and French governments simultaneously issued a communique stating that representatives of the two governments recently held talks in London on colonial issues. Laurentie, Director of Political Affairs of the French Colonial Ministry, recently went to London to exchange views with the British Colonial Ministry on administrative and technical issues related to colonial territories. Both sides intend to continue these talks and maintain closer cooperation between the two governments on various issues such as refugee camps in West Africa.

[London (Reuters), 28th] Lord Lawrence, Secretary of State for India, and Mr. [missing name], Under-Secretary of the Department, are likely to announce policy on India over the weekend, simultaneously in both Houses. Interest in the Indian issue has been strong recently as Indian leaders make frequent statements due to elections. The British government's previous announcement of policy on India was made by Mr. [likely Attlee] and the Viceroy of India, three months ago, after the British General Election.

[Saigon (Reuters), 28th] French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Mr. d'Argenlieu, spoke to French sailors in Saigon yesterday, expressing great hope for resolving disputes in North Vietnam, and stating that order in Cochinchina is gradually being restored.

[Saigon (Reuters), 28th] French authorities announced that French troops near Tri An in northern Saigon, in the usual way, [destroyed/cleared] an Annamese village, whose residents had attacked a French platoon, resulting in the deaths of two French officers and one sailor. According to official French sources, conflicts between nationalist factions in northern Vietnam are frequent, and the French have banned gatherings of a non-specific nature.

### British Conservative Party Impeaches Government, Criticizing Inappropriate Post-War Measures

[London (Reuters), 28th] The British Conservative Party today submitted a motion of impeachment against the Labour government in the House of Commons. Signed by Conservative leader Churchill and others, the motion states that the Labour government has neglected its primary responsibilities and failed to concentrate its efforts on several urgent and important tasks, such as converting war industries to peaceful industries, solving housing problems, rapidly reducing male and female soldiers, and minimizing treasury expenditures. The House of Commons considers this extremely regrettable. At the same time, ministers in various government departments, misled by socialist theories, plan to launch a nationalization program for enterprises, which seems extremely inappropriate for industrial and commercial activities and greatly contrary to national interests.

House of Lords Begins Foreign Policy Debate

[London (United Press), 27th] The British House of Lords will debate foreign policy today and tomorrow. At today's meeting, both Conservative and Labour Party members supported US control of the atomic bomb, but requested that countries reduce suspicion and make the non-reservation of atomic bomb secrets a condition. During the debate, members of both parties deeply regretted the secrecy and [suspicion] towards the Soviet Union. Viscount Cranborne regarded it as [splitting] Asian power, dividing two cultures. Cranborne said, "As a Conservative [Lord], I do not expect to be compatible with the Soviet system. However, no one in any party does not hope for friendly relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the new situation between Western countries and the Soviet Union caused by the atomic bomb makes us particularly regretful."

### Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Organization Progressing Smoothly; Report on the Transfer of League of Nations Work Opposed by Representatives of Soviet Union and Australia by Vote

[London (Reuters), 28th] The Technical Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Organization today discussed the Executive Committee's report on the transfer of League of Nations work. The report was opposed by representatives of the Soviet Union and Australia by vote in the Executive Committee, because it contained the meaning of mutual succession between the old League of Nations and the new United Nations. At today's meeting, several speaking committee members held hopeful views, believing that most of the differences in opinion were a matter of wording, such as using phrases like "re-implementing activities" instead of "transfer," which could be avoided. The Preparatory Committee is being held in the Westminster Church Room. The impression of reporters this morning was that the group meeting stage of the Preparatory Committee's work has made a good start and is progressing very smoothly. The Eight-Member Committee also discussed general issues related to the United Nations General Assembly and further suggested the location of the permanent headquarters. Representatives from cities wishing to be the location of the permanent headquarters, who have been contacted, are already on their way to London. Those who cannot send representatives have already contacted by written means.

Chairmen of Various Subcommittees Designated

[London (United Press), 27th] Today, the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Organization elected representatives from Uruguay and Abyssinia to be responsible for the highly contentious Eighth Technical Committee, which will study the [suitable] location for the [UN] organization. The reason for [selecting] the representative of that country was that their [headquarters] dispute was not involved. Uruguayan representative MacEachin will serve as chairman, and Abyssinian representative Netetine will serve as vice chairman. The Chinese representative praised Abyssinia when electing its representative, stating that the country "firmly upheld the collective security system in its darkest days." The Preparatory Committee also elected Greek representative Agnides as chairman of the Sixth Committee, and New Zealand representative Kang [missing character] as [co-]chairman, responsible for various issues related to administration and budget. As for the Seventh Committee, which is responsible for handling issues related to the League of Nations, its chairman and vice chairman will be held by Syrian representative Aminazi and Turkish representative Beyazkle respectively.

[London (Reuters), 28th] Sir Mudaliar, leader of the Indian Anti-Representation Delegation, was unanimously elected chairman of the Three-Member Committee by the Preparatory Committee today, to much applause. The task of the Three-Member Committee is to establish the Economic and Social Council and handle the relationship between the United Nations Organization and special agencies.

### American Women Study Industrial Design

Before the United States entered the war, home furniture and equipment were mostly designed by men. After joining the war, many men were transferred overseas for service, and this industrial design work was taken over by young women, which not only filled the labor shortage but also greatly increased domestic productivity. Now, in order to maintain the production plan after the war, the United States is still actively providing young women with industrial design technology training. The illustration shows a special training [class] in the Industrial Design Department of the Chicago Art Academy, educating them with industrial design technology and knowledge.

### Konoe and Tojo Should Be Responsible for the War of Aggression; Saito Angrily Argues Before the Japanese Parliament; Militarism Led to the Collapse of Japan

[Tokyo (United Press), 28th] At the Japanese Parliament meeting this morning, Saito, an elder of the Progressive Party, at the age of 75, raised a serious question in the House of Peers this morning, stating that the Japanese people are complaining about former Prime Ministers Tojo and Konoe. Tojo has been listed as a war criminal and arrested, while Konoe is still at large. He asked the reason why. Saito's remarks were made after Prime Minister Shidehara briefly announced the Japanese government's policies and guidelines. It is said that Tojo and Konoe should bear full responsibility for this war that evolved from the "China Incident." Before the outbreak of the war, Konoe refused to negotiate with Chairman Chiang. China is now one of the world's major powers, but Konoe is still safe and sound today, which is ridiculous. At this point in Saito's speech, one member interjected, saying that Konoe's diet is very good. Saito continued, Konoe should have known long ago that Japan's protests against British and American aid to China would be ineffective. This protest led to inauspicious negotiations between Japan and the United States in Washington, which ultimately led to the Pearl Harbor incident. Saito then addressed Minister of the Army Shimomura, asking him to explain why the warlords caused this war. He said, "This is our last chance to explain to the public why militarism can lead to war." Shimomura, wearing plain clothes, replied that military intervention in politics was one of the major causes of this war, and that some military leaders were indeed unsatisfactory. The Japanese military led the country to such a tragic state, and the responsibility is too great to be expressed in words. I bow to the nation in apology. After Shimomura sat down, the members again shouted for Minister of the Navy Yonai to speak, and some joked, wondering what the navy had done. Yonai, wearing a naval uniform, remained silent in his seat. Shidehara denied that he had stated that the entire Japanese people should bear the responsibility for the war, and said that his remarks were misunderstood, and the members said, "Why didn't you deny it at the time?"

### Chen You Cup Basketball: Desheng Defeats V Team, Green Forest Defeats Overseas Chinese, Friendship Match Shows Excellent Performance

Yesterday, the Zhongqing Ballroom was lively for a while, because in addition to the two A-group matches, a friendship match between Hualian and the American military police team was added. With three matches, it is no wonder that fans flocked to it.

As a result of the two league matches, Green Forest defeated Overseas Chinese with a score of 34 to 21, but the first half was tied at ten points each, and the game remained evenly matched. Green Forest was fortunate to have a better late burst, finally defeating the enemy in the last five minutes.

In the battle between Desheng and V Team, V Team had sufficient coordination, but its skills were inferior. In the end, it could not defeat Desheng's tiger generals, who were rich in both skills and experience, and suffered a tragic defeat with a score of 27 to 34. The first half was evenly matched, with each team sharing the spoils at fourteen points.

In the finale performance match between Hualian and the 117th Battalion of the American Military Police, Hualian sent out Da Li Xuechong, Xiao Kong, and the black Bort, while the American military police had many unfamiliar faces, but it is said that they were the most elite main force. After contact, Bort opened the scoring, Xuechong made a free throw, and Xiao Kong and Xuechong made a series of layups. The American military police only scored one goal by Brown when the score was 3-0, and in an instant it became 10-2, with Hualian leading the way, making the American military police gasp. Luo Bo made a shot, and Xuechong returned the favor, making it 12-4. The American soldiers called a timeout, and Wood scored again, ending the first quarter with a score of 14-6.

In the second quarter, the American soldiers (slightly more active, after Cheng Zhang made a layup, Cardanini successively scored, turning the tide and being chased to 12-15. Fortunately, Hualian dealt with it carefully, and Bort, Xuechong, and Cheng Zhang scored every time, with both sides rising and falling, and the scores were quite even. At the end of the first half, although the American soldiers scored one more goal than Hualian, Hualian had sufficient capital and still led by seven points with a score of 27-20.

Changing sides and fighting again, Da Li and Xiao Kong retired, and the American soldiers took advantage of Hualian's loose formation and caught up section by section, at one point forcing a tie at 29 points each, and then forming a seesaw battle situation. At the end of the third quarter, Hualian still led with a score of 39-35. Li Zhenzhong was the soul of Hualian, although he did not make any achievements, but once he retired, Hualian's offensive weakened.

In the final quarter, Da Li still took the stage, and the military might of Hualian was revived, the twilight atmosphere disappeared, and Xuechong Liangxiong became more active, with the entire quarter being dominated by the two of them, with Chen and Zhang each accounting for half of the twelve points scored. The American soldiers were also only supported by Brown, and their fighting spirit was already depleted. When the whistle sounded, Hualian won with a score of 51-46.

The results of the three matches are recorded below:

Green Forest - Overseas Chinese (A group) 34 - 21

Desheng - V Team (A group) 34 - 27

Hua Zhou - American Military Police (Friendship) 51 - 46

### The Founding of the Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association

— You Mijian

Taiwan was ruled by Japan for fifty-one years, which means that the compatriots in Taiwan were slaves of Japan for fifty-one years. All the economic resources and wealth were exploited, and the people of Taiwan could only survive as slaves. All the culture, thoughts, and speech were suppressed like bean sprouts in the dark, with no sunlight to be seen and no room for growth. Under the high pressure of imperialism, fascist germs were cultivated day by day. Therefore, the people of Taiwan were severely anesthetized by the fascist toxins during these fifty-one years, and the roots of imperialism spread quite deeply in Taiwanese society.

Now that Taiwan has been restored, everyone has returned to the embrace of the motherland, and at the same time, everyone hopes to quickly build a new Taiwan of the Three Principles of the People and become good people under the Three Principles of the People. However, toxins cannot be eliminated overnight, and toxic roots cannot be dug up cleanly in a day. In order to quickly realize the ideals of the Three Principles of the People, how should we eliminate these toxins and dig up these toxic roots? How can we change our enslaved concepts? How can we assist the government in building a new Taiwan? This is what we should consider and work hard on. The motivation for the establishment of the Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association comes from this. The purpose of the Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association is to promote the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, instill the ideas of democratic politics, change the enslaved Taiwanese culture, assist the government in implementing policies and decrees, teach the national language and literature, and provide various services to society. However, this important work cannot be done by a few people. It requires everyone's collective wisdom and efforts to unite and do it together. That is why we are initiating this Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association, hoping that everyone will join this group, unite sincerely, and work together to promote what the people of new Taiwan should do for new Taiwan. (To be continued)

### Soviet Union Discovers Atomic Energy, Claiming to Have Achieved Preliminary Success

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] Yesterday's diary published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party stated that the Soviet Union is close to discovering atomic energy. The diary contained an article on atomic energy by Professor Simon Ke Qingke, which stated that the most important theoretical and practical work facing science in the new era is the creation of the chemistry of the atomic nucleus, which is as thorough as the chemistry of the atom itself. The effect of solving this kind of work can enable us to transform a large amount or kind of elements into other kinds of elements, but the more important work is to use the huge amount of "energy" created in this kind of transformation. The first successful step recently achieved in this regard has made us anticipate that the period of controlling the energy contained in the atomic nucleus is not far away. Discoveries in this field cannot always be exclusively owned by one country or another. The professor also quoted the recent statement by Foreign Minister Molotov: "We will have atomic energy and other things."

### Cheng Zhonghang Sends Personnel to Investigate, Numerous Problems in Various Warehouses, Even Omission of Warehouse Names in Remote Areas, Reluctant to Hand Over Even After Forced Unsealing

A Central News Agency reporter visited Cheng Zhonghang, Inspector of Jiangsu, yesterday to inquire about the recent work of the Inspector's Office. Inspector Cheng comprehensively replied as follows.

Warehouse Inventory Reveals Missing Inventory Lists

(1) Regarding the thorough investigation of the takeover matters in various aspects, personnel are being sent to the relevant agencies and nearby areas for visits and investigations. The current stage of takeover involves the warehouses initially taken over by various military and government agencies, which are ordered to be handed over to the Customs for inventory. The Customs has a total of 500 units of warehouses and wharfs to be inventoried this time. Among them, 100 units were taken over and handed over by the original mountains and navy. In the past half month, the Customs authorities mobilized all customs officers and staff to participate in the work. According to the investigation, the difficulties in the inventory are: First, the agencies handing over the warehouses often do not attach the original inventory lists handed over by the enemy. There are also warehouses in remote areas where even the names of the warehouses are not listed, such as the two warehouses that were recently burned. There are also some warehouses where the original receiving personnel refuse to hand over for some reason, and there are also some warehouses where a certain part of the warehouse is not allowed to be handed over for inventory for some reason. After being forced to unseal, there are various excuses for delaying the handover. There are also cases where a large number of trucks suddenly arrive at a nearby warehouse while receiving a certain warehouse, fully loaded with goods and leaving. This kind of situation directly disregards government laws and regulations and indirectly hinders prices and people's livelihood. The office has successively reported to the central authorities.

Military Police in Jiangsu Province Forcibly Impose Donations

(2) According to the investigation of the office in the recovered areas of Jiangsu Province, the local military police repeatedly impose donations on merchants and farmers. Taking Shanghai as an example, the office has repeatedly received complaints from merchants about police stations forcing the purchase of rice at low prices and forcing the purchase of goods in shops, and the detention of merchants at every turn, feeling deeply distressed. Personnel have been sent to secretly investigate. The office will use swift and effective methods to punish unscrupulous police officers in the city according to law, to vent the people's anger and relieve the merchants' plight. (3) The office has recently received a number of signed complaints, and the submissions contain detailed guarantees of the shops and the facts alleged. However, when the office sends personnel to thoroughly investigate and summons the complainants and guarantors, they often hide and fail to appear. This situation is due to the merchants' fear of the accumulated power of the official offices, or there may be other concerns, but it is deeply hoped that the people will have a responsible attitude for their own rights at this time and fight against the evil forces.

### Three Batches of Affordable Fabrics to Be Sold Starting Tomorrow

The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has decided that the third batch of affordable fabrics will be available for sale starting (the 30th). In addition to the original five major companies – Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, and China National Goods Company – for the sake of widespread supply, two more stores, Da Hu and Shanghai, will be added in the French Concession; two stores, You Xin and Xinda Xiang, will be added; and one store, Xie Da Xiang, will be added in the Nanshi area, making a total of ten locations distributed throughout the city. As for the types and prices of fabrics, Khaki Drill is priced at 900 yuan per yard; White Twill at 450 yuan per yard; White Flannel at 600 yuan per yard; White Poplin at 600 yuan per yard; Black Serge at 800 yuan per yard; and White Cambric at 450 yuan per yard. Some of the prices are lower than the previous batch.

### Foreigners Renting Land Must Register with the Land Bureau

The Municipal Land Administration Bureau, based on central government laws and regulations, has formulated registration methods for land with Perpetual Leases or Deed Leases and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. According to the regulations, foreigners renting land with Perpetual Leases or Deed Leases should directly apply to the Municipal Land Administration Bureau for registration of perpetual lease rights. If the Perpetual Lease or Deed Lease belongs to a Chinese national, an application for ownership registration should be made. As for foreign merchants who registered in the past, they have no right to register transfers or issue ownership documents according to law. Recently, various newspapers have published announcements by 14 foreign companies, including the British firm Arnhold & Co., Ltd., to re-register property rights, which is inappropriate. The competent authorities are seeking appropriate measures to deal with this and hope that citizens will cherish national sovereignty and proceed to register with the Municipal Land Administration Bureau.

### New Street Names for the City to Take Effect on the First of Next Month

The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that many of the old and current names of certain roads in the city are inappropriate and need to be changed. In addition to Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, and Great West Road, which were renamed Zhongzheng Road on October 30, it has now been decided that: (1) The Bund (currently Huangpu Tan Road) will be renamed Zhongshan Road; (2) Avenue Joffre (currently "Taishan Road") will be renamed Linsen Road; (3) Avenue Lafayette (currently "Daxing Road") will be renamed Fuxing Road; (4) Route Tenant de la Tour (currently "Changxing Road"), Route Frelupt (currently "Nanhai Road"), and Route Hulin (currently "Xichangxing Road") will be merged and renamed Jianguo Road; (5) Bubbling Well Road will be renamed Nanjing West Road; (6) Route Louvain (currently "Anhui Road") and Route Mercier (currently "Ningxia Road") will be renamed Xizang South Road; (7) Avenue Haig (currently "Datong Road") will be renamed Beijing West Road. The names of the above roads will all be changed starting on December 1.

### Ship Allocation Committee to Handle National Shipping

Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited Mr. Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, who had just returned to Shanghai from Chongqing, and inquired about specific plans for developing shipping. He replied that the National Ship Allocation Committee will be established in Chongqing on the first of next month. The committee has been ordered by Premier Song to allocate all ships. The committee will also divide the area into two management regions. Ships above Hankou will be the responsibility of the Chongqing Ship Allocation Committee, headed by two deputy directors, Lu and Qi. Shipping below Hankou and along the coast will be managed by the Shanghai Ship Allocation Committee, handled by Liu Shengren, Hong Sheng, and himself.

### Cultural Gathering Held Yesterday: Zhang Daofan Reports on the General Situation of Culture in the Wartime Capital over Eight Years; Xu Xiaoyan Says the Legislative Yuan Is Revising the Publications Law

Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, and Xu Xiaoyan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Information, jointly held a tea party for the cultural circles of the city at Kang Le Restaurant at 2:30 PM yesterday, attended by more than 500 people from the cultural, news, film, and theater fields.

General Progress in All Culture

At 3:00 PM, Zhang Daofan delivered a speech reporting on the development of education, news, publishing, literature and art, music, fine arts, theater, film, and acrobatics in the wartime capital over the past eight years. He stated briefly that (1) education has made progress in both quantity and quality; (2) the news media has made great contributions to the leadership of public opinion and the development of national spirit; (3) publishing, despite insufficient paper and printing conditions, has progressed in both quantity and quality; (4) literature and art have seen new integration and new efforts during the nation-building period. In addition, music, fine arts, theater, film, and acrobatics have all raised the status of folk art.

Xu Reports on Freedom of the Press

Deputy Minister Xu then delivered a speech, stating briefly that he had one addition to Mr. Zhang Daofan's report, which could also be said to be good news for people in the cultural field. That is, the central government is preparing to revise the Publications Law. The detailed rules for the Publications Law currently in use were drafted before the War of Resistance, and supplementary regulations were added later to meet the needs of wartime. Now that the war has ended, the wartime supplementary regulations are no longer needed. Based on the principles of freedom of the press and freedom of publication, all the provisions of the current Publications Law will be re-repealed or revised. In the past, the scope of restrictions was broader; in the future, it will probably only restrict the publication of text that harms good morals or endangers public order. As for publication registration, it was restricted during the war to maintain military and diplomatic secrets and due to printing materials and paper issues, but in the future, it will only be a formality. This revised new Publications Law has been passed by the Supreme National Defense Council and is now being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. Once promulgated, the future of China's cultural circles will be brighter and more developed.

It is also learned that Mr. Zhang Daofan will go to Japan next month to investigate Japanese culture.

### Robbery on Van Huang Du Road

American Sailor Robbed in Hongkou

Three robbery cases occurred in the city yesterday: (1) At Yong'an Fang No. 10, Van Huang Du Road in western Shanghai, at about 5:45 PM yesterday, six robbers broke in, three of whom were holding pistols, threatening and intimidating the victims and robbing them of three gold rings, two gold bracelets, and clothing and ornaments, estimated to be worth 300,000 legal tender. (2) At Yongle Fang No. 8 on the same road, at 6:00 PM yesterday evening, seven or eight robbers came, two of whom threatened with guns, robbing the victims of 32,000 legal tender and many ornaments and clothes. (3) At the intersection of Broadway and Gongping Road in Hongkou, at about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, three rickshaws carrying six American sailors were passing by when more than ten robbers rushed out of the darkness, threatening with guns, and robbing them of 200,000 legal tender.

### Mei Lanfang Performs for Ten Days

### "Rickshaw Queen" to Be Chosen This Saturday: General Wedemeyer Plans to Attend in Person

The lively and active spirit of Americans has always been unmatched by people from any other country. When they first came to Shanghai and saw countless rickshaws and pedicabs on the streets, squeezing back and forth, they undoubtedly felt a great deal of interest. After being away from home for a long time, American children probably hoped to relive some of the lively American fun after coming to Shanghai. But in fact, they were disappointed. Today's Shanghai is not the Shanghai they imagined. The Jai Alai stadium has long been closed, and the horses and dogs in the racecourse and dog track have either starved to death or been eaten as beef and mutton, or have been sold off. However, their need for excitement and liveliness has not diminished; indeed, they have come up with a new game. They are going to hold a "Rickshaw Race," initiated by the China Special Edition of the *Stars and Stripes* newspaper. The reporter went to visit the newspaper and obtained detailed information.

This Saturday (December 1st) afternoon, the US Army and Navy will hold a football game at the dog track on Albert Road. Before the football game, a Shanghai "Rickshaw Queen" will be selected. There are a total of twenty rickshaws participating in the race. Each rickshaw will have a lady sitting on it, pulled by a rickshaw puller. Starting at 1:00 PM, they will start from the Bund, pass through Nanjing Road, Bubbling Well Road, and Seymour Road, and turn west to the dog track on Albert Road. The first rickshaw to reach the finish line will win first prize.

Among the ladies participating in the race, there are four Chinese, one American, one Canadian, and the rest are Russian. Each lady represents her organization or a high-ranking official such as Generals Wedemeyer and Stratemeyer. Four of the twenty rickshaws were hired on the street, and the rest are private cars. The US military has specially assigned people to step up training at the racecourse, which has taken a full ten days. Each rickshaw will be decorated in a dazzling manner. The 10th Air Force has also specially made a lightweight aluminum car to participate in the race.

The race route is three miles long and will take about twenty minutes. Generals Wedemeyer and Stratemeyer will both be present to preside over the ceremony.

It is reported that the *Stars and Stripes* will use 7 million yuan in puppet currency as prizes, with the first prize being 2 million yuan in puppet currency, and the rest will be distributed in several levels. In addition, other items will be given to each contestant.

As for the road traffic order during the race, it will be maintained by military police specially assigned by the US military.

This unprecedented and special fresh race is bound to give the people of Shanghai another interesting topic of conversation.

Commercial News

### Cotton Yarn in Short Supply, Gold Market Calm

Cotton Yarn

The yarn market continues to rise, because the sales from Hunan and Hubei are quite good. In the case of 20-count yarn, the spot goods have risen by another 20,000 due to short supply. 32-count fine yarn and 42-count double yarn are especially sought after by merchants from other places, with a crazy rise of 100,000. 16-count and below are still not popular, and the price is similar to the previous day. Yesterday, the Jiangshun ship exported 700 pieces of cotton yarn and 500 pieces of piece goods to Hankou.

Gold Price

Yesterday (28th), the market fluctuated. Due to various speculations in recent days, the price rose and fell sharply, resulting in heavy losses for both sides. The bulls were slaughtered first, and the short sellers covered their positions later. It was not until yesterday that the storm passed and the market calmed down. There were repeated struggles at the 800,000 mark, resulting in a drop of more than 20,000. However, after the midday close, the downward trend continued, once retreating to 770,000. The gold price in Tianjin fell to within 60,000 due to a sudden tightening of credit. There were also reports of tight credit in Chongqing. In the future, more goods will arrive from various places, making it difficult to expect any action in the trend. The price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores also dropped slightly from 86,000 to 84,000. Because the price of silver in jewelry stores was still 650, the price of silver dollars was still between 444 and 445 yuan yesterday. The black market discount was higher, about 15% to 18%.

US Dollar

Yesterday, it was slightly soft. The gold price was sluggish, and the Tianjin market plummeted, so it gradually dropped from 1360 yuan to around 1330 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. As for the Hong Kong dollar, because the prices in Hong Kong and Macau were higher, the overall situation was still stable (the old goods there were worth 400 yuan, and the new goods were worth a quarter of a US dollar, 5 yuan and zero). As a result, the old goods fell by 5 yuan, and the new goods fell by 2 yuan. The price of a Hong Kong gold pound was 3,000 and something, and the price of a rupee was around 300.

Government Bonds

Yesterday, insiders continued to push up the price. C-type was close to the 500 yuan mark, and then they rushed to sell, and in an instant, the price plummeted, breaking into 400 yuan. However, many outsiders bought in at the low, and finally stabilized at around 403 yuan. As a result, the prices of various bonds were slightly higher than the previous closing price. A-type and B-type fell by 20 yuan due to a weaker speculative atmosphere. The change may not be far away, because people in the industry have taken profits and transferred funds to small Chinese stocks, and various speculations are too far from the facts.

Stock

At first, it was extremely calm. After the large bond market investors took profits, the funds were transferred to various small stocks. Before the close, a sudden surge occurred due to the exhaustion of buying orders. However, the speculative atmosphere was too strong, and the authorities continued to warn to guard against unexpected blows. The situation in the foreign stock market was calm, with little difference from the previous day.

Rice and Grain

Yesterday's rice market, because the prices in the interior were still firm, formed a production and sales reversal, and the transportation was not smooth. The owners were very firm, and the price was slightly up by 200 to 300 yuan. The oil price rebounded slightly by 400 to 500 yuan. The price of soybeans also rose slightly by 200 to 300 yuan. The retail sales of flour were still acceptable, and the market was firm. Soybean cake, cottonseed cake, and bran were all stable.

The coal market continued to show a weak trend. Only the sound of buyers and sellers asking prices was heard in the market, and there were few actual transactions. Although the price reduction wind was very severe, sellers also devalued and sold their goods. Anthracite arrived one after another. Because the market has been flat for several days, the industry is watching with a wait-and-see attitude, and the price is trending downward.

Woolen Fabric

Yesterday, the transaction volume of woolen fabrics was limited, especially the transaction volume of all-wool high-grade goods was even smaller. The existing stock was extremely scarce, and the asking price was too high, so the market transactions were mostly for second-rate goods made of local factory goods, rayon cotton, and coarse wool yarn. At the same time, due to the impact of current events, most hoarders stopped passing the buck to each other, which is also one of the reasons for reducing the import and export volume.

### Huangtai Oranges Arrive in Shanghai

In recent years, due to the impact of the war, fruits from Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangdong, such as oranges, bananas, and sugar cane, have disappeared from the city. However, Huangtai oranges from eastern Zhejiang can still arrive in Shanghai. The Maoli ship arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou the day before yesterday, carrying 2,797 boxes of Huangtai oranges, which are the only fruits monopolized in the market. Now that Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangdong have been recovered, the above-mentioned fruits from various places should be able to be transported here this winter.

### Nuomi Zhi Litchi Soon to Be Launched

Nuomi Zhi litchi is the best quality among litchis. Due to the long-term obstruction of transportation, the source is scarce, and the cold storage goods in the market have also been out of stock for a long time. It is now heard that the new goods of this year have been shipped from Hong Kong and will arrive in Shanghai soon. There are more Yuan Zhi and Bian Zhi. At a time when prices seem to be trending downward, new goods are appearing on the market again, which will definitely help to suppress and stabilize prices. It has been found that the market has already seen loose noodle production. For example, Longan has fallen by 20% before and after, and there was a continuous arrival of new large bubble Longan from Quanzhou yesterday, and the asking price may be loose.

Yesterday, the "Reorganization of Book Capital Amount" was suspended due to manuscript congestion.

### Drafting Committee Member Sun Jiulu Talks About the Main Points of the New Company Law

Simplified Procedures for Company Organization; Foreign Companies Adopt Territoriality

According to a special report from this newspaper, the new Company Law will be promulgated on January 1 next year, but it has not yet been made public. There are different rumors in the city's business community. Yesterday, the reporter of this newspaper specially visited Mr. Sun Jiulu, a legislator in charge of drafting the law, and inquired about the main points of the new law. According to Mr. Sun, the new Company Law is based on the first phase of the economic implementation plan of the Supreme National Defense Council. In legal principle, it tends toward economic liberalism and encourages the public to use their own financial and human resources to establish industries that China urgently needs. Therefore, the new Company Law has

Two Characteristics

(1) In law, the people and the government have equal status; (2) The procedures and procedures for company organization are simpler than before. In the past, in order to suit the wartime situation, my country had a special limited liability company organization, so that the central government could jointly run industrial and commercial enterprises with the people or provincial and municipal institutions or foreign merchants. The new Company Law has no provisions for special companies. In the future, the government and the people will work together to promote the national industry.

Simplified Organization

Mr. Sun also said that the most significant improvement in the new Company Law is the provision that the organization and management of joint-stock limited companies can adopt the methods of unlimited companies. In other words, although limited liability companies have limited liability in terms of capital, they can freely adopt limited or unlimited company methods in terms of organization and management according to the needs of the environment. This is the first point of simplification of company organization. Secondly, the old Company Law restricted equity measures in order to avoid manipulation by large shareholders. The new law does not have this restriction, and the principle of one share, one vote is adopted. Therefore, the rights and interests of large shareholders can be more fully protected. Although the new Company Law does not have explicit provisions on restricting equity, each company can stipulate restrictions in its own articles of association. The principle of the new Company Law is to facilitate the organization of private institutions and to correct them on the right track with strict penalties.

Foreign Companies

The reporter raised the organizational procedures for foreign companies and asked Sun Min to answer. Mr. Sun said that the concept of the new Company Law regarding foreign investment is to enable Chinese and foreign capital to obtain equal status and equal protection, and hopes that Chinese and foreign capital can stand on the same footing to promote China's industry. The new Company Law adopts the principle of "territoriality" for so-called "foreign companies", that is, a company must have two conditions to obtain the status of "foreign company": (1) It must have a head office in a foreign country; (2) It must have actual and regular business operations in a foreign country. Other foreign companies must be organized in accordance with the new Company Law. There is no restriction on the proportion of funds for Sino-foreign joint ventures, but the position of chairman of the board must be held by a person of Chinese nationality. Mr. Sun added that we adopt the principle of international reciprocity for foreign investment.

The new Company Law was drafted by Sun and legislators Sheng Zhenwei and Zhang Zhaoyuan in April this year, passed its third reading by the Legislative Yuan in October this year, and is scheduled to be implemented on January 1 next year. Because Shanghai is the national industrial and commercial hub, Mr. Sun came here to investigate the current situation of various companies for reference.

### Large Land and Abundant Resources

— Huang Jiayin

Anyone who enters school will mostly have an impression that China is "large in land and abundant in resources."

China's "large land" is beyond doubt. China was able to win the final victory in the eight-year War of Resistance, and "large land" was indeed one of the important reasons. If China were a small country like Denmark or Norway, China would have been subjugated many times. Now that China has resisted Japan for eight years and can still have a complete government and occupy a portion of free land, it is not without the gift of "large land."

As for the words "abundant resources," they often give the people of our country a wrong illusion that China has many resources and is rich in materials. In fact, you only need to take a trip to the interior and see the situation in China's rural areas. It is really poor and miserable, and the types of materials are not many and the quantity is not large. China is actually very poor, so how can we talk about "abundant resources"?

Many of China's resources are buried underground, and many lands are barren. Without the ability to utilize them, they are almost equivalent to waste. For China to be rich and strong, it depends on industrialization and mechanization, and even more on hard work!

Correspondence

### France After Liberation

— Xian

The author of this article, Weydenbacker, is the European bureau chief of the American magazines *Time* and *Life*. From the following correspondence, we can see the difficult conditions in France after liberation, as well as the celebrations in Paris when full peace arrived.

——Translator's Note

Our car passed the Chamber of Deputies, where we saw that the building was burning. A large hotel wall was riddled with bullet holes, and a large pillar had been blown down. Gunshots could be heard occasionally on the street. By the time we arrived at the hostel, the moon had risen.

That day was Friday evening, August 25, 1944, the day the German troops were driven out of Paris by the French and the American troops entered. The next day, De Gaulle led his tattered army of victory in a parade on the streets for the first time. And so, Paris awoke from its confusion and prepared to spend its first free (but also most difficult) winter in five years.

During the occupation, although they suffered humiliation and pain, life was quite exciting. On the one hand, pro-German factions made a fortune and enjoyed the black market life. On the other hand, the underground resistance also tasted the pleasure of adventure. With the realization of liberation, the first group hoped that the Americans would intercede for them, while the second group believed that after the victory of the new French resistance, the country could be revived. But as a result, from the liberation of France until the end of the European war, for nine months, neither of these hopes was realized.

Life in the first winter after the liberation of France was extremely miserable. The situation was still relatively good in late summer and early autumn. Because the weather was still warm, although food was scarce, it was not as lacking as it would later become. After the electricity supply stopped, people had to walk up and down the stairs in buildings, and there were no lights to turn on at night. Buses and business cars were suspended. Only bicycles or overcrowded trams were available, or people simply walked. Except for those who could afford black market prices, other citizens waited in lines for a long time, and the things they bought were still not enough. Workers regarded small amounts of cigarettes and alcohol as treasures. Even those who could afford black market cigarettes carefully hid their cigarette butts.

Winter arrived especially early, and the suffering increased accordingly. Food became even scarcer, and the city's coal reserves were almost non-existent. Everyone wore everything they had, but still shivered with cold in their houses. Women had no socks to wear and developed frostbite on their legs when they went to work. Musicians wore gloves with the fingertips cut off to play. Dancers had to drink wine before they could take off their clothes. Many sophisticated gentlemen did not take a bath for five months in a row. From October onwards, the whole of Paris suffered from colds, and everyone coughed until mid-May. Some poor people developed lung diseases, and some even died.

Fortunately, spring arrived early. In the Luxembourg Gardens, children raised their pale faces to the sun, and women sat on benches allowing the warmth to soothe their chapped legs. The French are naturally carefree, at least on the surface. The tables in the cafes were moved outside. Nightclubs stayed open late into the night, and the military did not interfere. The book stalls on the docks gradually increased, selling old books, old maps, and colorful scraps of paper.

In December, when the German army launched a counter-offensive in the Ardennes, the people of Paris remembered that the German army had said in August, when they withdrew, that they would come to Paris for Christmas, and they were all worried. After the Allied forces crossed the Rhine, everyone knew that the end of the war was only a matter of time.

But happiness also brought sorrow. From the returning prisoners of war and exiles, they heard about the deaths of many acquaintances. Many of those who returned were sick or so old that they could not be recognized. There was a story that was humorous in its sadness. The wife of a prisoner of war knew that her husband was coming home, so she specially prepared a double portion of food, a double bed, and even went out to borrow things from the neighbors. Just as she left, her husband came in and, seeing the situation, misunderstood and turned away without looking back.

As the war drew to a close, France and Paris were exhausted. At that time, everything was waiting to be done, but there was a lack of people to handle it. After Pétain returned, he lived a comfortable prison life. Former prime ministers such as Herriot, Reynaud, and Daladier also returned and, after looking at the political situation, quietly sat down to write their autobiographies.

On the day the war officially ended, after the final air raid alert was lifted at 3:00 p.m., the people began to celebrate with some restraint. Several cars and jeeps filled with soldiers and young people drove past, cheering and singing softly. Older people looked at each other and said, "Now that the war is over, everything should be different, shouldn't it?"

The only emotion the people expressed on the night of the victory was hope. We walked all over the city that night, and everything we saw was like that. The lights were very bright, and people were looking at the lights. Near the Grand Theater, a large group of people were walking in the strange electric light. Several young men and women were even dancing. People at the entrance of the theater were sitting on the steps, not watching the dancing, not looking at each other, but looking at the lights.

On the way back, we passed the Place de la Concorde. I remembered that nine months ago, that was the place where people celebrated the German retreat with wild enthusiasm. We crossed the quiet bridge and stopped at the Chamber of Deputies across from the dock. On the wall was a small wooden plaque. It was adorned with a sprig of lilac, and the plaque was engraved with "Here fell Clute Bilin, August 25, 1944, aged twenty-one."

### Celebrities' Hats

—

During World War II, the hats worn by many celebrities were as brilliant and outstanding as their names. The eight hats recorded here are the "trademarks" of well-known figures familiar to readers.

A simple gray felt hat with a narrow band, tied around with a string, became known to the world when Truman became President of the United States.

Mr. Churchill's tall black hat, which he has used for many years, is as inseparable from him as his cigar box and is familiar to people all over the world.

General Montgomery always wore that special French-style soft hat. Wherever this hat passed, a glorious and great military achievement was shown. Now this soft hat is as famous as his vegetarianism.

Although lost and found several times, and damaged by artillery fire and bullets, General Stilwell still cherished this outstanding broken hat and continued to wear it, even more noticeable than his glasses.

In the United States, when New York Mayor La Guardia appeared in social settings, his pointed black hat was often used as a joke. This good-tempered mayor cherished this hat very much.

Before winning his fourth Silver Star, the round steel helmet worn by General Patton, along with his sharpshooting skills, had already become a famous anecdote on the European battlefield.

A military leader can choose any style of hat. A few years ago, General MacArthur selected the one he currently uses, which is the most famous style in the U.S. Army, and is probably already familiar to readers.

Admiral Mitscher, leading the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, has inflicted countless defeats on the Japanese Navy. He often wore a baseball-style hat to direct operations.

Science

### New Rat Poison

— Wang Yanxiang

"Antu" is the name of a rat poison, specifically used to kill rats, and is very toxic. One pound can kill 300,000 rats. It was invented by Dr. Leitchert, a psychopathologist at a hospital in Baltimore, USA. Because it was kept secret during the war, it was only recently published.

"Antu" is formed by spelling out the initial letters of the chemical name. Its invention was also a coincidence. It was accidentally discovered during a taste test in a psychological laboratory. It is a grayish-white fine powder with a slight odor, and its toxicity is 100 times greater than arsenic. But it has two major characteristics: (1) It only poisons rats and is harmless to humans. (2) It causes pulmonary edema in rats, which kills them.

The method of use is also very simple. Just mix this powder with grain flour, put it on fruits, vegetables, cut apples, sweet potatoes, floorboards, runways, drinks that rats like to drink, or near their burrows, and you can avoid rat harassment. If it is used systematically, even the most severe plague can be eliminated within one or two days.

In Baltimore, although it has been tested repeatedly, the 500,000 residents have not been affected at all. Dogs may be poisoned, but dogs have a vomiting reaction to this drug, so they are less affected. Rabbits are also unaffected, and chickens can eat a spoonful without harm.

Although an antidote has not yet been invented, Dr. Leitchert advocates using gastric lavage. Victims should not be given liquids, only oxygen should be supplied.

Because this drug is helpful for the war, it is regarded as an important military supply. During the war, diseases such as typhus and plague were extremely rampant, and this drug could be used to eliminate them.

### New Scientific Information

— Jin Chun

How people with deep nicotine addiction react to smoke has not been very clear. Recently, medical scientists, after many experiments, have found that when addicted people see smoke, their blood pressure increases, their pulse quickens, the humidity of the skin on their hands and feet decreases, and the speed of their heartbeat also changes.

Soviet scientists have successfully transplanted frog hearts. After the frog used the new heart, it continued to live for as long as four months.

Medicine

### Plant Diseases

— Yu An

Only the plant itself can tell in detail what nutrients are lacking in the soil. Chemistry can analyze the soil and know the elements it contains, but it cannot know exactly how much of each element is useful to the plant.

Scientists have conducted 20 years of research on the tobacco industry. From careful observation of the symptoms shown by the roots, stems, and leaves of this plant, they have found answers to the lack of nine important plant nutrients.

Tobacco leaves are the best experimental product, because the leaf surface exposed to light is very large. The symptoms of tobacco leaves lacking potassium are similar to those of cotton suffering from potassium deficiency. Other plants cannot show the symptoms of plant diseases so easily. Only from the subtle symptoms of tobacco leaves can the nutritional deficiency diseases of other plants be answered.

The nine important plant nutrients mentioned above are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, boron, sulfur, manganese, and iron. According to Dr. McMurtrey, when a plant lacks an element, it not only does not grow, but also has a special change. When a plant lacks nitrogen, it turns a light green color, the lower leaves turn yellow, and when dry, it becomes a light brown color. When it lacks phosphorus, the plant turns dark green, the width and length of the leaves are narrower than usual, and the plant also does not grow.

Lack of potassium and magnesium has the same effect as lack of nitrogen and phosphorus, affecting the lower leaves (old leaves), or even the entire plant. Lack of calcium, boron, zinc, sulfur, and iron, in the beginning, affects the tender leaves on the upper part of the plant. For example, when iron is lacking, it can be seen that the tender leaves are less green, becoming a chlorosis, and the green of the main veins is darker than the green of the leaf blades. After the veins lose their color, the leaf blades become white or yellow.

As a result of research, scientists have discovered that from the sowing of plants to maturity, the same is true at any time. The size and age of the plant itself are irrelevant to this symptom of "nutritional deficiency."

Dr. McMurtrey said: Once the problem of plant nutritional deficiency is solved, all plants will become healthier and increase their ability to resist plant diseases and pests.

Dr. McMurtrey added: If a tobacco grower can be completely familiar with these symptoms, then he can correctly diagnose the source of nutritional deficiencies in plants in the field, because he already knows the plant's life history, living habits, the effects of plant diseases and pests on plants, and so on.

### How Old Is the Earth?

There are about forty different estimates of the age of the Earth, ranging from 100 million years to 3 billion years. Geologists and physicists advocate for long-term estimates, because geologists must explain strata that are clearly more than 100 million years old, while physicists know that it takes at least 4.6 billion years for potassium in ancient rocks to turn into lead. They once agreed that the age of the Earth should be at least 2 billion years or 3 billion years. Although the difference between the two is quite large, it is not arbitrary speculation. Potassium is an accurate clock, and it decays at a certain rate regardless of the rocks that contain it. As a result, it turns into lead in a predetermined period.

Unfortunately, uranium is not a clock, but eight clocks starting at the same time, because there are eight types of uranium on Earth (what physicists call "isotopes"), which turn into sixteen types of lead at different rates. Fortunately, these sixteen types of lead can be traced back to their mother uranium. Only one of the eight clocks shows the correct time, and according to it, the age of the Earth is about 2 billion years.

The report submitted by Dr. Wilkin and Dr. Leighton to the American Association for the Advancement of Science is not much different from this estimate. Using one of the eight isotopes of potassium, copper uranium (the uranium that eventually turns into lead) as a clock, they obtained a new and more accurate estimate of 2.5 billion years. A difference of 500 million years seems very large to us, but if we include the long period of time that the Earth was attracted from the sun by a certain planet, it cannot be considered too long. Astrophysicists will definitely thank Wilkin and Leighton for finally solving this riddle. In today's high-pitched theory of cosmic expansion, the age of planets and the Earth is extremely important to them. Because unless they know the age of the Earth and the Sun correctly, they can never suppress the relativists who insist that the Earth is younger than the planets.

### Fishing Rod on a Jeep

— Zhong Zuo

Many Shanghai people find it strange why some jeeps with American military police have something that looks like a fishing rod erected on them. In fact, this is the antenna of a wireless portable telephone, relying on it, the military police can receive orders anytime and anywhere, and quickly complete their tasks.

For example, in post-war Europe: "Military police, pay attention!" The wireless radio in a jeep is calling: "Six German prisoners of war carrying weapons have escaped and privately stolen a truck. They are now heading towards the Paris Avenue." After receiving the news, the American military police stationed in Paris immediately dispatched. ... Now they are tracking the escaped German prisoners. They shout for them to stop, and there is already a military police vehicle in front to block the way for the German prisoners. The machine gun rattles. These prisoners have no choice but to raise their hands and run out of hiding, and their mission ends.

### Dry Cleaning Soap

— Chong Mei

Waterless dry cleaning soap has recently been invented in the United States. It is shaped like cream. When using it, there is no need to apply water. Pour some on the palm and gently rub it on the skin, and the dirt will fall off with it. After use, a layer of dirt-resistant film is added to the skin.

### The Enemy (8)

— Pearl S. Buck

He thought, "Let her vomit out what's in her stomach." He forgot that she had never seen an operation before. But her pain and his own inability to go and see her made him impatient and irritable with this person who was as dead as he was lying under his knife.

He thought, "There is no reason in the world to keep this person alive."

This thought made him unconsciously cruel and acted quickly. The man groaned in his sleep, but Sadao paid no attention to him, only muttering:

"Shout, shout if you want to. I'm not operating on you because I want to. To be honest, I don't even know why."

The door opened and Hana came in. She didn't stop at all, and didn't even touch her disheveled hair.

She asked in a clear voice: "Where is the anesthetic?"

Sadao moved his chin and said, "You're back just in time, this guy is starting to move." She held the anesthetic and a bit of cotton in her hand.

She asked, "How do I do it?"

Sadao replied, "Just soak the cotton with anesthetic and move it close to his nostrils. If his breathing becomes rapid, move the cotton away a little." He said this without stopping the complicated operation he was doing.

She squatted beside the sleeping face of the young American. She thought, this is a pitifully thin face, with twisted lips. Whether this person knows it himself or not, he is always suffering. Looking at him, she began to have some doubts, wondering if the stories she sometimes heard about the suffering of prisoners were true. When reading the newspaper, it only recorded how the people cheered for liberation wherever the Japanese army went. But sometimes she remembered people like General Takima, who was so cruel to his wife at home, that no one mentioned it again after he won a battle in Manchuria. If a person like him can treat a woman under his power so cruelly, wouldn't he be cruel to people like this white man?

She earnestly hoped that this young man had not been abused. At this moment, she saw deep red scars on his neck, just below his ears. She raised her eyes and looked at Sadao, and said softly, "These scars."

But he did not answer. At this time, he felt the end of his instrument hit something hard, and there was a risk of hitting the kidneys. All thoughts left him. All he felt was pure joy. He gently explored with his fingers, familiar with every cell in this person's body. The old American professor who taught him anatomy attached the most importance to this matter. "Gentlemen, the lack of knowledge of the human body is the greatest sin of a surgeon!" he shouted year after year in class. "When performing surgery, if you are not as familiar with the body as if you had created it yourself, it is murder."

Sadao said softly, "Not yet touching the kidneys, my friend." When he forgot himself while performing surgery, he had this habit of whispering to the patient. He often called his patients "my friend," so now he did so, forgetting that this was his enemy.

### Social Services: Solving the Transportation Problems for the Maritime Workforce

— Ji Ping

Saving Precious Time, Enhancing Work Efficiency

"Punctuality" is one of the virtues of the public, yet it is regrettable that the general public often fails to observe it! For example, if a meeting is scheduled for nine o'clock, it is often the case that everyone is not present until half-past ten. One is forced to extend the meeting time, with the majority waiting for the minority. As a result, holding a meeting takes half a day, which is not economical with time; this is a common sight. Some people do not understand and always say that failing to be punctual is a waste of other people's precious time and is also an immoral act. In fact, this should also be excused; those who break appointments do not necessarily want to do so. The problem lies in the inadequacy of transportation. At present, only a small number of people ride in cars; the general public mainly uses streetcars and rickshaws. However, rickshaws and pedicabs are too expensive, and salaried employees and industrial and commercial workers dare not even inquire about the price. The streetcars and buses available to the public are overcrowded, making everyone sigh at the sight of them! This not only makes it impossible for people to be punctual for meetings but also affects office work efficiency. Writing that work starts at nine o'clock is often delayed due to crowded transportation. Even if one gets on a vehicle, it is so crowded that one can hardly breathe. Anyone in the workforce in Shanghai must have this difficulty, right?

This column takes serving society as its mission and is eager to find ways to solve this difficulty that the public cannot resolve. One is in the morning from the western district to the eastern district, and the other is every evening from the eastern district back to the western district. How can the transportation problem for thousands of people be solved? I am now designing a solution and hope that the transportation authorities will find a way to implement it. The plan is: every morning from eight to ten o'clock, add more streetcars at the end of Avenue Joffre and Jing'an Temple, running continuously, so that people going to offices in the eastern district do not have no vehicles to ride. From four to seven o'clock in the evening, conversely, add more streetcars on the Bund, constantly heading west. If there are not enough vehicles, there is another plan: please have the Public Utilities Bureau specially prepare dozens of buses to run "office special cars," running continuously every morning from eight to ten o'clock at Jing'an Temple, Avenue Foch, Avenue Haig, and the end of Avenue Joffre, heading east. Conversely, from four to seven o'clock in the evening, continuously run these "office special cars" westward at Nanjing Road, Avenue Chiang Kai-shek, Rue du Consulat, and the Bund, to avoid passenger congestion. In addition to this, are there any better plans? Please give us your advice. We also hope that the Public Utilities Bureau and the Streetcar Company authorities will study this matter carefully to alleviate the difficulty of citizens traveling. Because saving precious time means increasing work efficiency! (Reader opinions on this issue are welcome)

### My Views on Reviving Morality

— Yong Yu

During the war, "the morality teacher was dismissed from school," so morality has declined day by day. Now that our country has won the Anti-Japanese War, the movement to revive morality is indeed an important task at the time of national reconstruction. Here are two of Yong Yu's views on the movement to revive morality:

(1) Public Opinion Sanctions: The power of public opinion can influence society. Regarding the movement to revive morality, I hope that the public opinion sector will lead and urge everyone to move towards the road of reviving morality. Regarding the current extravagant consumption, places of improper entertainment that can cause young people to degenerate and morality to be lost, I hope that the public opinion sector will impose sanctions. Also, regarding the immoral behavior of general merchants, I hope that the public opinion sector will expose it. At the same time, we should extinguish the recent trend of meaningless social gatherings in Shanghai.

(2) Stabilizing People's Livelihood: Rising prices and unstable living conditions are major obstacles to promoting the revival of morality. Now, we want to "revive morality" and bring the country and society into an orderly and good state, to successfully build an independent, free, and democratic country, so that people have a sense of morality and enjoy material civilization. I think suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood are prerequisites.
