### Marshall Discusses His Mission to China: Will First Seek Opinions from All Sides; Chairman and Madame Chiang to Host Luncheon Today

[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 24th] U.S. Special Envoy to China, General of the Army George C. Marshall, hosted dozens of Chinese and foreign journalists at the U.S. Embassy on Shefu Road at 10:00 this morning. Mr. Marshall had a youthful face and white hair, and his expression remained as solemn and calm as when he disembarked from the plane the day before. Mr. Marshall, wearing a khaki Army jacket with five-star insignia on his shoulders, stood calmly by the fireplace in the corner of the room and said briefly: "I am very pleased to meet with you reporters today. However, I have not been in China for long, so I do not have much to tell you. Moreover, my primary purpose here is to gather information and listen to the opinions of all sides, some of which are not as announced externally. The U.S. policy toward China has been explained in detail by President Truman's statement, so there is no need to elaborate now. My understanding of China is limited, only gained a little bit in Washington and China in the past few weeks. What I am more familiar with is the eight years of arduous fighting by the Chinese people, and the great historical weight of the U.S. Army and Air Force personnel fighting alongside the Chinese army in China. I have never flown over the Hump. In the past, I only resided in Tianjin, Beiping, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan for three years. As for Central China, South China, and Chongqing, I have never been to them before. I have been very interested in China even before today, and the American people are even more concerned about China after it was forced to rise up and resist the war. Today, after the victory of the war, the American people's concern for the Chinese people and world peace has increased even more." Mr. Marshall paused slightly and said to the reporters, "Now, if you have any questions, you can ask them, but I am afraid that there are some questions that I cannot answer." The reporters then asked questions, which Mr. Marshall answered separately. Regarding how long Mr. Marshall would stay in China, he replied that it was undecided. When asked if he would go to Yan'an, he replied that he had not considered it yet. When asked when the U.S. troops would withdraw, Mr. Marshall smiled and said, "I don't know either, but all American officers and soldiers wish to return home as soon as possible."

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Special Envoy Marshall held his first public meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters in the accompanying capital on the morning of the 24th in his office.

At 9:50 AM, General Marshall, accompanied by Mr. Robinson, Chargé d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy, ​​arrived at the embassy. In the misty rain, General Marshall stood on the lawn and leisurely gazed at the rainy scenery of the mountain city for three minutes, looking quite content. When General Marshall entered the hall, he frequently nodded to the reporters standing in formation and said good morning. The reception was then held in the special envoy's office. After Mr. Robinson, the Chargé d'Affaires, made a brief introduction, General Marshall made a statement, saying that there was nothing he could report at the moment, and that he would make another statement in a few days. The United States is concerned about China and its relationship with the world in the future, and believes that China will contribute to maintaining world peace. The press conference ended in less than twenty minutes. When General Marshall spoke, he stood throughout, and his tone was calm and steady, with the clear and bright tone typical of people from the eastern United States. After the reception, General Marshall shook hands with the reporters one by one and took photos as a souvenir.

### Shenyang and Harbin to be Officially Taken Over Before New Year's Day; General Du Yuming to Inspect Beizhen County

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] Central government representatives held a handover ceremony in Changchun, and the Soviet side also sent representatives to participate. This is the first event since the Northeast fell into enemy hands that the Chinese government has recovered its former territory from the Soviet army. Changchun has had heavy snow for several days and has become a silver world. Residents have hung up the national flags of China and the Soviet Union to celebrate, and the situation is very enthusiastic. Since Zhang Jia'ao, chairman of the Economic Commission, arrived here, he has been in contact with the Soviet authorities and relevant parties for several days. The Changchun Railway has been quite busy with passenger transport recently, and air transport for supplies is also ready. The local people are eagerly hoping that the army will arrive soon so that the current chaotic situation can end as soon as possible.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 24th] In view of the fact that the entry of the National Army into the Northeast has generally been stepped up, the central government's official takeover of Shenyang and Harbin from the Soviet side seems to be realized before New Year's Day. Local Chinese newspapers believe that the acceleration of this work is due to the "more friendly attitude of the Soviet side." After the National Government took over Changchun over the weekend, the Chinese mayors of Harbin and Shenyang, who attended the Changchun takeover ceremony, reportedly left Changchun by plane yesterday to take up their posts, and many experts accompanied them, including officials in charge of the Central Bank. It is expected that other experts from the National Government will also fly from Peiping. "The Republican Daily" reported that the follow-up troops of the National Army, which were carried by American transport ships and landed on Huludao, have arrived in Jin County and are now crossing the city and advancing towards Shenyang. According to other newspaper reports, General Du Yuming's troops are also spreading out in a fan shape towards Yingkou, threatening this port currently occupied by the communist army. The situation of the National Army in the Northeast is improving day by day, but the activities of the communist army in the front and rear continue to increase.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th] The troops advancing towards Shenyang to take over defense reached Beizhen on the 23rd. On the morning of the 24th, General Du Yuming personally went to Beizhen County to inspect. It is expected that he can reach Heishan and Qianhoudahushan on the evening of the 24th. According to reliable information, the communist army in Yixian is showing signs of wavering.

Hoping that all Troops Will Rectify Discipline

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Commander-in-Chief He reported on the key points instructed by Chairman Chiang at the memorial week of the Army Headquarters on the morning of the 24th, which included four items: (1) The central and local takeover personnel have not been able to fully utilize the enemy and puppet materials and factories that have been taken over, and they should find ways to utilize them in the future. (2) The places where various agencies and troops in Nanjing are stationed are still not clean and tidy enough. Each sick soldier in the hospital only has two military blankets, which is still not enough and should be improved as soon as possible. (3) The damaged parts of Nanjing City have not been completely repaired. The suburban highways should be repaired and restored as soon as possible. Japanese prisoners of war should be used to undertake this work as soon as possible. (4) The Army Headquarters has not made full use of its authority to guide and supervise the party and government agencies to promote all matters to perfection. Before the official return to the capital, the Army Headquarters should be responsible for exercising its authority to supervise and guide the party and government affairs in the areas recovered by the headquarters, so that all restoration work can be promoted smoothly. Mr. He hoped that the responsible comrades of the party and government would work harder so as not to disappoint Chairman Chiang's high hopes. He also hoped that any shortcomings would be reported at any time, and encouraged all military agencies and troops to rectify discipline.

### National Assembly Representatives Express Opinions on the Current Situation: Believe that the Way to Solve the Current National Affairs is to Return the Military to the Country and Return Political Power to the People

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The National Assembly representatives issued a common opinion on the current situation on the National Revival Day, which roughly stated: We believe that the way to solve the current national affairs is no more than two points, namely, returning the military to the country and returning political power to the people. The army is a tool for defending the country and protecting the people. No party or faction shall take it as its private property. It must be returned to the country. The reason is very clear and there is no need to elaborate. Political power is entrusted to the people of the whole country. It should end the period of political tutelage and return it to the people. Today, the National Government exercises political power. In theory, it is based on the legacy of the national father Sun Yat-sen, and in law, it is based on the "Law on the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China" promulgated in the 20th year. The former stipulates that the highest principle of our revolution and nation-building is to achieve constitutional government through political tutelage, and the latter is granted by the National Assembly to return political power to the people. It should be the sole object of the National Assembly convened in accordance with the law, and a democratically elected government should be formally organized by the National Assembly to exercise the power to govern. Apart from this, the National Government has no right to privately transfer power. Chairman Chiang solemnly declared at the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association on March 1 this year: "We can only return political power to the National Assembly of the representatives of the people of the whole country, and cannot return political power to the party meetings or their coalition government of various parties and factions." The words are simple and profound, and are indeed irrefutable truths.

The political consultation conference that is about to be held has no legal basis. It is just a negotiation to resolve party disputes, so that the opinions of various parties on national affairs tend to be consistent. However, major national plans cannot be decided without a genuine public opinion body stipulated by law. The representatives of this National Assembly were legally elected and produced by the people. They cannot be loved or hated by various parties, nor can they be changed by the political consultation conference. If the beliefs in this fundamental great principle are not firm, and the measures are uncertain, then the government's painstaking efforts to seek peace and unification cannot be achieved, and it will give opportunists an opportunity to take advantage of, and the gains will be endless.

This National Assembly is the foundation for our country to implement constitutional government, and convening it on time is a clear path to solve national affairs. Democracy and political system, the rule of law comes first. If any party does not adhere to the usual practice of constitutional government in modern countries, and puts the interests of the party above the interests of the people, and does not hesitate to destroy the law and disrupt discipline and shake the foundation of the country, then disasters will follow each other, which will not only affect the international status, but also threaten world peace.

### Exchange Rate of Northeast Currency to Legal Tender to be Posted Daily; Puppet Manchurian Currency and Soviet Military Currency to be Cleared

[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 24th] According to sources, in the future, the Northeast currency and the legal tender will not have a fixed exchange rate, but will be posted daily by the Central Bank. Holders of legal tender who want to exchange it for Northeast currency must apply to the Central Bank, just like buying foreign exchange. This measure is to avoid the large-scale transfer of funds to the Northeast, which will affect the local financial prices. The former puppet Manchurian Central Bank banknotes and Soviet military coupons will also be collected and cleared at a considerable time. The status of legal tender in the Northeast currently varies from place to place. The Xingying in Changchun absolutely prohibits the use of legal tender, while in Jinzhou, a large amount of legal tender is pouring into circulation. It is heard that the ratio of legal tender to Manchurian currency in the area is 3:1. Regarding the issuance of currency in the Northeast, it is reported that the former amount issued by the puppet Manchurian Central Bank was 800,000,000,000 yuan. After the Japanese surrender, the puppet Manchurian government increased the issuance by 400,000,000,000 yuan to pay for the officials' severance fees. The first batch of Soviet military coupons was 100,000,000,000 yuan, and it is not known whether it will be increased in the future. As for the issuance of Northeast currency by the National Government, the current amount is very small. 50,000,000 yuan was transported on the 13th of this month, and another 50,000,000 yuan was transported on the 21st, totaling 100,000,000 yuan. This phenomenon of divergence can be eliminated after the opening of the Jinzhou Central Bank. The amount of salaries for administrative personnel in the Northeast has a great impact on the social economy. After several discussions by the Standing Committee, it is heard that it has been determined that the monthly salary for senior officials is 9,000 yuan. If there is no major fluctuation in prices in the Northeast, this amount is sufficient for honest officials to maintain their integrity. Prices in the Northeast are very low. If financial management is handled properly in the future, society will be easily stabilized.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th] The Central Bank transported Northeast currency to Jinzhou. 28 boxes were transported on the 23rd and 14 boxes were transported on the 24th. Once preparations are completed, business can begin.

### A Full Tour from Beiping to Jinzhou

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 22nd] The Beining Railway is open to Jinzhou, which has not only provided the northern people with psychological security but also enabled a smooth flow of goods and restored freedom of commerce. The day after the railway to Jinzhou reopened, a reporter took a train from Beiping to Jinzhou for a full line inspection. The train journey took three days, with heating inside the carriages and the route closely protected by Sino-American troops. Over 4,000 passengers arrived safely at their destinations with great pleasure. The fact that 1,192 "Hua Li" (Chinese miles) of railway transportation inside and outside the pass could be quickly restored in such difficult circumstances is a truly successful demonstration in the aftermath of victory. This could not have been achieved without the great cooperation between the Allied forces, the National Army, and the farmers. If there were no Communist disturbances and the trains could run day and night, the travel time could be reduced by half. When the train departed from Beiping Station, tickets to Jinzhou were in great demand, with as many as 15 passenger carriages. The trains from Beiping to Tianjin traveled quickly and arrived on time. The 134 kilometers from Tianjin to Tangshan took a relatively long five hours due to the initial repairs of the route. Railway facilities on both sides of the track were damaged by the Communists, and the conditions in the villages were particularly unbearable to witness. The train arrived in Tangshan at 5:00 PM. Passengers stayed overnight in Tangshan and changed trains to continue their journey. Tangshan was teeming with passengers and cargo, showing great prosperity. At that time, the Kailuan Mining Company was moving back to Tianjin, and the celebrations at the station were very enthusiastic. Kailuan never stopped production from beginning to end. All the bridges were guarded by the US Marine Corps, with 50,000 workers working under their protection. The US troops set up tents and guarded the bridgeheads at minus seven degrees Celsius, enduring great hardships. Every passenger was deeply moved, so whenever the train crossed the railway bridge, passengers would reach out the windows and shout "Ding Hao (very good)!" The American soldiers would smile and respond with "Ding Hao." In the vast fields near Beidaihe, two American soldiers were repairing a telephone on the spot. A Chinese child was riding on one of their shoulders, watching them repair the telephone. It was truly a beautiful picture viewed from the train window, and one was deeply moved. It is said that 9,500 tons of coal can be produced every day. Tangshan has a population of 200,000, and order is maintained jointly by the National Army and Allied forces, so the local situation is very stable. There are occasional bandit disturbances within 40 "Li" (Chinese miles) near Tangshan, but they are not a cause for concern. In the morning, the train traveled east from Tangshan, passing through Guye, Changli, Su County, Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao to Shanhaiguan. Along the way, over seventy American soldiers were seen, and two children were sitting on the shoulders of one of them, watching the repairs to the telephone. Looking out the train window, it was truly a beautiful picture, and one was deeply moved. At 7:00 PM, the train arrived in Shanhaiguan and stayed overnight in the town of Shanhaiguan. The surrounding area was a scene of ruins. The crimes of the Communists were clear for all to see. The 70,000 people were struggling to survive. Survivors of the disaster recounted the Communist conscription and looting, with tears streaming down their faces. They were especially grateful for the National Army's rescue and for their compassion in bypassing the Communist forces and not firing a single shot at the pass, leaving them in tears of gratitude. On the morning of the 20th, the train crossed the pass. It took eight hours to travel 182 kilometers. The forests and plains on both sides were fertile and lovely. Herds of cattle and sheep could be seen everywhere. The double-track railway built by the Japanese had been partially destroyed, and thousands of workers were rushing to repair it. There were still some Communist soldiers hiding in the small villages along the way, but their numbers were very small. The train passed through several small stations, and farmers were seen angrily burning Communist border region currency. It was reported that farmers in the countryside had suffered greatly from this currency. This section of the route was closely protected by brave soldiers who had fought north and south, demonstrating their loyalty to the country and the people in the severe cold of minus fourteen degrees Celsius. The passengers on the train deeply respected them. After the reporter crossed the pass, they constantly heard the common people hoping that Chairman Chiang would visit the Northeast. The people of the country earnestly hoped for good governance, and the enthusiasm for seeing the leader's grace was evident everywhere. The train arrived in Jinzhou City in the fading light of dusk and saw a large number of troops setting off to the front lines. The fatigue of the three-day journey was forgotten due to this exciting scene.

### The United Nations Preparatory Committee Concludes; The General Assembly is Scheduled to Convene Next Month; Representative Gu Weijun Delivers the Closing Remarks on Behalf of the Entire Body

[Reuters, London, 24th] Yesterday at 5:00 PM (1:00 AM Shanghai time), the preliminary work of the first plenary session of the United Nations organization was completed. The 51 representatives of the Preparatory Committee had been meeting since yesterday morning and passed the last items on the agenda of its final meeting in the afternoon. [Central News Agency, London, 23rd] The representatives of various countries on the United Nations Preparatory Committee elected Gu Weijun as the speaker for the final meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, representing the entire body to deliver the closing remarks to show great respect to our country, which was the first to be invaded in World War II. Gu Weijun immediately first represented the Chinese delegation in praising the achievements of the committee's work as expressed by the chairman of the Preparatory Committee, as well as the spirit of cooperation and enthusiasm among the representatives of various countries in promoting the rapid and optimistic results of the work. Then, on behalf of all the delegations, he expressed his gratitude to the chairman, secretary, and all the staff of the Preparatory Committee for their leadership and assistance. He also expressed his deep gratitude to the British government for its hospitality and the facilities provided, which enabled the meeting to achieve great success. Gu continued, "We firmly believe that when the United Nations General Assembly convenes in January next year, the work we have already completed will greatly facilitate the future General Assembly in establishing various major institutions. In this important era, the signs of peace have already been seen. The work of the Preparatory Committee has been completed, and on January 13th next year, we can see the establishment of a new world organization, on which the hopes of all mankind truly rely."

The Four-Stage Construction Work is Finally Completed [Central News Agency Reporter Ren Lingxun, London, 23rd] The completion of various tasks by the United Nations Preparatory Committee today shows that the construction of the United Nations organization has already entered the final stage. The construction of the United Nations organization is divided into four stages: First, the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, where the four powers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union reached a general agreement on the preliminary system of this world organization, and it was confirmed at the Yalta Conference in February of this year. The second stage was completed by the San Francisco Conference held on May 27th of this year. At that time, the United Nations Charter was formulated, and the Preparatory Committee was established. The third stage began seven weeks later, on August 16th of this year, when the Executive Committee of the Preparatory Committee held a meeting. The Executive Committee was composed of 14 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Iran, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia. After nine weeks of detailed discussion, the Executive Committee passed a massive report, which contained detailed rules for the preparation of the organizational structure of various important institutions of the United Nations organization. This report became the basis for discussion by the Preparatory Committee. The Preparatory Committee began work on November 24th of this year and concluded this afternoon. After more than four weeks of review, the eight technical subcommittees of the Preparatory Committee thoroughly considered the points in the Executive Committee's report, some of which were revised, some were not revised, and some were completely rejected, but most were adopted. Only 15 countries participated in the Executive Committee, while 51 countries attended the Preparatory Committee.

The most exciting part of the resolutions made by the Preparatory Committee was the unanimous agreement, that is, the issues that caused fierce debate, such as the preparation of the Secretariat, the organization of the trusteeship system, and the selection of a permanent address, were all satisfactorily resolved. This is why most of the representatives who participated in the plenary session of the Preparatory Committee believed that the rapid completion of the work was a good omen. When the Yalta Conference was held, no one predicted that this world organization could work effectively within a year. During the San Francisco Conference, some people did not believe that these 51 independent countries could agree on the details of the organization before the end of this year. According to the general report made by the final report of the eight technical subcommittees of the Preparatory Committee, it will be submitted to the General Assembly on January 20th next year for final review, which will include the temporary rules and procedures of the United National General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, and the organization of various important institutions of the United Nations. In addition, it also includes various suggestions made by the organization of the Secretariat and the issue of the privileges of the United Nations organization, as well as the draft agreement on the "special status of the permanent address" of the United Nations to be established in the United States between the United Nations and the US government. The preface to the final report of the Preparatory Committee expresses infinite hope, saying that if the spirit of the Preparatory Committee's completion of work can be a general guide, then the United Nations organization can be established smoothly. If the United Nations organization can grasp the will of all corners of the world in its initial measures, then people who place great hopes on it will not be disappointed, believing that this organization is the last chance to free themselves and their descendants from the shackles of war.

### The Last Two Subcommittee Reports Passed

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] The plenary session of the Preparatory Committee passed the final reports submitted by the Type A Technical Subcommittee (responsible for matters related to the Trusteeship Council) and the Type D Technical Subcommittee (responsible for matters related to the United National General Assembly) this morning. When the representative of Norway, the chairman of the Type A Technical Subcommittee, presented the report, he said that the framework of the United Nations has now been completed, and the General Assembly can be held on January 10th next year to discuss important work, without being repeatedly blocked by procedural debates. When the representative of Czechoslovakia proposed to pass the report of the Type A Technical Subcommittee, he praised the attitude of cooperation and mutual assistance of the five powers, which finally made the work of the Type A Technical Subcommittee a great success. The representatives took a positive and concrete attitude towards various resolutions related to all countries, large and small. The several important debates that the Executive Committee went through from August to October have now all been passed by the entire body, or at least by a two-thirds majority vote, which is indeed a sign of the smooth progress of the United National General Assembly. The final report of the Type D Technical Subcommittee was also passed this morning, but the representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and South Africa still declared that they reserved the right to discuss again in the General Assembly the rights and freedoms of the residents of the trust territories proposed in this report.

### The Anglo-Siamese Treaty Can Be Signed Within Days

[Reuters, London, 24th] The Anglo-Siamese Treaty can be signed within one or two days. Its nature is between a peace treaty and an armistice agreement. As for the final peace treaty, it will have to wait until after the Siamese elections are held before it can be signed. London officials said that this transitional treaty is an "agreement in principle" and will be accompanied by an appendix, stipulating its scope and purpose. The final terms of the treaty have been agreed upon by the British and Siamese representatives, and they have all received instructions from their respective countries to prepare for signing. It is also known that the Siamese government has agreed in principle to export rice to Burma and Malaya, but the quantity is not specified in the treaty. It will also not be possible to decide before the signing, as the current state of supply requires examination by British and Siamese experts. The US State Department's decision to withdraw its request to oppose the signing has pleased London. Observers in London believe that the US's doubts were caused by "outdated information" received.

### Korean Travelers Talk About the Conditions in the Soviet-Occupied Zone

[United Press, Seoul, 23rd] Travelers arriving today from the Soviet-occupied zone said that Korean communists and anti-communists clashed in recent anti-communist riots, during which eight students were killed. According to these travelers, 30 to 50 Japanese women and children die every day in Hamhung (transliteration), in the Soviet-occupied area of northeastern Korea. The Soviets have almost concentrated all Japanese men in a certain area of Hamhung and transported them to Siberia for forced labor in coal mines and other mining areas. In the Soviet-occupied zone, the treatment of Japanese people is not good. In the eastern part of northern Korea, there are not enough coffins to bury the dead, and rice straw bags are used instead. These refugees bring various stories about the Soviets disregarding the welfare of the people, but since the Soviets have refused to allow American journalists to enter their occupied zone, it is impossible to verify the truth.

### It is Rumored that the Iranian and Turkish Problems Have Been Resolved by the Three Powers; Talks Are Still Proceeding in an Amicable Atmosphere; Stalin Received Byrnes the Day Before Yesterday

[United Press, Moscow, 23rd] Today is the eighth day of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference. According to well-informed sources, the talks appear to be accelerating, and the three powers seem to have hope of reaching an agreement before the close. US Secretary of State Byrnes, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held informal talks at 2:00 PM yesterday and attended the formal meeting together at 5:00 PM. Well-informed sources indicated that the atmosphere of the meeting was "harmonious and normal." It is generally believed that the communiqué of this meeting can be published before Byrnes and Bevin leave the Soviet Union to return home.

[French News Agency, Tehran, 23rd] According to information obtained from here: It is rumored that the Moscow Conference has reached a resolution on the Iranian or Turkish problems. It is also said that the Soviet Union has adopted an appropriate position. Some political figures in this country agree with the reorganization of the Iranian cabinet, especially the opposition, and demand the immediate resumption of direct negotiations with Moscow. [Reuters, Moscow, 24th] The Three Foreign Ministers Conference remains strictly secret, while US sources say that the informal talks held by the representatives of the three countries are continuing to progress in a warm and harmonious atmosphere. There is no hope of the Three Powers Conference ending before Christmas. US Secretary of State Byrnes is eager to return to Washington as soon as possible, so he will try to end the meeting early. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin is also busy preparing for the plenary session of the United Nations organization to be held in London in January next year. At noon yesterday, the three foreign ministers and their closest advisors continued to hold informal talks in Molotov's office in the Kremlin. Later, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman formally hosted a banquet for the three foreign ministers. In the evening, the entire diplomatic corps went to see the "Cinderella Song and Dance Drama" and then went to the French Embassy to attend the Christmas reception of Mrs. Gadrue, the ambassador's wife.

[Reuters, London, 24th] A Moscow dispatch said: Stalin received US Secretary of State Byrnes yesterday, with US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov also present.

### 60% of the US Army Air Transport Command Demobilized

### Guerrillas Active in the Spanish Mountains

Supported by the People with Great Momentum

[This newspaper dispatch] According to a London broadcast on the 24th, news from the military authorities in Madrid stated that guerrillas in the Guadarrama Mountains and Altomantos Mountains within forty miles of Madrid have occupied many villages and towns. This time, the guerrillas are supported by the people and have great momentum. Most of them carry new-style weapons, and their strength is even stronger than that of the government army. Wireless communication equipment is supplied by aircraft.

### Burmese Railway Repair Completed

[British News Service, London, 24th] The British military has repaired the main railway in Burma, the 450-mile track from Yangon to Mandalay. This railway was heavily bombed by the British Royal Air Force and destroyed by the Japanese army, but the repair only took more than six months. British military engineers alone repaired more than 100 bridges. A 1350-foot bridge was repaired in six weeks, showing the speed of the work. In the past eighteen months, the people of Burma had to travel by ox cart or dilapidated Japanese trucks. Now, train travel has been restored.

### Japanese Military Technology Secrets Were Seized by the US Occupation Forces in Large Numbers; The Search for Intelligence Was Almost Exhaustive

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd, United Press] According to a US military intelligence report: Among the many military and technical secrets seized by the US military in Japan, one was an aircraft-loaded torpedo that could destroy submarines. This torpedo could hover underwater and destroy the target. The Japanese stopped continuing research a year ago because they lacked a satisfactory gyroscope controller. Lieutenant General Willoughby, Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of intelligence work under MacArthur, said, "When our work in Japan is completed, the US government will have obtained far more information about Japan than any country has obtained about another country." Among the 1,500 documents in the US military archives that expose various Japanese secrets is the process of interviewing former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. He told Allied interviewers at the time that he knew that Japan's war with the United States was almost hopeless. Most Japanese leaders knew that Japan had been defeated when Saipan fell. Konoe stated that his sole purpose in China was to make Chinese leaders recognize their destiny as a great oriental nation. He had no intention of depriving China of its political and economic freedom during the Sino-Japanese War.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Lieutenant General Willoughby, Deputy Chief of Staff of MacArthur, said that when our mission here is completed, the US government will be able to obtain a large amount of information about Japan. No country's information about another country can match this amount. The files and reports collected and stored reach more than 1,500 pieces. Other information is also being collected. Hundreds of pieces of information are collected every week. Various investigation teams are currently conducting investigations throughout Japan. Relevant data are recorded in detail, and several special investigation organizations continue to conduct investigation work. Their efforts will undoubtedly find out Japan's wartime secrets, and some of the mysteries of Japan will be revealed one by one. The scope of the investigation conducted by the US investigators is wide-ranging and all-encompassing. Just listing a few examples can illustrate the variety of investigation objects, from residential trees, food, eating habits to political conditions, all are included. Even highly technical radar jet propulsion machines are also within the scope of investigation.

Radar Equipment Incinerated

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Special Dispatch] Radar equipment worth 500 million yuan, used to defend the B-29 Superfortress bombing of the city of Yawata, has been destroyed by the occupation forces. The radar equipment was incinerated by arson and melted into soft steel and glass in fifteen minutes. The radar equipment was used in conjunction with six anti-aircraft guns to defend the "Pittsburgh of Japan."

Large Quantities of Military Supplies Distributed to the Japanese

[Associated Press, Fukuoka, 24th] The US 32nd Division previously collected various Japanese supplies in Japan, amounting to thousands of kinds. They have now been transferred to the Fukuoka Prefectural Government for distribution to the Japanese people to help them get through the harsh winter.

Crime is Increasing in Tokyo

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th] Kyodo News Agency reported that crime is increasing in Tokyo. On Saturday and Sunday, the police rounded up and arrested thieves, detaining 900 men and 100 women. Most of them were charged with minor crimes, but there were several armed robbers among them.

### The New National Government of Iran Begins to Perform its Duties; The Kouji People in the North Assist the Iranian Army

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] According to a TASS report from Tehran on the 16th, the National Government of Iranian Azerbaijan has begun to perform its duties. All government agencies in Azerbaijan have been taken over by the new government. Some officials who are not sympathetic to the new government have gone to Tehran. The situation in the area controlled by the new government is peaceful, and the local people support the new government.

(Reuters, Tehran, 24th) Iranian defense forces in several cities in the Iranian province of Azerbaijan are still resisting the attacks of the democratic forces, while the Kouji people, who have always opposed the Iranian military authorities, have now changed their past attitude and are assisting the Iranian regular army in resisting the Assyrians, Caucasians, and democratic forces.

### General Patton's Funeral Held in Heidelberg

[United Press, Heidelberg, 23rd] The remains of the famous American general Patton were buried in the 16th-century Christian Church here today. The ceremony was simple and moving, lasting only twelve minutes. All of the highest-ranking American officers in Europe participated in the funeral procession, but the only relatives present were Mrs. Patton and her brother, Earl. Many soldiers at the scene were moved by the solemn ceremony, as were the German civilians. During the funeral procession, no fewer than 6,000 people stood along the road from the church to the station. Patton's remains were placed in a steel coffin, covered with the national flag, and led by a military band and sixteen armored vehicles, which will be transported by special train to Luxembourg, where they will be buried on Sunday. Mrs. Patton wore a black leather coat and a black hat, and rode in a car with her brother to escort the funeral. More than a dozen senior generals escorted the funeral procession, and the new US Commander-in-Chief in Europe, General McNarny, also participated in the procession by car, moving as slowly as a frog.

[United Press, Luxembourg, 23rd] Soviet Deputy Commander-in-Chief Marshal Zhukov arrived here today to attend General Patton's funeral.

### France Approves Monetary Agreement

### Various Countries Enthusiastically Celebrate Christmas. White House Square Relit. Loud Carols Evoke Memories.

[British News Agency, London, 24th] This is the first Christmas after victory, and the British people's celebration is more enthusiastic than ever before. Loud and cheerful carols evoke many happy memories, and the six years of suffering are finally in the past.

[American News Agency, Washington, 24th] The torch that was extinguished in 1941 was relit today in White House Square. President Truman personally lit the Christmas tree and made a Christmas broadcast to the war-torn countries of the world (the original speech appeared in yesterday's newspaper). At the same time, veterans across the country are also trying to return to their hometowns for the holiday. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is planning to aid Belarus, Austria, Korea, and Taiwan today as a Christmas gift to the world. The Red Cross clubs in all war zones where U.S. troops are stationed will be fully open during the Christmas holiday to welcome the troops. Soldiers on their way home will also receive about 1.25 million boxes of Christmas gifts.

MacArthur's Message

Hoping for Mutual Love Among Mankind

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] MacArthur issued a Christmas message today, saying: "On this Christmas Day, the first Christmas in five years without the sound of gunfire, I and all the personnel of the headquarters thank God for saving us from death and destruction. We pray that the merciful Lord will support us so that we can dedicate ourselves to completing the ideal that Christ wants to realize in this world, that is, peace on earth and goodwill among all mankind."

Holy Land Holds

All-Day Prayer and Blessing

[United Press, Bethlehem, 23rd] Bethlehem, a small town in the mountains of Judea, is the birthplace of Jesus Christ two thousand years ago. Tomorrow, countless believers will come to worship again. The Church of St. Catherine here will hold all-day prayer, meditation, and procession blessings. The ceremony is solemn, as it is every year, but this year there will be thousands of people in khaki uniforms participating.

The Rich Celebrate

The Common People Are Inferior

[United Press, London, 23rd] The world is at peace, and although the British people have goodwill towards people from all countries, their first Christmas after the war, in terms of family gatherings and children's festivals, does not seem to be able to return to pre-war standards. Some families have already reserved seats in mid-November and will be provided by hotels and restaurants in the West End of London. Music and dancing will be enjoyed all night long. However, most ordinary people have only gathered their families for the first time in seven years. Their family conditions are inevitably somewhat difficult, and some cannot prepare firewood and coal for Christmas Eve according to traditional customs. There are also quite a few relatives still overseas, serving in the war and unable to return. The food situation for children is slightly better than before. It is reported that 300,000 turkeys from South Ireland and more than 3.5 million pounds of grapes from Haifa, Palestine, have arrived in Britain. Australia has also agreed to greatly increase the supply of eggs and will transport more tea, wheat, fresh meat, salted meat, ham, butter, coconut oil, sugar, wine, and sweet wine. Besides food, the second most important thing for Christmas is gifts.

Gifts and Toys

Inferior Goods Supplied to the Market

However, this year's gifts are scarcer than the six Christmases during the war. Some stores rely heavily on old goods, eager to sell them on the one hand and eager to buy them on the other. The most popular gifts in the past, such as handbags, handkerchiefs, cosmetic cases, and coat hooks, are not easy to buy. Even gloves and handkerchiefs require sacrificing precious ration coupons. Pont Street, the fashion center, has been damaged by bombs, and although it can still supply some specialty items, their value is very high. A piece of old jewelry can cost as much as thousands of pounds. A department store has a special counter selling old prints, old maps, old nautical charts, and copperplate prints, with prices starting from one pound. Genuine and fake jewelry varies in price and size, with the lowest being only seven shillings and six pence. Playing cards are very difficult to buy, and children's toys are also very scarce, expensive, and of poor quality. Wooden trains are crudely made and poorly painted and are now displayed in the windows of major department stores. In the past, such inferior goods would never have been displayed on the shelves. Some toys are simply a few rough pieces of wood loosely nailed together.

### The Soviet Union in the Far East Seeks to Develop Fisheries. Vladivostok Shipyard Rushes to Build New Ships. Experts and Workers Move from West to East.

[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] The Soviet Union, after its lightning seven-day offensive against Japan, occupied southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands and is working hard to rebuild. The fishing industry has been restored and expanded, factories are being built in succession, and port facilities are also increasing. Soviet experts and workers from western Soviet Union are moving to the new region in large numbers. It is predicted that the Soviet Far East fishing harvest will double next year. When Soviet troops occupied the area, they discovered that natural resources had been exploited recklessly, regardless of future losses, resulting in a significant loss of the richness of the fisheries in the central and southern Kuril Islands. The largest and most complete equipment on the northern Kuril Islands was heavily damaged by American bombing. In southern Sakhalin, the Japanese army adopted a scorched earth policy when they withdrew, leaving only rubble. It is reported that many of the large Japanese fishing boats in the northern Kuril Islands and Kamchatka have been taken away by the Japanese during their withdrawal. However, the Soviets are now doing their best to restore them. A vanguard of several hundred Soviet technicians and fishermen from the Caspian and Black Sea regions has arrived in the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin. The industries built by the Soviets in the Far East related to fisheries are now being expanded to meet this new demand. Shipyards in Vladivostok and other places are rushing to build new ships for fishing.

### The Indian League Convened an Emergency Meeting Yesterday. Pointing Out That Britain's Traditional Policy Has Not Changed. Wavell Will Meet with Twenty Leaders Again Next Month.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Bhandari, the Central Indian Commissioner of the Indian League, stated at an emergency meeting convened by the League yesterday that there can be no peace in Asia until foreign forces are completely expelled from Asia. Menon, the secretary of the League, said that the convening of this meeting is to express our loyalty to the Congress Party and to support the complete independence of India. The World War has not brought peace to India and Asia. If foreign forces are not completely expelled from Asia, peace will never be realized. The so-called socialist government of Britain has not broken away from the style of the Churchill-Amery era, and the recent statements of the Labor government have made the situation in India worse. Menon also said that Britain has no right to arrest personnel of the Indian National Army, and we firmly oppose the British authorities in India.

[Reuters, Calcutta, 24th] The Governor-General of India, Lord Wavell, may meet with Gandhi again in Calcutta before mid-January.

### American Newspapers Criticize Konoe's Memoirs

A Leader of War Cannot Evade Responsibility

Who Can Believe What He Described?

[United Press, San Francisco, 23rd] California newspapers commented on Konoe Fumimaro's suicide and the statements in his posthumously published memoirs, with much criticism. The Sacramento Bee editorial of the McClatchy chain said that Konoe made a final protest before taking poison, arguing that he had tried to seek peace during his three years as prime minister. From a historical perspective, his words are difficult to establish. It will take more than months or years to understand the chaotic situation in Japan before the Japanese-American War. However, it is clear that the definite steps towards war were taken when Konoe was the prime minister. Although Konoe had already resigned on December 7, 1941, the bombs had already been made, and someone only needed to light the fuse. The Sino-Japanese War occurred during Konoe's tenure, and the United States' protests were directly rejected by Konoe. All efforts by third parties to mediate the Sino-Japanese War were also thwarted by Konoe. The Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan was also signed during Konoe's term as prime minister. On October 5, 1940, Konoe even boldly predicted, "If the United States does not understand the true meaning of the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and actively cooperates to create a new world order, it will lead to war with the United States." These are not the words of a peace lover. Examining Japanese history from 1930 to 1940 inevitably gives one the impression that Japan's military aggression visibly slowed down when Konoe was not the prime minister. Therefore, Konoe's suicide does not seem to be due to the extreme mental anguish of being accused of being a war criminal. It is more likely that he knew that once he was interrogated and history was published, even if he was not recognized as the culprit of the war, he would be judged as one of the masterminds of Japan's war crimes. The San Francisco Chronicle commented that Konoe's posthumous work said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka knew about Germany's plan to invade the Soviet Union when he signed the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, which is not true. Hitler's news of the invasion of the Soviet Union made Matsuoka realize that he had been fooled, and Konoe was not unaware of this. Therefore, he resigned after changing the number of days. Konoe should be responsible for the Tripartite Pact signed on September 27, 1940. As for who should be responsible for his handshake with Stalin on April 13, 1941, and Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22 of the same year, the Japanese people will know. It is unbelievable to say that Matsuoka knew Hitler's intentions and deliberately fell into the trap. Furthermore, Germany may not have been willing to inform Matsuoka of its plans. Germany's contempt for its Eastern allies was obvious to all. According to the American ambassador to Japan, Grew, he repeatedly ordered Matsuoka to refute the accusations that Germany deliberately deceived Japan. Although Matsuoka did not publicly do so, he may have convinced Konoe that what he did was intended to protect Japan's position.

### The Most Memorable Day Today!

Today, December 25th, is the festive Christmas. Beyond the festivities, the general public in China also recognizes two great meanings.

The Republic of China was born in an era of turmoil. Shortly after the announcement of the democratic system, the ambitious Yuan Shikai wanted to uproot this young sapling of democracy, newly planted in a thorny garden. He wanted to plant imperial thorns in its foundation, hoping that it would quickly spread throughout the garden. However, with a thunderous roar, General Cai E raised the banner of righteousness in Yunnan, receiving unanimous response from people across the country who favored democracy. Yuan Shikai, who was lying on the dragon bed in the Xinhua Palace, dreaming of the Hongxian dynasty, finally woke up from his beautiful dream and ascended to heaven. This premature imperial restoration movement disappeared with his imperial soul. Therefore, we can say that December 25th symbolizes the spirit of struggle for a democratic China.

After that, the Anhui clique, the Zhili clique, the Fengtian clique, and other major warlords fought for supremacy in the Central Plains. Small warlords in Sichuan and Fujian competed for fiefdoms, and the situation of large and small warlords' civil wars plunged the people into misery. The great Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at that time, as the principal of the Whampoa Military Academy, punished the wicked and comforted the people. He led a benevolent army and wiped out the evil and dark forces, which aroused the jealousy of Japan, who had been eyeing the country. They abandoned the gradual economic aggression and adopted a military annexation approach, resulting in the turmoil in Wanbaoshan and the attack on Beida Camp. In one night, the vast territory of Northeast China changed color. Chairman Chiang deeply knew that our country's preparations were not sufficient at that time, and the time was not ripe, so he had to endure humiliation and work hard in silence. At that time, the general public with shallow knowledge not only failed to understand Chairman Chiang's painstaking efforts and long-term planning, but also made groundless accusations and rash actions, which ultimately led to the reckless and impulsive Xi'an Incident.

The Xi'an Incident was a major turning point in the rise and fall of the nation. Chairman Chiang, empty-handed, negotiated with the rebellious troops amidst drawn swords and bared bows. His life was in danger, and the captain of the guards, Chiang Hsiao-hsien, died in the line of duty, and the chief of staff, Qian Dajun, was injured. The urgency of the situation caused panic throughout the country. With Chairman Chiang's deep wisdom and strong courage, he finally safely escaped danger on this memorable day. Chairman Chiang's great character of benevolence and courage, after being tested by this incident, shone even brighter, winning the unanimous respect and support of the people throughout the country. From the initial outbreak of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident to the Japanese army's surrender in Zhijiang, throughout the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people were able to maintain national unity and remain steadfast. The inspirational power of Chairman Chiang's handling of the Xi'an Incident was truly a major driving force. On the ninth anniversary of Chairman Chiang's escape from danger in Xi'an, let us pay the highest respect to this uniquely great leader! (Zhang Deqian)

### A Great Place That Is Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer. Hainan Island's Scenery Is Still the Same. The Sea, Land, and Air Transportation Network Is Actively Being Developed.

This is the scenery of Hainan Island five months after the Japanese surrendered.

From the airport to Haikou—the capital of Hainan Island—you will see a strange sight: vehicles outside the city drive on the left, while inside the city, the new regulation of "driving on the right" has already been implemented. This is the so-called gradual change. The roads on Hainan Island are very well-maintained. This is probably because there are no heavy vehicles driving on them. The enemy, Japan, deliberately managed it in the past few years, vainly trying to build Hainan Island into the strongest naval base in the Far East. Therefore, their first step was to reorganize the island's transportation lines. This isolated island, with a circumference of 250 miles, is interwoven with modern cement highways, allowing heavy military vehicles to transport military supplies back and forth.

Four Major Airports Occupy Key Military Points

The long and slender railway network connects the various key points on the island. On this circular island, two major lines intersect vertically. There are also four major airports on the island, occupying key military points, with perfect equipment.

Now that things have changed, most of the railway vehicles have been damaged in this war, the coal has been used up, and the station parking lots are full of ruins and rubble. The locomotives are also rusted and lifeless, standing still. The railway width also seems to be unsuitable for modern needs.

The gasoline shortage has paralyzed most of the highway transportation.

Hainan Island's prosperity has always relied on imported and exported goods. However, there is no news of imported ships now, because they are afraid of touching the sea mines. The lack of ships is, of course, also an important reason. Shipwrecks dot the ports everywhere, and there is no way to salvage or repair them at present.

Sea Transportation: A Blessing in the Eyes of the Qiongzhou Overseas Chinese

To revitalize the victorious Hainan Island, the most important thing is, of course, the revival of commerce. At the same time, to restore commerce, it is necessary to restore transportation first, so that Hainan Island can contact the outside world. Currently, Hainan Island is in a state of semi-isolation.

First, let's talk about sea transportation: before the war, Haikou's foreign sea transportation was very developed. At that time, there were regular navigation lines that regularly sailed to the ports along the coast of mainland South China, as well as Tokyo, Vietnam, Singapore, Siam, the Philippines, and other places, which was very convenient for passengers. When the Japanese invaded Haikou, it was suspended. Now, Qiongzhou has been liberated, and everything presents a new phenomenon. The righteous people living in Guangzhou Bay are also buying boats and returning home one after another. The shipping between Haikou and Guangzhou Bay has resumed. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation, only sailing boats are temporarily running, sailing once every two or three days. As for the speed, if the tide is favorable, it only takes 24 hours to arrive. The round-trip fare is about two or three thousand yuan. It is heard that the navigation to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places is being restored, which is good news for the general public.

Land Transportation: A Total Length of More Than a Thousand Kilometers

Secondly, let's talk about land transportation. To put it bluntly, our Qiongzhou land transportation is quite developed due to the completion of the highways in various counties, and Haikou has also become the starting point for transportation, with local products and foreign goods gathered here as the center. As for the types of vehicles, there are automobiles, rickshaws, horse-drawn carriages, and ox carts. Statistics show that there are a total of 23 ring-sea and longitudinal routes in Qiongzhou, with a total length of 1,474 kilometers. The convenience of land transportation can be seen. Later, after another renovation, branch lines were added to the villages and towns in various counties, which was even more convenient. What deserves our attention is the 175-kilometer-long railway from Sanya to Beili. However, due to the lack of coal, there are very few trains. Now that the enemy has surrendered, transportation should have been very convenient. However, in the west, bandits often appear, so it is still unsafe. The east is relatively peaceful, and cars are running as usual. However, since there are not many cars running now, the passengers are very crowded. Each car has about 20 people, and people are standing and sitting on the sides and roofs of the cars. The car owners only care about making money and do not care about the safety of the passengers at all. The Qiongzhou authorities have already ordered a crackdown to protect the safety of passengers. As for the fare, it has risen from 700 yuan to 5,000 yuan from Haikou to Jiaji, which makes the general public feel that they "cannot return home even if they have a home."

Utilizing the Airport, Aviation Business Will Flourish

Speaking of aviation, there used to be Eurasia Civil Aviation, flying from Guangzhou to Haikou via Maoming. After the Japanese invaded, they expanded the original airport in Haikou several times. Airports were also added in Wenchang, Lingao, Jiaji, Changjiang, and Sanya, among which the Haikou Airport is the largest and Sanya is the second largest. The equipment is also quite complete. There are currently no civil airlines flying. We predict that once the above-mentioned airports are utilized, the aviation business will develop smoothly.

The sea, land, and air transportation of Qiongzhou are roughly as described above. Although it is not convenient now, it is undoubtedly bound to become more prosperous and convenient in the future due to the increase in land lines and airports.

The main export goods are fruits, peanut oil, sugar, and coffee. The main import goods are rice and manufactured products. Very little rice is produced on the island and has always relied on French Indochina. Currently, transportation is cut off. In the eyes of outsiders, the islanders seem to be all vendors selling bananas to make a living.

Blue Sea and Yellow Sand: A Tropical Landscape

Haikou City seems to be dormant under the tropical sunlight. The trees are lush, and the palm trees sway in the breeze, fully demonstrating the tropical landscape. The azure sea water washes the yellow sandy shore, surging with white foam.

The island's commercial scope is extremely small, limited only to the island itself. There are very few cars on the road. The standard of living is also very low. But on the surface, the islanders seem to be very satisfied with their lives.

Life on the island is indeed very quiet and peaceful. There are many small coffee shops on the street corners. A cup of milk coffee costs 25 yuan in legal tender. Most of the people who patronize these coffee shops are barefoot women who sit and chat and rest after returning from work. Martial law is temporarily in effect on the island, and no one is allowed to pass after 10 pm every night. The streets are densely packed with armed sentries.

French Colors Dominate the Whole City

The buildings here are deeply dyed with French colors. Most of the new buildings are in the Japanese style. Although many Japanese have been detained in concentration camps in the suburbs, Japanese men and women can still be seen on the streets from time to time. The first to be sent back to their home countries were probably the 15,000 Chinese laborers who were forcibly conscripted by the enemy.

Catholicism has a great advantage on the island. The magnificent and clean Red Cross Hospital and many small schools in the city are all achievements of Catholicism. The Customs Office is the most modern building on the island, and its structure is quite exquisite.

The damage from the air raids is limited to buildings such as ports and airports. In Haikou City, there are no traces of past air raids.

The food problem on the island is not very serious at present. The rice reserves are gradually thinning, costing 25,000 yuan in legal tender per stone. The authorities are now working hard to restore relief efforts. Photos of Chairman Chiang and the Father of the Nation can be seen everywhere.

In the past, the fuel on the island, the coal stored after the Japanese army surrendered, has now been used up, and electricity has also run out. Fortunately, the island has abundant forests. The fuel problem should not be a problem. At present, most of the islanders use oil lamps.

A Great Place to Escape the Cold: It Is Expected to Be Realized Soon

The islanders are threatened by snake plagues, but at the same time, snakes are used as a delicacy in the vegetable plate. Other mountain delicacies and seafood are roasted dog meat and jellyfish, which taste like peanut butter.

This is a great place that is warm in winter and cool in summer. In winter, even in the current month of December, the climate is only 75 degrees Fahrenheit, which makes people feel quite mild and comfortable. There is absolutely no so-called cold wave invasion.

In the near future, I think Hainan Island may become the ideal winter resort in our country. (Li Ming)

### American Troops in Tokyo - Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department from the December Issue of Life Magazine

The diligent Japanese people have already cleared away the rubble and debris in Tokyo, the most devastated area among Japan's bombed cities. Various vehicles have also resumed operating on the streets of the modernized urban center that was partially spared from the bombings. The Japanese Parliament is preparing to convene 21 million women with the right to vote in Tokyo during a special general election meeting; this is the first time they have gained suffrage. Out of the three million soldiers stationed in the mainland, all but a few non-commissioned liaison troops have been demobilized. There are still a total of six million Japanese soldiers abroad. General MacArthur has lent Japan one hundred tank landing ships, allowing for the repatriation of 100,000 Japanese soldiers each month. MacArthur has ordered the abolition of Japan's conscription system. MacArthur also uncovered a large sum of $250 million that the army and navy had secretly embezzled from the government. Japanese tourists had not been able to visit Mount Fuji for five years, but now the American flag is flying on its peak.

Current Status of Shintoism

Many people were spared from wartime sacrifices because they maintained contact with the Japanese mainland; some of them went to the mainland to avoid the heavy bombing. This winter, many people can still barely survive by fleeing to the countryside, where the food supply is much more abundant than in the cities.

Japan has now been defeated and is under the strict rule of an American officer, but the Japanese people remain largely unchanged. MacArthur has abolished Shintoism in Japan, prohibiting it in schools, government offices, and shrines. Only Shintoism related to individuals or families will not be interfered with. The Japanese still bow to their Shinto emperor and shrines. However, a certain Japanese legal expert has made a surprising declaration, saying, "The Japanese people do not believe that they are descendants of the sun goddess in Shintoism."

The Japanese Emperor, who once instigated the Gohan Revolution to resist the military cliques, has not gained any benefits. His private property is estimated to be worth 100 million yuan, and he owns 3.2 million acres of land. Now, his property and the assets of 67 male and female members of the royal family have been frozen. Currently, his annual budget of 400,000 yuan must be carefully reviewed by the Americans. Japan's reparations may reach 330 billion yuan, and he may be personally responsible for paying a portion of the reparations, but Japan's annual revenue is only one percent of this huge sum.

Changes in the Lives of Japanese Police

In Tokyo, the most noticeable and significant change is the reform of the police force. Japanese police have historically ruled the people with terror. When arresting someone, a Japanese police officer only needed to order them how to walk, how to turn, and how to follow them automatically, and the arrested person would usually obey. When Japanese people asked police officers for directions, they always bowed deeply. Even now, they still do. Last week, the head of the American Counterintelligence Corps sharply criticized the Japanese police for using terror tactics and illegal confiscation. In the eyes of Americans, the behavior of the Japanese police demonstrates their rudeness, shamefulness, and immorality.

Women and Chocolate

It is easier for American soldiers to solve their "woman problem" in Tokyo than anywhere else. This problem can often be easily resolved in Hibiya Park, next to the Imperial Palace Gardens. The women who are approached are not the common geishas, nor are they the readily available maids or prostitutes. Instead, they are often housewives who have broken away from family supervision. The routine involves teaching them some basic English and giving them something to eat, like chocolate or fruit. So far, Japanese men have expressed anger about this behavior.

The US government's misguided exchange rate policy for US dollars and Japanese yen has brought American soldiers to the brink of personal bankruptcy. American soldiers' salaries are paid at the fixed rate of 15 yen per dollar (i.e., one yen equals six and a half US cents). However, due to the black market exchange rate, the Japanese currency has inflated from 27 billion to 44 billion yen in four months. One US dollar can be exchanged for 70 yen. An American soldier needs 20 US dollars to spend a night out without alcohol.

The Popularity of New American Dances

People in the military can travel for free and buy souvenirs at department stores run by the US military. Their best asset is cigarettes. If they can get past the military police, each pack of cigarettes can be exchanged for two US dollars. Some brothels in Japan are allowed to remain open. The dancers in Tokyo have learned new American dances (Jitterbug), but they are threatening to strike, saying that a plate of sweet potatoes is not enough compensation for dancing new dances. General Eichelberger has planned a large-scale sports program, including baseball, football, ice skating, and field hockey, to solve the entertainment problems of American soldiers.

A Glimpse of Winter in Tokyo

In Tokyo, 250,000 people live in dilapidated shacks, and hundreds of thousands more are homeless, sleeping in parks. This winter, there is also a shortage of rice. The black market price has risen to $4.25 per pound (calculated using the pre-war exchange rate). In 1941, the price of rice was four cents per pound. Japanese officials claim that 8 million people will die from freezing and starvation. The American authorities believe this number is exaggerated, but a high mortality rate is inevitable.

To pay for food imports, Emperor Hirohito plans to sell his pearl treasures worth $4 million. The United States is forcing the Japanese to redistribute arable land, selling one-third of Japan's unclaimed arable land to tenant farmers. Although this method may help with future wealth distribution, there is actually no wealth to be divided this winter. As a result of the air raids, only 25% of Japan's major industries remain, and there are ten million unemployed people!

Under these circumstances, public discontent and lack of rest are difficult to avoid. Among Japan's 36 political parties, the smallest Communist Party is the most organized and disciplined. The Japanese Communist Party has no connection with Moscow and is the only party in Japan that calls for the abolition of the Japanese Emperor. Nevertheless, they still need to liberate themselves from tradition, because one female communist, while expressing her opinion on Japan, still shed tears.

Wanderers sleeping on public park benches are living the lives of beggars and petty thieves.

When demobilized Japanese soldiers visit Tokyo shrines, the US military stations troops to prevent American soldiers from approaching.

In Hibiya Park, American soldiers and Japanese women sit and chat by the lake, looking out at the towering building of MacArthur's headquarters across the way.

American Women Learning Industrial Design

Before the war, household furniture and equipment in the United States were mostly designed by men. Currently, there are more and more women engaged in this emerging industrial design field.

Pictured: American women practicing in the industrial design department of the Chicago American Academy of Art. The increase in the number of female students trained at the school over the past four years has exceeded 75%. Students in the design department first receive simple art training and gradually learn formal operations. In the picture, a female student is attaching a part of the handle to a chair using an iron punch.

### The New Development of the Northeast: A Base for Asian Industrialization

The industrial empire built by Japan in Northeast China will be taken over by China. This property should be considered part of the reparations Japan should pay for its occupation of China. At the same time, it is also an opportunity for China to begin its industrialization. Japan has invested hundreds of millions of yuan in Northeast China's industry. At this moment, industries such as steel towns, chemicals, machinery, artificial gasoline, and timber have not suffered severe damage from the war. China will not have to pay any price to Japan for this takeover, because the ownership of the industry mostly belongs to Japanese government-operated companies. The United States is paying close attention to the situation of the transfer of industries in Northeast China. The reasons are as follows:

After China takes over the industries in Northeast China, the management work done by the Japanese will definitely be transferred to Chinese hands. Therefore, perhaps American managers and engineers will be called upon to help with the operation. At the same time, how to raise funds, whether it is for operation or for China to transfer to any individual or company, is also a problem. Perhaps China will hope for American investment. Furthermore, the market for the products of this new industry is a fundamental issue. Perhaps American economists will be hired to design the best way for Northeast China's industry to generate wealth.

There is a rather complicated factor here. The Soviet Union enjoys half ownership of the South Manchurian Railway (according to the Sino-Soviet treaty, the Changchun Railway is jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union). It may demand a share of ownership of the Northeast China industries owned by the Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau operates many industries such as mines, factories, shipping, telephone, and telegraph. The development of Northeast China's industry should be done cautiously.

Editorial

### The Shadow of Japan's Democratization

Since General MacArthur, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, occupied Japan, only a little over three months have passed. With a calm attitude, he has gradually unfolded measures to deal with post-war Japan. Such as the arrest of war criminals in batches, the dissolution of financial groups, the improvement of individual farmer relations in Japan, and the separation of Shintoism from the national polity, etc., are either directly related to the liquidation of war responsibilities, or lay a good foundation for a new democratic Japan. Within such a short period of time, and with such achievements, we cannot but deeply admire General MacArthur's outstanding talents. Yesterday, news from Tokyo by the Associated Press and the United Press stated that General MacArthur's headquarters declared that the basic work for building a new Japan has been completed, and Japan's ancient feudal system has been eradicated. Whether this report is reliable is questionable. If it is true, it can only be regarded as an unofficial observation from General MacArthur's headquarters at best. In the process of Japan's democratization, the imperial family, which currently represents the highest institution of the Japanese feudal system, still exists. We cannot hastily believe that "Japan's ancient feudal system has been eradicated" just because of the improvement of individual farmer relations in Japan, the dissolution of financial groups, or even the separation of Shintoism from the national polity. Because the Japanese imperial family is the center of the Japanese feudal system; if the emperor has not been removed, how can it be said that the feudal system has been eradicated?

Regarding the issue of the survival or abolition of the Japanese imperial family, opinions do not seem to be consistent at present. Observers qualified to comment on Japanese issues, either advocate abolition or advocate preservation, naturally each has their own reasons. Generally speaking, conservative people in the United Kingdom mostly believe that the Japanese imperial family is the center of reverence for the people. In fact, it is only a puppet and does not directly participate in politics, and should be retained so that a democratic system can be gradually established with the imperial family as the center. This is originally the view of British "realists." They believe that once the Japanese imperial family is abolished, the entire country may fall into a state of anarchy. This kind of argument seems to be quite powerful in the United States as well. However, in both the United Kingdom and the United States, there is also a group of people who advocate that the Japanese imperial family should be abolished immediately, and there is no room for an emperor in the new democratic Japan. The general intention of China is that the Japanese imperial family should be abolished; although the Chinese government has not issued an official statement on the issue of the survival or abolition of the Japanese imperial family to this day.

At present, the handling of the Japanese imperial family issue is stagnant at such a stage. The Potsdam Proclamation did not explicitly mention the Japanese imperial family issue; Japan proposed conditions when accepting the Potsdam Proclamation, requesting the preservation of the imperial family; but President Truman's reply did not accept Japan's conditions, only stating that the Japanese imperial family must be subject to the control of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. The major Allied powers only have passive consensus on the issue of handling the Japanese imperial family and have not yet reached active coordination. This matter really should not be delayed any longer!

We believe that in the process of Japan's democratization, the imperial system must be eliminated and not allowed to exist again. Although it is reported from Tokyo that senior officials of General MacArthur's headquarters hinted that if the Japanese Emperor can have unique insights, find ways to solve the rice shortage and unemployment problems, and follow the democratic system implemented by General MacArthur in Japan, so that the Japanese people can obtain a reasonable and perfect government, then the Japanese Emperor and his system can be maintained permanently, and Emperor Hirohito himself hopes that the matter of abdication will be decided by the Japanese people, but the survival or abolition of the Japanese imperial family is now not just a Japanese internal affair that can be decided by the Japanese people themselves, but an international issue that should be decided by the United Nations. We should not forget! It must be known that both Tojo and Konoe organized governments after receiving the Emperor's "great mandate." Legally speaking, the Japanese Emperor is the biggest war criminal in this war of aggression. Whether it is in terms of invading China or in terms of invading the United Kingdom and the United States, he should bear full responsibility for launching World War II. Now that the war is over, we should first eliminate this evil system that not only harms the Japanese people but also destroys world peace. The Japanese imperial family and the British royal family are originally two fundamentally different systems. The formation of the British government is determined by public opinion, and the king does not bear the actual responsibility of organizing the government. However, Tojo and Konoe of Japan came out to organize the government not because of the support of the parliament, but because they received the "great mandate." Moreover, the army and navy directly listened to the orders of the Japanese Emperor, and the cabinet had no right to intervene in them. Therefore, the Japanese Emperor is directly responsible for politics. We cannot treat the Japanese Emperor and the British King as the same. The Japanese imperial family is the supreme commander of this war. Regardless of the current intentions of the Chinese government, the Chinese people have the right to point out that the Japanese imperial family is the head of the Japanese war criminals, and demand that the imperial system should be abolished in the construction of a new post-war Japan.

From the standpoint of the United Nations, after mobilizing the strength of the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to defeat the enemy, if the imperial system is allowed to continue to exist, it will only plant the seeds of future trouble. The Japanese people's psychology has always retained extremely deep Shinto superstitions, believing that they are God's chosen people and that they have the sacred mission of ruling the world. It was for this mission that they launched the "Greater East Asia War." Although their self-proclaimed "Greater East Asia War" has been defeated, if the imperial system is allowed to exist, it may give the Japanese people the illusion that their "sacred mission" has only suffered a temporary setback and still needs to be completed in the future. Concentrating the strength of the four countries of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and still not being able to eradicate the imperial system, will make the Japanese people even more believe that their imperial family is "mandated by heaven," increase their arrogance, and once again become a scourge of the world. General MacArthur's separation of Shintoism from the national polity in Japan was originally an extremely wise measure, but if the "god" in the Shinto religion is still allowed to exist, and allowed to be the ruler of Japan in politics, then the future Japan will probably still not be a democratic Japan, but still a Japan ruled by a "god," a Japan of the Emperor of "Hakkō ichiu." This is really a hidden worry for world peace!

For the sake of lasting world peace and for the sake of the interests of the Japanese people, the existence of the imperial system is ultimately a shadow on Japan's democratization. We should clear this shadow, and then the world and Japan can obtain light.

Commercial News

### Buyers Come One After Another: The Gold Market Rises Again, US Dollars Also Rise Gradually

Yesterday, sentiment continued to be good, and the US dollar rose gradually under the large-scale purchases of manufacturers and importers, stimulating the gold market. Many people in the stock market sold their stocks to buy gold, gradually forcing a short squeeze situation. After an initial price of 768,000 in the morning, buyers came one after another. With demand exceeding supply, the price had broken through the 800,000 mark by noon, and finally hovered around 810,000, an increase of 52,000 compared to last Saturday. General public opinion believes that the exchange rate should not be too high (below the market price). General sentiment has also changed its old view, resulting in even more demand for gold and US dollars. The prospect is likely to be good. Gold jewelry is priced at 86,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars are still hovering around 450 yuan. Although demand for dark exchange is high, supply is also pouring in, still standing between eight and one angle.

The US dollar's firm market in Peiping, coupled with rumors that many free merchant ships will arrive this morning, with yarn mills and importers rushing to buy, has resulted in a visible depletion of chips. After opening at a low price of 1280 yuan in the morning, the market improved. After breaking through the 1300 yuan mark, the situation became more firm, and factory demand poured in even more. People in the industry were forced to sell at high prices, so they made up for it in the afternoon. The market became even more profitable. Finally, there was still a lot of demand at a price of 1380 yuan, an increase of more than 120 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong tickets also stabilized accordingly. As a result, old goods were good for five yuan, and new goods rose by three yuan.

### Chinese Stocks Have Reduced Sharpness, Public Bonds Are Gradually Trending Downstream, and the Foreign Stock Rally Has Not Ended

Public bonds are lacking in pulling power due to the industry's interest turning to stocks. Category C bonds broke into the 700 yuan range as soon as they were listed, and then fell to below 650 yuan. Retail investors still tried to show off, and although there was a pull-up in the middle, they failed to re-emerge from the 700 yuan mark. At noon, they were still selling off due to floating more, falling to around 640 yuan. As a result, they continued to fall by 55 yuan to 90 yuan compared to last Saturday, and the miscellaneous brands approached their difference, and the market situation was very dull.

Initially, Chinese stocks felt somewhat disappointed because the securities association meeting the previous day was not smooth. Many large investors sold their stocks for gold, forming a state of oversupply. Cotton mills retreated from 740 yuan to 690 yuan, and Mayar retreated from 570 yuan to within 480 yuan. After entering, the rise in the gold market stimulated something. Large investors in the securities industry still came to absorb them. Finally, the rebound was seen outside the 500 yuan and 700 yuan mark, and the situation was still firm, but the chips were not very tight (observe that the price ratio of cotton mills to gold on the 15th of this month was more than 1,500 shares, and this morning it only needs a little more than 1,000 shares). As a result, compared with last Saturday, the giant stock cotton mills rose slightly and Mayar fell slightly. Small stocks, New Light, Ping Jingfu, and Quanxing each rose by one and a half yuan. The unpopular old stocks are still being snapped up by strong factions, soaring.

Foreign stocks are still stable, with demand and supply matching. The whole city is just hovering. Customers and securities dealers still have a stomach for bottom-fishing. As a result, Jardine Matheson rose by another 100 yuan, and Jardine Brewery and Paper each rose by 30 yuan. The rest of the unpopular stocks were slightly inferior.

Yarn and Thread Rise with the Price of Gold

Yesterday, the yarn market was still stable. Because the price of gold frequently reported high, all kinds of yarn and thread rose by 10,000 yuan. Although the Sichuan gang had a strong appetite for old heavyweight goods such as 20-count special double horses and golden chickens, and rose to 650,000, there were people selling other 20-count yarns, and there were not many transactions. The same industry's buying and selling of 16-count yarn was still not lonely, and people did not see very much glory, and the foot seemed to be unstable.

### White Coal Lumps Rise Again, Prices for Firewood and Charcoal Vary

White coal briquettes are very popular and have rebounded. White coal dross and coal briquette factories will receive flat-price distribution, and their popularity has become sluggish, and prices have slightly weakened. Bituminous coal dross transactions are idle, and market conditions are flat and soft. Fewer firewood boats are arriving than before, and prices are slightly firm and stable. Cargoes of charcoal are still pouring in, and the market seems to be slightly lower.

Yesterday, the Allied Wheel loaded 700 tons of coal from Tianjin. In addition, the Zhongshan, managed by the American President Shipping Company, loaded 9,000 tons from Qinhuangdao and arrived in Shanghai at about 3:00 pm yesterday, mooring at the Puxi Lanyancong Wharf.

### Rice Falls, Oil Rises

Soybeans, Raw Peanuts, and Bean Cakes are All Popular

Rice market digestion is bleak, japonica and indica average fatigue of 200-300 yuan, White Yuan from Danyang cargo shipment arrived in Shanghai 300-500 packs, Hexia wheel arrived in Shanghai also 200-300 packs, Qingdao Gang suspended, market shape returned to Xiaoliu 600-700 yuan, flour from Beiyang is selling very well, up another 200 yuan, the situation is rising, the oil market is still very beautiful with Ning Gang Zhoushan continuing to enter, up another hundreds to thousands of yuan, this street is still cleared due to flat oil, The soybean price is still rising with Fujian and Zhejiang continuing to enter, up another 300-400 yuan, and the later situation is still firm. Raw peanuts are being sold a lot on this street in winter, and the supply is less than the demand, up another 1,000-2,000 yuan, bean cakes from Taiwan are being processed and connected, Shantou is acting very briskly, up another 200 yuan, and the wine market is also good, up 500 yuan, and the trend is turning from fatigue.

### Allied Ship Loaded with Large Quantities of Northern Goods, Seafood Rises and Falls Mutually

The Allied ship that sailed to Tianjin to load goods has arrived, loaded with more than 400 pieces of flue-cured tobacco, walnuts, red dates, and more than 2,000 pieces of sundries.

Shima large slices of raw sun-dried longan, yesterday I heard that Jian Banghao had more than ten boxes shipped, this is the first time to offer new here.

Because of the small output of Xuzhou daylily, the market seems to rise slightly, while sales in Fujian and Guangdong are still good.

The arrival of Ming Wang Ginseng is rare, and the previous market reported a rise in pepper, but now the market is leveling off due to a lack of sales. The sales of fennel are gradually slowing down, and the market has reported a decline. Winter mushrooms are being purchased by Hong Kong gangs, and then it is the season (New Year's dishes), so the price has risen, and the arrival of bamboo shoots is still numerous, and sales are waiting to be developed.

### Dyeing and Weaving Factories Are Expected to Recover

Small and medium-sized dyeing and weaving factories were severely restricted by the enemy's pseudo-controlled electricity before the victory of the War of Resistance. After the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated the electricity for production, it was not restricted in order to encourage production. Therefore, they have been connected to electricity and started work one after another, and the Longhai Line, Sichuan, and Yangtze gangs have started, and the dyeing of various factories has become extraordinarily busy. From this speculation, the recovery of the dyeing and weaving industry is expected.

### Four Banks and Two Bureaus Are Open as Usual Today

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Today is the National Renaissance Festival and the Yunnan Uprising Anniversary. Member banks of the Municipal Banking Association are closed for one day as usual. However, the four Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks and the China Trust and Postal Remittance Bureaus in this city received orders from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in the Beijing-Shanghai region, and are still open for business as usual according to the Chongqing example. There is no change in commercial banks. In addition, Chen Hang, the Financial Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance in the Beijing-Shanghai region, has returned to Shanghai after visiting Chairman Chiang in Beijing and reporting on his work.

### Opinions on Book Capital, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Is Still Discussing

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The issue of converting the book capital amount of counterfeit currency in industry and commerce has been discussed separately by the Accountants Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and various experts. There is no specific method yet. The Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has set up a subcommittee to study the matter. The Qian family took the method of collecting counterfeit coupons at the rate of 200 to 1, which is not suitable for the conversion of book capital, and there is no other comparable standard that can be promoted. A few days ago, they sent letters to various industry trade associations to solicit opinions so that they could be summarized, and then standards were determined to make recommendations to the competent authorities. In recent days, various industry trade associations have submitted this letter of opinion to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce one after another. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is still discussing this issue seriously. According to the responsible persons of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry and Cotton Cloth Industry Trade Association, the three methods assumed by the former Accountants Association are still worthy of approval. However, if the government also has to strictly levy income tax and profit tax on the false surplus obtained after the conversion of the book capital amount, it is equivalent to a virtual account and actual levy, and the industry and commerce of this city will not be able to tolerate it. Therefore, it is advocated to suggest to the government that the tax collection should be handled in a flexible manner to avoid operators being overly concerned when calculating the book capital amount.

### Economic Briefs

Regarding business and industrial registration, the registration fee should be directly submitted to the Municipal Treasury. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to reduce the back-and-forth travel for applicants, has consulted with the Finance Bureau to request the Treasury to send personnel to the Bureau to collect the fees. The Finance Bureau has agreed to do so.

The local carpentry and plumbing trade unions, facing difficult living conditions, plan to further increase wages. For carpentry, each worker would receive 1,150 yuan per day, and for plumbing, 1,100 yuan, both without meals. The implementation is scheduled to begin on New Year's Day.

The "Yongsheng" steamer arrived in port this afternoon, carrying 11,200 bags of flour as relief supplies, along with commercial goods including over 1,100 cases of preserved eggs, several hundred bags of red dates, and a large quantity of Chinese medicinal materials.

The Fuel Management Committee has approved the allocation of a portion of coal dust to various mechanized briquette factories at a fixed price. Distribution is expected to begin within a few days.

Due to eager demand from foreign merchants and rising gold prices, the market prices of knitted goods all increased yesterday.

### Sugar Inventory: Change in Sales Method; Distribution to End Before January 15

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The local sugar industry, after the victory, still has an inventory of six to seven thousand bags of sugar, entirely owned by Chinese merchants and not enemy or puppet assets. They voluntarily petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to sell it to the public at a fixed price to meet market demand. The Bureau approved the price and public sale method, allowing them to proceed. The highest price was set at 400 yuan, with subsequent reductions. This occurred before February when the market was extremely short of supply, and prices soared to 600-700 yuan, with no goods available. After the news was released, the general public eagerly anticipated it. However, the sugar was stored in the Zhongfu Warehouse, which was sealed due to its involvement with salt, leading to repeated requests and delays for over a month. By that time, new sugar shipments had arrived, and prices began to fall. The Enemy Property Administration Bureau then distributed sugar under its control to the association for public retail, further weakening market prices. Recently, the stored sugar has been unsealed, and the association, through members like Zheng Yizhou, has again petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to change the method to supply users directly. The general plan is as follows: (1) The 2,700 dan of sugar originally intended for sale to consumers will be sold proportionally to previously registered users based on their last allocation. (2) The 1,200 dan of sugar originally intended for sale to government agencies, hospitals, and pharmacies will be included in the above plan if those entities do not need it. (3) The selling price will be determined by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau's first-phase fixed price sale, based on the types and proportions. (4) The 2,300 dan of brown sugar will be returned to the various businesses for self-sale. All of the above methods have been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. The association will notify hospitals, pharmacies, and retailers regarding their sugar allocations. Agencies and organizations with allocations of 1,200 dan must pay and purchase the sugar from the association before January 15. Any remaining sugar after that date will be sold by the association through other channels.

### Christmas Charity Soccer Match: Donghua's New Lineup to Face British Navy

2:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park; Mayor Qian to Kick Off

The charity soccer match organized by the Shanghai Sports Association to raise funds for the Relief Association for Comrades Who Sacrificed in the War of Resistance will feature the local Chinese soccer powerhouse Donghua team against the British Navy cruiser Black Prince team. The match will be held at 2:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park on Changping Road. Tickets are priced at 400 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and honorary tickets at 10,000 yuan. This match is expected to be the most exciting soccer game after the victory and will cause a sensation among fans throughout the city. The referee will be Wu Shouheng, and the linesmen will be Huang Renyi and Li Guoyi.

Donghua's lineup has been strengthened by the addition of the former Lianyi trio of Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, and Liu Xianhan, making it the most complete lineup. However, due to Qian Shangyi's injury, Jia Youliang will move to the right wing position, and Chen Mingzhe will play right wing, which may slightly reduce the offensive power. The Black Prince team is considered one of the best in the British Navy in Shanghai, so Donghua is bound to have a tough battle.

To make the match more grand, Mayor Qian has been invited to perform the kickoff ceremony, and a charity ball will be auctioned off on the spot to increase revenue. Donghua's lineup is as follows:

Zhang Banglun

Li Ning Zhuang Youren

### Exhibition of Chinese Woodcuts to Be Held in London

[British News Agency, London, 24th] In cooperation with the British Parliament and the Chinese News Reporting Department, a Chinese woodcut exhibition will soon be held in London. The purpose of this exhibition is to enable the British art world to understand the significance of Chinese woodcuts during the war and how Chinese woodcuts maintained their artistic value in difficult circumstances. These woodcuts were collected by the Chongqing Woodcut Art Association. Most of the woodcut artists are not professionals, but only take woodcuts as an amateur pastime. The woodcuts represent the reality of Chinese life, so this exhibition has profound significance in terms of culture, art, and education.

### Cradle of Chinese Library Talent: Wuchang Wenhua Library School Builds a New Fortress on the North Bank of the Jialing River in Chongqing

"Private Wuchang Wenhua Library School" is not an unfamiliar name. No matter in the north or south of the Yangtze River, as long as "Wenhua" is mentioned, no one does not know it. It and its predecessor—Wuchang Wenhua University—have had brilliant records in Chinese education, cultivating many talents for China. Its reputation abroad is as valued as "Tsinghua" and "St. John's," recognized as the only authoritative and long-standing training institution for library talents in China. Today, most of those engaged in the library business are directly or indirectly from the cradle of "Wenhua."

Withdrawal Westward with the Army

After the War of Resistance, "Wenhua" withdrew westward with the army, moving from Wuchang to Chongqing. In the campus of Qiujing Middle School in Zengjiawan, it found a few buildings to continue classes. Unfortunately, in the summer of the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1941], it was destroyed by enemy aircraft, and it had to find another location. Finally, through the efforts of teachers and students, in less than a year, it built a new fortress on the north bank of the Jialing River, next to a sparsely populated town.

Liao Family Garden is a small garden that has been barren for a long time. Over the past three years, through continuous management and cultivation, it has become a beautiful little world. On a green triangular piece of land, there are three or five buildings. All kinds of flowers and plants welcome visitors from near and far throughout the year, such as peach and plum blossoms in spring, oleanders in summer, osmanthus and chrysanthemums in autumn, and double plum blossoms in winter, making this small world always dressed up, standing out among the mountains north of the Yangtze River.

Gradual Expansion

When it first arrived at Liao Garden, there was only one building, where classes, meals, meetings, and sleeping all took place. Over the past three years, buildings have been built one after another, and today, they are sufficient for use. The spacious auditorium, the large library, the comfortable classrooms and bedrooms allow students to grow in a stable life. Recently, electric lights have been added, which makes this small garden even more colorful. Every night, looking from afar, the lights are interwoven into a beautiful night scene. The students are able to study peacefully today, first of all thanks to the old principal, Mr. Shen Zurong. He is a wise leader with a spirit of struggle and extraordinary perseverance!

Internal Departments

The school is now divided into two departments: Library Science and Archives Management. Including the two new classes recruited this summer vacation, there are only five classes, totaling 70 students. They are all enthusiastic young people from various provinces, all with education above high school. They all have great confidence in these two emerging subjects. They must study practical theories and techniques at the school for two years. Such as: Library Management, Administration, Chinese and Western Cataloging, Chinese and Western Bibliography, Classification, Various Classification Methods, Ordering Methods, Reference Work, Reference Books, Serials, Indexing, Character Searching, Archives Management and Administration, Archives Cataloging, Chinese and Western Archival Science, Information Management, Historical Materials Arrangement, Personnel Management, Official Document Research, Typing, Internship...etc., and each course overview, Chinese, English, second foreign language (German, Japanese, French), statistics, must complete one hundred credits within two years. Before graduation, a graduation thesis must be submitted, which must be approved by the professor meeting before graduation is allowed.

Experts Teach

The school's professors, regarding specialized subjects, are all domestic library science authorities and archives experts. Last year, Li Yongquan was hired to teach Museum Science. This year, Lu Huashen and Li Yongzeng were hired to teach Library Management, Administration, and Selection, etc. This shows that the school authorities, even in the case of extreme economic difficulties, are still constantly recruiting good teachers to strengthen the lineup.

In addition to specialized courses, the school authorities also deeply emphasize students' learning of foreign languages. For example, the organization of the English Speaking Society aims to allow students to use what they have learned in practice, to correct their pronunciation, tone, posture, and habits, to develop habits, and gradually lead them to the right path. Some courses, such as Cataloging, Reference Books, Bibliography, and Archival Science, also adopt original books and are taught in English. Also, such as projecting film books Microfilm Reading, etc., to train their audio-visual ability. All these facilities can promote the long-term progress of students.

Adding New Books

The library seems to be more active in this library school. In addition to being busy all day collecting materials for professors and helping students choose reference books and answer questions, it also needs to do a job and make a demonstration. Therefore, it has an extra responsibility than ordinary libraries. Under the principle of independent funding, new books are constantly flowing into the picture museum and are constantly circulating, like the daily journey of the sun, so that every reader has the right and opportunity to quickly enjoy new books. Recently, the British and American embassies have donated many books, and the American Library Association and various library schools have also donated a large number of books to the school, which will further increase the efficiency of the school library.

The school has a research department for the research of library science and archival science. For eight years, it can be said that there has been no moment of rest. There have been many new discoveries and creations. Unfortunately, because of the difficulty of wartime materials, it is impossible to print and publish them for the reference of the library community. Now that the War of Resistance has ended in victory, they are preparing to work hard in this area, and there will be some contributions in the near future. The person in charge now is Professor Xu Jialin, who holds a master's degree in library science from the United States.

Going Back to Wuchang

Restoration is the most urgent thing at the moment. As President Chiang said, restoration is not restoration. It is reported that "Wenhua" will not only move back to Wuchang, but also expand into a college, and will also establish a demonstration library, always walking ahead of people, assisting and leading the development of China's library business. However, the vastness of China needs too many people and too few talents. In order to train talents, in order to build libraries, there is a need for talents, and even more高级 talents and teachers. It is heard that the British and American library communities, in order to help the construction of our country's libraries, have successively established graduate scholarships for the further study of our country's library scholars. The relevant authorities in our country have also paid attention to this and will, in recent years, gradually select library science students to study abroad. Associate Professor Xu Jiabi of the school has already left for England at the beginning of last month to investigate the library business in England, and will also go to the United States to investigate library science education.

Methods for Returning Heaters Determined

Since the Bureau started handling the registration for the return of heating equipment, the number of requests for return or allocation has been very large, but the number actually found is limited. It is impossible to confirm each one due to time constraints. Therefore, three principles have been decided for handling the heating stoves: (1) All heating stoves that have been thoroughly reviewed by the Bureau and found to be without any doubts will be returned to the original owner. (2) Heating stoves needed by the U.S. military will be temporarily borrowed during the period of undetermined ownership.

### Second Group of Japanese Nationals and Prisoners of War to Be Repatriated Today

A total of 4,691 Japanese nationals and prisoners of war to be repatriated were completely assembled in the city center's Municipal Government the night before last. The Port Transportation Command of our army, together with the Customs, Military Police, and the Japanese Nationals Management Office, sent personnel to conduct inspections, which lasted until late at night.

### Indian Ship Godavari Hosts Journalists for Tour

The first Indian warship Godavari to come to China after the victory hosted Chinese and foreign journalists from this city for a tour yesterday morning. This ship is one of the 150 warships of India and was built in England during the Second World War in 1943, weighing 1,600 tons. In the past two years, it has participated in battles in England, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean. After Japan surrendered, the ship sailed into the port of Singapore at the same time as the first batch of warships. The captain of the ship, Choudhry, is an Indian, only 36 years old. Yesterday, he instructed his officers to be responsible for guiding reporters to visit various departments on the ship.

According to Captain Choudhry, the ship sailed here from Hong Kong three days ago and is scheduled to return to Hong Kong tomorrow (26th) and transport 300 Chinese people to Hong Kong. The mission after arriving in Hong Kong is undetermined, but it will belong to the transportation aspect of the work.

### Robbery on Julu Road; Intense Gunfight between Police and Robbers; Two Robbers Killed While Fleeing into the Tongshantang

[Our Newspaper Report] A robbery occurred at No. 1 Jinfuli, Julu Road, at 9:30 yesterday morning. Within two hours, the police authorities surrounded and arrested the robbers inside the Tongshantang nunnery at the intersection of Carter Road and Xinza Road. Both sides fought, firing more than 20 shots. As a result, two robbers were killed on the spot, and three male and female robbers were captured. The details are recorded below:

Entering the Room Under the Pretext of Interrogation

At about 9:30 yesterday morning, three robbers suddenly broke into the home of Xie Songshi at No. 1 Jinfuli, Julu Road, under the pretext of interrogation. They took out firearms and threatened the master and servants, and looted a large number of ornaments such as gold bracelets, gold lockets, diamond rings, and gold rings, and fled with the loot. Afterwards, the victim reported to the Xincheng Branch under its jurisdiction. Chief He immediately ordered a large number of police officers to patrol and arrest the robbers within the jurisdiction, but the robbers had already fled far away.

Hiding in the Nunnery, the Police Surrounded It

Not long after, at about 11:30, the bureau received a secret report that the robbers in this case were hiding in a Yuangue Nunnery in Tongshantang, No. 266 Lane, Carter Road and Xinza Road. Deputy Chief Chen personally led 30 to 40 armed police officers and drove there in police vehicles. They first surrounded the nunnery, and the police officers bravely rushed in. At this time, the robbers inside heard the news and each grabbed firearms and planned to break through the encirclement, first firing to resist arrest.

Two Robbers Killed in the Fight

Deputy Chief Chen took the lead and fired back. The two sides exchanged fire for more than 20 rounds. As a result, two robbers were fatally hit on the spot and fell to the ground and died. One male robber and two female robbers were captured alive. Two pistols with live ammunition and all the stolen goods were seized. It is reported that the two robbers killed were named Xu Huilin and Shi Shengyuan. One of them was from Guangdong. They were both wearing Western suits and leather shoes.

After receiving the report last night, the Laozha Branch immediately sent police officers to apprehend them. However, there was no one in the room, so they left officers in disguise to wait. It was not until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning that one person arrived, claiming to be Li Wenlong, 30 years old, and was immediately arrested. However, the robber was extremely cunning and pretended to defecate and escaped through the window, causing injury to his left foot, and was eventually captured.

### A Merry Christmas Day – Remember the Displaced

— By Our Reporter, Jie

We are all new people, growing up in every corner of Shanghai, decadent and corrupt, dark and fallen. Now we must bravely repay this extravagant life! Comrades, let's train our minds and bodies today so that tomorrow we can be useful pillars of the nation. Wake up! Wake up! Let's go to classrooms and factories together. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, brilliance and candor are the guidelines for learning. Let's sweep away decadence, corruption, darkness, and depravity in our work! Comrades! Work hard! We are all new people, the force for building a new China!

Amidst this enthusiastic and magnificent song, we saw nearly a thousand refugees and orphans in desperate need of relief from charitable people in society, which moved me greatly! On the eve of the first Christmas after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, all of Shanghai was intoxicated in a whirlwind of revelry—perhaps not noticing that in a very quiet corner of the city, the refugee and orphan shelter of the Shanghai Relief Institute in Caohejing, although they were also holding a Christmas celebration party, there were still more than forty poor fellow countrymen sleeping in hospital beds without anyone to sympathize with, pity, or help!

Eight years of gunfire may have cultivated cruelty in people's hearts. Although this horrific reality may have shocked them for a moment, it passed like fleeting clouds, becoming a thing of the past, and was easily forgotten. Seeing the grand hotels, ballrooms, and theaters filled with dignitaries, with guests feeling right at home, a scene of extravagant luxury, in stark contrast to those collapsing and dying on the street corners, reminds one of the ancient lament, "Behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the roads, lie frozen corpses." Whose responsibility is this?

Many people only have hatred, disgust, and contempt for so-called vagrants, beggars, and petty thieves, without sympathy, compassion, or love. This corner of humanity is forever abandoned by society, living a miserable, subhuman life. Humans are, after all, the spirit of all things, great and loving. If they were not lost in their original nature, no one should despise their tragic plight. I can say with certainty that their becoming social dregs is not their fault, nor is it their responsibility!

The Shanghai Refugee and Orphan Shelter was formerly the World Red Swastika Society's Livelihood Training Center for Displaced People. During the puppet regime, it was renamed a "Labor Camp." After the victory, it became a military camp for the National Army. It covers an area of over ninety-seven mu. On October 26th, the Social Bureau ordered its takeover. On November 1st, it officially began to take in refugees and orphans in Shanghai. In a short period of time, they mobilized their own strength to remove the knee-high weeds and piles of rubble, and established an elegant and beautiful environment from the barren land. The first thing that makes people feel good is the orderly arrangement, which combines solemnity and reverence.

As of Christmas Eve, they had taken in 966 refugees and orphans, most of whom were sent by the police, with very few coming on their own. There were 449 healthy adults, 464 children, 6 women, and 47 elderly and weak individuals, all classified according to their age and gender. The composition of these nearly a thousand people is extremely complex, including vagrants, beggars, local ruffians, hooligans, petty thieves, and even robbers, who are generally recognized as social outcasts; orphans who have lost both parents; illegitimate children who have been heartlessly abandoned; civil servants; small businessmen; and even college students who have attended institutions of higher learning. How to manage and guide these thousands of people is a serious problem. Director Zhou Zuwang pointed this out to the reporter, saying that they are now focusing on guidance, and have also established management of daily life, education, and special education groups. As for daily life, in short, spiritual well-being is paramount, and it is completely militarized. In addition to the two grand assemblies for raising and lowering the flag in the morning and evening, where spiritual speeches are given, physical training, labor service, individual talks, group discussions, etc., are carried out constantly every day. Their slogan is "Education and cultivation go hand in hand, work and study are equally emphasized." Their educational principle is that reading is more important than work for children, work is more important than reading for healthy adults, and care is the sole task for the elderly and weak.

To cultivate the self-governance spirit of the refugees and orphans, everything is managed by themselves. All forty-odd staff members are only responsible for supervision. They have divided many small units such as districts, households, and groups. In addition, according to the skills of the refugees, they have formed many work teams, such as masonry, carpentry, kitchen, sewing, and laundry.

Many refugees and orphans suffer from skin diseases, venereal diseases, and opium addiction, accounting for about 30% or more. The Health Bureau has now sent two doctors and three nurses to be stationed in the shelter to be responsible for diagnosis and treatment. If they encounter serious illnesses, they will be sent to Renji Hospital, Municipal Epidemic Hospital, or Municipal Hospital for treatment, so health is guaranteed.

The shelter is authorized to accommodate 1,200 to 1,500 people. The police department hopes that they can accommodate up to 10,000 people. Under the circumstances of a lack of money and materials, they can only hope that generous philanthropists in society will donate generously.

Finally, the reporter would like to report that Mao Zipei, Director of the Social Welfare Department of the Social Bureau, Huang Tiren, Section Chief, and Commissioner Yan Changyan, etc., specially went to participate in the party last night, which is indeed admirable. Indeed, we cannot ignore this group of forgotten fellow countrymen.

### Anecdotes of Christmas

— Zhang Peiyue

The Origin of Christmas

Generally, everyone believes that December 25th is the birthday of Jesus, and Christmas is to celebrate his birthday. In fact, the exact date of Jesus' birth has not been recorded in detail in history. In the beginning, people of various European and Western countries held seasonal celebrations every year during the winter solstice, roughly starting around December 25th. Later, Christians used the celebration of Christmas to replace the original entertainment, and that day gradually became Jesus' birthday. Everyone believed that Jesus was born at midnight on December 24th. But even now, when celebrating Jesus' birth, many ancient ethnic seasonal amusements are still preserved.

According to legend, the first celebration of Jesus' birth was by King Atal of England in York, England, in the year 521 AD.

Christmas Cards

"Merry Christmas" cards were invented by the British. At first, everyone just offered verbal congratulations. Later, the British became accustomed to calling out this phrase at the windows of every house on Christmas morning. Soon, everyone wrote greetings on letters and sent them to each other. It was not until 1846 that ten artists in London, named Kang Joseph, used lithography to print greetings and colored pictures, about the size of business cards. That was the first Christmas card.

Santa Claus

Santa Claus, wearing red clothes, dragging a white beard, and carrying a large bag of toys, can be said to be completely created for children. Therefore, Santa Clauses in various countries are all deified from the gods who protect children. The German god who protects children is Christkindleln, and Santa Claus is called Kriss, Kringle. In the Netherlands, it is St. Nicholas, and Santa Claus is still called St. Nicholas, but after it was introduced to the United States, it became Santaclaus. Although his name is slightly different in various places, his mission is the same, which is to increase the children's interest. So he always carries toys on his back, slips down from the chimney, and puts things in the socks hanging in front of the bed.

Speaking of the origin of chimneys and socks, it is also very interesting. It turns out that the British have long had a custom similar to our year-end cleaning, and before the New Year, they must clean the chimney to let good luck come in. With a little combination, Santa Claus comes down from the chimney every time. Hanging socks was thought of by the British and Americans. Originally, Dutch children put their shoes by the stove, saying that Santa Claus must see the shoes placed there before putting the toys in them. The British and Americans are smarter and use socks. Socks can be stretched and are larger, so you can put more things in them.

Christmas Tree and Holly

The origin of the Christmas tree is said to be inconsistent. Some say it was started by Luther, who said that in order to show his children the scenery of snow-covered trees under starlight, he cut down a small fir tree in the garden, installed it in the house, and lit candles on it. That night was Christmas Eve, and later generations followed suit. But some say it was started by St. Boniface, who once cut down a large oak tree in the forest. When a gust of wind passed, many trees fell, but only a small fir tree stood still. St. Boniface then declared that this was a sacred tree, and it was used to decorate Christmas. The origin of using holly at Christmas is also very early. The ancient Romans used laurel branches to represent peace, victory, and joy. Later, Christians followed suit and used laurel branches to decorate windows, meaning that Jesus had entered. The British used holly to replace laurel branches. It is said that the white flowers of holly symbolize holiness, and the red berries symbolize the blood that Jesus shed for sinners. The holly wreath represents the crown of thorns worn on Jesus' head when he was martyred.

### Christmas and Santa Claus

— Lequn

The god of war roared Santa Claus away so that he could freely reinforce his troops and satisfy his murderous desires. As a result, wars of aggression began, from East Asia to Western Europe, to the entire globe. The breath of continuous gunfire filled the world. Would Santa Claus dare to come down on Christmas Day?

But finally, the aggressors surrendered. Thus, this year's Christmas is going to be more lively than in previous years because people believe that in a "peaceful" world, Santa Claus will definitely be able to come to earth and grant people happiness. We also hope so, so that our people who have suffered for eight years can stretch their waists comfortably. Perhaps the government has designated Christmas as our national revival festival, with this intention in mind!

In the shop windows on the street, there are many different images of Santa Claus and Christmas trees, Christmas cards..., which make the street look too beautiful. Just like the chairman's portrait after the victory news was released, it's enough to rival it! Schools are on holiday, companies are closed, a scene of peace.

I went to the home of a foreign friend. Coincidentally, the friend's father, mother, younger sister, and younger brother were all squeezed together, arranging a Santa Claus pattern the size of a room. Looking at their energy, it's really interesting. According to that friend, they had already spent hundreds of yuan, and it wasn't completely successful yet. I was grateful to the friend's mother, who said that I was a foreigner and didn't know the inside story. She pointed out in detail, "This place is where Santa Claus enters, this place is where children receive blessings, this place is..." What surprised me was that Santa Claus doesn't go through the door or window, but comes down from the chimney. No wonder that friend's mother said I didn't understand the allusions.

This year's Santa Claus will be able to come down on Christmas, which is promising. Everyone who is looking forward to Christmas thinks so. As for me, I am the same.

### News Background

— Yu Fan

Herbert H. Lehman, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, submitted a budget of 135 million yuan for the second year to Congress.

Someone in London suggested to a newspaper that it launch a movement to relieve European refugees, willing to save their own extremely meager rations and donate them to the cause. As a result, 30,000 people responded in mid-January.

An American soldier in France wrote to the editor of a newspaper, saying, "We really eat too richly and too deliciously. There are so many people, men and women, old and young, in Europe who are in a state of starvation. Why must we be fattened like pigs? Please give the surplus to make up for the deficiency. I am willing to eat less."

The United States and Europe form a sharp contrast. Words such as freezing, starvation, and hunger have long been forgotten in the United States. Christmas turkeys are being transported in truckloads; to avoid overcrowding for meat purchases, the price limit has been increased by two points per pound; the rationing system for leather shoes has been canceled, and they can be produced in large quantities and purchased freely; new "nylon" rayon stockings will be on the market for Christmas; Victory Company's unbreakable records are on the market; RCA's new money-free motors.

It is estimated that Japan will need to import 3.4 million tons of food next year, worth a total of 300 million yuan, to avoid famine. However, Japan itself does not have the ability, and it must not only rely on the Allied countries to lend this huge sum of money, but also rely on Allied ships to transport the food to Japan.

In China, eight years of continuous war and constant flight and wandering have made the people's need for relief extremely urgent, which no one dares to speculate on.

### My First Christmas

— Zheng Biru, Junior Two, McTyeire School

Ah! How happy was Christmas when I was a child!

A week before Christmas, my mother and aunt took us to the company and asked us to choose our favorite gifts. I wanted a jump rope and a box of coloring paper, which I had wanted for a long time, although I couldn't color yet. My brothers each chose a seven-star sword with seven red stars and an air gun.

A few days before Christmas, I also attended Christmas service (it was my first time in my life). When the choir sang hymns in a melodious voice and slowly walked in, the two people in front held a golden cross and a bright red flag. I thought it was angels coming, and I happily clapped my little hands and shouted, "Ah! Mom, look! Little angels, little angels!" Mom quickly stopped me. The day before Christmas Eve, the living room was decorated with a Christmas tree, which was full of gold, silver, and colored Christmas bells and small stars, and countless light bulbs, blue, red, ... of various colors. A big star, one side silver and one side gold, stood at the top of the tree, which was also what we had been looking forward to for a long time. On Christmas Eve, after we finished our dinner, we sat in the living room and waited. After a while, the lights went out, and we shouted in unison, "Ah!" This shout was both surprised and happy. The surprise was that the lights went out, but at the same time, the lights on the Christmas tree turned on, so the shout turned into joy again. Ah! How beautiful! The five-colored lights reflected the gold and silver bells and stars, emitting a brilliant light that flickered, directly assaulting our eyes, almost unable to open them. The happiness at that time was indescribable. We jumped and laughed around the tree until we were tired before stopping.

This was my first Christmas as a child. Now, peace has arrived, and light has returned to the world. This year's Christmas is the first Christmas after peace, so I want to return to the way it was before and celebrate it to the fullest.

War

### Rommel and the Wounded

— Jin Chun

In the North African campaign, the battle for Tobruk was the most intense. The city was entered and exited by the British and German armies several times, changing hands several times, resulting in a tragic seesaw battle. The following story took place in Tobruk and was told by a certain captain, the director of the British wounded soldier hospital in the city.

The first time Rommel's troops broke into Tobruk, the hospital still calmly carried on as usual. The wounded soldiers who were carried in, whether British or German, were treated the same.

The hospital suddenly became quiet. Rommel himself came. He stood and looked at the rows of hospital beds. He walked to a German wounded soldier, simply asked a question, and quietly listened to the wounded soldier tell him. He walked along a row of hospital beds, stopping from time to time to ask other German wounded soldiers.

Finally, Rommel greeted the British captain. He said, "Our soldiers tell me that they are treated and cared for by you exactly the same as the British soldiers. You lack medicine, but you still share it with them. I will send someone to send medicine to you. You continue to work like this, and no one will bother you." After he finished speaking, he strode out.

The medicine was quickly delivered, and the hospital used these medicines to save many British and German soldiers. The hospital proceeded with its work without any interference or harassment.

After a few days, the situation suddenly changed. Rommel's troops abandoned the city and retreated, but when they retreated, the hospital was not damaged. The war situation shifted, and victories and defeats alternated, but the hospital only cared about carrying on with its work as usual.

A secretary visited the President "for official business." Led by the messenger to a large living room, walking to the shade, a man next to him was constantly shining his shoes, making a creaking sound. The secretary was about to walk past without paying attention, but was shocked and stopped.

It turned out that the President was shining his own shoes.

"You are the President, doing such a thing is quite unsightly when seen by others, especially by noble ladies..." The secretary had often heard people say behind his back that the President often showed the crude attitude of a country person, and kept it in his heart. This morning, he couldn't help but say this.

Lincoln, however, smiled and gave the secretary a surprised look:

"Oh, is shining shoes a shameful thing? The President and the shoe shiner are both public servants who work for the world. There should be no lowly occupations in the world, only people with inferior hearts."

It is hoped that today's high-ranking officials can all listen to President Lincoln's famous saying: "The President and the shoe shiner are both public servants who work for the world!"

### The Bells of Christmas Eve

— Zhang Deqian

Sparse forests and short hedges trembled in the sharp north wind, and oak trees had already borne fruit. On this moonlit and windy night, the bells of Christmas Eve burst into sparks, flying from the spire over the rooftops, illuminating the souls of mankind.

The bells in the church, with their rises and falls, proclaimed peace and charity, and proclaimed all the virtues of mankind. The echoes of the bells fell on villages and hotels, fell on the hearths of deep mansions, warming the souls of mankind.

On this sacred night, no one heard the bells in the church without feeling a star in their heart, illuminating their dark future, giving them more courage to move forward on life's journey. Because the bells of Christmas Eve proclaimed peace and charity, which Christ exchanged with sacrifice.

### Mrs. Truman, Sr.

— Shen Yikun

President Truman's mother, Mrs. Martha Truman, was ninety-three years old last month but is still very healthy. She constantly reads the Congressional Record to know what those congressmen are saying. She said, "I want to live to be a hundred."

"Harry (President Truman's name) sends me the Congressional Record," she said with a smug look.

She has always read her books herself, and "without glasses." It wasn't until last year, because of a fall that affected her eyes, that Truman's sister, Miss Mary, read to her.

Mrs. Truman, Sr., and Miss Truman live in Grandview, Jackson County, Missouri, not far from Kansas City. The whole town has 800 people. They live in a modern yellow flat house with five rooms, separated from Main Street by a path. Half a mile outside the town is the old Truman farm, where Mrs. Truman spent most of her years.

Mrs. Truman was born on November 25, 1852, on a farm in what is now the southeastern residential area of Kansas City.

In 1881, she married John Truman, and two years later, moved to Lamar, 100 miles from Grandview. On May 8, 1884, President Truman was born there.

Mrs. Truman, Sr., pays close attention to Congress, but this is just one example of her concern for world affairs. She carefully reads the evening newspapers every day and clips them out. She likes to listen to the radio, especially news programs and operas.

Mrs. Truman, Sr., said, "I don't think humans should have invented the atomic bomb. I am against killing. Harry is also a supporter of peace."

She had three grandsons who participated in World War II: Sergeant Harry Truman (named after the president) recently retired from Camp Robinson and participated in the campaigns in France, Germany, and Austria; and two were the sons of the president's brother, Vivian.

### Relief Supplies Sold at Reduced Prices: Methods Should Be Improved to Ensure Benefit for the Common People

— Jun Yi

American aid relief supplies have been arriving in Shanghai in large quantities since last month, including wheat, flour, medicine, old clothes, canned goods, fruits, construction materials, burlap sacks, trucks, and more than ten other items. As of now, in addition to a large amount of flour distributed by the Shanghai branch of the China Relief Administration to various charitable organizations and Jewish residents, flour and canned food items have also been placed on the market for general sale at reduced prices. According to Mr. Jiang Tingfu, Director of the China Relief Administration, in his previous discussions in Peiping, these relief supplies are not entirely free to the people, but are sold at reduced prices in a work-for-relief program, with prices reduced by five percent compared to market prices. Therefore, the price of flour in this city is also 1,900 yuan per bag. We have no objection to the use of reduced-price sales for relief supplies, but the purpose of transporting these supplies to China is to relieve the general public suffering from high prices after the war, especially the poor who cannot make a living. Flour, in particular, is a daily staple for the common people, and is rarely consumed by those above the middle class. Therefore, it seems too harsh to set the price at only five percent lower than market prices, which is not in line with the meaning of "relief." Not only do the common people benefit very little, but most still suffer from being unable to afford it. Furthermore, many stalls that mainly use flour to make pancakes and other foods have not lowered their prices despite the abundance of flour on the market, which is strong evidence. As for the canned fruits and dried apricots sold at reduced prices recently, some cans cost as much as 2,500 yuan, which is difficult even for the middle class to afford. As a result, they are inevitably bought by the wealthy, and the advertisement prominently stating "Charitable Relief Sale at Reduced Prices" seems even more out of touch.

### Vehicles Keep Right, Right Hand Wrap Red Cloth

— Gu Si

Regarding the fact that vehicles will drive on the right side of the road starting on New Year's Day, I am afraid that Chinese and foreign drivers will find it difficult to reform suddenly, causing accidents and endangering everyone. Regarding this matter, I have recently come up with a method that may be helpful. That method is to have every driver wear a red cloth on the sleeve of their right hand, so that the driver pays attention at all times. When the vehicle wants to turn, the driver will see the red cloth and be shocked, and naturally turn to the right. It can also serve as a constant reminder to drive to the right when driving parallel. This method is also very effective for bicycles, tricycles, and rickshaws. If this is done, it will become a habit after two months.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor: After reading the "Carefree Theory of Lung Disease" published in your newspaper these past few days, I couldn't help but feel secretly overjoyed. I am 21 years old this year, and I recently weighed 128 and a half pounds. My chest is also quite broad and comfortable. From the outside, my physique seems very strong. However, since an X-ray last autumn revealed tuberculosis in my left lung, I have been taking good care of myself. Although my condition has not worsened in the past year, it has not improved either. I usually cough up a lot of phlegm, and sometimes there is blood in it. This prolonged condition is a deep concern. Now that I have seen your column, I have a few questions, namely, is the method of "compressing the lesion" effective for all stages of lung disease? And how much does it cost approximately? My family lives in Jiangbei, and I am lodging alone at school. All expenses must be budgeted in advance. I would be especially grateful if you could recommend a reliable doctor. Your column has always taken serving the public as its responsibility, and I believe it will not disappoint me.

(Editor's Answer) Compression therapy (i.e., pneumothorax) is best treated early. Please seek treatment at the Red Cross Hospital. The fee is approximately 10,000 yuan or more per year.
