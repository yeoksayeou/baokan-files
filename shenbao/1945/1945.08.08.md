### Japan, Based on Established Policy, Supports East Indies Independence; Establishes Preparatory Committee for Independence in Java

Shonan, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Based on the Japanese Empire's public declaration to China and foreign countries on September 7th of last year, permitting the independence of the East Indies people, the Japanese Southern Army has been implementing various measures to achieve independence as soon as possible. This includes specially appointing indigenous people to official positions, permitting the use of ethnic songs, and launching new national movements to provide political training to the East Indies people. Furthermore, an independent preparatory investigation committee has been established to conduct various preparations regarding the fundamental characteristics of an independent nation, guiding the people towards independence. In order to promote the establishment of an independent government, it has now been agreed to establish an East Indies Independence Preparatory Committee in mid-August, which was officially announced by the Japanese Southern Army at noon on the 7th.

Jakarta, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Regarding the establishment of the East Indies Independence Preparatory Committee, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Sumatra issued a statement on the 7th, the gist of which is as follows: Based on its established policy, Japan will establish the East Indies Independence Preparatory Committee in Java by mid-August. As soon as preparations are complete, independence will be declared immediately. This Preparatory Committee is the final stage of preparing for independence, and the mission of the committee is to build a nation with a high degree of national defense in the face of the enemy, based on justice, in order to meet the deep expectations of the residents and to repay the kindness of the various nations and peoples of the Greater East Asia.

### B-29 Formation Raids Hiroshima City, Uses New Type of Bomb, Killing and Wounding Innocents

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 7th that Hiroshima City suffered considerable damage due to an attack by a small formation of enemy B-29 aircraft yesterday, the 6th. The enemy aircraft appeared to have used a new type of bomb in this attack, and detailed information is currently being investigated.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The small formation of B-29 aircraft that appeared over Hiroshima City on the 6th dropped a new type of bomb on the urban area, causing many houses to collapse and numerous fires to break out, resulting in considerable damage. It has been found that this new type of bomb is equipped with a parachute and detonates in the air before landing. The power of the bomb is currently being investigated, but it should not be underestimated. The enemy intends to use this new type of bomb to kill innocent Japanese civilians, thus exposing the cruelty of the Americans to the world. The enemy's willingness to discard the facade of humanitarianism and start using cruel new weapons is due to anxiety about the current state of the war. It is anticipated that this type of bomb will continue to be used in the future, but the Japanese authorities are researching countermeasures with firm confidence. The power of new weapons is undoubtedly quite effective in the initial stages, but once a countermeasure is found, its power can certainly be lost.

### Keihin Area Suffers Another Air Raid; British Air Force Participates

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Approximately forty enemy P-51 aircraft, led by one B-29 aircraft, came to the Kanto area at 10:20 AM on the 7th, mainly operating in the southwestern sky of Keihin, and machine-gunned Japanese military facilities and urban areas. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the enemy aircraft that attacked this time included the participation of the British Air Force (type of aircraft unknown).

One Hundred Enemy Aircraft Blindly Bomb Toyokawa

Nagoya, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At approximately 0:30 AM on the 7th, a combined formation of approximately one hundred enemy large fighter-bombers invaded from near the coast of the Shima Peninsula and retreated after attacking the vicinity of Toyokawa with bombs, causing fires to break out in several places in Toyokawa City, but they were quickly extinguished.

Cruel Acts Arouse the Anger of Gods and Men

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since June 17th, the United States has repeatedly conducted indiscriminate bombing of various small and medium-sized cities in Japan at night, exposing its ambition to destroy the Japanese nation, which has a glorious history of three thousand years. After bombing the Keihin area, Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, etc., the enemy air force, since July, has begun bombing and burning Japanese small and medium-sized cities with the aim of killing civilians. While chanting the humanitarianism of Christianity, they fully demonstrate their brutal and inhumane inferiority in their actions. For example, when P-51 and P-29 aircraft attacked military facilities in various parts of Japan, they bombed civilians, including non-combatant citizens, innocent elderly, young children, and women, or machine-gunned them, with the aim of turning Japanese small and medium-sized cities into scorched earth. The majority of the small cities that have been sacrificed to the enemy's tyranny are undefended cities, with no military facilities or munitions factories. When carrying out bombing raids, enemy aircraft first drop incendiary bombs near the suburbs of civilian shelters, forests, and open spaces, surrounding the civilians in the urban areas before starting a concentrated attack with incendiary bombs, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties, which is a common occurrence, and as a result, the casualty rate among women and children is the highest. For example, in the war disaster in Chiba Prefecture, out of 954 deaths, 430 were men and 524 were women, with women accounting for 54% of the total. Furthermore, there were 234 children under the age of twelve (118 boys and 116 girls), with children accounting for more than 24% of the total number of deaths. In terms of material damage, the enemy also extremely demonstrates its inhuman and culturally destructive barbarism. For example, during the enemy air raid on Okayama City on June 29th, they destroyed and burned 23 shrines, 44 Buddhist temples, 93 hospitals, 31 schools, and many other famous historical sites. The enemy's bombing of shrines and Buddhist temples has been extremely blatant since the attacks on the Ise Grand Shrine, Outer Shrine, and Meiji Shrine. These tyrannical acts of the American military are truly intolerable to both gods and men and only arouse the indignation of the entire Japanese nation.

### Special Transport Vessel Management Promotes Work; Branch Bureaus Established in Various Locations

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Lieutenant General Hui Enzheng, Director-General of the Special Transport Vessel Management Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai a few days ago and met with Acting Chairman Chen to report on his work. On the 7th, he also gave a statement to visiting reporters as follows: In view of the importance of transportation under the wartime system, the National Government's Standing Committee specially established the Special Transport Vessel Management Bureau in Shanghai, and established branch bureaus in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Haizhou, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Tanggu and other regions, in order to facilitate the smooth exchange of military supplies in North and Central China, and to handle the registration of civilian ships and assist in civilian shipping affairs. Since the establishment of this Bureau, branch bureaus and offices have also been established one after another in various locations, but there are still people from all walks of life who do not understand the correct mission of this Bureau, and even mistake this Bureau for a tax collection agency, which is a mistake. Recently, the organization of this Bureau and its various branch bureaus will be strengthened in order to promote work.

Editorial

### The Kuomintang and Constitutionalism

Yesterday, the newspapers in this city carried Acting Chairman Chen's address at the Central Party's weekly memorial service: "The Kuomintang's Re-examination." Although we have not been able to see the full picture, the section on "The Kuomintang and Constitutionalism" alone has given us much food for thought. We would like to express our views as follows:

Regarding the Kuomintang, Acting Chairman Chen, with his advanced reputation, has made a re-examination, and his insights and feelings are certainly beyond the ordinary superficial remarks. From the standpoint of people completely outside the party, we are particularly pleased to read such a fair review, which we have not had the opportunity to do for a long time. The Kuomintang's development from the Tongmenghui to its current position as the only major party in the country is no accident. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the Three Principles of the People have deeply penetrated people's hearts. The Kuomintang's contributions to the country and the revolution over the past fifty years, and the historical deeds of the Kuomintang martyrs who fell one after another for the revolution and nation-building, are forever engraved in the hearts of the people of the whole country, and no one can deny them. However, the Kuomintang's development has been curvilinear. During that time, it repeatedly fell into depression and formed a disintegrated situation, which made the people of the whole country feel hopeless and leave. Even ambitious people within the party often had the depression of "retreating to observe the situation," like Mr. Gongbo. This is also an undeniable fact.

However, in any case, the Kuomintang, with its fifty years of glorious history, has deeply rooted its doctrines and strength in the people. It must not be pessimistic and disappointed by temporary bad phenomena, let alone be timid and fearful of the expansion of enemy parties, express narrow-minded exclusiveness, and fall into a dead end. This is also the consistent realization of many wise leaders in the Kuomintang in the past, and they have constantly used this to warn their comrades to take external tolerance and internal self-improvement as the basic attitude. Unfortunately, the situation has not been stable for years. On the one hand, there is the reality of regional divisions within the party, and on the other hand, it suffers from the coldness of the people outside the party. This phenomenon, rather than being said to be the misfortune of the Kuomintang, is more accurately the misfortune of China. We deeply hope that the Kuomintang can, under the fair self-examination of the highest leader, remove the old and renew itself, unite and strengthen itself in the near future. More importantly, it must be able to approach the people, fight with the people, and believe in the people in order to win the support of the people, and then it will be possible to concentrate the national strength and jointly complete the great cause of revolution and nation-building.

Under this premise, we deeply feel that Mr. Gongbo's correct argument on the Kuomintang and constitutionalism is indeed the victorious road to advancing toward revolution and nation-building. Mr. Gongbo said: "Why do people want to implement constitutionalism? Naturally, it is a sign of opposing one-party autocracy and demanding the return of power to the people. On this point, I really sympathize and am willing to do my best to promote it." Mr. Gongbo also firmly pointed out: "It has been thirty-four years since the founding of the Republic of China, and there has never been a constitution that has been adhered to by all. This is a joke and a shame... I not only sympathize with the implementation of constitutionalism and the establishment of representative bodies, but I am also more willing to promote the date of implementation and establishment." Mr. Gong is the highest leader of the Party and government in the Peaceful Region today. This firm, clear, and sincere attitude, I believe, will certainly be admired by all parties in the country.

In addition to congratulating the wise expression of the highest authorities of the Party and government in the Peaceful Region, based on our superficial views, there are still three points of hope that we would like to take this opportunity to raise to Mr. Gongbo and all those who have the Way:

First, although the people of the whole country believe that one-party autocracy is a major obstacle to the success of revolution and nation-building, we do not believe that the current politics in the Peaceful Region is one-party autocracy. Therefore, our current task is not to passively resist one-party autocracy, but to actively promote constitutional government, democracy, and the rule of law. We believe that today everyone, regardless of party or region, should strive to promote the implementation of constitutionalism, which is a positive and constructive cooperation, rather than a passive, divisive struggle.

Second, at the current stage, the common task of all Chinese people, regardless of whether they are officials or civilians, is to get rid of the imperialist aggression and the crisis of the destruction of our nation, and to unite the countries of East Asia to fight together. Therefore, we must concentrate the national strength internally. Only under this goal do we need a strong government that is trusted and supported by the majority of the people. This government must pay attention to political reform and make politics gradually clear. At the same time, this government must stand with the people. In order to realize this urgent requirement, our minimum goal is not the ideal "immediate implementation of constitutionalism," but to establish a true representative body as soon as possible, so that the government and the people can be closely united as one to cope with the urgent needs of the internal and external situation.

Third, after the establishment of the representative body and the sound execution of its tasks, uniting the people and the government to devote themselves to the great East Asian War against imperialism, the great cause of nation-building and restoration will unfold before us, and that is when we put forward the maximum goal, that is, the realization of constitutionalism. However, constitutionalism is by no means an overnight success. At that time, if we hastily prepare for everything, it will inevitably be too hasty. Therefore, after the establishment of the representative body, on the one hand, we must give full play to its role as a bridge between the government and the people, and on the other hand, we must actively promote the preparatory work for the implementation of constitutionalism, so that as soon as the war ends, it will be possible to convene a true National Assembly to discuss and formulate a constitution, and then establish a democratic republic government.

### Further Review of the Kuomintang (2)

— Chen Gongbo

Critique of the Essence of the Kuomintang

If we observe the Kuomintang from the position of an outsider today with a cool head, it is really nothing more than an ordinary political party, and sometimes not even as good as an ordinary political party. This is because ordinary political parties, during elections, still promote their party platforms and political programs to the public in order to win public approval and secure victory. As for the Kuomintang, apart from solemnly reciting the will of the Generalissimo in meetings, who would promote the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, the Outline of National Reconstruction, or the Three Principles of the People to the public? Not only do they not promote them to the public, but they themselves are merely reciting them as if they were sacred edicts, reading them aloud but not knowing what they mean. No wonder the Kuomintang boasts every year that it has 400,000 members, a number that neither increases nor decreases.

It is not enough for the Kuomintang to have created the name of the Republic of China, nor is it enough to have achieved the nominal unification of the country. Our greatest goal lies in equalizing land ownership and regulating capital. According to my research, equalizing land ownership is just a method, its spirit is to oppose feudalism; regulating capital is also just a method, its spirit is to oppose capitalism. The former aims to embark on the path of a modern nation-state, the latter aims to prevent the occurrence of social revolution. Only those who understand this purpose can be considered members of the Kuomintang, and only those who can implement this purpose can be considered a sound Kuomintang.

The Kuomintang's proposition was originally to oppose feudalism, but recently it has become a feudalistic group. I remember back in 1929, the so-called Reorganization Faction once opposed the designated system of the Third National Congress. In all fairness, when we insisted on electing representatives, we did not have the slightest intention of seizing power for the Reorganization Faction, nor the slightest intention of opposing the Nanjing government, nor the slightest intention of undermining the unity of the party. On the contrary, we were genuinely concerned about the future destiny of the party and the future of the country. If the delegates to the Congress are appointed by the central government, the members of the provincial party headquarters are appointed by the organization department, and the party headquarters of each county and city are also appointed by the provincial members, then the party headquarters will be separated from the party members, and the party headquarters will be even more separated from the public. If party members do not have the right to be elected or the right to vote, what relationship do they have with the party? If the organizational structure is not established by the will of the party members, what interest do they have in the party? Moreover, because of the appointments, the opinions of local officials have to be respected, and private individuals of local officials have to be appointed. Originally, the party was supposed to supervise officials who were party members, but as a result, it became an appendage and decoration of officials within the party. The party became a system of countless private individuals, and naturally became a feudalistic group. If the party becomes feudalistic, all ideals of democratic centralism become empty talk. If the party is not democratic, how can it be centralized? If power is fragmented, there is no way to be democratic. This is the biggest fatal flaw of the Kuomintang.

The Kuomintang was originally anti-capitalist, but since 1929, those in power have become capitalists. The party has neither the power to sanction them, nor even the courage to criticize a party member who holds political power, and the individual who holds the highest power is too concerned and not well-informed. Naturally, party members will use their positions to accumulate personal gain. Since the Kuomintang came to power, apart from creating many capitalists and petty capitalists attached to high officials, the Kuomintang has contributed too little to the country. The general public has no way to distinguish the Kuomintang from other political parties, let alone distinguish between Kuomintang warlords and bureaucrats. Anti-capitalism is out of the question, and even national capital cannot be formed by these bureaucratic capitalists. Isn't this the Kuomintang's fatal flaw?

To be honest, the Kuomintang can still nominally be in power today, not because of the party's platform, nor because of the party's strength, but because the public still remembers the past achievements of the Kuomintang's martyrs in building the nation, and because the country is in a difficult situation, and no party has been found to replace the Kuomintang for the time being. Therefore, they can only place their last hope on the Kuomintang. This is not reason but emotion, or even a kind of environmental compulsion. This kind of nostalgia is limited and has a time limit. If we do not reform as soon as possible, the Kuomintang will inevitably decline.

Thorough Reform of the Kuomintang's Organization

There is no doubt that the Kuomintang should urgently restore its original purpose and spirit. As for the organization, I am also willing to offer frank criticism. What I call organization includes organization, training, and strategy.

First, organization. I have always advocated that the party should be secret. I have two reasons: First, the Kuomintang is a revolutionary party, and the nature of a revolutionary party is to struggle. Judging from the overall situation in China, the revolutionary party has not succeeded, and is too far from success, so it needs to struggle. In military struggles, victory lies in knowing yourself and your enemy, so that you can win every battle. Military struggles are like this, and political struggles are also like this. Once the party is made public, it will not be able to know the enemy, but will be known by the enemy first. Then there will be no way to start the struggle. What's more, there are people who want to subvert the Republic of China, people who want to overthrow the government, and people who want to eliminate the Kuomintang. In this way, the general party members still do not understand the secrets of the party. I really don't know why. Second, there is a famous saying in the party's struggle: "Secrecy is power." Whether the party loses its power when it is made public or not, at least the party members believe that success reduces their enthusiasm for struggle. Now many parties are vying for the party to be made public, believing that without publicity, work cannot be done. They also have their own reasons. For example, social movements believe that if mass organizations are controlled by the party, registration requires the party's permission, and actions require the party's guidance, it is very convenient. But we must know that if mass organizations are voluntary and willing, then there is no problem. But if they are forced to comply with the regulations, they will first leave the masses with a very bad impression of the party. Moreover, if there is a strong party group of ours in a mass organization, then it does not matter whether it is controlled by the party or not. If the party group cannot play a role in it, what is the use of even if it is nominally controlled by the party? Naturally, some party members will say that the party has a way to manage the masses, but the government does not. But we have forgotten an important fact, that the majority of those in charge of the government are party members. Is it that a party member can be effective with the masses when serving in the party headquarters, but not when serving in the government? If not, then that theory is not valid. If so, then that is a serious problem of the Kuomintang itself, not whether the party is public or not, or whether the party controls mass organizations or not. Also, if the party needs to be public to be effective, then the Tongmenghui was not public at that time, and must not be public. According to this reasoning, there would be no revolution in China, and the Republic of China would not have been established. (To be continued)

### Conflict Between the Chongqing Government and the Communists Tends Toward a Political Solution

Central News Agency Dispatch: Chongqing, 4th. Broadcast of the situation of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists as follows: The Yan'an army has been resisting in the Chunhua and Yetai Mountain area for a week. On June 28th, after encountering fierce artillery fire from the Chongqing army, they retreated to the rear. The Chongqing army has taken over the area and stopped advancing. The two sides each have three divisions of troops facing each other. In the future, it seems that they will seek a solution through political negotiations.

Tokyo, 6th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Asahi Shimbun's editorial on the 6th, entitled "The Limits of the Kuomintang-Communist Civil War," discusses the following:

According to recent reports, there have been frequent incidents of armed conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist armies. The Communist side's goal is to insist on using the Soviet Union as a background to fight against the Kuomintang army in order to establish a united front regime. However, Chongqing has stronger military power than the Communist Party, so the Communist Party strives to avoid armed confrontation with the Chongqing army. However, as long as it is expected that there is absolutely no danger of expanding to a full-scale war of resistance, it will sometimes take the greatest risk in order to achieve political results. This time, the Communist Party had to give up its attack unwillingly, and its heart must be extremely sad. This armed conflict was probably not caused by the Chongqing army's provocation. Since the Communist Party holds the initiative, the armed conflict is only local, sporadic, and peripheral, but it is not impossible to expand to a full-scale armed conflict. They claim independence and autonomy in their war of resistance against Japan, but on the other hand, they are acting perversely. This is truly a tragedy between "tears and laughter" as Lin Yutang said. The tragedy contains comedic elements. In the China of the War of Resistance, this contradiction is also a tragicomedy. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have lost their autonomy in solving problems today. Both sides listen to the instigation of people behind the scenes. Therefore, within the China of the War of Resistance, only this kind of peripheral conflict cannot restrain the intentions of the people behind the scenes. The continued outbreak of civil war will never make the compromise of reconciliation suffer. General observation of this kind of armed conflict will lead to a full-scale armed confrontation between the two sides, which cannot be fully believed.

### Davies Visits London

Central News Agency Dispatch: According to TASS's London dispatch: Reuters issued a message yesterday stating that President Truman's personal representative and one of the four American representatives attending the Potsdam Conference, Mr. Davies, has arrived in England for a short visit. In London, Davies had discussions with US Ambassador Whitman and British Prime Minister Attlee, Foreign Minister Bevin, Minister of Trade Cripps, and other key members of the new British government. Mr. 合 arrived in London on August 3rd, but left on August 4th, and it is said that he passed through Paris on this trip.

### US Officials Deny Lending Huge Sums to Britain

Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to Washington: US Undersecretary of State Grew denied on the weekend that the US government has drafted a plan requesting Congress to approve the allocation of 30 billion to 50 billion US dollars to lend to Britain for economic assistance. He declared, "We, the United States, should indeed assist Britain in resolving its economic difficulties under all reasonable circumstances, but our State Department firmly believes that the authorities will give careful consideration to all British loans to our country."

### British and Soviet Representatives Discuss Draft of Trade Union

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to the Soviet News Agency in Moscow: Representatives of the British Steel Trade Union have discussed the draft of the World Trade Union with Soviet representatives on Saturday.

### Prince Xavier and Others Do Their Utmost to Defend Pétain. The Old General Saved Many Lives.

Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to Paris news: Prince Xavier of Habsburg, nephew of Prince Parma, was summoned to the Paris District Court on Monday to defend Marshal Pétain as a witness. Prince Xavier led the French secret movement and was detained in the famous Dachau concentration camp. He testified in court: "No one in the Dachau concentration camp slandered Marshal Pétain. After Pétain came out to mediate for France, countless French lives were saved." Later, General Leickart (Leickart was a mediator between the German and French people during the German occupation of France) testified in court, stating that in 1941, Marshal Pétain dispatched Grusard, the Attorney General of the French National Security Police, to discuss with former British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Minister Eden. The purpose of the French envoy to England was to change the British blockade against Pétain's side and to ease the anti-Pétain movement in Britain at that time." After Leickart's statement, Prince Xavier continued, "I had 120 servants of the Marquis under my command. At that time, many French aristocrats participated in the war. Marshal Pétain saw that the general aristocratic French were about to be executed by the Germans and tried his best to mediate to avoid the disaster. Therefore, in my Dachau concentration camp, there was indeed no one who said half a word against Marshal Pétain." After a slight pause, he continued, "In mid-May of 1943, I personally heard Pétain say, 'I firmly believe that the Allied forces will win, but this victory will take a long time. I am now a criminal, so I will never write any letters that have not been inspected or send any telegrams that have not been inspected.'" After Mr. A spoke, General Audet (Mr. Au is 62 years old and was a general in the French reserve army) testified, "Since July 1941, my French military headquarters has repeatedly encouraged the storage of weapons. By the end of this year, the military department had stored most of the weapons in secret depots. At that time, the Vichy government was still thinking of making a list of the necessary weapons and sending them to the Allied forces, intending to establish secret factories to manufacture a large number of armored troops and hand grenades. Therefore, it is now feared that all the large number of weapons are secretly stored somewhere. We can spend twenty years to discover these weapons." Later, General Laffargue testified, "The armistice agreement saved the lives of many French troops and the people of North Africa. This armistice agreement can also be said to have saved the lives of many British, Soviet, and even American people. We are fortunate to have Marshal Pétain leading us. If we turned to General Weygand or Foch, then everything of ours would have been lost." After the speech, the trial was adjourned again.

### Tomorrow is the 20th Air Defense Day. Four Major Trainings Will Be Implemented. The Police, Baojia, Messengers, and Lights are the Four Items.

Tomorrow (9th) is the 20th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will carry out various training exercises as usual. However, the training method of this session is different from the previous ones, focusing on comprehensive training with each air defense district as a unit, and the branch director is responsible for liaison and training with the Baojia. The details are as follows:

Mobilization Training of Police Stations

In this air defense training, the police of each branch bureau will carry out general mobilization training. The allocation of their duties is as follows: the first section is responsible for command and liaison, the second section is responsible for security, rescue, fire fighting, and fire extinguishing, the third section is responsible for investigating damage and examining corpses, and the fourth section is responsible for collecting intelligence, rescue, relief, and Baojia. Based on past experience, the goal of training is to become proficient and cope with the occurrence of emergencies, in order to avoid the state of extreme confusion in the event of air raids.

Implementation of Baojia Mobilization Training

(A) Carry out general mobilization training of Baojia with each air defense district or Lianbao as a unit. (B) When implementing this general mobilization training, the time of implementation of the training unit should be stipulated separately by each district in charge. In view of recent air raid experiences, attention should be paid to initial fire prevention and special shelter rescue training. Comprehensive rescue training of the Baojia rescue team and the rescue teams of each district organized by the rescue department of the Civil Air Defense Headquarters should be implemented. The branch director and the rescue team leader are in charge of command.

Communication Liaison Messenger Training

(A) Use the site of the Baojia general mobilization training unit as a damaged site to set up a local liaison office. In addition to implementing command and control training, simultaneously implement telephone communication between the site and the branch bureau or between the branch bureau and the second division of the police bureau, telephone communication for the air defense section, and bicycle messenger communication. (B) Organization and key points of the Bicycle Messenger Unit: Each district or Lianbao should organize a Baojia bicycle messenger team. The Baojia messenger team is responsible for liaison between the branch bureau and the site and between the branch bureaus. The branch bureau must organize a bicycle messenger team composed of police officers. The police messenger team is responsible for communication and liaison between the branch bureau and the headquarters and the air defense section, or between the headquarters and the branch bureau. (C) Road rate messenger training for branch bureaus and headquarters, designating the following seventeen branch bureaus: Huangpu, Lao Zha, New Cheng, Jing'an Temple, Jiangning Road, Putuo Road, Hongkou, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Yulin Road, Yangshupu, Taishan, Lujiawan, Changshu Road, Huashan, and Changning Road, and implement comprehensive training of special air defense teams. However, the situation of radio broadcasts will not be used on this training day.

Short Commentary

### The Enthusiasm of the Municipal Authorities

After the city suffered air raids, the lives and properties of citizens were greatly damaged. Rescue, treatment of the wounded, and accommodation of refugees all require huge sums of money, relying on citizens from all walks of life to contribute money and effort to achieve the effect of collective wisdom and effort.

Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, Deputy Secretary-General Hu, and others yesterday submitted valuable items to the Air Defense Headquarters to be used as air defense relief funds. This spirit of public service is commendable. Standing from the perspective of citizens, we should respond urgently to maximize effectiveness.

This newspaper previously launched the Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition, hoping that collectors of calligraphy and paintings would donate their works. After a considerable number are collected, they will be publicly exhibited for charity, with all proceeds going to air defense relief funds. Our intention is the same as that of Mayor Zhou and others. However, although there has been no shortage of participants in recent days, the response has not been enthusiastic. We have now hired three painters, Wu Hufan, Chen Dingshan, and Wang Yayang, to oversee the matter. We hope that people from all walks of life will emulate the benevolent spirit of Mayor Zhou and others and donate ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings. All donations are welcome.

### Shanghai Poor Children's Arts and Crafts Institute Appeals for Donations from All Sectors

The Shanghai Poor Children's Arts and Crafts Institute is experiencing financial difficulties, and the lives of poor children are difficult to sustain. Last November, the Civic Welfare Association of the city gave 4.48 million yuan in football donations. It has been eight months since then, and there has been no extensive fundraising, relying on borrowing to maintain operations. The institute has housed a total of 181 poor children by the end of May this year, and also issued 350,000 yuan in evacuation fees, that is, 90 children were automatically dismissed, each receiving a severance pay of 23,000 yuan, totaling more than 2 million yuan. Thirty-six other disadvantaged children were evacuated to the Songjiang Orphanage to be raised. The evacuation fee of one car for the Songjiang Orphanage cost more than one million yuan. In total, 126 people were evacuated. However, the monthly subsidy for children raised in the Songjiang Orphanage is 1 million yuan, and there are 55 disadvantaged children who cannot be evacuated and are still raised at the Shanghai Institute, including a 40-member boys' band and a 15-member girls' sewing class. Therefore, the minimum monthly expenses required are more than 10 million yuan. The institute originally had no designated funds, and 91 poor children are being raised, all crying for food, hoping that great philanthropists will actively contribute to sustain the lives of the poor children. The institute's handmade arts and crafts products, stock line mesh bags, will be presented to great benefactors. Those who donate 1 million yuan will receive ten dozen mesh bags. Donations should be sent to the General Office of the institute at 148 Ding'an Road, or please call 82686 to arrange for someone to pick them up.
