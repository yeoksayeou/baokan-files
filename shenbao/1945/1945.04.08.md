### Japanese Cabinet Reshuffle; Policy Remains Unchanged

Central News - Since Prime Minister Koiso formed his cabinet on July 22nd of last year, succeeding the Tojo Cabinet, he has dealt with the serious war situation and handled national affairs. After eight and a half months, he has now entrusted the national administration to General Suzuki and submitted his resignation en masse.

With the enemy Americans approaching Okinawa Island from Ryukyu Island again, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing are making various speculations about the Japanese cabinet reshuffle, or fantasizing that this is a further step towards Japan's defeat. and express extreme joy. However, the reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet is completely different in purpose from the reshuffles of other countries. Japan's path has been shown in the declaration of war. Although this policy has undergone several cabinet reshuffles, it will not change in the slightest. The only thing is to take more effective methods to move towards this goal.

Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese cabinet has been reshuffled three times. The Tojo Cabinet resolutely declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in order to seek self-preservation and self-defense and to promote the stability of East Asia. Since the start of the war, it has worked hard to rectify the wartime situation in the country and finally completed its mission. Last July, in order to refresh people's minds and complete the war, the cabinet was given to Prime Minister Koiso. Prime Minister Koiso took "Great Harmony and Unity" as his slogan and established a national general mobilization system to deal with the war situation.

During his tenure, Prime Minister Koiso implemented policies such as creating the Supreme War Guidance Council, having the Prime Minister attend the Imperial General Headquarters meetings, and ensuring that the military districts and local councils were closely integrated. He also established a system in which 100 million people participated in the war, inspiring national morale, strengthening military production, and completing the deployment of national volunteer corps. All of these tasks have also been completed.

The domestic situation in Japan is looking forward to the emergence of a cabinet that can issue orders to the people across the country and lead them to fight to the end. Therefore, Prime Minister Koiso submitted his resignation en masse in this hope. Now the Japanese people's anti-enemy mentality is even more激昂, and they are determined to fight to the last person and will not stop until the United Kingdom and the United States stop. This can be said to be the progress of Prime Minister Koiso's policy.

General Suzuki Taro, the naval admiral who will be the new prime minister, is currently the president of the Privy Council and is one of the most important ministers. During his fourteen years in the Navy, he successively served as Vice Minister of the Navy, Commander of the Second and Third Fleets, Commander of the Combined Fleet, and Chief of the Naval General Staff. He is one of the veterans of the Japanese Navy. He retired in Showa 4 (1929) and served as a Chamberlain, and in August of last year, he became the President of the Privy Council. He is now 79 years old. During the Qing-Japan War, he led a torpedo squadron into Weihaiwei Bay and was admired for his bravery. At this time of decisive battle, he will lead 100 million people and issue orders.

What the Japanese people currently expect from the government is to concentrate politics on the decisive battle, to closely integrate the commander-in-chief and the people, and to bring the country's total strength to the highest level. Some of these stages have been completed by the Koiso Cabinet, and the Suzuki Cabinet will continue to vigorously promote them, lead the people to rise up and carry out a total assault, and all decisive battle measures will be developed in leaps and bounds. The nationwide unified decisive battle to defeat the enemy will also be launched quickly.

### President Kohiyama Will Fly to Tokyo Today

Xinjing, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Mr. Kohiyama, the president of Mantetsu, decided to fly to Tokyo by plane on the 8th at the invitation of Kantaro Suzuki.

### The Battle Situation in the Philippines Over the Past Two Months

When we (Daily News correspondents Kojima and Saikaku) returned to Taiwan, the heroic姿態 of the soldiers of our army and navy garrison still floated in our hearts. Every day, they guarded the ruins of the old city of Manila, braving the continuous bombing of enemy planes and the 10,000 or so huge shells every day, and launched a magnificent charge against the American troops hiding behind the flame throwers, constantly achieving great results. This time, due to operational needs, we carried out a transfer of defense. On 〇月〇日, we went north from Manila. We伏臥 in the fields during the day and slept in the mountains. At night, we sometimes used trucks and sometimes walked on foot. We continued the night march for more than 1,000 kilometers, and the soldiers of the Imperial Army endured hardships. Now, the two of us have finally returned to Taiwan. On the Luzon Island battlefield, the Imperial Army is displaying a tragic and magnificent charge, causing the enemy Americans to suffer countless losses. Now, the enemy's casualties have reached more than 70,000. The formal war of attrition is still ahead. Under the威揚 of enemy planes, the Japanese soldiers absolutely trust General Yamashita's "Yamashita tactics" of剝皮折骨 and斩草除根. The morale is very strong, and they all believe that "the formal war of attrition is still ahead." I would like to report on the actual situation of the Luzon operation that I personally experienced on the northern front for two months since the enemy Americans landed in Lingayen.

The obvious fact seen in the Luzon Island operation is that the Japanese Air Force, which has been assisting the army in intercepting the enemy, has been constantly appearing. We watched the enemy planes in the air raid shelter and thought several times that if there were more planes on the Luzon battlefield, "the American devils would definitely be beaten to a pulp." As soon as the enemy planes saw a Japanese soldier or even a truck on the ground, they would rush forward and repeatedly strafe them. Our Japanese tank army, which has enough heavy equipment to耀世界, wanted to rush into the enemy's陣,拼个 "you die or I live", and was therefore considerably restrained. Each of the enemy's tanks had three escort planes protecting the tank like eagles. When the enemy Americans landed in Lingayen, they always used group attack methods, with four planes as a unit, and groups of 20, 30, or 50 planes always disrupting us in the skies over Luzon, reaching more than 1,000 planes every day. Initially, the United States used B24 and B25 medium bombers and P47 fighters as the main force. However, when landing successively in Lingayen using transport ships, P40, P51, and P39 carrier-based fighters were also dispatched. These carrier-based fighters concentratedly bombed the main cities in central Luzon, such as 加已那贊, San Jose, and Tarlac, like demons, turning them completely into scorched earth and injuring many Filipinos. Even if the enemy planes identified our hospitals and ambulance teams, they still carried out low-altitude bombing, which can be said to be inhuman.

Although American planes are so rampant on Luzon Island, our Japanese soldiers are not discouraged at all, but have consumed countless enemy forces. If we divide the decisive battle in the Philippines and the Leyte operation by the particularly heroic charge tactics of the Japanese army, the protagonist of the Leyte operation was the special attack隊 of the air force; but the protagonist of the Luzon Island battlefield, where Japanese planes were greatly insufficient, was the incomparably heroic ground charge隊. The special attack隊 used their own planes to crash into enemy ships. The ground charge隊 is the same as this. On the Luzon Island front, all the Japanese soldiers have become ground special attack隊. They charge towards the enemy's陣, forcing the enemy to consume the most troops. What the enemy fears most is the human losses that the Imperial Army inflicts on them. Therefore, on the Luzon battlefield, our Japanese soldiers, although they do not have planes to help the ground troops, there is not a single pessimist. The ground warriors said: "During the Leyte operation, the Japanese air force insisted on fighting hard, and now it's our army's turn to charge." The soldiers are smiling and firmly believe in Japan's victory.

The Imperial Army on Luzon Island watched the American troops land on Luzon Island and launched a bold tactic. In the eastern area of Manila, the Clark area, and northern Luzon, the three strategic areas, they will withdraw and shorten the front lines in a way that the American troops cannot quickly pursue. This is General Yamashita's very confident tactic of consuming troops. At that time, we heard a unit commander say豪语壮言: "No planes are needed in the Luzon operation." We did not dare to 加信賴. But now, we deeply understand the meaning of the commander of the American troops.

Soon after the American troops landed in Lingayen, Commander A, who was in charge of the Luzon operation at a certain base on the northern front, also said to me about the profound significance of the operation: "If the enemy only enters Manila or Clark, it will become a 　中之鳌." These mysterious words have now come true. The American troops who entered Manila have been mostly killed by our brave and good-fighting Imperial Army. The Manila that the Americans invaded is now being set on fire everywhere, plundered everywhere, and bombarded everywhere, and has long been completely reduced to焦士砾瓦. On the dark streets and alleys, there are hundreds of thousands of Manila citizens who are homeless and crying out for food and warmth. When the enemy started using an airport in the Clark area, the Imperial Army soldiers who were包阁 in the nearby mountains fired巨炮 and launched charges to prevent them from using the airport. When the enemy changed their strategy and made a comeback, there were only greater troop losses. Recently, on the various battlefields of Luzon, the enemy is advancing, and fierce offensive and defensive battles are unfolding between them. This is because the enemy has fallen for our plan. The Japanese soldiers on each line of Luzon Island believe that "killing as many American devils as possible, even if it takes five or ten years of war, we must persevere." They are all burning with incomparably heroic fighting emotions.

The Japanese soldiers fighting on the northern front have built 千旱城, which are difficult to attack and easy to defend, in the mountainous areas to ensure the possibility of a畏期 battle. They are fully confident and have prepared a陣势 of fighting the war. I visited a certain unit that had preserved a whole year's worth of charcoal, which is truly admirable. It is said that cooking with firewood is often discovered by enemy planes, so charcoal was prepared long ago. The warriors in the unit plant pumpkins, eggplants, radishes, etc. in their spare time. This is truly a long-term war態勢.

The Japanese civilians on Luzon Island, in a certain place in 〇〇溪谷, a key point on the northern front, absolutely trust the army's operations, and even women and children help the army in carrying out operations, which is truly a unity of the military and civilians. That is to say, under the command of the army, the Japanese residents prepare for a self-sufficient and self-sufficient life in combat, and form a living material production隊, a living material collection隊, and an industrial self-sufficiency班, etc. The production隊 is engaged in harvesting rice, milling rice, and planting crops, etc.; the collection隊 leads water buffaloes to buy materials. From this point of view, on the current Philippine front, from General Yamashita to women and children, they are completely united and working hard to win the victory.

### Determined to Cooperate with Allied Nations to Seek the Goal of Liberation

—Statement by Acting Chairman Chen—

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Acting Chairman Chen issued a statement today, saying: Prime Minister Koiso resigned on his own initiative because he realized that the war situation was becoming increasingly serious and hoped that a more powerful cabinet would emerge. It has now been decided that General Suzuki will continue to form the cabinet. We have infinite respect for the achievements of the Koiso Cabinet, and we have high expectations for the new cabinet. I recall that when the Koiso Cabinet was established in the autumn of last year, the enemy's American counterattack was becoming increasingly fierce. Prime Minister Koiso, with a必胜 belief, aroused the spirit of the Japanese nation to决斗, and with a firm determination, implemented the unification of strategic and tactical略. He made the greatest efforts to promote national policy and strengthen combat power. Therefore, in the successive battles in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Iwo Jima, he achieved great results. The突击 of the Special Attack隊 especially demonstrated the spirit of courage and fearlessness. The Japanese nation's determination to protect East Asia and its homeland has been unyielding. During my visit to Japan last winter, I exchanged views with Prime Minister Koiso and deeply knew that if this war cannot be won, the liberation of East Asia will never be realized. The interests and safety of China and Japan are inseparable. No matter how urgent the situation is, the National Government will adhere to its firm belief, cooperate with the Allied nations, and jointly seek liberation. Although there has been a change in the Japanese cabinet this time, there is no difference in the goal of completing the war. General Suzuki is a naval veteran who has served as Commander of the Combined Fleet and is currently the President of the Privy Council. He is not only an authority on strategy, but also has excellent administrative skills. The people who participated in the cabinet formation are also important figures in the Japanese military and political circles. I firmly believe that the new cabinet will be able to promote the implementation of national policies and carry out the decisive battle with a stronger陣容. Based on the goal of seeking liberation together, the National Government will inherit Mr. Wang's legacy, with the determination to live and die together,貫澈 its original intention of participating in the war, and strive to advance in order to 　 the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

Weekly Commentary

### A Perspective on the San Francisco Conference

— Jin Songsheng

The San Francisco Conference, heavily promoted by the anti-Axis powers, is less than three weeks away from its opening. According to recent overseas telegrams, the anti-Axis powers are staging new infighting dramas before the conference, which further strengthens our doubts about the outcome of the San Francisco Conference and necessitates further exposure.

First, it must be understood that although this conference claims to have more than forty participating countries, such as Turkey, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and various Central and South American countries, some even declaring war on Germany and Japan in order to participate, the main inviting countries are only the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. They all regard themselves as the leaders of the future international league, hoping to take the lead in this San Francisco Conference. Even the French provisional government under De Gaulle, seeing this situation, announced that it would not be among the inviting countries. The status of other countries in the conference in the future is even more imaginable. Although the anti-Axis powers' intelligence propaganda methods have changed from the Moscow "Four Powers" declaration in the winter of 1942 to the "Five Powers" theory, in reality, as the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy pointed out in his article "The San Francisco Conference, a Dreamlike Illusion," France under De Gaulle's rule is merely a bastard child of Britain and the United States and will have no independent voice in future international conferences. Even Chongqing, although it has long regarded itself as one of the "Four Powers," has too many internal problems and constant friction with the Communists, so it cannot but be in a passive position in international conferences and cannot be on par with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, this conference is obviously just a tragicomedy led by the three major protagonists, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The worldwide international organization for postwar peace and security is nothing more than a selfish and self-serving tool monopolized by these three major protagonists.

Secondly, judging from the recent trend of the situation, the contradictions and oppositions between these three major protagonists have become increasingly intense. The most obvious are the Polish representation issue and the voting issue. Because the Soviet Union, seeing the hidden ambitions of Britain and the United States, has shown a cold attitude towards the San Francisco Conference, a product of the Crimean Conference. Contrary to the high spirits of Britain and the United States, it has shown calmness in its domestic and foreign intelligence and public opinion organs. It has also disregarded the strength of the delegations of various countries attending the San Francisco Conference and only sent a group of diplomats considered "unqualified" in the eyes of Britain and the United States to perfunctorily deal with the matter. Regarding the Polish issue, it also issued a strong statement, supporting the Polish provisional government in Warsaw must have the right to attend the conference. Regarding the voting issue, it also strived for the privilege of three votes for one country. However, Britain and the United States, in addition to recognizing that the Soviet Union's Ukraine and Belarus each have one vote, have rejected the Polish representation, and British and American public opinion has published articles criticizing the Soviet Union's attitude. Due to the increasingly serious opposition between these three major protagonists, foreign telegrams have reported that the San Francisco Conference will be postponed until this summer, and the United States has also suggested that the five powers hold a meeting in Washington before the San Francisco Conference. This further proves the deepening of the contradictions between the three major protagonists.

The significance of the San Francisco Conference, at best, is to create a new international league under the leadership of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, based on the military force of the three countries, and to place small countries in a subordinate position to jointly suppress the Eastern and Western Axis powers. Due to the increasingly acute contradictions between the three countries, the reality of their ambitions is very doubtful, and the crisis of world disputes is an inevitable trend. Therefore, as the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. An, said: "The conference, which will be held in San Francisco on April 25th, boasting of establishing world peace, is nothing more than a continuation of the war."

### All East Asians Cooperate to Strive for Freedom and Independence

Li Shaogeng, the Ambassador of Manchukuo, recently made a special trip from Beijing to Shanghai to pay his first visit to the heads of various Chinese and Japanese authorities in Shanghai after taking office. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, he, together with Minister Zhongshan You, received reporters from various Chinese and Japanese newspapers in the city on the ninth floor of the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. Also present were Major General Iwu, Counselor Ito, Counselor Takenouchi, Secretary Fu, and others. Consul General Ye Yaogong, Officer Yu Wenjingyi, and more than 20 reporters from various newspapers also attended from the Consulate General. First, Ambassador Li gave his impressions after taking office and the construction situation of Manchukuo in the past 13 years. He also hoped that China, Japan, and Manchukuo would further strengthen their close cooperation in the future to achieve the final victory of Greater East Asia. Then, he answered various questions raised by the reporter group until 3:30 PM.

Close Ties Between China and Manchukuo

Ambassador Li said first: "This is my first time in Shanghai since arriving in China to meet with various parties. Shanghai is the most important city in China and also an important corner of East Asia. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen contact with all parties in the future. Since arriving in China, I have been eager to visit Shanghai, but because of the busy official duties since taking office, I was only able to meet with you today in February, which I sincerely apologize for. In recent days, I have had many earnest talks with the heads of various Chinese agencies and the Japanese military in Shanghai. I am grateful that all parties have expressed deep assistance to Manchukuo in the future and hope that Shanghai will further cooperate in the cooperation between China and Manchukuo. I am very pleased to have the assistance of the United States and Manchuria. Although all construction in Manchukuo has not been on the ideal track for more than ten years since its founding, there has indeed been progress in general. This is really the result of the close cooperation between Japan and Manchuria. At the same time, we have received considerable cooperation from China, especially the assistance of the North China authorities. Therefore, in the future, we hope that China and Manchukuo will further strengthen their close ties, and that China, Japan, and Manchukuo will work closely together. Manchukuo has made full efforts, and the new China should also make special efforts. When I was in Nanjing, I had many earnest talks with your country's government and saw its great efforts to dedicate itself to the Greater East Asia War. Now, due to various relationships, China has not yet been able to fully realize peace, but the National Government's spirit of hard work and the sincerity of the officials and people are united as one, which is no less than Manchukuo. I am very optimistic about its ability.

East Asian Revival Can Resist Foreign Insults

Today, the war is becoming increasingly tense, and all East Asian nations should mobilize and work hard, then it will not be difficult to overcome difficulties. The revival of the entire East Asian nation is powerful enough to resist foreign aggression. In the past, East Asian countries were oppressed by the West, so they demanded freedom and independence for East Asia. This is the responsibility of the East Asians themselves. Regardless of the peace of the Chinese National Government and the "resistance" of Chongqing, the independence of Manchukuo, and the successive independence of countries such as the Philippines, Thailand, Myanmar, and India, the reason is that they have suffered the oppression of the white race for hundreds of years. Today, our yellow race should open a new situation. We demand freedom and independence, and we should rise up to transform the situation, strive for the same self-reliance as the Westerners, and fight more strongly for the freedom and power that nature has given us to achieve the final goal and complete the greatest goal. Then we must all cooperate to seek independence and resist the Westerners. Regarding Japan's leadership in building East Asia, some people suspect that Japan has the ambition to invade East Asia, which is similar to that of the Westerners. I can guarantee that it is absolutely not the case. We can see that Japan is cooperating in building Manchukuo, and this doubt has been completely dispelled, and there is absolutely no ambition to invade. Today, not only is Manchukuo's politics on track, but all domestic construction is advancing rapidly. For example, Japan and Manchukuo's economic cooperation in developing industries and investing in mutual assistance is quite large.

United Solidarity, Bright Future

If the enemy benefits from this war, no matter China or any East Asian nation, especially those who want to seek equality, the difficulties will be even greater. As for the Western countries' concept, they only care about their own interests and plans, and they will never consider the East Asians. The East Asian people are a nation with rich morality. Japan is the only country that is a friend. Recently, the San Francisco Conference lured Chongqing to attend, which is sweet talk and deception, and is quite dangerous in the future. Britain and the United States are trying to win over Chongqing to destroy the East Asian group. If one billion nations are united to defend against the white race, there will be no problem. If the East Asian nations are broken up one by one, the future of East Asia will be in danger, and we should urgently understand and reverse the crisis. When we look at the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, they all have different dreams in the same bed and are seeking their own interests. Although they are now using Chongqing, they are falsely using the resources of the Chinese people, and the result will eventually be sacrifice. Before the outbreak of the U.S.-Japan war, the United States tried its best to provide material assistance to Japan, while deceiving China, hoping that the snipe and the clam would fight, and the fisherman would benefit. Therefore, Chongqing should urgently reflect and think about the entire East Asian nation, and should not kill each other. For countries such as Manchukuo, Japan has a great understanding of Manchuria, and Manchuria also has a very clear understanding of the Japanese Yamato nation. Over the years, they have cooperated sincerely and have become good friendly countries. Japan's sincere and moral spirit is truly admirable. I hope that everyone will unite, and there will be a bright future.

### Reporter's Meeting Raises Questions on County Administration Improvement; Deputy Director Tan of the County Administration Office Answers

The eleventh reporter's meeting hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held yesterday (7th) at 2:30 PM in the Municipal Government conference room. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. First, Director Liu introduced the new Director of the Municipal County Administration Office, Cai Shun, and Deputy Director Tan Shuzhan. Subsequently, Deputy Director Tan answered various questions raised by the reporters from the newspapers, lasting for over an hour. The details are recorded below:

Policy Implementation

(Question) What is the recent policy implementation situation of the County Administration Office? (Answer) Since its establishment on March 1st, the former兼Director has been very concerned about the improvement of administration in various counties and districts. He drafted the "Outline for Strengthening County Administration" in preparation for implementation. This outline provides concrete suggestions for adjusting the structure of various county-level organizations, reorganizing personnel, promoting efficiency in official document processing, and improving administrative affairs related to civil affairs, finance, construction, education, and public security. For example, raising the salaries of county administration staff, training district chiefs and assistant administrators, rectifying official discipline, strictly enforcing clean governance, reforming the collection of land tax in kind, eliminating irregular Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) notes, repairing roads and bridges, establishing agricultural experiment fields, increasing production, establishing county-level hospitals or clinics, increasing the number of rural primary schools, training police and self-defense corps, and strengthening the people's self-defense forces are all under planning. This outline has now been submitted to the Municipal Government for review and approval. Once approved, it will be ordered to the county governments for implementation. In addition, in order to strengthen public security in various counties and districts, the office convened a public security discussion meeting on March 22nd, gathering county magistrates and district heads to make decisions on ensuring public security in the counties and districts. However, since the office was newly established, the focus of its policy implementation has been on investigating local conditions, formulating county administration improvement policies, and increasing administrative efficiency in counties and districts.

Increased Production Campaign

(Question) Is the increased production campaign being carried out in the various counties, and what products are the focus? (Answer) The various counties of this city have always attached importance to increased production work and have established agricultural production promotion committees responsible for promoting it. At the same time, cooperative societies in various counties are also making efforts to assist. The focus of increased production is rice and cotton. Recently, the office has also listed vegetable production as a key focus for increased production in various counties and has concrete implementation plans. It is expected that there will be a relatively large harvest this year.

Strictly Prohibiting Gambling

(Question) Gambling is rampant in the suburban townships. Does your office have a thorough way to eliminate it? (Answer) Regarding the gambling situation in the suburbs of the city, the office received reports after its establishment, especially in the Zhoupu Xinchang Dawei area of Nanhui County. It was also learned that some cunning people organized so-called "silver groups," issuing a kind of illegal "Shen Dan" (betting slips) to replace coding, which led to ignorant farmers losing their fortunes. After obtaining concrete information, the office immediately ordered the Nanhui and Chuansha county governments to thoroughly investigate and prohibit it, and to investigate and report the main culprits for punishment. In the future, if gambling revives in any county or district, it will be thoroughly eliminated without any leniency.

Rectifying Police Discipline

(Question) It is rumored that the discipline of the police in various counties is poor, and extortion occurs from time to time. What is the truth? (Answer) In the past, the salaries of the police in the various counties of this city were extremely low. For example, the salaries of police officers in Nanhui and Chuansha were only 90 yuan per month. The salaries of police officers in Chongming, Fengxian, and Jiading were relatively higher, but even then, the monthly salary was only around 900 yuan. Extortion was inevitable. Now that police affairs have been assigned to the office, special attention will be paid to rectifying police discipline. If there are concrete facts reported from any side, the office will definitely punish them according to the law. In order to thoroughly rectify police discipline, Luo, the former兼Director, drafted a proposal to increase police salaries to be equal to those of the security team. This proposal has been submitted to the Municipal Government for review and approval. Once approved, it will be implemented. It is hoped that after the new salary system is implemented, this undesirable phenomenon can be reduced.

### Special Transportation Ship Management Bureau Established Yesterday in Shanghai to Facilitate Shipping and Regulate the Flow of Goods Between North and South

In order to meet the needs of wartime, facilitate maritime transport, and smooth the flow of goods between the North and the South to achieve economic and material regulation between the two regions, the National Government's War Affairs Committee specially appointed Lieutenant General of the Army, He Enzheng, to organize the Special Transportation Ship Management Bureau to handle wartime material transportation business. The bureau was officially established in Shanghai yesterday (7th) and began operations immediately. It is expected that the completion of maritime transport will make a considerable contribution to suppressing prices in various regions.

### Sugihara Appointed as the Fourth Chief of the Police Bureau

Senior police officers, including section chiefs and department heads, attended the party, which was hosted by Chief Li Shiyu. Chief Li and Deputy Chief Guanxian delivered farewell speeches, followed by a thank-you speech from Chief Wushima. Hosts and guests were very happy, and the atmosphere was harmonious. The party ended at about 6 PM.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Strictly Investigates Impersonators of Investigators

The Municipal Economic Bureau must dispatch personnel to conduct thorough investigations of applications for business registration by industrial and commercial enterprises before approving the issuance of business licenses. The supervision of all investigators in field missions is particularly strict. All dispatched personnel performing their duties must wear employee badges and carry a special yellow attendance card. However, on the 27th of last month, a person claiming to be Wang Yiming, an employee of the Economic Bureau, went to Zhu Maosheng Noodle Shop at 112 Songpan Road to conduct an investigation and demanded a handling fee of 3,500 yuan, promising to expedite the issuance of a registration certificate. Unexpectedly, when the inspector dispatched by the bureau on the same day went to investigate with his credentials, the shop realized it had been deceived. The bureau's inspector immediately returned to the bureau to report and dispatched personnel to secretly investigate and deal with the matter. At the same time, it notified all merchants and residents that if personnel dispatched by the bureau come to investigate and cannot produce an attendance card, they should refuse the investigation to avoid being deceived.

### Japanese Military and Civilians Celebrate Horse-Loving Day

Yesterday (7th) was Horse-Loving Day in Japan, an allied nation, and Japanese military and civilians in Shanghai celebrated it enthusiastically.

All the responsible persons were very satisfied, and the meeting ended at half past four.

### Taishan Police Sub-Bureau Strictly Prevents Thieves and Bandits; Bamboo Fences Are Set Up Around the Jurisdiction

The Taishan Police Sub-Bureau, in view of the fact that the area is located in the center of the city, is the most prosperous area of the former French Concession, and there are many entertainment venues, the people who come and go are of mixed quality, and after the merger of the city, all the iron gates of Kunshan and Nanshi were opened, and it was easier for thieves and escaped soldiers to escape, and theft cases have emerged in recent three or four months. In order to strengthen police affairs, the sub-bureau has repeatedly planned preventive countermeasures to curb theft. Therefore, after consulting with the Baojia (neighborhood watch) aspect, it was agreed to cooperate, set up bamboo fences around the jurisdiction, and close the iron gates of the alleys on time, and densely deploy detectives in various entertainment venues. Once a theft occurs, all intersections in the area will be closed at the same time, and detectives will conduct anti-theft training from time to time to prevent it secretly, curb theft, and hope that citizens will cooperate to maintain local security.

At about 6 PM on the 29th of last month, the infamous bandit Jian Genrong, armed with a large Dum Dum-style revolver pistol, sneaked into Guoxing Secondhand Shop on Luoyang Road and stole valuable items such as diamond rings, and fled by car with the loot. The shop assistants and self-defense team members blew the whistle, and the entire area was sealed off. When the thief's car arrived at the Huangpo Road intersection, it was discovered by police officer Ming Fangqing, badge number 524, who was on duty there, and was arrested on the spot. After strict interrogation by the authorities, he confessed to the robbery and will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Construction Bureau Prohibits Rickshaw Rental Price Increases

### With a Heart for the Hungry and the Suffering, Self-Tendering to Buy Diamond Rings and Watches

Mr. Ren's enthusiasm for public welfare is a model. In February of this year, Mr. Ren (Mr. Zhu Chengshi's name) sent a letter to the office, saying that at the beginning of the year, the poor were threatened by life, displaced, and cried out in hunger and cold. They need to be relieved. Mr. Ren was saddened and worried about it. He asked himself that he was still well-fed and clothed. He sent one three-carat diamond ring, one five-carat diamond ring, and one 18K gold watch to the office for auction, with a starting price of 300,000 yuan. The proceeds would be donated to the office's social welfare funds, and he hoped that people from all walks of life would participate in the charity event to make it a success, so as to promote the effectiveness of relief, etc. The news was published to call on people from all walks of life to sell it for charity, but until now, no owner has been found. Mr. Ren then generously spent 300,000 yuan to donate himself and took back the original items. Mr. Ren has a heart for the hungry and the suffering, and his enthusiasm for public welfare is a model for the society. It is specially allocated to donate 100,000 yuan to the Yixue (free school) fund, 50,000 yuan each to the midwifery fund and the small loan fund, and 25,000 yuan each to the poverty relief fund, the medical aid fund for primary school teachers, the medical aid fund, and the fund for poor children. The total is the above amount, and we express our gratitude.

### Contributing Money and Efforts to Help the Yixue Fund

Letter from Students of Yisheng Primary School

All the fifth and sixth grade students of the private Yisheng Primary School wrote a letter saying: "Today, our senior teachers, Mr. Zhou and Mr. Yan, reported on the Memorial Week: 'Because the cost of living has been rising recently, and more and more children are out of school, although our principal, Mr. Hu, has opened a compulsory primary school in our school, the school building is limited and cannot accommodate as many students as possible. At the same time, we are feeling the lack of Yixue (free school) in our city. Now that we have heard the news that the newspaper office is sponsoring the establishment of ten compulsory primary schools and that Mr. Xie Lilin is launching the "Yixue Fund", our school teachers are very sympathetic. After hearing this, our children were also very excited. We are all willing to do a little bit to help your museum and complete the unprecedented enthusiasm for the whole compulsory education. We have spent a few days' worth of snack money, so those who have money can donate money, those who have books can donate books, and those who have strength can donate to the outside world. As a result, we raised 73,000 yuan in storage coins and 40 old books. A list of donors is attached. We are all primary school students and know that our economic strength is weak. In order to relieve the suffering of out-of-school children and respond to the enthusiasm of your newspaper, we hope that people from all walks of life will unite to complete this great charity, and we hope that your newspaper will disclose this letter, and we are very grateful.'"

Travel Communication

### From Shanghai to Hefei

— Xu Ming

In mid-March, I, the author, traveled to Hefei alone with two pieces of luggage. The entire journey was approximately 1,700 li (approximately 850 km). The conditions encountered along the way, witnessed firsthand, are worth recording.

The route taken to Hefei this time was as follows: from Shanghai, via Nanjing, Pukou, Bengbu, and Shuijiahu, to Luzhou (i.e., Hefei). The Nanjing to Pukou section involved taking a ferry across the Yangtze River, and the Shuijiahu to Hefei section was on a "Huazhong Transport" bus. The rest of the journey was by train. The Bengbu to Shuijiahu section is the new Huainan Railway line, completed in July of last year.

The difficulty of buying tickets at Shanghai Station surpasses that of other places. Due to the high cost of food, many want to return to their hometowns but are unable to do so. Readers can surely witness the ticket-squeezing crowds in front of the Transport Cooperative at the intersection of North Nanjing Road. According to information in Shanghai, there are two places to purchase train tickets from the city:

North Station. Only sells tickets to stations along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, does not sell connecting tickets.

Nanjing Road Transport Cooperative. There are three ticket-buying queues: (A) Japanese. (B) Military personnel, employees of military industries, and civil servants. Must have a travel permit issued by their organization. (C) Ordinary citizens. Must present a citizen's card.

Because I needed to buy connecting tickets, I joined the C queue at the second location. The process of buying tickets involved three steps: On the first day, queuing and waiting to receive a "number card." This is done once every morning at 9:00 AM, and there are usually less than one hundred numbers issued, with no fixed number. After issuing the card, the citizen's card is taken away. The next day, using the "number card," one queues to obtain an application form, filling in one's name, destination, and citizen's card number. After queuing again, one prepares cash to buy the ticket. Imagine that the opportunity to buy a ticket is so scarce, and the procedure so cumbersome; how can travelers not be daunted?

After endless waiting, I finally managed to get a train ticket. Before boarding, I checked my bedding as luggage. As for my suitcase, I preferred to bear the physical and financial burden of carrying it with me to prevent it from getting lost. Because it was a night train, I arrived at Nanjing Xiaguan at five o'clock the next morning. After getting off the train, I urgently needed to wait for my luggage. Blue tickets could be used for connecting journeys, but luggage could not be transferred, and I needed to catch the Jinpu express train at 9:00 AM, so I was anxious. After waiting anxiously until 8:30 AM, an air raid alarm suddenly sounded, and Xiaguan Station was instantly deserted. I hired a car to hide under the Zhongshan Bridge because the riverbed was permanently dry and the bridge foundation was solid, making it a suitable place to seek shelter.

After the air raid alarm was lifted, I retrieved my luggage and crossed the river. It was already past 9:00 AM, but fortunately, the train was delayed, and I was still able to catch it. The porter fees for carrying luggage across the river were shocking, totaling 6,000 yuan in four instances. Adding the 2,000 yuan car fare to escape the air raid, this was more than enough for a fast train ticket from Shanghai to Bengbu. Such an expense for ten minutes on the river was truly unexpected, and the inspection was strict. If the China Railway authorities could allow luggage transfers, the inconvenience to travelers would definitely be reduced. This is an easy matter, as the luggage crossing the river will inevitably have to cross the river anyway.

The Jinpu express train was originally scheduled to depart from Pukou at 9:00 AM, but it was delayed until 9:00 PM. In the meantime, there were two more air raid alarms. Because I had luggage with me and no rickshaw to hire, I could only resign myself to fate.

The crowding on the Jinpu train was even worse than on the Shanghai-Nanjing train. Because Japanese women and children were traveling that day, the number of train cars was reduced, and the overcrowding was indescribable. The air quality inside the train cars was unbearable. Many people were vomiting and dizzy. As for lice crawling on people's shoulders, this was a common sight. The cries of women and children were constant. The slow speed of the train was unbelievable. It took eleven hours to travel from Pukou to Bengbu, while the scheduled time was only four hours.

The first thing that surprised me upon arriving in Bengbu was the low cost of food. Rice here was 35,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg), but it was a large dou (unit of measurement). Flour was 120 yuan per jin (approximately 500g), eggs were 100 yuan for three, and beef was 180 yuan per jin. Fried dough sticks and pancakes were 60 yuan per serving. The dough sticks were large, two inches in diameter and fourteen inches long. The pancakes were also "large," thick and substantial. Compared to those in Shanghai, it was like a giant seeing a dwarf.

In Bengbu, I boarded a car to Shuijiahu. The crowding on this route was better, but there were many small peddlers. Before the Huainan Railway was rerouted, Shuijiahu was a small station. After the rerouting last year, connecting to Bengbu, the old line was dismantled up to this point, and the new line was built from here. Therefore, those going to Hefei had to pass through this station. The road from Shuijiahu to Hefei was rebuilt from the old Huainan Railway line after its dismantling, so the road surface was very narrow, and two cars could not pass side by side. There was one bus to Hefei every morning at 9:00 AM, and the price was surprisingly high, 7,000 yuan for 180 li. Compared to the 500 yuan train ticket from Bengbu to Shuijiahu, it was shocking. Therefore, peddlers carried their goods on foot along the road, one after another. The car arrived in Hefei at 4:00 PM.

This trip took five days and cost 30,000 yuan. (Moved to support education)

### The Great Strategist General Yamashita

— Ikeda Genji

Currently, on the entire battlefield of the Philippines, the Japanese army is carrying out fierce bayonet charges and has achieved a great victory, killing more than 70,000 enemies, plunging the enemy into a quagmire of suffering. During the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the "fierce Yamashita offensive" in the Battle of Singapore was experienced, but the general public does not yet know much about this fierce general's "strong and flexible Yamashita strategy."

What exactly is the "defensive Yamashita strategy"? To understand this, one must first know the general's life and personality - the general has no children. When he was in Manchuria, he treated the local boys as if they were his own children, teaching them the methods of study, saying, "You are truly hardworking children. Diligent preparation is enough; there is no need to review." This was the rule he followed from elementary school, to youth school, to the Army Officer School, to the Army University, putting it into practice himself.

"Battles cannot be revised. Therefore, the most important thing before a battle is thorough preparation."

This was the general's perspective from his youth. Possessing this perspective and belief, he has never revised it, nor has he ever failed, from the time he was a young officer until he became a general.

Yamashita's Flexible Strategy

On the Chinese front, whether as a division commander or as a staff officer, the strategy he bravely executed was always the "Yamashita strategy" that defeated the enemy. He was praised as a new strategist even within the military headquarters.

Previously, when the general was the commander of the North China Army, I, as a reporter, had the opportunity to ask him about his opinions on the China Incident. At that time, the general, shaking his imposing frame, said:

"Let's first observe the Chinese! In the midst of war and chaos, even if they are attacked and repeatedly defeated, they do not panic. We Japanese should also be calm and composed, and not be too nervous."

Later, he led a division into the vast Chinese interior, personally experiencing the attack on the Chinese mainland. At the same time, he thoroughly studied and absorbed the Chinese strategy of drawing the Japanese army into their interior.

In the current Luzon Island operation, when the enemy army invaded the Luzon Plain, he said very calmly and with a smile: "The enemy army has already become a part of our belly." With the enemy landing in Luzon and entering the dangerous interior guarded by the elite Japanese army, he naturally smiled inwardly, believing that the enemy would continue to be mired in arduous combat. Since the enemy landed in Lingayen, they did not encounter the expected resistance and, like an overwhelming wave, continued to pursue the Japanese army southward. The enemy lost one-third of their entire landing force in the attack on Manila, while the main force of the Japanese army suffered no losses. MacArthur, taking advantage of the victory in Leyte, wanted to directly attack Luzon, but he fell into the "Yamashita strategy." Perhaps they will suffer the consequences of their own actions!

A Word that Startled Goering

General Yamashita is not only one of Japan's leading strategists but is also a world-renowned great strategist. In the second year of this World War, in 1940, at the invitation of Italy and Germany, the general inspected the new battlefields of the Western Front in detail. At that time, Germany gathered its elite mechanized units, which had shaken the world, in one place and had General Yamashita inspect them. Marshal Goering patted the general on the shoulder and said:

"What are your impressions, Your Excellency?…?"

The general turned his head to look at the large formation of mechanized units and replied casually:

"Oh, it's not as good as I expected."

Marshal Goering was startled by the general's great spirit and said:

"Then let's compare it with the Japanese army!"

"Good, that's exactly what I want. Then let's have a decisive battle in the Iranian plateau or the Afghan area!"

"Ha! Ha! Ha!…"

The two heroes embraced and laughed.

After the general returned from inspecting the German and Italian fronts, during the period before he became the supreme commander of the Singapore occupation army, he continuously studied in practice the strategy of defeating highly mechanized units, and finally invented the so-called "Yamashita flexible strategy."

Waiting for the Decisive Battle

Recently, the general has been researching a strategy to crush highly mechanized units with thousands of tanks and thousands of aircraft using limited equipment, limited troops, and limited resources. So the regret of this strategy is that a part of air supremacy is temporarily in the hands of the enemy. However, the enemy, who has the advantage in numbers, has already suffered our attacks, resulting in a loss of as many as 70,000 people, while our main force has not suffered the slightest damage. This is the success of the Yamashita tactics.

The general, who possesses a fervent fighting spirit and firm confidence, will surely launch a major annihilation battle when the time is right. This is the general's indomitable character.

But when will this huge annihilation battle be launched? That is when the anxious enemy is about to launch a mainland landing operation, when their replenishment is difficult, and when the balance of power between the enemy and us is broken again.

Now the enemy's ships are already insufficient. They are anxious to fight a quick battle and hope to forcibly land in various places. When the enemy's replenishment is already lacking and the enemy's combat power is already weakened, this is known to all. This is when the balance of power between the enemy and us in the Philippines is broken, and it is the best opportunity for the Yamashita army to launch a major annihilation battle.

Whether in Taiwan, or in China, in South China, or even in Japan in the future, if the enemy advances further, they will always use the "Yamashita flexible strategy," which makes people cry out in alarm, causing them to pay the greatest price in blood and flesh. The time for the "Yamashita flexible strategy" to shine is at hand. (Lin Tan from the March 15 Asahi Shimbun).

### The Imminent Opening of the Battle of Berlin

— Berlin Correspondence

If it weren't for the Nazi Party's drastic reorganization and guidance, all Germans would admit that they would never have been able to hold out until today. However, this view is not entirely correct. Because relying solely on the Party's guidance and encouragement would not have resulted in such a tragic nationwide resistance. Observing the current internal situation in Germany, as it faces the final battle, one can deeply feel the traditional and strong national character inherent in the blood of the German people.

The Final Hour

German territory is already being gradually eroded by the enemy from the east, battered by the rain of bombs dropped from the sky, creating a tragic scene of families torn apart, fathers separated from their children. The difficulty of life is increasing day by day. Millions of men, women, and children, carrying only a blanket, are fleeing from west to east, and from east to west, not knowing where to go. With the entire country of Germany becoming a battlefield, this group of innocent and pitiful children naturally cannot find a haven. Now is the moment when the United Nations wants to use overwhelming military pressure to crush Germany in one fell swoop. In other words, the current war situation for Germany has reached the most severe stage imaginable. But even in this situation, the German people are still holding onto their flag of national struggle. At the same time, they still want to continue fighting. Of course, there is no denying that many people are dissatisfied with their current lives, but as soon as the conscription order is issued, even white-haired old men in their seventies stand up, shoulder their rifles, and go to the battlefield. Now is not the time to consider the fate of tomorrow, or to criticize today's war and satirize politics. The call to persist in resisting to the end fills the entire country. According to Western utilitarianism, this is truly an unbelievable miracle. All the former European Allied countries, in the midst of fierce fighting, abandoned their armor, surrendered, and begged for the enemy's mercy, but Germany, despite being pressured by the armies of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on all sides, is still resisting with its flag of battle in the heart of Europe, which truly displays the strength of the German nation.

There has been discussion in Germany about where the Soviet troops' tenacious resistance came from. Initially, most people believed that the ideology and organizational power of communism were the reasons for the Soviet Union's victory. However, later, due to several experiences in the Eastern Front, the Germans realized that the Soviet Union's strength stemmed from the innate nature of the Slavic people. The fact that the Germans can persist today can be explained by the same reasoning. Especially the emotions of fighting in other people's territory and fighting in one's own country are vastly different. As the battle line is gradually and repeatedly retreating to the country's own territory, and one sees firsthand the burning of one's own hometown by artillery fire, although the objective situation becomes more unfavorable day by day, the German people's fighting spirit and morale become increasingly strong. Today, all the German people truly experience that this is a war for their own survival. That is to say, the militarism of ordinary soldiers, the so-called spirit of German victory in every battle, the tenacity of the Germanic people, the tradition of past history, and the character of the German people, are all factors that determine this war and are the source of their tenacious resistance.

Two Great Pillars

The Nazi Party is the organization that builds the national resistance consciousness and plays the greatest role in constituting combat power. Therefore, the people's will to fight and the Nazi organization are the two pillars that support Germany in the decisive stage. In other words, it is old Germany and new Germany, and these two pillars support each other. It goes without saying that if either pillar breaks, the war will be lost. Therefore, facing the greatest difficulties today, the interdependence of these two pillars is undeniable. When France was occupied by the American and British troops, and the Soviet Red Army carried out rapid blitzkrieg operations in the Ukrainian territory, these two pillars united as one. However, today, although there are old inherent traditions and new organizations, the two have a close and inseparable relationship. "Fight for the beloved homeland!" This supreme principle is inspiring the solidarity of Nazi Party members and non-Party members, uniting them against external enemies.

The United States and Britain, who induced Italy and other Axis allies to surrender, still do not forget to constantly implement both threats and inducements to the German people. The conspiracy to divide the Party and the people in the past has already failed, but recently it has been re-enacted. For example, at the Crimean Conference, they announced to the German people: "Only the Nazi Party is our public enemy." However, the German people's determination to fight this war has not been shaken. Although there are often inconsistencies and non-cooperative phenomena on the front lines, the surging enthusiasm to desperately make up for failures, and the determination of the rear to endure the greatest sacrifices in order to win victory, are worthy of admiration.

Believing in the Leader

If an enemy asks an ordinary German about the future of the war, saying: "The current war situation has already been largely decided. If you continue to resist meaninglessly, it will only lead to sacrifice. Why not surrender early?" The German would definitely answer:

"We admit that there have been great failures in the leadership of the German war, and that the people have made many mistakes. But we do not admit that President Hitler is an irresponsible politician. A figure like Hitler, who loves Germany so much, would never sacrifice the lives and happiness of the German people and continue a hopeless war. We ordinary people do not know how much military power and combat strength Germany still has. The President knows this very well, so he is still continuing the war. We believe that as long as Hitler is fighting, from a purely military point of view, Germany still has a chance to win. Therefore, we obey the President's orders and go to the battlefield. Besides this, is there any other way for Germany to survive?"

Due to the long period of unfavorable war situation, and under the east-west attack of the Soviet and American-British armies, when considering the fate of Germany, the German people will make the above decision. If you do not recognize the above idea, you will not understand the reason for the current German fierce resistance.

Berlin Defenses

Now, less than fifty or sixty kilometers east of Berlin, is the Oder River, a scene of raging war. The Soviet Union's most elite Zhukov army is on the east side of the Oder River, having completed new formations, new deployments, and replenished ammunition and food, waiting only for the order to launch a major offensive against Berlin. Since the large-scale bombing of Berlin by the US Air Force on February 3, the city of Berlin has truly become a battlefield. The appearance of the city has now changed dramatically and is alarming. The sandbag barricades at the crossroads are increasing day by day. The bustling main streets are also closed to traffic, allowing only military trucks to pass. Due to enemy bombing, there are pieces of iron and roof tiles everywhere, materials used for barricades. Most of those who are desperately transporting these materials and helping with the defenses of Berlin are Soviet prisoners of war in uniform. Next to all the bridges or intersections, members of the People's Stormtrooper, wearing ordinary suits and hats, are carrying rifles, preparing themselves. This clearly shows that martial law has been declared.

Determined to Defend to the Death

The person in charge of the Third War Zone, that is, the highest authority for defending Greater Berlin, was formerly President Hitler, but has now been replaced by the unknown Lieutenant General Heinrici. Lieutenant General Heinrici broadcasted to the citizens of Berlin via radio, and appointed individual defense commanders for the suburbs of Berlin, completely transforming Berlin into a large fortress, preparing to defend the German capital to the death. The lakes, rivers, and mountains in the suburbs have also been fully utilized as natural barriers in the defense plan. We naturally have no freedom to report in detail on the comprehensive defense measures being carried out day and night in the German capital. What we can report is that Berlin will definitely not be declared a non-defended city like Paris and Rome, and have its government agencies move elsewhere for refuge. However, the Zhukov army seventy kilometers to the east is only "reinforcing Berlin" directly even if they launch a major offensive. The metropolis with four million citizens will become an isolated city surrounded by enemy troops in the midst of artillery fire. Refugees fleeing from the Eastern Front are overflowing in Berlin, especially women and children. But the government has not yet ordered an evacuation. Why has it not ordered an evacuation? The main reason is that such a large population cannot find a safer area in all of Germany to accommodate them, and evacuation would be a futile effort. Another reason is that the German government has long considered that abandoning the capital Berlin would have a decisive and serious impact on the entire war. Therefore, the beginning of the Battle of Berlin is likely to be the dividing point that finally determines the fate of Germany. Four million citizens will all participate in this great battle.

When there is no gas, electricity, or tap water, the food for the general public, like the army, will implement a large-scale rationing system. The supreme commander of the Greater Berlin armed citizen group, the "People's Stormtrooper," is Propaganda Minister Goebbels. Now the critical moment for Germany is approaching moment by moment. The Soviet Red Army, centered on the Zhukov army, with the Koniev army on the left and the Rokossovsky army on the right, is about to launch a major battle, preparing like a crane formation. Of course, Germany will never admit defeat and immediately sign a treaty of surrender, so it is currently carefully planning a counter-offensive operation, determined to defend to the death.

High Morale

Based on the resolutions of the Crimean Conference, we can fully imagine that the American and British armies will launch a new offensive on the Western Front in mid-February or early March, and the European war situation will have major decisions in March and April. This estimate cannot be considered arbitrary.

German newspapers and radio stations repeatedly boast that London was also devastated by the German army in 1940 and fell into a state of turmoil. At that time, thanks to the calm response of the British, they overcame the difficulties; Moscow and Leningrad also suffered greatly from the German army, but thanks to the strong character of the Soviet people, they finally turned defeat into victory. Berlin is certainly not preparing to learn from the enemy, but wants to persist and crush their ambitions. These repeated reports are to encourage national morale. The crisis in London at that time still had the hope of the American allied forces joining the war, and the dangerous era in Moscow still had a vast rear area and countless human and material resources to support the war. Britain and the Soviet Union at that time both had something to rely on. But what does Germany rely on today? And what does it intend to rely on? From the perspective of military production alone, the Upper Silesia heavy industrial zone, which has the same value as the Ruhr industrial area, has been lost to the Soviet Union. The military factories in the former Polish colony and Czechoslovakia, the Varta River basin, etc., have also been occupied by the Soviet Union. This loss is truly irreparable. The only savior is the trade relationship with neutral Sweden, but it is gradually deteriorating. According to today's situation, the replenishment of military supplies can only rely on the raw materials stored in the past, and the newly invented weapons can fill some of the losses. There is no other way. Since this compensation is minimal, what Germany relies on is its high morale and excellent operational guidance. As the war situation becomes more and more urgent, national morale is the greatest and final weapon to overcome enemy planes and cannons. (Newly translated from Berlin's Shoushan correspondence on February 22)

### Map of the European War Situation

The Eastern and Western fronts in Europe have now entered a decisive stage. On the northern flank of the Western front, anti-Axis forces crossed the Weser River and advanced eastward in the Minden area, aiming for Hanover. In the central area, the American Third Army, after entering the Saarlautern area, encountered fierce resistance from the German army and made little progress. According to a telegram on the 7th: On the Eastern front, Soviet tanks have broken into Old Odor, and on the Warthe River front, Soviet forces have concentrated their forces, and a major battle is imminent.

### Measures that the Business Community Should Take

— Yushun

Since the soaring price of rice, the business community in this city has suddenly declined; reversing the past state of abnormal prosperity. At this time, business operators should take appropriate measures to cope with the current difficulties. Now, with the intention of offering a humble opinion, I contribute my superficial views below for reference.

Adjusting Work Hours: Currently, the working hours of companies and businesses are approximately six to ten hours, which does not seem to have been shortened compared to previous working hours; even if they have been shortened occasionally, the reduction is only one or two hours. However, the business of companies and businesses is extremely quiet, with the best only reaching half of what it was at its peak. Therefore, if working hours are reduced by half, there should be no problem in handling business, but the following benefits can be obtained: (1) Increase the time for employees to study and engage in side businesses, (2) Reduce the number of times employees travel to and from work, saving manpower and resources, (3) Increase the employees' work remuneration in an intangible way. How to adjust the working hours should be decided by the trade association to ensure uniformity.

Reducing Redundant Personnel: Rather than lingering on with difficulty, companies and businesses should simply reduce unnecessary employees, giving them a considerable amount of severance pay so that they can return to their hometowns to make a living during the authorities' evacuation of the population. Assuming that they continue to drag on in a half-dead state, the company will be drained, and the employees' savings will be exhausted. By that time, even if the company wants to reduce employees, it may not be able to pay a severance pay. At the same time, the dismissed employees, with only a small amount of severance pay, may not even be able to return to their hometowns, let alone use it to start another business.

Increasing Remuneration: Companies and businesses should give reasonable remuneration to retained employees, ensuring that their income can maintain a minimum standard of living, so that they can concentrate on their work, and the company can also rely on this to maintain itself and plan for future development. Remuneration should be changed to a mixed system of in-kind and currency, and in addition to paying salaries on a regular basis, it is best to distribute necessities such as rice, fuel, oil, and salt.

It is indeed not easy to overcome difficulties. Assuming that companies and businesses can consider taking the above-mentioned emergency measures within the scope of possibility, they may be able to overcome the danger safely. It all depends on how it is implemented!

### A Perspective on Material Rationing (Part 2)

— Liu Ningwu

Household Rationing and Special Rationing

Since the implementation of material rationing in Shanghai, it has been divided into two types: household rationing and special rationing. The former uses a voucher rationing system. All taxpayers in the district, with their municipal tax receipts and household registration certificates, apply for vouchers at the voucher issuing office. Citizens can purchase and receive rationed materials at the designated stores according to the announcements of the rationing office. Currently, there are approximately 969 retail rice stores designated by the rationing office, 4 retail water supply stores, approximately 628 coal ball retail stores, and approximately 425 soap and firewood stores. The rationed items include rice, flour, sugar, coal balls, soap, firewood, and milk, which are discussed separately below:

Rice—Rationing is implemented based on the applications of various applicants, such as government agencies, public utilities, hospitals, charities, and factories, after verification.

Flour—Recipients are bakeries, noodle shops, and restaurants approved by the rationing office. The amount of rations they are entitled to is based on the total number of their users.

Sugar—Rationing is implemented based on the quantity approved by the former Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office.

Coal Balls—Recipients are government agencies and charities.

Soap and Firewood—Recipients are hospitals, the Laundry Industry Association, and the Restaurant Industry Association.

Coal by the Catty—Recipients are members of the Boiled Water Industry Association.

Milk—Recipients are hospitals, the elderly, infants, etc.

Points to Note for Future Rationing

Currently, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland, and other countries have implemented material rationing systems. Whether they are effective or not is not discussed for the time being. The material rationing system is very important in wartime economic policies. It can not only suppress the rise in prices, but also prevent rampant hoarding. Regarding future rationing policies, I would like to present my humble opinions as follows:

In order to protect the minimum living standards of the general public, the government must be determined to overcome all difficulties.

Secondly, it should thoroughly cooperate with the Allied institutions related to rationing, find ways to enrich the source of materials, and at the same time discuss transportation issues, purchase price issues, etc., and jointly take responsibility for material rationing in Shanghai.

Find ways to plan the exchange of materials between the north and south of the country, and adopt a mutually beneficial approach.

Thoroughly investigate hoarding on a large scale. If materials related to rationing are found, they should be confiscated and handed over to the rationing office to be sold to citizens at a fair price.

Substitute materials should be rationed. For example, for the current household rice rationing, before it is rationed, the rationing of coarse grains should be increased as much as possible. Or, the current special flour rationing for various industries should be increased for general users, which is also an appropriate measure.

### Suggestions for Improving Well Digging

— Wang Peiting

Since the city's tap water has been repeatedly reduced in quantity, citizens have deeply felt the pain of insufficient water. Therefore, various neighborhoods have opened up earth wells to seek remedy. However, most of these earth wells have been poorly dug, resulting in poor water quality, making them unsuitable for consumption and only suitable for washing.

More importantly, these earth wells pose a great danger to residents. Most of these well-digging projects are contracted out and built with shoddy workmanship and materials, especially the well walls. The surface seems to be quite solid, but in reality, it is only made of bricks and earth, with a very thin layer of lime. Once submerged in water, it will collapse, and various dangers will arise. Minor incidents include cats and dogs falling into the well, drowning and rotting. If this is not noticed, consumption may be harmful to hygiene. In the dark of night and during curfew, pedestrians may accidentally lose their footing and fall into the well. This is especially dangerous for children. In the event of an air raid or fire, residents will rush to escape. If the alleys are narrow and people rush in like a tide, falling into the well and drowning is also possible.

To avoid the above-mentioned possible unfortunate events, the best way is to remove the well curb and pave the surface with cement, with small holes around it to allow air to circulate. Open a hole in the middle, large at the top and small at the bottom (to prevent children from falling down). The size should be suitable for a long, round lead bucket to draw water, and it should be equipped with a bottle-stopper-style stone cover, which should be tightly closed when not in use. If economically feasible, it is best to install a water pump. The pump can be placed near a clean wall with water. In this way, the trouble of drawing water with a bucket can be avoided, and it does not hinder traffic. It is truly beneficial in every way. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to the above points when digging new wells. It is truly a great service to the public. (Contribution for Academic Aid)

### Opening Parks

— Jue Ya

In this densely populated city, the only places to get some fresh air are a few public parks. Shanghai is densely populated, and the original parks were not enough to meet the needs. Recently, there has been a sudden change, that is, several parks have been closed, and citizens cannot enter.

It is certain that the parks are not open for other uses, but they are not used all day long, from morning to night. Part of the time should still be free.

Therefore, I propose that the opening hours of the parks be shortened; reopening them based on the principle of not hindering other uses. The parks should be fully utilized, and the citizens should have a place to roam. I wonder if the authorities will adopt this suggestion.

### The Necessity of Vehicles Burning Lights at Night

— Gu Qizhong

Recently, rickshaws, bicycles, etc. on the road often cause accidents due to the lack of lights at night, day after day, especially bicycles. What is even stranger is that a few public officials ride bicycles without lights, rushing around, as if the authorities have no such regulations. In addition, rickshaws do not burn lights at night, and law enforcement officials turn a blind eye, which is puzzling. At this time of vigorously renewing municipal administration, it is a matter of public safety, and I hope the authorities will pay attention to it.

### Preparing for War Against the United States

Since the enemy's Pacific operations controlled Iwo Jima, their air bases have been advanced by one thousand kilometers from the Marianas. As we previously pointed out, once Manila is in their hands, the bay can be transformed into a major forward supply base. The former commander of the enemy's Asian fleet, Yarnell, contributed an article to the "Red Fleet" newspaper, openly stating this strategic intention. At the same time, he boasted about and praised the efforts of his country's navy, which traveled five thousand miles across the Pacific to finally achieve today's strategic situation. He emphasized naval primacy and concluded by saying that the main task of future landing operations against Japan also rests on the navy's shoulders.

Enemy Strategy

In that article, he said that his country's troops have entered Manila, and if the Cavite naval base is restored, even if it cannot serve as an anchorage for the entire Pacific fleet, it can at least be used as a base for supply ships, so the value of Manila Bay is extremely high. Utilizing this forward supply base, and coordinating with the navy's crucial mobile units to advance directly forward, a landing on the Japanese mainland is by no means impossible. He implied that instead of implementing MacArthur's landing operation on the Asian continent, they would launch Nimitz's direct attack on Japan, highly praising the effectiveness of the navy and advocating naval primacy. We can only approve such discussions. Even when landing on Iwo Jima, which is less than four and a half miles in circumference, they mobilized the entire Pacific fleet and paid a huge price. When they landed in northern France, simply crossing the English Channel, which only takes three hours, required the protection and assistance of the entire British navy and more than two years of thorough preparation. Just thinking about these things makes it clear.

Ready and Waiting

Even if Manila Port is opened as a supply base, as Yarnell said, it will be highly effective, and the fact that its Pacific base can be advanced three to five thousand miles from Hawaii is also a fact. Assuming that the reorganized and successful 50th Mobile Unit is as impressive as they boast, according to a statement regarding the Iwo Jima operation, the initial supply for one American soldier is sixteen tons for the first month and six tons for the second month. If averaged at eight tons, assuming they want to send 200,000 landing troops, 1.6 million tons of supplies will be required. Moreover, this supply convoy, traveling a long distance of 2,300 kilometers from Manila to the Japanese mainland, must meander in a long snake-like line of ships, connecting with the mobile unit that they rely on as their main combat force, inevitably exposing its massive body within the bombing range of Japanese base air forces. Are the strong Japanese soldiers and brave generals waiting in readiness doing nothing in vain? For them, the greatest danger lies in this.

Seize the Opportunity

Yarnell can now be said to be an admiral who has not personally shouldered the burden of command, but from the movements of the enemy's mobile units, not to mention the current state of the Pacific war, there is no doubt that Nimitz intends to covet the Japanese mainland. Yarnell can be said to be his representative spokesman. Since the enemy's operational intentions are so clear, we must immediately be on guard. What should be prepared? Needless to say, it is the large-scale production and accumulation of aviation weapons. Moreover, with the divine strategy of our leadership, a suitable opportunity will arrive for a major explosion. Defeating the enemy's divine machine will not come by waiting. Whether the future opportunity can truly become a divine opportunity depends on the efforts of our entire nation. Only through bloody and sweaty, desperate efforts can we seize the opportunity. Should we not all rise up together now? (Translated from the March 9th Yomiuri Hochi)

Bai Mao

### A Lan

— Hong Ying

I

Grayish-white light, secretly stretched its footsteps in the cold air; in just a fraction of a second, it created an amazing process. Over the buildings, over the window sills of the buildings, the tables and chairs, and the floor. Finally, when the sky, with its few morning stars, changed from black to a fish-belly color, it filled every space, and everything in the building became white, bright!

A Lan yawned at this time; he had just woken up from a dream. In the dream, he had become a writer again, a teacher loved by many children... He was happy, free, and joyful. But A Lan opened his eyes from the joyful mood and quickly turned over again, closing his eyes tightly, wanting to return to the dream. Because he saw what he hated and felt most annoyed by: the yellowish-pink walls, the lavish sofa, the desk and telephone in the distance, all stimulating his recently relaxed nerves. So A Lan's mood gradually rose like a mercury column, and his young heart was beating, beating, beating....

"Get up, you bastard!" Reason challenged A Lan, and one figure after another emerged from the blankets, rushing back and forth on the floor with rapid steps. A Lan had no choice but to flip out of the bunk, grab a towel, a washbasin, a toothbrush, and toothpaste, and begin his morning routine.

II

A Lan walked down the stairs quickly, scribbled a few strokes on the sign-in book lying on the table in the living room, and then ran into the office. Here, the first meeting of each day did not require a polite nod or a more courteous "Good morning!" They merely glanced around with familiar eyes, and then sat down listlessly in armchairs to rest for a while, before taking out ledgers, pens, and abacuses... A busy and lively atmosphere filled the entire room.

A Lan used his key to open the safe, opened the drawer, and took out piles of documents and copies. A tea boy delivered a cup of hot tea, and he took a sip to moisten his dry lips. "Ah!" A Lan felt a headache and a stuffy feeling when he saw these things and this environment, but he had to start writing.

The crowds outside poured into the bank like a tide, and colleagues were busy responding with smiling faces—especially in the cashier's section, stacks of red and green bills were thrown out of the counter, and then stacks of red and green were moved in from people's hands. A Lan hated these, hated money, and hated the pitiful and foolish fellows acting out comedies and tragedies.

"Okay, okay, okay... Hehehe, it doesn't matter, that's the count. Five million, five million... It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter..." A fat director, raised his golden voice, laughing and shouting into the telephone receiver. In A Lan's view, this outward kindness was a substitute for internal malice and scheming. "Hypocrite, damn it, philistine, dog! Should go to hell ten thousand times." A Lan cursed fiercely, and looked at his happy face, hypocritical face, and numb face with disdain.

Over there, A Lan quietly noticed that a general affairs officer had become short-tempered and was getting angry, scolding people. "Hey, tea boy! What's the matter? Can't you even wipe the cups clean? Isn't the Argen cigarette here yet?..."

Over there, A Lan's gaze shifted, and the general affairs officer walked over to the manager's side, the anger on his face immediately disappearing, replaced by boundless smiles, endless attentiveness, and immeasurable kindness. "Mr. Zhu, it will be done exactly like this, please rest assured. I will send someone over first thing tomorrow morning... Yes, send someone over."

Further over there, A Lan's eyes jumped to the body of an old clerk. According to A Lan, this old document clerk, whose head was full of white hair and who was over fifty years old, had been eating this for job since he was young. However, a document clerk is just a document clerk. Now, he is slow to work, and his thoughts are also exhausted. Look at him! Lighting one cheap cigarette after another, tearing up one draft after another, coughing, spitting, and gasping....

A Lan's emotions completely followed the speculation of each person's different changes. Gradually, his heart could not be peaceful. On the surface, he bent over, moved his pen, and completely focused his energy on his work; in reality, A Lan's mind was full of countless scenes, and his thoughts were spinning, spinning.... He wondered: What is a person? What is the human world?

III

At exactly twelve o'clock, the bell upstairs rang, and everyone in the office realized that it was lunchtime. They quickly put down their work, left their seats, and walked upstairs at a running pace. So the stairs were full of feet. A Lan also sat at the dining table with them. Here, the emotions of every soul seemed extremely tense; one hand held a rice bowl, and the other pinched chopsticks; the young ones picked up a piece of fatty meat, and then snatched a chopstick of fresh fish. The old ones also took two chopsticks of scrambled eggs and one chopstick of shredded meat. Everyone exerted themselves, exerted their wildness, and desperately swallowed the rice grains into their mouths. Occasionally, some took a breath in the tense air, showing some disgust, but in this way, they filled their stomachs with food, and every soul felt satisfied, satisfied with their meal.

Within ten minutes, each food bowl became empty, each seat became empty, and A Lan was the only one left at the table. Immediately, an indescribable feeling filled his mind. A Lan could not figure out what this phenomenon was. "Hmm, this is the harm of hunger and thirst," A Lan thought of the words in the ancient books, "the harm of hunger and thirst is enough to harm the heart. Yes, people do this for the drive of the will to live, for having to accept the challenge of life, but...?"

A Lan returned to the armchair in a daze, and the tea boy delivered another cup of hot tea, which he drank in one gulp. Taking advantage of some free time, he lowered his head towards a square piece of glass on the desk and pondered endlessly. As soon as the surrounding things touched his eyes, he tried his best to think about why they were doing this. Look, there are several older colleagues, all bent over, with white hair and wrinkles, now smoking and chatting leisurely. Their faces are so peaceful and serene. And those young people, although six or seven out of thirty have a few strands of white hair growing in their black hair, they don't have any worries or haggardness, but show themselves to be very proud and comfortable. As for himself, his soul is disturbed and in pain every day, without a moment of peace, why is this? What exactly is it for?

The more A Lan squeezed his brain to think, the more his depression surged like a tide. "Hmph, are foolish people digging graves for themselves? Are they destroying their own future?" What is the meaning of life, what is the purpose of work? He saw reality, saw the changes in reality, and suddenly felt lost. "They..." A Lan couldn't find a suitable reason to explain these people, so he felt even more lost.

"No," A Lan's soul cried out, "they are indeed digging their own graves, but can you, A Lan, also be so confused? Don't you have a beautiful dream, a beautiful life? This environment, this ugliness, only serves as a kind of experience, a kind of display for your life; although it also gives you a kind of suffering, and people should endure suffering."

"A Lan," the soul cried out even louder, "face this kind of life squarely!"

IV

One day's work passed, and each soul revealed their pleasant emotions, tidied up their bodies, and calmly left the office, gradually dispersing, dispersing, and disappearing their shadows on the way home.

V

Dusk added layers upon layers, and the dormitory turned pitch black. A Lan turned on the electric light, opened a copy of "Nietzsche's Autobiography" under the dim light, and looked at it, thinking; the muscles of his whole body were constantly tense, relaxed; relaxed, tense....

——People should express their true strength, not be contaminated by the inferior, short-sighted, and selfless.

——Children growing up in humid air do not necessarily have to be pessimistic about fate. We have no other way but to become reformers—we must never let go of the situation where things retain hypocrites.

A Lan's heart was set free; he forgot the environment, forgot all impressions, like a little rabbit growing up in the grassland, with curiosity, excitement, and reverence, running to the forest with fairy music. He understood the great philosopher's words, understood what is self, what is fate, what is resistance!

VI

It was late at night, and one figure after another sneaked back from outside, and the dormitory was immediately filled with a strong smell of alcohol, cigarettes, and unrestrained laughter.

—Old Liu, the wine we drank today was good, really good chicken.

—Old Liu, hey, don't pretend to be deaf, how is the stock market today, up or down? Grabbed a hat (suspiciously) and made a profit? No wonder!

—Old Liu has good luck, Xiao Li, we want him to treat us...

—Of course I'll treat you, tomorrow, let's go to the Cosmopolitan, Nana is waiting for you there! Can't have a good time.

—Oh, still pretending to be dumb, if you have money, why not be extravagant? Definitely going...

—What, no suit? I'll lend you one; are your leather shoes old? Buy a pair...

A Lan couldn't stand these nonsense words, he flicked his two clear eyeballs and pondered in a daze. His few short beards symbolized his tenacity, stubbornness, and arrogance. Slowly, the surrounding despicable phenomena stimulated his flames to rise. So, his two pupils were filled with bright flowing light, as if they were tears, no, it was the light of his mature feelings that was sublimating.

He thought:—

Didn't God give every human being a soul? Can't pure souls accept those despicable and inferior scenes? And because of the perception of the soul, people have to resist those malicious and shameless things? Now, why do people live in this circle covered by the abyss of sin without being aware of it, but instead laugh and live very naturally? Then, what about their souls? Who snatched their souls away, who subjected them to severe torture and shackles so that they could not speak?....

A Lan then inferred from reality: those old employees, when they were young, also had a lively and brave soul, facing reality squarely and fighting. However, slowly, slowly, external stimuli, obstacles, and suffering, constantly increased. Or, for the greed and desire for official positions, their souls lost their central position; they evaded responsibility, evaded justice. Finally, the soul was ethereal in their bodies, and one by one they died. They only had a body and numb nerves left. Occasionally, they would come back to life, but it was only a slight disturbance, a groan, and they could never cheer up. From then on, they accepted sin, accepted heresy; they regarded hell as heaven and gold as life, walking towards the grave of death under the urging of the years....

A person ends his life so easily!

VII

A Lan thought so much that he was tired. He lay down on the bunk.

The noisy sound in the dormitory was slightly quieter, and a decadent melody floated in again.

—You are my soul... chirp chirp chirp... you are my life...

—Alas alas (the sighing sound mixed with the singing), no, no, no, hahaha (the sound became happy again), you are my life... chirp... you are my soul!

"Life! Soul?" A Lan was so stimulated by the boring singing that he couldn't sleep. When he opened his two eyes to observe the surroundings, it seemed that the pinkish-yellow walls were covered with sharp-headed nails, and the chairs were full of sharp knives; his bunk was a net woven with gold threads. Those who were talking and laughing were terrible skeletons. A Lan thought: he had fallen into this trap that could destroy life. And he saw groups of people who would die in this net. So, A Lan's soul was in turmoil, he judged himself, knowing that his soul was being tormented and in pain in the flames of fire... At the same time, he saw his ideal life, a writer, a teacher loved by countless children.... Therefore, his heart beat even more fiercely, like a ignorant little deer running wildly in the forest, he became excited, and angry, his head like a powder magazine about to explode.

"Hmph, you!" A Lan sat upright on the bunk, loudly—his two eyes were even bluer, brighter, and more spirited—"You dead souls! Dead souls! Find it back."

Everyone stopped and looked at A Lan's words in surprise. But no one could understand the meaning of the words: they only thought that A Lan was being stupid or crazy today.

Outside, the black of night was deeper and heavier.

The mood of "...this person alone is haggard" floated to his heart, and A Lan's soul felt lonely and lonely; although there was still a bit of superhuman arrogance.

### Zhou Xuan's Concert

— Tie Ying

As a prelude to the Spring Festival, Zhou Xuan used several pure songs to thank her fans and moviegoers. The door of the Jin Du presented the grand occasion of a festival. The program was divided into three parts, including ten famous songs, all of which were the most popular theme songs or interludes from the films Zhou Xuan starred in, and also famous songs from the victory and EMI's best-selling records.

The yellow silk curtain was drawn open, revealing the inner layer of purple-red silk curtain. In front of the orchestra platform, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performed, conducted jointly by Jin Yu Gu and Li Jinguang. The beautiful scenery blended poetic and artistic feelings, and it could also be used to match the meaning of each song, helping to complete the effect of the performance. One pure and bright lyric after another, lined with the beautiful artistic conception of the background, made people think of them as lyrical new poems—the audience was not only able to feast their ears, but also feast their eyes.

Green grass and fields, tender willow branches, white clouds in the blue sky, transforming beautiful colored areas... The singer was softly singing the theme song of Fisherwoman. The impression given to people is: quiet, clear, simple.

During the interval between the second part of the singing and the change of scenery, Yan Hou and Guan Pang Shi's comedic and unique dialogue, as well as the compilation of the song titles sung by Zhou Xuan into a story, interspersed with many jokes.

After the second act of singing was over and the curtain was lowered again, Mr. Qin Jingzhang was invited to perform a solo on the national instrument pipa—Huaiyin Pingchu. His fingering was skillful, and the strings plucked made the sound of gold, stone, pearls and jade, which was quite wonderful.

After Miss Zhou Xuan sang six pleasant and moving songs, including Fisherwoman and Phoenixes Flying Together, the third part—Phoenixes Sing in Harmony—was about to begin! The stage was decorated with clusters of flowers, rich and grand. Miss Zhou sang along with the piano, softly singing in harmony. The feature here is: there is gentleness, there is softness, there is sweetness, and there is clarity, and the singing is extremely pleasant to the ear. She can use emotion to control the singing, and she can also use the singing to express meaning and convey inner emotions. It makes people never tire of listening and lingering. Miss Zhou has her own special cultivation and talent in the art and understanding of singing!

### Crying

— Stie

—On the Birth of a Child—

Elegy of birth!

Mixed with shock, doubt, fear,

Make the first sound into the world.

…………

Light—dazzling,

Skin—tingling,

Air is a cold snake,

The bellows only fan stiffly.

…………

Starting from this cry,

Hunger, thirst, defecation, urination, worries, sorrows;

Every square centimeter of a thousand kilograms

And all eternal debts.

…………

Starting from this cry,

Birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, pain,

Welcome the line of light with a black shadow

You are a whole in the universe.

…………

Stepping into the gate of the world naked,

The thin chest beats with a hot heart;

The surrounding air is too cold,

Therefore, you must be wrapped in soft cotton wool.

…………

Limbs and body are beyond your control,

Come out of the warm black house,

You took the wrong way, this is a bright prison,

And cry out your first heartbreak!

### Ode to the Mist

— Xia Ru

The ground is veiled in clouds and mist, a gentle, moist breath hovering over rooftops, treetops, and the faces of passersby. It's like a pair of white, soft hands playfully obscuring your eyes, yet you can only respond with a tender rebuke; how could you bear resentment or anger? It is the gentleness of a passionate lover, caressing you and whispering sweet nothings into your heart.

Have you ever lingered on a misty riverbank or in a valley? It seems like a still, milky white veil, but within it lies a writhing, dancing soul.

"It is the sigh of the god Zeus, who, waking one night, sees the bustling of humankind and exhales a breath," a friend told me. I shook my head. But seeing the pervasive, self-draping curtain, drifting slowly through the dawn-lit world, so light and carefree, I cannot believe it is the troubled sigh of a great god.

The wind in the mist is a joyful wind, carrying a damp fragrance, floating to you from its wandering and then hurrying away in gusts. It licks your hair, leaving a dewy kiss on your forehead, and your still-drowsy eyes open, brightened. Facing the hazy expanse, you take a deep breath, straighten your chest, unafraid of the bloody reality that will emerge after the mist dissipates.

I love the misty dawn. It is not only as tender as a lover's hand, but also as loving as a mother's eyes, weaving together hope, with boundless kindness and resolve. Hope for a more glorious sunrise, a clearer blue sky. After the mist, there is often a cloudless azure. That is why I love it even more!

In the thick fog, we crawl along, timid and slow. Hesitating before the distant telephone poles, fearing the sounds of carriages and horses behind us. It is then that we understand the true meaning of "thinking" and "courage": considering the chaotic environment around you, choosing the safest path, summoning the determination to move forward, bravely progressing through the mist. It is the mist that teaches me how to think and be brave—about life.

The music of Northern Europe is desolate and heavy, and in misty regions, the songs of young women are filled with infinite lament, singing ancient lyrical poems, old legends from the times of grandmothers and mothers, with sorrow and love. The trembling sounds can pierce your sensitive heart. You want to sing along: "Love is like mist, coming and going without a trace..." A mist song, like weeping, like pleading.

I praise the mist, but cannot indulge in the daylight after the mist, like a dreamer who trembles in fear of the reality after the dream ends. In the mist, ugliness is temporarily concealed; in dreams, life is always beautiful. I am somewhat afraid to see everything under the sunlight.

Is this decadence? That I can long for the beauty of the mist, but cannot smile at the boundless light after the mist disappears?

### International Cup, Italy vs. China, Quarterfinals This Morning: Hopes Placed on the Chinese Team

— Bi Xian

Today, Sunday (the 8th), at 10:00 AM, the International Cup quarterfinals will be held at Jiaozhou Park, with China playing Italy. Although it's only the quarterfinals, it's practically the final. Considering the strength of the other possible finalist, Northern Europe, it's probably weaker than these two teams. So the winner of this match should secure the championship.

Seven teams joined this competition for international glory. Russia, the Jewish team, and Japan were all eliminated in the preliminary rounds. Portugal was defeated by Northern Europe in the quarterfinals.

Tournament Bracket

Our Chinese team had a bye in the preliminary rounds. Today's quarterfinal is their first appearance. They immediately face a tough opponent. The key to success or failure lies in this one match, highlighting its importance. Looking at the selected team members, apart from Jia Youliang, Han Longhai, Li Yao, Wu Qixiang, etc., who were excluded, they have practically searched all of Shanghai's first-class players. However, I still believe that gathering the essence of each team without sufficient prior practice risks the criticism of being a "star system." The outcome is a separate matter. Seamless cooperation is unlikely to be achieved. I have repeatedly written about this, but my words have been in vain. However, the situation is pressing, and we must act. The most pressing issue is how to arrange the formation. According to what the authorities have announced:

Liu Xianhan

Li Ning Zhang Linggen

Song Lingsheng Fu Zhen Meng Yiliang

Zhou Qilin Sun Jinshun Dai Linjing Li Yichen Xu Wenkui

### Overview of the Italian Team's Strength

(Reserves) Zhang Banglun, Huang Shijie, Li Tiansheng, Gao Baozheng, Luo Shoufu, Lei Shu, Yu Liming.

With the above lineup announced, we may as well examine the Italian team's strategy and strengths and weaknesses to assess whether our lineup is appropriate. The so-called Italian team will likely be composed entirely of players from the overseas Chinese community. The famous goalkeeper, Ke, will also be assisting. Although the team's goalkeeper belongs to the upper echelon, the strength gained is still limited, but the team's momentum will undoubtedly become more magnificent because of this. The defenders Sirati, Luo Xulai, the center backs Ottonilo, Xue Weitai, and Bolini are unlikely to be changed. The forwards are likely to be: with Yatuomali sick, the center forward will be Teikeni, right forward Bama, left winger Di Panbang, right winger Vila, and left forward Baojie. With the lineup clear, let's talk about their strategy. In defense, the forwards and backs always form a straight line, with little skill in cooperation. They rely on their strength to follow the opposing players. Center back Ottonilo seems to be focused on defense, but in reality, his strong legs allow him to do as he pleases, either assisting the wings or cleverly passing through the middle. Therefore, Ottonilo is the most satisfactory center back in assisting the attack. Moreover, his passes are without hesitation, making it easy to catch the opponent off guard. As for the attack, the wingers have the ability to cross to each other, but lack the skill to dribble deep and break through the center. The two inside forwards can return to defense and dribble the ball, but the positions of the two inside forwards are too chaotic, resulting in no fixed style. Furthermore, the players' shots lack precision, so it's hard to get the best reviews from all circles.

### Li Ning Should Be Replaced by Tiansheng

It can be seen whether our Chinese team's lineup is reasonable and if it's a targeted strategy. I think the biggest mistake is the left back Li Ning, and the left forward is Song Lingsheng. I've often seen Li and Song representing the Chinese Association, occupying these two positions, and each time they seem to be working independently, frequently making mistakes. And this time, the Italian attack will be more on the right than on the left, so heavily relying on Li and Song is tantamount to giving them an opportunity. Isn't this making a big mistake? I think Li Ning should be replaced by Li Tiansheng. Both are veterans with old qualifications and rich experience. But in terms of leg strength and energy, the latter is superior to the former. Some will say that Li Ning's position is excellent, which I don't deny. But observe Li Ning's weak leg and the fact that nineteen out of ten balls he kicks are out of bounds, with no better landing point. Moreover, cooperation between Li Tiansheng and Song Lingsheng is expected, and the past unsuccessful phenomenon of Li Ning and Song Lingsheng working independently will definitely not be repeated. If some think that Li Ning's mind is clearer than Tiansheng's and insist on reusing him, then I think Tan Fuzhen should switch positions with Song Lingsheng. For the sake of team cooperation, this is a necessary transformation on the defensive end.

### It's Better Not to Have A Dai Kick

Let's talk about the forward line. After looking at the list, almost everyone thinks they are all well-known generals, but I feel that this forward line can be called old-fashioned. The most needed for forwards are two inside forwards with the strength to return to the defense and dribble the ball. Sun Jinshun is okay, but Li Yichen may not be able to do it, which will make Meng Yiliang feel unsupported. This is not a good strategy. And in fact, the way to attack Italy, in addition to the leg, is to rely on a forward who can dart around, otherwise, it will be difficult to break through the enemy's goal. The five listed forwards are all veterans, but there is no darting energy. Dai Linjing's center forward position does indeed impress, supplying Longhai with balls for a darting attack, and passing to Youliang and Li Yao in the most tacit position. However, since Jia, Li, and Han can't play, I say A Dai will bury his talent. So A Dai should step down, and Li Yichen should take the center position, and another person, Gao Baozheng, should be used as an inside forward as a reasonable attempt to defeat the enemy. Although Xu Wenkui has skillful ball skills, he is ultimately unable to keep up physically. I hope he will know his limitations and switch Yu Liming onto the field. However, if Yu goes on the field, I hope he will make more breakthroughs, and avoid pointlessly trying to pull the goal, as Yu's kick has no purpose.

The above is the reporter's suggestion that the Chinese team's lineup needs to be changed. I wonder if it can invite the sympathy of the authorities?

Finally, I sincerely hope that the soldiers who are about to go into battle will cooperate sincerely at the time, work together, not hold personal opinions, and fight bravely to the end to achieve the wish to defeat the Italian generals and win glory for the country. All fans are looking forward to it. Cheer up! Athletes! (Le)

### Post-Match Commentary on the North China-Hua Lian Championship

The authorities were afraid that there would be too many spectators in the final battle of the North China-Hua Lian Basketball League 甲甲group, causing disputes, and that simply increasing ticket prices would lose the original intention of promotion. Therefore, they would rather hold it secretly at the Youth Association Gymnasium in Baxianqiao at 10 am last weekend (April 1st). This is a win-win and a helpless strategy. As a result, North China won a great victory, and the 甲甲group was able to come to a satisfactory end, and the authorities got rid of a concern. But the fans heard about it, and they will definitely complain that the authorities are unreasonable, and there is no opportunity to admire it! So the reporter went with the referee of the game, Jin Botao, in the morning and didn't miss it. Here is a post-match review of this final game to help the fans quench their thirst.

North China Wins the Championship

At the beginning of the game, Hua Lian was skilled in basketball, taking the lead. North China did not show weakness, so the scores were always very close, with a constant difference of two or three points. And the first half was over. North China led by twenty-one to eighteen. In the second half, Hua Lian had the heart to revive and still tried to recover. The offensive was very good, chasing closely. North China did not relax at all, and the battle was very exciting and tense. But Hua Lian unfortunately lagged behind at twenty-two to twenty-seven. Because of Xu Jusheng's four fouls, there were no substitutes, and they were unable to make a comeback, and North China trampled on them at will. Hua Lian was defeated, and North China won the 甲甲group championship.

Review of the Advantages of the Two Teams

Comparing this final game, there is really no ideal basketball skill to admire. Because Hua Lian has Qu Xilin, Fan Qinggong, Zhang Xianlun, and Quan Changchun, the four knights who went north and have not returned, and North China also has Shen Yugong who has a foot injury that has not healed, and Tan Yongzhan has already gone elsewhere, and is busy acting in Paris. Therefore, both sides see that domination is easy, but it is extremely difficult to adjust. Under these circumstances, it depends on each other's caution and reducing fouls is the prerequisite. North China was able to pay attention to this point, being careful, and there were few fouls. On the other hand, Hua Lian was punished in the first half by Bott. In the second half, Xu Jusheng was again graduated four times. This is the only reason why Hua Lian failed, with a difference of nineteen points.

Hua Lian has three points that are satisfying. First, the accuracy of the shot is breathtaking. Xu Jusheng, Zhang Liangxiong, and Kong Guangyi can be called shots from anywhere. The second is the extensive use of individual skills, so they can have the opportunity to shoot from a distance. The third is that even in the face of North China's fear, they tried their best to follow up under the basket, not afraid of North China, which is worthy of praise. What is disappointing is the degeneration of Wu Chengzhang, who accomplished nothing, and the failure to pay attention to fouls, which led to no one to replace him, which is a pity for the defeat.

The success of North China lies in the defense and offense. Its use of man-to-man marking has become pure. This is the first point. It is desirable to use height, passing over the top, and standing under the basket to follow up and support people, killing the enemy. Although the method of blocking people is rarely used when attacking, it has the heart to lure the enemy in the unnecessary passing, and Zhuo Guorong has repeatedly gained gaps, all of which are good gains.

The basketball season has passed, and the wonderful games in Shanghai will disappear with the 北大北決戰告北. I heard that the North China Brave Tianjin Basketball Team has come to Shanghai. The Shanghai Children's Library plans to raise funds to invite North China and 克克仁余 to make four anti-matches. If so, then as the autumn wave is approaching, basketball can still have a grand event, and we will wait and see. (Dao)

### Han Longhai Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before

Due to the fact that Donghua and Overseas Chinese United lost by one goal in the rematch, fans are missing this young white-robed general Han Longhai. He has the fastest darting momentum, he has the kung fu to pounce one step faster than the ape McNitti, so he got the elegant name of "McNitti Kui Xing", and in fact, he is indeed the forward that McNitti is most afraid of.

A month ago, General Han went to Bengbu for official business, and he was supposed to stay there for one or two months, but why did he suddenly return? It is said that it was because of the urgent telegram from Cheng Bo'an, the owner of Fuhua, because there will be a grand football game in Shanghai recently, and he specially invited Longhai to rush back to participate in the war. The reporter met Mr. Han yesterday. According to him, he arrived in Shanghai the night before (the 6th). It is expected that when this grand football match is staged, with the assistance of General Han, the fans who miss him will flock to watch it. Really, maybe he will kick this ball and leave Shanghai. We will wait and see when the game comes soon. (Jiujing)

### The Racecourse Stadium is Still Leased for Matches

The Football Federation is indeed racking its brains on the stadium issue. It often feels insufficient, which affects the progress of the game a lot. A few days ago, Yiyuan Greyhound Racecourse was ordered by the authorities to dissolve within a time limit, and the stadium was also subject to the example of being closed. When the bad news came, it was tantamount to a serious blow to the Football Federation. (According to the Football Federation, Yiyuan Stadium is the most suitable for all important football matches.) Recently, there has also been talk about stopping the lease of the racecourse, so the panic of the stadium has become more serious, and Jiaozhou Park is the only one left that can publicly sell tickets.

Although the football league and various cup games have come to an end, the remaining games are attractive and require a large venue. Jiaoyuan has a small capacity and it is difficult to maintain order. The Football Federation has consulted several times, but it is difficult to get a satisfactory result. According to reliable sources yesterday, the racecourse stadium is still allowed to be open, and the lease will continue to be used for football matches. The Football Federation was overjoyed after hearing the news. The current stadium problem is expected to be solved, which is also good news for fans. (Muzi)

### Sports News

Zeng Rongzhong, the former national record holder for 200 meters and 400 meters, is a Fujianese from Min. He graduated from National Jinan University. He is now in Saigon, the capital of Thailand, continuing his father's business, operating rice and wood sales. He said in a letter a few days ago that due to the obstruction of maritime transportation, business is rather bleak. (Leda Guan)

The White Horse Small Football Team was crowned champion in the Fuhua Cup last year. Recently, I heard that the White Horse Football Team has been established. In addition to the original generals Jia Youliang, Dai Linjing, and Zhang Linggen, it also plans to invite famous players to join. Its lineup can be called unmatched. Mr. Cheng Bo'an has already started to proceed. Once it is established, it will confront the strong teams on the sea, which will surely refresh the fans' eyes and ears.

Huang Xingfen of the Green Team has been married since last summer. A few days ago, she was seen to be pregnant.

The first edition of "Sports Figures" edited by Hongchen has been sold out, which shows that its content is excellent. Now I know that the second edition has also been published a few days ago, and it is expected to be popular for a while. Sports people must be the first to see it.

Qian Xucang and Xie Yiqin have been playing ping-pong in the Huangjiasha Dick Ping-Pong Room every day recently. Due to age, basketball is already too much for him, so this is just a painting exercise to relax his muscles and bones. (Yongduan)

### Green Team Yan Wei is About to Get Married

Miss Yan Weiwen, who has been red since the Qixiu Girls' School basketball team, and has now served as the center of the Si Team women's basketball team. Her ball skills are improving day by day, so this year's performance can be said to be in the most peak state of Miss Yan. We are hoping that she will continue to work hard, have more innovative performances, and improve the level of women's basketball.

Miss Yan's advantages are her standard physique, abundant energy, clear mind, and accurate shots. Miss Yan has made considerable contributions to the Green Team's ability to dominate the Shanghai arena. What is even more valuable is that Miss Yan always smiles during the game, and seems to care about gains and losses. Therefore, she has won the elegant name of "Sweetheart" and gained fame in the sports world.

Now the news has come that Miss Yan's wedding is scheduled, and it has been decided within the next week. As for the exact date, it has not been found out. Although, the reporter has inquired in many ways and has also visited Miss Yan, she is always smiling and perfunctorily saying, "I will invite Mr. to have a wedding banquet on that day," so it is impossible to report. What can be decided is that it will be one day in the next week.

After Miss Yan gets married, she is probably planning to leave Shanghai. Then the Green Team will suffer a loss, and the fans' eyes will be too shallow.

Indeed, I often feel a little inexplicably at a loss when a female player who is progressing suddenly disappears from the stadium after getting married. (Skinny reporter)

### An Explanation of Basketball Theory (15)

— Liang Zhao'an

How to Snatch Rebounds

The key to snatching rebounds is to avoid being beaten to the front by the opponent when they shoot. Stand between yourself and the basket to block the ball. When the opponent's shot is released, move closer to the basket, stand firmly, and crouch slightly. Observe the ball hitting the backboard and bouncing out, then jump up with all your might. At the highest point, raise both hands to seize the ball, and grip it tightly in your hands, without slapping it. When both feet touch the ground, immediately place the ball in your abdomen for protection, while glancing left and right. If heavily defended, try to escape, either by pivoting or dribbling to the sideline, seeking an open teammate to pass to. If there is no heavy defense after obtaining the ball, seize the opportunity and execute a fast break while the opponent is unprepared, using long passes to teammates near the basket for a layup. Those who can consistently secure rebounds can not only deny the opponent follow-up shot opportunities, but also increase the number of offensive possessions for our team, thereby increasing the chances of victory. Therefore, securing rebounds is the most important skill in defensive strategy.

Defending Against an Opponent Without the Ball

To defend an opponent without the ball, first and foremost, ensure you are always positioned between the opponent and the basket, preventing them from receiving a pass. If, while guarding, the opponent gets ahead and runs faster than you, run backwards, urgently moving towards the basket to secure the inner circle, finding the shortest route, and then intercepting the opponent. While moving, wave your hands to disturb the opponent and make it difficult to pass the ball to them. If, while guarding, the opponent remains stationary, judge their skills and determine your defensive position. If the opponent is good at long-range shots, stand closer to make it difficult for them to shoot. If the opponent is more agile than you, stay further away, moving closer to the inner circle to observe their movements and shorten your defensive route. However, always be mindful of the opponent's attempts to screen, preventing them from using a two-person attack.

Defending Against an Opponent With the Ball

To defend an opponent with the ball, in addition to constantly positioning yourself between the opponent and the basket, you must also consider the situation and decide how to attempt a steal. Do not rush forward to steal unless the opponent has finished dribbling, and do not stand too close. Otherwise, they may seize the opportunity to escape by pivoting or using the dribble to evade. Therefore, at this moment, your position should be within reach of the ball they are holding. Wait for them to be inattentive, then slap the ball out from below and seize it. When slapping the ball, slap from below upwards, not from above downwards. If the opponent has finished dribbling and encounters your defense, you can immediately step forward to steal the ball, or stand closer to make the opponent flustered and lose the ball, or result in a jump ball. However, when approaching the opponent, be careful to prevent them from bounce-passing the ball and escaping after the pass, leaving you lunging in vain and behind the opponent. Therefore, do not forcibly attempt to steal the ball unless you are very confident.

Defending Against Two Opponents with One Defender

Defending against two opponents with one defender is often used during the opponent's fast break. In this situation, the defensive strategy should be to first step forward and feint, causing the opponent dribbling the ball to stop, then quickly retreat to closely guard the opponent near the basket. While retreating, wave your hands to feint, disturb the dribbling opponent, and delay their passing and shooting opportunities, waiting for teammates to catch up and assist, or intercept their pass. This defensive method is extremely strenuous and difficult to execute. Therefore, in this situation, other teammates must provide support to prevent a dangerous situation.

Defending Against an Opponent Dribbling Forward

To defend an opponent dribbling forward, position yourself between the dribbler and the basket. Follow the opponent, and as much as possible, force them towards the sideline or corner of the court, trapping them in a difficult situation, making it difficult to shoot or pass. If you can run alongside the opponent, you can seize an opportunity to steal the ball when they are unprepared. To steal the ball, use the hand closest to the opponent's body, reaching under their dribbling hand to continue the dribble. Slap the ball out, slapping it lower and faster than the opponent. After slapping it out, turn to block the opponent to prevent them from taking it back. When stealing the ball, do not slap down on the opponent's dribbling hand, otherwise, not only will the ball be blocked by the opponent's hand, making it difficult to steal, but you will also easily hit the opponent's hand and commit a foul. If the dribbler comes head-on and tries to pass you, they will quickly dribble the ball low. Therefore, the defender should also bend their knees and lower their body to defend. If they dribble too low and lose control of the ball, you can steal it. If the opponent dribbles forward to shoot, occupy the inner circle and follow them until they jump up to shoot, jumping up at the same time and slapping the ball out as it leaves their hand, preventing them from scoring. When jumping up, face the opponent and avoid contact, using the hand furthest from the opponent to slap the ball. For example, if the opponent shoots at the right corner of the basket, use your left hand to slap the ball; if they shoot at the left corner, use your right hand. If you can time your jump accurately, this interception method is very easy and a foolproof defensive tactic.

Defending Against an Opponent Pivoting

Defending against an opponent pivoting is quite difficult. Therefore, the defender must be alert and agile, able to anticipate the opponent's movements, not be deceived by their feints, and never let their guard down. Especially when the opponent is near the basket or in the free-throw area and wants to pivot, these two locations are critical areas contested by both offense and defense, so strict defense is essential. The methods of strict defense can be described as follows:

(A) Strictly Defending Against an Opponent Pivoting Near the Basket

When an opponent pivots near the basket, their goal is to escape the defender's surveillance in order to seize the opportunity to rush forward and shoot at the corner of the basket. Therefore, the defender should be wary of their feints to turn and escape, and must anticipate their true movement, forcing the opponent as close to the sideline as possible, firmly defending the position between the basket and the opponent. Keep your feet apart and your arms outstretched, making it difficult for them to rush past you. If the opponent moves away, retreats near the sideline or the court, and lures you closer, be wary of their screening tactics, where a second opponent comes to block you. At the same time, alert your teammates to strictly guard the gaps in the free-throw area, preventing the opponent with the ball from escaping. To shoot, or pass the ball to the opponent near the basket for a layup, in this situation, if you cannot steal the opponent's ball, at least force the opponent to pass the ball back to the rear before fulfilling your defensive duty.

(B) Strictly Defending Against an Opponent Pivoting Near the Free Throw Line

When the opponent is standing near the free-throw line in front of the basket, they are likely to receive a pass and then turn and shoot, so strict defense is essential. The defensive method should be to stand beside the opponent, with one hand extended in front of the opponent and one hand placed behind the opponent to make it difficult for them to receive the ball. Once the opponent receives the ball, immediately stand behind them. At this time, do not try to steal the ball, but be prepared for their feints, pivoting left and right to escape, or jumping up to turn and shoot. Your position should change according to the opponent's direction of rotation, and you must pay attention to which hand the ball-handler uses to shoot. If they are good at using their right hand, they will first feint to the right or upwards, and when the defender is deceived and leaves their position, they will pivot to the left to escape and shoot. If they are good at using their left hand, the opposite is true. Therefore, you must anticipate the opponent's true intentions and determine when they start to shoot before blocking. If you can make fierce gestures behind the opponent, using feints to counter feints, you can make the opponent panic and make it difficult for them to shoot, and they will pass the ball back to the rear. If the opponent wants to jump up and turn to shoot, you should jump up at the same time and raise both hands to intercept the ball. But under this strict defense, the opponent may not turn and shoot themselves, but pass the ball to the opponents on either side who are moving forward towards the corner of the basket. Therefore, other teammates should cooperate to defend, so that the opponent has no opportunity to exploit.

1. Key Points of Individual Defense

When your team loses possession of the ball, retreat to defend immediately.

Always occupy the inner circle and defend, standing between the opponent and the basket, so that you can take care of both the ball and the opponent.

When defending, keep your feet apart and your arms outstretched. If the opponent has the ball, raise one hand in front of them to block their shooting or passing lane, and constantly wave your hand to make the opponent panic and disrupt their vision.

Always stand with your heels off the ground, so that you can sprint in any direction at any time.

Except in front of the basket, all defensive stances should be with bent knees and a lowered body, ready to block and steal.

Do not turn around with both feet firmly planted. Lift one foot to turn.

Always stick close to the opponent, stopping and running with them simultaneously.

If the opponent uses "man-to-man" defense and blocking offense, quickly switch defensive positions to counter it.

Run alongside an opponent dribbling forward, and seize the opportunity to slap the ball from under their hand.

Remember that in all defensive strategies, footwork is more important than handwork.

### Several Rising Stars of Football and Basketball

— Mei Bixian

In the football world, figures like Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Sun Jinshun, and Li Yichen have long histories known to a generation of fans. Similarly, in the basketball world, figures like Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Kong Guangyi, and Qu Xilin, as well as women's basketball players like Rong Shujian, Huang Mingyuan, Li Zhizhi, and Deng Xiuchun are well-known. Of course, while we hope for and encourage these veterans, we should pay even more attention to the younger generation. Given the space often allotted to football and basketball in the newspaper, and considering my own personal circumstances and frail health, which make writing difficult, I have reluctantly chosen this topic to write about the newly famous football and basketball players of recent years, sharing my observations from the field and also hoping to encourage the progress of these younger athletes.

After gathering information, I've come up with a list that roughly includes Han Longhai, Li Yao, and Luo Shoufu in football, Wu Chengzhang, Lin Weicong, and He Jingui in men's basketball, and Yan Weiwen, Xie Lijian, and Zhan Xiuqiong in women's basketball, totaling nine people. I will describe them separately below, starting with women's basketball to show respect for women's rights.

Women's Basketball Heroines

(1) Yan Weiwen

She is the center for the Green Team women's basketball team. Some might say that Miss Yan is also a veteran, as she, along with Zhang Jiapei and Liu Zhenbao, formed the once-famous "Three Musketeers" of Qixiu. However, in reality, Miss Yan was the weakest of the three at that time, with a short and chubby figure and unrefined skills. Now, Miss Yan has a well-proportioned physique and has received careful instruction from Mr. Qian Xucang. Therefore, whether it's holding the ball, dribbling, or shooting, all three are above average. She can be considered the standard center in Shanghai women's basketball and should be listed as a new talent. What's even more commendable is that Miss Yan always smiles during games, earning her the nickname "Sweet Girl." I admire her progress in basketball skills and respect her spirit, so I list her as the first person in this article.

(2) Xie Lijian

She is an excellent forward in the Overseas Chinese team. Miss Xie's specialty is soaring up for a shot, with a graceful posture and precise positioning. It is rare to see such talent among newcomers. Miss Xie is still young and shows significant progress in each game. We can believe that Miss Xie's basketball fame will surely be praised by fans in a short time.

(3) Zhan Xiuqiong

I only became aware of this newcomer's skills during the Shenbao Cup Basketball League. She joined the Yikang team and, thanks to the guidance of the famous Wu Shibin, Miss Zhan has a clear understanding of basketball tactics. We can often see the team using forward Ren Kuanping to screen, and Zhan Xiuqiong quickly darts into the most open space, easily scoring and returning. From this, it can be seen that Miss Zhan has an extremely clear mind and can perform so well under pressure, making her a top-tier talent. Her future is undoubtedly bright.

Men's Basketball Trio

(1) Wu Chengzhang

Of course, he hasn't been playing basketball for a short time, but he has always been stuck in the B-league ranks and has not been noticed. When the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory basketball team was established, Mr. Wu was appreciated by the team manager, Zhang Huixiang, and was listed as one of the official members. After being polished by the veterans of the team, Mr. Wu's abilities were highlighted. When the Hualian team won the Xiqing championship and repeatedly displayed their prowess in the Chenyou Cup and Shenbao Cup, Mr. Wu also gave outstanding performances. His interception of the ball under the basket is accurate in both position and timing, making it difficult to obtain. Moreover, he has abundant stamina and runs tirelessly throughout the game, which is one of the most important prerequisites for a basketball player. Mr. Wu's teammates call him "Little Brother," which shows that he is in his prime. I encourage "Little Brother" to strive for progress, as his future is limitless.

(2) Lin Weicong

Similar to Wu Chengzhang, he has always been a good player in the B-league ranks. After being favored by Ren Yu Zuo Xunzi, he worked for the Ren Yu team. After being enlightened by Mr. Yu, his skills improved day by day, and the young player was transformed into a famous player, making many contributions to the Ren Yu team. He is now being recruited by the Shantou team and has been entrusted with the important task of captain. Little Lin is truly blessed by heaven. His advantage is that he can shoot from any corner, with both his left and right hands, and he is very confident. He has a lithe body and excellent speed, making him difficult to guard. He is the most standard talent among basketball forwards.

(3) He Jingui

Mr. He's floor skills can be compared to Feng Nianhua at his peak. Although he is short, he has good elasticity, so he does not suffer from being short. He is lifted into the air by another player, and rushes under the basket with a dribble, then shoots. His beautiful posture and swift movements prove his floor skills. He has always been a member of the Huanan team, which is known as the "Little Tyrant" of the basketball world, and Mr. He has made great contributions. In the third Basketball League, the Huanan team was effectively scattered, and Mr. He's skills will be separated from us for a while.

Young White Uniforms (Football)

(1) Han Longhai

Longhai has been working for Donghua for a long time. He used to play the center back position, but in the first league of the Football Federation, Donghua had more center back talents, so Longhai played the right inside forward, displaying great agility, liveliness, and elusiveness. His running speed is aggressive, causing foreigners to lose their color in fear. Donghua's consistent victories last year were greatly related to Longhai's fierce attacks. However, due to the burden of fame, he is easily noticed by the opponent, so he suffers from being closely monitored, leaving Longhai with no chance to use his skills.

(2) Li Yao

The left winger who became famous in one season, and the only left winger in Shanghai, is Li Yao. When Mr. Li was first tried as a left winger for Donghua, people did not dare to place too much hope in him. Unexpectedly, under the guidance of Sun Jinshun, his skills greatly improved, his shooting became sharp, and his courage gradually increased. He is not flustered in the face of strong enemies, and he is full of energy and does not tire in difficult battles. Looking at all the teams in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, there is no such good left winger material, so he has been repeatedly selected as a representative of Shanghai and the representative of the Chinese team. Having achieved so much in just one season, is Li Yao truly a natural talent?

(3) Luo Shoufu

After participating in the friendly matches this year, fans have noticed him and looked at each other in appreciation. Little Luo also seems to live up to people's expectations, working hard in battle and giving a good performance in every game, earning unanimous praise from the audience. His playing style is said to be somewhat similar to Li Yingtang, and some say it resembles the famous star V. Suo Ruo. In fact, Little Luo has a wide stride, and his dribbling and shooting skills are excellent. He has both intelligence and hard work and is truly a good material among forwards. I hope Little Luo will not be arrogant or discouraged, but will work harder and reach the peak of achievement. We have high hopes for him.
