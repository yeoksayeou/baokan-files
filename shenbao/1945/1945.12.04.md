Furthermore, Wang Qingmao, Chief of Staff of the 13th Air Force Area Command, and 14 others flew to Jinzhou on the 2nd to take over the airport. The suggestion that I proposed about industrial and mining rights and the navigation rights of the Songhua River is inaccurate.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Chen Yanjiong, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Communications for the Northeast, Chen Gongliang, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance for the Northeast, and their party flew to Beiping on the morning of the 3rd and will transfer to Changchun.

[United Press, Beiping, 3rd] Central government officials responsible for receiving the Nine Northeastern Provinces, who had suddenly withdrawn from Changchun two weeks ago, are now preparing to return to Changchun, as the situation appears to be clarifying, to carry out handover work with the Soviet occupation forces. Song Ziwen, Premier of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the newly established Supreme Economic Council, will arrive here today or tomorrow to confer with senior officials of the Nine Northeastern Provinces on handover matters and to provide personal instructions to ensure compliance with the recent Sino-Soviet understandings reached in Chongqing. Jiang Jingguo, Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the Nine Northeastern Provinces, and Zhang Jia'ao, Special Commissioner for Economic Affairs, arrived here from Chongqing late yesterday. They met with officials of the Northeast Headquarters and the chairmen of the Nine Northeastern Provinces that evening. If the weather is clear tomorrow, Jiang and Zhang will fly to Changchun with the Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Chongqing, accompanied by several financial and economic advisors. Jiang stated that after arriving in Changchun, he would discuss with Soviet Military Commander General Malinovsky the method of airlifting the central army to the Nine Northeastern Provinces. The method of transferring political affairs in the Nine Northeastern Provinces is also on the agenda. Fifty mining special commissioners, engineers, and technicians are also currently in Beiping. The Fushun coal mine near Shenyang, the largest coal deposit in Asia, will be taken over by them. It is estimated that the Nine Northeastern Provinces have a total of 200 billion tons of coal and 20 billion tons of iron, with the Fushun coal mine being the richest in reserves.

### National Army Approaches Shenyang; Elders in Jinzhou Accuse the "Road-Destroying Army" of Crimes

[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] The vanguard of the National Army has reached a location 90 li from Shenyang. Airlifted troops will begin entering the Nine Northeastern Provinces next week.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] It is reported that more than 500,000 leather coats and winter uniforms have been shipped to Beiping for use by the National Army heading to the Northeast. The Beiping area is prepared to dispatch troops on a large scale to the Northeast as soon as orders are given.

[United Press, Jinzhou, 3rd] General Du Yuming, the Northeast Security Commander, is only 42 years old, short and energetic. He fought alongside American General Stilwell in the India-Burma-Yunnan theater and is a world-renowned hero. Du entered newly recovered Jinzhou today and established his headquarters. The people of the city lined the streets to cheer, displaying great enthusiasm. Jinzhou is a semi-Chinese, semi-Japanese industrial city with a population of 200,000. Elders emerged from their mud houses, where they had lived for generations, to complain about the suffering endured during the two months of occupation by the disorderly troops. They stated, "We could barely survive for 14 years under Japanese occupation, but two months under the control of the 'Road-Destroying Army' (those who destroy roads) was too long." The disorderly troops robbed the residents of food and livestock, seizing everything they wanted. The Soviet troops who came here two months ago to disarm the Japanese forces did the same. The 40,000 disarmed Japanese soldiers, disheveled and barefoot, were full of awe towards the Chinese soldiers. Meanwhile, General Du's troops continued to advance northeast of Jinzhou, progressing 45 li today without encountering any resistance. According to General Du, the disorderly troops kidnapped the puppet provincial governor of Jinzhou and all the railway officials as hostages when they retreated yesterday, and their whereabouts are unknown. Du frankly hopes to reach Harbin within a month, and the "Road-Destroying Army" may collapse within two months. The "Road-Destroying Army" had obstructed transportation between Soviet troops and the Great Wall, but now national troops have landed on the south side of this area and will strengthen protection. The "Road-Destroying Army" broke through the national army's defenses 45 li south of here, disrupting traffic for four days. A force of 2,000 from the "Road-Destroying Army" clashed with a unit of the national army for a full day and night, resulting in 70 casualties for the "Road-Destroying Army" and 10 deaths for the national army. According to news from Shenyang, the Soviet army withdrew on the 10th of last month, and the "Road-Destroying Army" moved in and began looting and destroying factories to prevent them from being used by the national army.

### Fierce Battle Rages in the Suburbs of Baotou; National Army Enters Suburbs of Tianjin; Security Consolidated; Most of the Communist Troops near Tangshan Come to Their Senses

[Central News Agency, Guisui, 3rd] The Northeast Communist Army suddenly shelled the city walls around 3:00 AM on the 3rd. Within 50 li of Baotou's suburbs, fighting continued on the afternoon of the 3rd.

Simultaneously, over 10,000 infantrymen stormed the west gate. Several sections of the northwest wall of Baotou were breached, but the National Army and civilians bravely resisted and patched the breaches. Although the Communist Army launched 14 or 15 consecutive assaults, they failed to succeed. Around 4:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, the Communist Army retreated in defeat. However, their subsequent troops are rushing to Baotou to reinforce them, and a fierce battle is still raging. [Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Military news: In the past 48 hours, the National and Communist armies have engaged in the fiercest bloody battle of the current civil war in snow-covered Baotou. Elite Communist suicide squads, using Japanese weapons and aided by Japanese artillery units, armored vehicles driven by Japanese personnel, and pro-Communist Mongolian cavalry units, are launching a final assault on Baotou. The government claims that Baotou has been surrounded by the Communist army since November 8, but since the 1st of this month, the government has dispatched powerful Hui Muslim cavalry to surround the Communist army from the outside. According to a wireless message received indirectly from Baotou, the defending troops in Baotou are running out of ammunition, with only 500 American carbines. The Communist army is now under attack from all sides. The 12th War Area's wireless broadcast stated that the Communist army's total collapse is not far off. The current battle zone is within 48 li around Baotou.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd] Security in the suburbs of Tianjin is becoming increasingly consolidated.

Government authorities have strongly denied this. The government side declared that this is the work of "conspirators" attempting to use pure students to achieve their ambition of overthrowing the government, and they are even resorting to coercive force in an attempt to maintain the strike. The newspaper also stated that some students in Kunming are vigorously supporting the government and have issued a telegram calling on the Kuomintang to suppress the actions of the rebels, unify the nation's political and military commands, eliminate all "conspirators" who exploit students, and eradicate all "rogue intellectuals."

### Sixteen Cultural Organizations in Chongqing Issue a Joint Declaration on the Current Situation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Sixteen cultural organizations in Chongqing, including the Chinese Writers' Association, have recently issued a joint declaration on the current situation. The full text is as follows:

The eight years of the War of Resistance were the most sacred and arduous. Our compatriots shed their blood and sacrificed their lives. Those who were weak contributed their strength, and those who had no money contributed their resources. They left their homes and abandoned their wives and children. We endured all the suffering of wartime. We have endured it for eight years. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, will we not be allowed to enjoy peace? Must we continue to endure suffering? The people are weary; they deserve a respite. We demand peace; we oppose internal strife. Whoever starts internal strife is our enemy. During this War of Resistance, our country suffered the greatest destruction in its history. How many prosperous cities and towns have been turned into scorched earth? How many emerging factories are left with only rubble? How much brilliant culture has been turned into ashes?

To Build a Great Unified Nation

Now that we have won, will we not be allowed to rebuild our homeland on the ruins of destruction? Will we not be allowed to rebuild our homes on the dilapidated walls? We demand life; we demand construction. Whoever prevents us from construction, whoever wants to destroy after destruction, is our enemy. Construction first, nation-building first. The nation we want to build is a great unified nation. Only a unified nation is a modern nation, and only a unified nation can shoulder the great task of nation-building.

We were able to become stronger through war and even became one of the five great powers. We can finally hold our heads high and speak our minds. How can we allow ourselves to be divided at this time, preventing the nation from becoming a modern nation and the people from becoming modern people? We support unification; we oppose division. Whoever creates division is our enemy.

Support Democracy and Demand the Rule of Law

After a great war, discipline and laws must be rectified. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, society underwent enormous changes. Without discipline and the rule of law, how can we restore social order and establish a democratic nation? Democracy goes hand in hand with the rule of law; without the rule of law, there is no democracy. We support democracy; we demand the rule of law. Those who disrupt discipline and the rule of law are the enemies of democracy and our enemies. Unfortunately, while we demand democracy, unification, peace, and construction, the Communist Party is engaged in a major rebellion against democracy, unification, peace, and construction.

At the beginning of Japan's surrender, the Communist Party disregarded the decisions of the Allied nations and the orders of the Supreme Commander. It arbitrarily issued the so-called Yan'an Headquarters Order, seeking the illegal right to accept the surrender. First, it independently advanced to accept the surrender; then, it obstructed and attacked the national army accepting the surrender; and then, it launched widespread attacks on the national army throughout the country. From Guangzhou to Guisui, there were instances of Communist troops besieging the national army everywhere. From the surrender to the present, there have been daily reports of Communist troops besieging and attacking cities and territories. What have the people done to deserve this slaughter? Where is the peace we hoped for? Railway construction has been destroyed. Where is the construction we hoped for? The Communist Party has established separatist rule, resembling feudalism. Where is the unification we demanded? The Communist Party opposes the convening of the National Assembly, resorting to military chaos instead of political struggle. Where is the democracy we demanded?

Promote the Communist Party to Stop Internal Strife

The Communist Party is also aware that this rebellion violates the demands of the people and is playing with terms and stealing names, trying to shirk its responsibility for internal strife, hoping to deceive the people of the world with one hand. They are also shouting for democracy to achieve their private goals of opposing the nation and the government, but they do not understand that democracy must have the rule of law and discipline. They are loudly shouting about their so-called "liberated areas" to cover up their separatist and divisive actions, without asking from whom they seized their so-called "liberated areas." They are also loudly shouting "oppose civil war" to win the sympathy of peace-loving people and to shirk their responsibility for starting internal strife, without asking whether the so-called "civil war" is actually caused by internal strife. Such hypocrisy only proves their growing anxiety. This rebellion is expanding. If the Communist Party persists in its own way and continues on the path of armed force, what will the people live on? What will the nation be?

We are all organizations dedicated to cultural work. We have the duty to expose conspiracies that steal names and disrupt right and wrong, and we also have the responsibility to reiterate the demands for democracy, unification, peace, and construction. We believe that there are many wise people in the Communist Party, and not all the people of the country can be deceived. If the members of the Communist Party are willing to be friends of the people, then please stop the internal strife or do not participate in it. This would be a great blessing for the nation and the people. If they are still unrepentant, it will not only be a great disaster for the nation and the people, but also a public enemy of the people of our country. Disaster! Blessing! Enemy! Friend! The decision now rests on the single thought of every member of the Communist Party. We wish to earnestly inform our compatriots and the members of the Communist Party of this. Chinese Writers Association, Chinese Inventors Association, Chinese National Fine Arts Association, Chinese Religious Fellowship Association, Chinese Catholic Cultural Association, Chinese Buddhist Society, Confucius Society, Life Philosophy Research Association, Youth Discussion Association, Chinese Psychological Construction Association, China National Sports Association, Chinese Know-Do Society, Chinese Border Association, Chinese Literary and Art Association, Chinese Overseas Enterprise Cultural Association, Chinese Youth Writers Association.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Zhao Cai Guild Hall, National Salvation Association, and other four organizations in Mexico City have all telegraphed Chairman Chiang requesting the suppression of the rebellion in order to uphold the national law and maintain the foundation of the nation.

### Editorial: The Construction of the Changsha Water Dam

—A Major Event in Chinese History

As the Political Consultative Conference is about to convene and the situation in the Northeast is showing signs of improvement, we must not easily overlook another very meaningful event in China's rebirth: the implementation of the Yangtze River water dam project. The U.S. authorities have signed a contract with the China Resources Commission, under which American engineers will draft plans to build an unprecedentedly grand concrete and steel dam on the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to control the water flow. This will save tens of millions of residents in the Yangtze River basin from the incessant floods and famines of the past centuries. It will also utilize water power to generate electricity. At the same time, it is planned to build several other water dams and dig thousands of miles of canals for irrigation and other facilities. In the future, ocean-going ships will be able to sail directly to Chongqing. All planning will be supervised by American dam design expert, Savage. The development of this project will take 25 years and includes the world's largest hydropower plant project.

The signing of this contract is a major event in Chinese history. Although the Yangtze River is not necessarily "China's sorrow," the flooding of the river is sometimes enough to cause countless people to suffer. What is most regrettable is that such a large river, with such great water power, has not been utilized in the past, causing us to waste the special favor that nature has given us. Now that the United States has signed a contract with us to develop water conservancy, this will not only enable the Yangtze River basin to avoid droughts and floods, but also provide us with a large amount of cheap power, laying a solid foundation for our country's industrialization. At the same time, it will increase the throughput of Yangtze River shipping, allowing ocean-going ships to sail upstream to Sichuan, sweeping away the past lament of the so-called "difficulty of the Shu Road." Although the complete success of this project will require a relatively long period, once it is successful, the entire face of China will be completely changed. China will leap from the stage of handicraft industry to an electrified society. The signing of this contract is indeed a major event in the process of building a new China!

In the process of nation-building, the full utilization of water power is the most basic and most important thing. Before implementing the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union first paid attention to water power, building a huge dam on the Dnieper River. By using the water power of the Dnieper River, it generated a huge amount of power, and then was able to launch its industrial development plan. The manufacture of the atomic bomb relied on the so-called TVA's large amount of cheap electricity, transportation equipment, and industrial equipment. We are now embarking on the road of nation-building, and the core of future nation-building is industrialization, and industrialization requires power. Therefore, our first step is to utilize the water power of the Yangtze River, which can be said to have laid an excellent cornerstone for my country's industrialization and nation-building project.

Moreover, the utilization of the Yangtze River's water power is not limited to providing us with the power necessary for industrialization. Using water power to generate power is only one aspect of utilizing water power; its main purpose is how to control the natural water force to benefit mankind. From the very beginning, mankind knew how to use water to benefit mankind. People in the Neolithic Age knew the benefits of irrigating the Rong River. Li Bing of our Qin Dynasty used the water of the Min River in Sichuan to create agricultural benefits for the Chengdu Plain. Even today, the Dujiangyan irrigation system in Guanxian is still praised by the world. Even Savage, who plans to utilize the Yangtze River's water conservancy, greatly admires it. However, the modern use of water power is still a recent event. This is the great plan of the "Tennessee Valley Authority" (TVA) established by President Roosevelt when he implemented the New Deal. The Tennessee River Valley used to be the most barren area in the United States. Since the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority, with the utilization of the entire Tennessee River as the target, the barren land has been transformed into a prosperous one. Electrification has been realized, and agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, and social welfare have all been expanded, becoming a typical democratic experimental area, creating a new situation for the world.

Savage, who is planning to utilize the Yangtze River's water conservancy, was the designer of the water conservancy in the Nasco River. It is said that the full utilization of the Yangtze River will surpass the TVA in the future and become the only water conservancy area in the world. A few days ago, news from the United States said that the original plan would be scaled down. Whether the contract signed by the United States now is the original plan, the telegrams are vague, and we cannot know. But whether it is the original plan or the revised plan, the signing of this contract undoubtedly clearly indicates that our government is determined to utilize the water power of the Yangtze River. When implementing this plan, many fields and graves may have to be destroyed, which may encounter the resentment of the people, and even the obstruction of some powerful parties. But under the major premise of national welfare, we must all endure all minor sacrifices.

Here, we cannot help but have renewed feelings. After a long period of war, the country has decided to start anew with the people, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and start with the utilization of the Yangtze River's water conservancy. This shows the government's determination to build the country. However, there are those who destroy national interests, raise troops and cause chaos, and attempt to obstruct the great cause of nation-building. Our people will not allow the victory work of nation-building to be hindered again. In the utilization of the Yangtze River's water conservancy, we see the rebirth of the nation. We hope that this rebirth will become a reality, so that China can achieve the ideal state of strength, prosperity, and happiness.

### Incident at the United Nations Normal College: Hand Grenade Incident

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 2nd] According to reporters' inquiries, the hand grenade incident at the United Nations Normal College was caused by a fight between students of the United Nations University and a small number of cadets from the Second Military Officers Corps. The details are as follows: (1) A team of cadets from the Second Military Officers Corps went to Daguan Building to visit on the 30th in accordance with regulations. When passing by the United Nations University, some students in the school suddenly threw mud, tiles, and stones at the team, and shouted insults. The team initially avoided by leaning against the wall, but the stone throwing became more intense, so they fought back, and more than a dozen people on each side were injured. (2) The cadets who were insulted for no reason were filled with resentment. They submitted articles to various newspapers on the same day, but they were not published, which increased their anger. They gathered more than 30 people and went to the United Nations Normal College at about 11:00 am on the 1st to question the students of the college, resulting in a conflict. At that time, a jobless soldier, Chen Yunzeng, broke in, carrying several hand grenades. During the fight, he threw them at the college, injuring 13 people. Four of them were seriously injured and sent to Yunda Hospital for treatment, but later died. Other lightly injured students are being treated in the hospital. (3) A hand grenade throwing incident also occurred at the Liberal Arts College of the United Nations University at the same time, but no one was injured. It is now learned that the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters has arrested the perpetrator Chen Yunzeng and one suspect at the Liberal Arts College. They will be publicly tried and severely punished according to law tomorrow.

### Executive Yuan Routine Meeting to be Held in Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Regarding the matter of returning the capital, the highest authorities gave instructions last Monday that the Executive Yuan and its subordinate ministries and commissions could first send a part of their personnel to Nanjing to work. The date of the official return to the capital will be decided after the restoration work is completed. After the routine meeting last Tuesday, the Executive Yuan discussed specific measures based on this instruction and decided: (1) The Executive Yuan and its subordinate ministries and commissions will send a part of their personnel to Nanjing according to actual needs. The number of personnel in each ministry and commission will vary. The maximum number will be 150 for ministries such as Finance and Transportation, and the minimum number will be only 10 for commissions such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, for a total of 1,500 people. (2) All personnel must arrive in Nanjing before December 15th. (3) The routine meeting of the Executive Yuan will be moved to Nanjing. Chen Kewen, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, went to Beijing a few days ago to survey the buildings, furniture, and food and lodging problems of the various ministries and commissions. He has now returned. According to him, the addresses of the various ministries and commissions have been roughly decided. The Executive Yuan will temporarily use the old Ministry of Railways for office. Most of the ministries and commissions are located at their original sites. A small number of ministries and commissions and those established after the Anti-Japanese War will temporarily share offices with the Executive Yuan. Chen said that his impression of Nanjing is not desolate but quiet. Thanks to the efforts of the municipal authorities, the city appearance has been restored, and there are no security problems in the suburbs.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] According to the Executive Yuan, from the beginning of October to November 30th, a total of 784 personnel and 10 tons of public goods were transported by air under the control of the Executive Yuan. The important personnel for the reception in the Peiping-Tientsin area have been largely transported. Since December 1st, civil aviation has been opened. In the future, personnel going to Peiping should apply directly to the China National Aviation Corporation.

### Marshall Deploys Matters to Fly to Chongqing: Must Attend Congress Twice Before Departure; Hurley's Statement Still Under Investigation

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] General Marshall, the new U.S. Ambassador to China, is busy deploying matters for flying to Chongqing to assume his post. However, before departure, he must attend Congress twice this week: once to testify before the Pearl Harbor attack investigation committee, and once to explain his mission to Chongqing to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in advance. [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] According to the U.S. Information Service's Washington dispatch of the 1st, members of both houses of the U.S. Congress are still concerned about the points made by former Ambassador to China Hurley accusing State Department foreign service personnel. Congressman Rogers introduced a bill requesting Bernays to hand over all information about undermining U.S. policy toward China to Congress. Senator Willis gave a speech in the Senate criticizing U.S. policy toward the Far East, requesting the State Department to clarify it and to rectify its internal affairs.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Congressman Mundt, a member of the Committee on Un-American Activities, announced today that the committee will conduct a thorough investigation of the State Department after hearing Hurley's accusations. It is said that Hurley has made accusations against communists in the American diplomatic community. We will use this as a basis for investigation. We want to know who the communists Hurley is referring to are. How did they hinder U.S. foreign policy, and what methods did they use? We hope Hurley can answer. If Hurley's accusations are limited to the current people, then our investigation will be limited to these people. However, if other State Department personnel are included, the scope of the investigation will also be expanded. I personally believe that there are pro-communist elements among the lower-level personnel of the State Department who are hindering foreign policy. We have discovered that reports from overseas are deliberately altered and embellished by these communist believers before being submitted to senior State Department officials. I suspect that the reports made by Ambassador Hurley may have been altered by these people.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] A government spokesman believes that the Republican Party is using Ambassador to China Hurley's resignation to stir up a debate on foreign policy.

### The Three Major Economic Spheres Under Today's World Phenomena

Communism, which had a strong momentum before the war, is now inferior to socialism after the war

[Reuters, London, 3rd] According to an article by a special correspondent of the New York Times, the phenomenon of today's world, from an economic point of view, can be divided into three major parts: (1) Capitalism; (2) Semi-capitalism; (3) Communism, with the United States, Western Europe, and the Soviet Union as their respective centers. These three categories may soon be found to be inadequate, as China, India, and even South America may not fit into any of them. However, in the immediate future, this classification still seems appropriate, as these three different economic societies will seek ways to trade with each other and with the rest of the world. Great Britain is a non-capitalist society and is now evolving. The British Labour Party has not only never suggested nationalizing all industries, but also does not want to do so. It not only does not want to establish a totalitarian economic system, but also strongly opposes this ideal. Its purpose is only to fight against private monopolies and restrictions on production and employment. The reason for taking over several industries and controlling the monopoly habits of various industries still in private hands is nothing more than to achieve this goal. The British Labour Party's policy is not semi-communism, but a completely different democratic plan policy to achieve the goals of a democratic socialist party. The countries of Scandinavia are indeed the same. If Britain's experiment is successful, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy will follow in Britain's footsteps. If the aforementioned democratic socialist policies are successful, the countries of Western Europe will not attempt communist economic policies. If the three parties can approach the problems with good faith, the above three different systems can have good trade relations. There is only one thing that can force Western Europe to abandon the trial of democratic socialist plans and turn to communist policies in the near future, that is, the United States places various obstacles in the way of the former two policies, making them feel that only the latter policy is their only feasible way out. It must be known that Western Europe now wants to reverse its tide and return to controlled flame capitalism, which is impossible in the current situation.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] A New York Times reporter wrote that the development of socialism has obviously exceeded the expectations of prophets. A year or even half a year ago, political commentators believed that the moderate revolutionaries of Marxism would inevitably succumb to the radical communism backed by the Soviet Union. The lion once loved the sheep. If communism and socialism could form an alliance, the political control would inevitably fall into the hands of this powerful group. The dictatorship of the proletariat could then be established. Reactionary forces, privileged classes, and neo-fascism would inevitably bow their heads. However, the evolution of the matter has been unexpected. Communism has not only failed to form a united front with socialism, but has instead been in a state of civil war. Communism has not only failed to gradually strengthen and absorb socialism, but the public has instead tended towards socialism. France, Italy, the Netherlands, and even Germany, Austria, and the former satellite countries have all become the domain of socialists. The current government of Britain is also a socialist government. The social democratic parties and peasant parties in Central Europe may also belong to the socialist faction. Communism, before the war, had a strong momentum, but after the war, the lion was no match for the sheep.

Education and Sports

### A Portion of the Ministry of Education Staff Decides to Choose Nanjing to Work First.

Vice Minister Hang Liwu Will Go to Nanjing and Shanghai to Supervise the Restoration

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Since Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua returned from his inspection, he has been actively promoting the restoration of education in the recovered areas. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and a portion of the staff will first take a plane to Nanjing to work. Vice Minister Hang Liwu will soon go to the Nanjing and Shanghai areas to supervise the restoration of education in the recovered areas. As for the puppet teachers and staff, they must be strictly screened. Even those who were conscripted as a last resort must be strictly screened. Those who fail the screening will not be allowed to work in the education field in the future. Those who have participated in underground work and have conclusive evidence of anti-Japanese actions will not be subject to this restriction. Those few people who are temporarily conscripted as a last resort will not be hired for tutoring classes, so these personnel do not have the qualifications of tutoring class teachers and are not even teachers in any university. Even those puppet school teachers and staff who have passed the screening can only indicate that they have the qualifications to serve in the education field, and should not be considered as officially hired. Therefore, in the future, each university will not be subject to any restrictions regarding the hiring of professors.

### Our Country's Students Going to the United States are Stranded in New Delhi. Commissioner Xue is Negotiating with the U.S. Side.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 1st Dispatch] Thirteen women, two children, and fifty students from our country who were en route to the United States are now stranded here. The U.S. military has prohibited non-military passengers from boarding U.S. ships. This measure was implemented without prior knowledge by all parties. It is obviously due to complaints from U.S. soldiers, who believe that the delay in the return of the military is due to the Water Transport Bureau giving priority to non-military personnel. After contacting various groups, Xue Shouheng, the acting commissioner of China stationed in India, decided to consult with the U.S. commissioner stationed in India on the current situation on the 1st. This measure not only affects Chinese students, but also 150 Indians preparing to go to the United States to participate in the State Department's cultural program. In the future, the right of priority for boarding ships will be determined by the representative of the U.S. State Department here.

The Commissioner's Office confirmed the cancellation of the priority for non-military passengers to board U.S. ships and planes, and currently has no way to assist students stranded in Calcutta. It is reported that diplomatic and government personnel and their families are not subject to the ban. The provision that 300 non-military civilians from the China region and the India-Burma region could obtain fourth-class priority each month has been cancelled as a result. If this method also applies to the China region, then the only way for Chinese students stranded in India to be sent is to take a ship to Shanghai and then take a ship to the United States when commercial ships resume sailing.

### National Institute for Compilation and Translation

— Wu Hongzhi

The poet Bai Juyi once chanted in "The Song of Everlasting Regret", "The Shu River is blue, and the Shu Mountains are green." The Jialing River from early winter to late spring confirms the realism of this poem. That kind of blue and green is so lovely that it is hard to imagine and even harder to describe.

The National Institute for Compilation and Translation is located on the west bank of the Jialing River. This is a large-scale cultural and academic institution. It has been growing steadily during the arduous eight-year war of resistance." On the one hand, it pays tribute to many cultural and academic warriors who fought hard on the line of hunger and cold and firmly guarded their posts; on the other hand, it also shows that the country attaches importance to cultural and academic work during the war as it does in peacetime.

The institute is divided into six groups: Natural Science Group, Humanities Group, Textbook Group, Education Group, Social Science Group, and General Affairs Group, which is responsible for the administrative affairs of the entire institute; in addition, there are many committees, such as the Translation Committee, the University Textbook Committee, and the Place Name Unification Committee. A library with the richest collection of books in the rear is also part of it.

The staff, including clerks and stewards, consists of more than 180 people. Their work includes the compilation and review of national textbooks for primary and secondary schools from time to time; the unified Chinese and foreign terms for physics, chemistry, and other subjects that have been completed; the medical and pharmaceutical terms and geographical terms that are about to be completed; the secondary encyclopedic dictionaries that are urgently needed by young people; the educational encyclopedia that is being compiled; the twenty-four histories that are being sorted out; the world-famous works of philosophy, literature, history, etc. that are being translated; and the textbooks for various university subjects that are being written. All are written by experts, and there are also experts outside the institute who are specially commissioned to write them. In the future, when the country's material construction moves forward, cultural construction will also develop rapidly. When printing conditions improve, the achievements of the National Institute for Compilation and Translation will inevitably be recognized by people across the country, and the work will be even more arduous.

In a row of long black houses, under the windows sheltered by tall, verdant banana trees, next to each table are some cultural warriors buried in their work. Many people from allied countries, after appreciating the scenery of the Jialing River, came to visit (and of course, many came specifically to visit) and were amazed that China, during the arduous war of resistance, not only had young students chanting, but also had such a large-scale cultural and academic institution. It seemed to be a great surprise. And the enemy's bombing at that time only destroyed a few small houses, but it could not cause major damage to this spiritual fortress, but it was very heavy on the enemy's "striking the striker". Now that victory is coming, I wish the National Institute for Compilation and Translation a limitless future.

### Shanghai Factories and Mines Resumption Loan: Government Approves 30 Billion Yuan, Stipulating Raw Materials as Collateral

[Our Newspaper Exclusive Interview] Li Daonan, Manager of the Bank of Communications, told our newspaper reporter yesterday: The "Four Joint Offices" (Si Lian Chu) have allocated a loan of 30 billion yuan to aid the resumption of work for various factories and mines in Shanghai and assist the local factories' recovery. This sum is allocated by the Shanghai branch of the "Four Joint Offices" based on the "Implementation Measures for Shanghai Mining and Factory Resumption Loans" passed in Chongqing on the 29th of last month.

Shanghai Manufacturers' Loan Amounts

The Shanghai mining and factory loan applications that have been approved include: China Xing Coal Mine Company, 10 billion yuan; Shen Xin factories, 7 billion yuan; Wing On Textile Factory, 7 billion yuan; enemy-operated factories taken over by our side, 2.5 billion yuan; Jun Feng Textile Factory, 3 billion yuan; American-owned Shanghai Power Company, 5 billion yuan; American-owned Telephone Company, 200 million yuan; British-owned Water Company, 200 million yuan. In addition, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's loan application of 3 billion yuan has passed the review of the Shanghai branch and has been submitted to the Chongqing headquarters for approval.

Preventing Hoarding and Restricting Mortgages

According to Mr. Li, the sole objective of the "Four Joint Offices'" loan method is to enhance Shanghai's industrial production. Therefore, the loan terms are very strict. Factories intending to apply for resumption loans must first apply to the Shanghai branch of the "Four Joint Offices." The branch and the responsible authorities will conduct a joint review. Currently, textile factories and similar factories are reviewed by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, public utilities are reviewed by the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, and flour mills are reviewed by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food. After passing the review, the Shanghai branch of the "Four Joint Offices" will submit the application to the headquarters for approval. For factories borrowing smaller amounts, loans can be obtained from commercial banks, and the "Four Joint Offices'" branch can apply for rediscounting. Currently, to prevent hoarding, mining and factory applicants are only allowed to use raw materials as collateral and cannot use finished products. The annual interest rate on loans is 2% to 3.6%. According to Mr. Li, Shanghai factories urgently need assistance. Since the Shanghai branch of the "Four Joint Offices" started providing loans, the state of industry in Shanghai has shown improvement.

A small number of police officers temporarily dispatched by the police bureau maintained order at the wharf. The "Ming Yu Maru" was completely operated by Japanese personnel. Twenty-one American soldiers, led by Lieutenant Daves of the American side, were responsible for management. After the ship docked, Lieutenant Daves of the American side first disembarked, accompanied by personnel from a certain military agency of our side and a reporter from the Central News Agency, to board the ship. Ten minutes later, they escorted Li Lizhuang, the wife of the traitor Chen Gongbo, off the ship. She was taken to a certain location under military escort. Afterward, our overseas Chinese disembarked in order and boarded fifty trucks borrowed from the American side, heading to the original site of the Dakang Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, the Second Temporary Reception Center of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

Over two hundred overseas Chinese returning from the Philippines also arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon and are currently residing in the First Temporary Reception Center of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the Nanshi district.

### Over Two Thousand Japanese Nationals to Depart for Repatriation Today

The first group of 2,229 repatriated Japanese nationals gathered at Shanghai University in Yangshupu before 7:00 AM yesterday morning. Starting at 9:00 AM, customs officials, military police, and police officers jointly conducted inspections. Zou, the Deputy Director of the Japanese Nationals Management Office, also went to the office of the Japanese Nationals Autonomous Association in the assembly area to guide repatriation matters. This group of Japanese nationals is scheduled to walk to the Qujiang Wharf at 7:00 AM this morning to board the ship.

In principle, it is stipulated that the ship will leave the wharf immediately after the Japanese nationals have finished boarding. Furthermore, among the Japanese nationals repatriated this time, there are also 30 personnel from the Japanese Nationals Autonomous Association, led by Shiju (former supervisor of the "Central China Railway Company"). They are responsible for coordinating with their own government (Japan) after the first and subsequent groups of repatriated Japanese nationals disembark, and for arranging ship or train transfers for their return home.

### American Military Tribunal to Regularly Try Japanese War Criminals

[Our Newspaper Exclusive Interview] The American Military Tribunal plans to try 35 Japanese war criminals related to the killing of three American servicemen in Hankou, as well as other foreign war criminals, later this month. The criminals are currently imprisoned in the Ward Road Prison. Our newspaper reporter visited Colonel Yanc, a judge of the American Military Tribunal, yesterday and learned that among the 35 war criminals, 10 are officers below the rank of colonel, and the other 25 are soldiers. However, there are no prominent figures among them who need to be tried by the Tokyo International Military Tribunal. It is rumored that there are American citizens among the war criminals in prison. Colonel Yanc said that their exact nationality is under investigation. As for the court format to be adopted during the trial, it will be a "military court." It is currently determined that three American officers will be responsible, but in reality, five people will be designated to perform the duties of judges and jurors. Prosecutors and defense lawyers will also be American officers with special experience and qualifications. This type of trial format is the one used by the United States for the trial of war criminals in various places. The persons in charge of the court have not yet been designated and will be announced in two or three weeks.

In August of this year, it was ordered to the Pacific to join American ships in attacking Japan. The war ended as it sailed to Australia. It then went to Taiwan to transport prisoners of war back to England. This is its first visit to China, and it will regularly host reporters for visits.

### Inspecting Traffic Conditions

After inspecting the reception of ships and instructing on the expansion of shipping, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications flew to Qingdao yesterday morning to inspect traffic conditions. According to sources from the Ship Allocation Committee, the procedures for returning privately owned ships require first applying to the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau. After the bureau investigates and confirms that the ship did not collaborate with the enemy, it will then consider the overall shipping situation and notify the National Ship Allocation Committee to return the ship.

### Shanghai Nazi Party Members Enter Jiangwan Concentration Camp

Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao have gradually restored communications, and commercial telegrams have begun to be sent and received in Taipei.

### Chen Gongbo's Wife, Li Lizhuang, Escorted to Shanghai: Intended to Stay at the International Hotel but Ended Up in Detention

Li Lizhuang, the wife of the traitor Chen Gongbo, was escorted off the "Ming Yu Maru" yesterday morning at 9:10 AM when the ship docked at the Qujiang Wharf from the Huangpu River, accompanied by American and Chinese military police, carrying seven pieces of luggage of various sizes. She was transported here from Japan by the American side and handed over to our government for processing. Chen Gongbo's wife was unable to accompany him when he was escorted back to the country due to illness.

Fellow Traitors

Li Lizhuang was the only woman among the thousand-plus overseas Chinese aboard the "Ming Yu Maru" this time. When the ship arrived at the Qujiang Wharf, reporters boarded the ship to meet with the traitor Li. She was monitored by an American lieutenant and "escorted" by a Japanese baojia (local security official). Three other traitors were traveling with her, all ruthless thugs who caused trouble on the ship several times. The traitor Li was held in a small cabin measuring six feet square, with the door tightly closed. It was only after the American military police knocked urgently that it was opened.

Two Faces

She appeared to be in her forties, wearing rimless glasses and light makeup. She wore a dark purple silk cheongsam with a cream-colored coat, matching leather shoes and stockings with the color of the coat. Her hair was tied in a chignon. She smiled when she saw people, but appeared embarrassed when she saw a photographer taking pictures. It is said that she suffered from dental disease along the way that has not yet recovered, but her spirits are still good. She boarded the ship in Fukuoka, Japan, and received good treatment along the way, including various vaccinations. She wore an expensive jade bracelet on her right hand and had a copy of "Life" magazine on her bed.

Attempted Bribery

According to Lieutenant Daves, the American official in charge, she was very wealthy, repeatedly giving Luzon cigars to the escorts and bribing Daves with $65 USD three times, all of which were rejected. The reporter asked, "What are your thoughts on returning to Shanghai this time?" Li replied, "I have mixed feelings. Let's talk about the future later." When asked, "Have you heard anything about the domestic situation in recent months? Do you have any news about your husband?" She replied, "I have been living in Japan for several months and know nothing about the domestic situation." The American soldiers on the ship called her "Madam." She also told reporters that she intended to ask the authorities for permission to stay at the International Hotel temporarily. Before she could finish speaking, she was escorted off the ship by Daves, the American escort officer, and several of his subordinates, armed with rifles, and taken directly to a military detention facility, where she was handed over to our side for processing.

Recently, an Evaluation Committee will be established to determine the value. The committee will convene an evaluation meeting on the 6th of this month to auction them in batches based on price, so as to achieve production work as soon as possible and start the recovery process early.

### Military Police and Gendarmerie Cooperate to Strengthen Winter Security

The security situation during the winter security period in the city is causing concern due to the fact that order has not been fully restored after the war. Our Central News Agency reporter interviewed the military, police, and gendarmerie agencies responsible for maintaining the city's security. According to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, the headquarters has formulated concrete plans for winter security with the military, police, and gendarmerie, and has sufficient troops and police force to maintain security during the winter security period.

Increased Troops and Strengthened Security

In the urban area, the garrison headquarters has decided to increase the number of soldiers stationed at major transportation routes, starting immediately, to strengthen security forces. Secondly, the city will be divided into five districts, each with a patrol team organized by the military, police, and gendarmerie, working in shifts day and night to patrol the streets and public entertainment venues. As for security in the suburbs, it will be the responsibility of the military. The 88th Division and units of the 71st Army, which fought in Myanmar after defending Zhabei and Dachang for three months, have taken over the defense of the four suburbs of the city.

City Defense Committee Establishes Volunteer Corps

The reporter also visited the Volunteer Corps of the Shanghai City Defense Committee. The corps was established on the 16th of this month as a self-defense organization formed by local civilians, and will exert its self-defense power during the winter security period to assist the military, police, and gendarmerie in ensuring the city's security. According to General Corps Commander Rong Youlue, the corps has decided to divide the Shanghai urban area into eight districts: Pudong South District, and Pudong North District, and Wusong District, with a defense corps established in each district. The total number of people will be set at 10,000. Members will be divided into permanent members and volunteer members. Volunteer members will be merchants and civilians who automatically participate, and it is estimated that there will be 8,000 people in the city. Permanent members will be recruited by the corps, with a quota of 2,000 people.

### Investigating Enemy Atrocities, Settling Eight Years of Blood Debts

This is a blood debt! We should present it as accurately as possible to the enemy for settlement! Since the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office was ordered to investigate enemy atrocities on the 6th of last month, the number of people registering has increased day by day, especially yesterday, when it exceeded 140. They seemed to treat the clerk as they would their own parents, pouring out the grief and pain that had been buried in their hearts for so long.

From this, we can understand how the enemy practiced "friendship" during these eight years. Besides torture, slaughter, occupation, arson, and rape, nothing else can be found. Every word and every sentence on the registration form is blood! It's all tears!

Although the number of people is large, Clerk Yu Tao is very kind, patiently asking questions in detail, which is commendable. As of yesterday, the total number of registered cases was over 500, of which three-quarters belonged to villagers in the suburbs, and only a small part belonged to the urban area. Is it possible that only these people in the urban area were victimized and ravaged?

The registration deadline is set for the 6th of this month, but it may be extended for a few days depending on the situation. This is to give the victimized citizens ample opportunity. It is hoped that they will quickly present this blood debt. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities will submit the investigation to the government immediately after the investigation is completed, and go to the enemy for settlement, so that these miserable people who have nowhere to turn and no home to return to can get some comfort and a result as soon as possible. Only then can they receive the warmth of victory.

### Lessons for Warmongers! Japanese Nationals Quietly Return Home: Gathered Yesterday, Leaving Shanghai Today

(Our Newspaper Special Feature) The first batch of repatriated Japanese nationals gathered at Shanghai University yesterday to prepare to board the "Ming Yu Maru" to return to Japan. The reporter made a special trip to see what the mood was like for these people from the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" who are returning home this time.

Upon entering Shanghai University, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sorrow. Shanghai's top university had been occupied by the Japanese army for so many years, and it had been devastated. The once neat and tidy campus with lush flowers and trees had become a wasteland. On the large lawn in front of the former girls' dormitory, rows of Japanese men, women, and children were sorting out their luggage, preparing to have their belongings inspected by customs, military, and police personnel.

The general order was very good. Although the Japanese people here did not have the arrogant attitude of the past, they were not crying. After all, they had lost the war, and most of their families were broken. However, returning home is still returning home. Most Japanese people were in different moods, and returning to their hometown was still a last resort.

A total of 2,185 Japanese nationals gathered at Shanghai University yesterday. Among them were babies held in their arms, old women who could hardly walk, and strong, able-bodied Japanese merchants who had once been all-powerful in Shanghai. Major General Xie Xiaoling, Commander of the Shanghai Port Transportation Command, personally came to direct the operation, along with other senior officers from the Third Front Army. The police bureau and customs also sent people to assist, so the order was well maintained, and the inspection procedures were very swift. Although the inspectors were very strict in performing their duties, their attitude was very kind. This couldn't help but make me wonder what the situation would be like if Chinese expatriates were returning home and the Japanese military police were carrying out the inspection?

The Japanese nationals being repatriated this time were selected according to the selection method set by the Japanese Nationals Management Office of the Third Front Army. The same qualifications were: (1) Single men and women who cannot support themselves, (2) Undesirable elements, (3) Those who have a legitimate reason to apply for early repatriation and have been approved. Japanese military personnel and those politically connected are generally not allowed to return to their country. This is to prevent guilty parties from escaping before war criminals have been investigated.

Each returning Japanese national is allowed to carry 30 kilograms of luggage and 1,000 Japanese yen or national currency. Other items such as cameras, gold and silver ornaments, books and stationery are prohibited. Each person is also allowed to bring three sets of new clothes and three pairs of new shoes. If there is extra space in the luggage, they can bring other clothes and food. Yesterday, the Japanese nationals gathered at Shanghai University brought pots and vegetables to cook on the lawn, while others brought bread and canned food and sat on the grass, munching away. On the surface, these Japanese people looked no different from those who used to picnic in Zhao Feng Park and Hongkou Park. However, the wind by the river was so biting, and there was no laughter or singing here. This was not a picnic; it was a final silent meal on a wasteland before people who couldn't go home left China.

Most of the Japanese people were dressed very well. Colonel Wu Zongcheng of the Third Front Army accompanied me to the end of the lawn and talked to a Japanese man in a suit for a few words. I asked him, "Do you want to go back?" He replied in English, "What's the alternative? There is nothing to do and no money to spend. How can I survive in Shanghai?" I asked him again, "Where is your home?" He said, "My home is in Hiroshima." His eyes were red, and he couldn't go on. I was embarrassed to ask any further. After a while, he said automatically, "My mother and family are all in Hiroshima. I don't know how they are. I heard that an atomic bomb completely destroyed Hiroshima? ... I don't know how my mother and family are." When I went over, I was full of questions about the war and the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." After asking a few questions, when he talked about Hiroshima and the atomic bomb, I saw that he probably wouldn't be interested in the war anymore. "Why should I ask this 'bereaved dog' questions that he can't answer at this time?"

However, the Japanese people in Shanghai have been "darlings of fortune" for so many years and have never suffered much. The people on the lawn at Shanghai University were not emaciated or poorly dressed. Today, they will take the "Ming Yu Maru" back to a Hiroshima that has been bombed flat, and to a Tokyo that has been destroyed. They must also see what war is, and they must experience the bitter fruit of warmongering. As twilight enveloped the campus of Shanghai University, as my car drove out of the school gate, I couldn't help but wonder what these people who had once been "masters" of Shanghai were really thinking this time as they went back like this.

### Mayor Qian Presides Over Expanded Memorial Week

The Municipal Government held an expanded memorial week yesterday at 9:00 AM. Mayor Qian introduced Deputy Mayor He Dekui to all members of the Municipal Government. Subsequently, Deputy Mayor He gave a brief speech, saying, "I am honored to assume my post, but I am ashamed of my lack of talent and deeply inadequate. From now on, I will work closely with all colleagues in the government, as intimate as family members, and under the leadership of the Mayor, strive to promote all municipal facilities." Mayor Qian then reviewed the Municipal Government's organization and encouraged all staff to remain as vigilant as during wartime while the rehabilitation work is not yet completed, focus their efforts, work diligently, be loyal to their duties in their respective positions, and immerse themselves in hard work.

### Preparatory Office of China Aquatic Products Company Established

The company will manage all enemy and puppet aquatic product organizations received in Shanghai, except for fish markets, etc. A preparatory committee was first established, with Qian Xinzhi as Chairman, Du Yuesheng as Vice Chairman, and Tang Chengzong, Feng Limin, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhihua, Zhang Daohong, Chen Tingxu, Dong Keren, and Qu Junyuan as members. A preparatory office was also established, with Feng Limin as Director and Qu Junyuan as Deputy Director, to carry out the actual preparatory work and commence business operations.

Recently, Dai and others telegraphed Shanghai, stating that President Song has personally agreed to provide relief to the factories and has finalized various relief measures. Therefore, the three major well-known tobacco factories in this city are preparing to resume production. The delegation is expected to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow.

### British Giant Airliner on Round-the-World Flight Arrives in Shanghai

[British News Agency] The VM701 Lancastrian airliner, converted from a Lancaster bomber, is currently on a round-the-world flight and has now arrived in Shanghai.

The aircraft took off from the UK, passing through Malta, Cairo, Karachi, Delhi, Colombo, Yangon, Kunming, and Chongqing before reaching Shanghai.

The aircraft will soon depart for Japan, and then cross the Pacific Ocean from Japan, hoping to complete the 2,200-mile flight from Hawaii to the US West Coast in ten hours. Although the aircraft's range has not been publicly announced, it is believed to be at least 3,600 miles, with surplus fuel available. When flying from Cairo to Karachi, it encountered headwinds of 40 miles per hour, but only took ten hours.

The Lancastrian airliner is equipped with four of the latest Merlin 24 engines, the same engines as the P-51 fighter. The Lancaster bomber was able to carry the world's largest bomb during the war, weighing ten tons, its capacity can be imagined.

Details regarding the conversion of the Lancaster to civilian use began in 1943. The aircraft's design is completely new, but the parts are the same as the original bomber. Only the fuselage has been changed to a streamlined shape, and the armament has been removed. The aircraft has a net weight of 70,000 pounds and a speed of 240 miles per hour. The top speed of this flight has not been announced. Its carrying capacity is 34,000 pounds, with a crew of five pilots, a manager, and a technician.

If used for transport, the aircraft can carry 48 passengers. Currently, the aircraft can carry nine passengers during the day and sleep six at night. The aircraft has a kitchen and all the amenities for passengers.

Before February, the first Lancastrian airliner test-flew to Latin America. Currently, British Overseas Airways Corporation is planning to mass-produce this type of aircraft for civil aviation. The original Lancaster was most suitable for combat, having sunk the German battleship Tirpitz and destroyed the Eder Dam. Before March, an unarmed version of the aircraft took off from Canada, making a non-stop flight across the North Pole to Shropshire, a distance of 4,000 miles. This flight also had a significant impact on the promotion of airliners.

Among the passengers on board is Air Commodore Flintham, a senior official of the British Air Transport Command. He commanded the British Transport Auxiliary, responsible for transporting the 6th British Airborne Division to Normandy, and later participated in the Battle of Anzio and the Rhine crossing.

Also on board are Commander Brayworth, Commander Inter, Miss Liddell of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, and Colonel Li Guopei, the Chinese liaison officer of the British Air Transport Command.

The captain of the aircraft is Captain Payne, the pilot is Mr. Newitt, and the co-pilot is Lieutenant Heath.

### Fourteen Years of Travel: Dong Shuhua Arrives in Shanghai

Dong Shuhua, a young man from Guangdong, has been traveling for fourteen years. During the War of Resistance, he reported the country's self-defense war and reconstruction needs to overseas Chinese, passing through Vietnam, Siam, and Malaya. In 1939, he recruited overseas youth in Singapore and formed the "China Walking Corps Nanyang Team Wartime Work Group" to return to the country, serving in the war zone and the rear. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, in order to realize the "China Opera Troupe" traveling the world plan, he decided to complete the unfinished domestic journey of the troupe alone in the shortest time. He has flown from Chongqing to Beijing and arrived in Shanghai yesterday, planning a route to Tianjin and the Northeast, Korea, and then south through Taiwan, Hong Kong, Saigon, and Yangon to reach India. He will also film the general trends along the way, to prepare for returning overseas and reporting to overseas compatriots who miss the motherland.

### Social Services: Questioning Housing Rental Management Rules

— Shang Zi

The Shanghai Housing Rental Management Rules and Housing Rent Standards were announced on November 25th. In the future, housing rental disputes in this city can be reasonably resolved. However, it is unknown whether the rules include the countless existing rental disputes between second landlords and third tenants in this city. There are two points that the public wants to question:

First, does the rule include the relationship between second landlords and third tenants? Second, the discussion on the application of the above relationship to the rules is as follows:

First, Article 2: Those who do not register with the committee have no right to enjoy the rules. Does this affect the rights and obligations of the lease relationship under the Civil Code?

First, Article 11: The lessor shall not terminate the lease unless one of the following circumstances exists. Item 5: If the lessee sub-leases the house solely for improvement and the rent charged exceeds 30% of the original rent. What kind of degree does the so-called "improvement" refer to? Subdivision of housing and construction of attics are already commonplace, and there are even more improvements for sub-leased commercial housing. Item 6: Recovery for self-use, as certified by the committee. If there is indeed such a fact, does the second landlord have the right to recover the building for self-use (there is no such provision in the Civil Code, the second landlord's recovery is nothing more than to increase use, is there a suspicion of infringing on the lives of others, which is worth studying), and the status of the third tenant and the second landlord are both lessees, at a time when there are few houses and many people, and the small-scale has not been completely eliminated, it is doubtful whether it is suitable for the actual situation.

First, Article 11, Item 5 stipulates that it shall not exceed 30% of the original rent. Is this the legal profit of the second landlord, or is there no restriction?

(Note) The above points are indeed closely related to the majority of people. Please send a letter from the Housing Rental Management Committee to explain.

### Letter to the Editor: How to Exchange Damaged Currency

To the Editor: Our factory specializes in wholesale and frequent transactions. Customers sometimes pay for goods with damaged and torn Legal Tender Currency, or Guan Jin 法幣, stained with oil. It is difficult to refuse. After accepting them reluctantly, after a long period of time, the amount is not small. Payment to banks and dealers is generally refused. It is obviously difficult to get this kind of currency flowing. Storing it only causes losses. The pain is not unique to our factory. I don't know if it is possible to request the exchange of new notes to facilitate circulation. For this reason, I hereby send this letter requesting detailed instructions and disclosure in the newspaper so that the public can be informed. We would be deeply grateful.

A Brief Chat

### Narrow Escape in a Car

— Huang Jiayin

Many friends ask if it is really dangerous and difficult to go to the mainland. This is a long story, and at the same time, it cannot be generalized. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you can pass safely. If you are unlucky, it is hard to say.

I took my wife and children from Shanghai to Chongqing and it took a total of thirty-three days. I didn't encounter any accidents, which is very fortunate and went very smoothly. But looking back, there was danger.

On the train from Shanghai to Nanjing, a young man in a suit started chatting with me. He asked me where I was going. I deliberately lied and said I was going to Tianjin. Unexpectedly, he suddenly asked, "How much is a train ticket from Shanghai to Tianjin?" This question stumped me. I was going from Shanghai to Bengbu, how could I know the fare to Tianjin? Therefore, I had to change my tone and said that I would go to Bengbu first to find a relative, and then transfer to Tianjin. Therefore, I don't know how much the fare is from Shanghai to Tianjin. I suspected that this young man was a spy sent by the enemy and puppet forces, who specialized in investigating the identity and whereabouts of passengers on the train, so I quickly tried to avoid him and stopped talking to him.

I know that a woman in her fifties was detained by the Japanese military police for three or four hours because she had a piece of paper on her that wrote the route from Shanghai to Chongqing. Fortunately, we didn't encounter this kind of thing.

### Miracle Drug for Tuberculosis: Salozide

— Kuang Xuebo

Since the news of the American invention of the special drug "Salozide" for tuberculosis was published in the newspaper, tuberculosis patients in general have felt extremely excited, just like a group of convicts who have been sentenced to death suddenly receiving the news of a general amnesty; some patients have even temporarily shelved their planned treatments. Many neurotic patients have even suddenly stopped their reasonable treatments that were in progress, and stretched their necks to wait for the miracle drug "Salozide" to descend.

However, here is a piece of disappointing news for many patients: I have a classmate who just returned from the United States. He was selected by the government last year to study medicine abroad, so he is quite familiar with the medical and pharmaceutical situation in the United States. According to him, the ability of "Salozide" to eliminate tuberculosis bacteria in test tubes is indeed amazing. The results of animal experiments are also very satisfactory. However, when it was tested on the human body, because the drug was too toxic to the human body, it had adverse effects. Medical scientists are now trying their best to reduce the toxicity. The hope of success is probably very high, but the time of success cannot be determined for the time being. In any case, it will not be realized in the short term. In fact, not to mention that "Salozide" has not yet been successful, even after it is successful, other reasonable treatments must not be discarded immediately. Because once an organ is damaged, no matter what kind of miracle drug can repair it. To put it bluntly, everyone knows that Neo-Salvarsan is a miracle drug for syphilis, but if a person with syphilis has an open window, Neo-Salvarsan will never be able to restore the missing nose. Furthermore, taking tuberculosis as an example, if there is already a cavity in the lung, even if "Salozide" can immediately eliminate tuberculosis bacteria, it will still not help this cavity. In order for the lung to shrink, it must still rely on the compression therapy that is currently popular, such as artificial pneumothorax. Therefore, if you are dazzled by the excessive light from a considerable distance away, and then stop reasonable treatment casually, this may worsen the disease and leave endless regrets in the future, which is really a big mistake. Although this passage temporarily disappoints many poor tuberculosis patients, I believe it will help their diseases to some extent.

### Talking About Books (2)

Ernie Pyle's Books

After a fierce battle, a British officer was invited to visit the American battlefield; at this time, the bodies of the dead had not yet been completely taken away. He saw the dead still tightly clutching the rifle in their hands, and couldn't help but sigh, "Warriors! Warriors!"

"Warriors" became the title of Ernie Pyle's second book about war reports; the first book was called "This Is Your War." These two are the most famous reportage literature published in the United States during this war, and almost every family has a copy, and everyone has read an article. Now, for the sake of portability, these two books have been abridged a little and combined into one, named "G.I. Joe."

Ernie Pyle was a war correspondent who specialized in reporting the lives of soldiers, with a thin figure and a bald head. He lived with the soldiers and faithfully recorded their words; due to his keen observation and natural and fluent writing, he quickly became a household name in the United States. In April of this year, he was killed by a Japanese sneak attack while observing the battle on Ie Shima near Okinawa. At that time, American newspapers mentioned him alongside President Roosevelt, calling them "two great figures who died in one month." His books are still worth reading even after the war.

### Reconstruction is Not Easy Meng Gu

— Meng Gu

China's educational reconstruction is a complex and difficult task. Recently, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua talked about the seriousness of China's educational problems, citing an example. He said that there are a total of 660,000 primary school teachers in the country, of whom only more than 6,000 are formally graduated from normal schools. Only a quarter of them are qualified by teacher certification. That is to say, three-quarters of the primary school teachers in China are undesirable.

He also mentioned the problem of the relocation and reconstruction of universities in the mainland. He said that the original school buildings of Wuhan University are no longer enough. Supplementing and renovating them would require 140 million yuan of national currency, and building school buildings for Zhejiang University would require 130 million yuan. Renovating the Central Research Institute opposite Zhaofeng Park in Shanghai would also require 100 million yuan.

We feel that if the officials in power can publicly disclose their actual difficulties to the public, they will surely receive greater understanding and support from all parties, and will be able to promote government affairs and achieve many benefits.

Short Masterpiece

### The Enemy (12)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

The cook and gardener had both worked for Sadao's father since he was a little boy, and Yumi cried for the children. She was very distressed, and after leaving, she ran back to Hana. "If the children really need me tonight, you can come and call me. I am going back to my own home, you know where it is."

Hana smiled and said, "Thank you," but she said in her heart that no matter how much the children cried, she would not call her.

She made breakfast, and Sadao helped take care of the children. The two of them never mentioned the matter of the servants leaving, except to say that they had left. But after Hana took the breakfast to the prisoner, she walked to Sadao.

She asked, "Why can't we see clearly what we should do? Even the servants can see more clearly than us. Why are we different from other Japanese?"

Sadao did not answer. But after a while, he went into the room where the prisoner was, and said rudely, "You can get up and walk around today. I want you to get up for only five minutes at a time. Tomorrow you can get up for ten minutes. You must try to recover your strength as quickly as possible."

He saw the horror flashing in the young face that was still very pale. The boy said softly, "Yes." He obviously wanted to say more. "Doctor, I feel I should thank you for saving my life."

Sadao said coldly, "Don't thank me too soon." He saw the horror flashing in the boy's eyes again—as obvious as the horror of a beast. The scars on his neck turned blood red for a moment. These scars! What were they? Sadao did not ask.

In the afternoon, a second thing happened. Hana was doing the unfamiliar work, and she was working very hard. When she saw a uniformed messenger coming, her hands went weak and she had difficulty breathing. The servants must have already reported it. She ran to Sadao, gasping and unable to say a word. But at this time, the messenger only followed her through the garden and stood there. Helplessly, she pointed at him, saying nothing.

Sadao was reading a book and looked up. He was in his office, and part of the office faced the garden, which could get the southern sunlight.

Scientists have statistically concluded that children grow faster in height in summer and faster in weight in winter, and bones grow faster in summer.

Medical scientists have recently discovered that men sometimes experience physiological changes similar to menstruation. It is said that taking male hormones can cure this condition.

Medical scientists studying blood have found that in a group of people with mental disabilities and intellectual weakness, one-sixth to one-quarter of them are due to the mother lacking Rh factor, while her fetus has this factor, resulting in an incompatible reaction between the two bloods.

Psychiatrists treating criminals suffering from depression have recently used a combination of hypnosis and psychoanalysis and have achieved great results. Ordinary psychoanalysis alone is not easy to achieve success, because it is not easy to get the cooperation of criminals suffering from this type of disease. The 1943 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Dr. Dam and Dr. Doisy for their discovery of Vitamin K and their invention of chemically synthesizing Vitamin K. The 1944 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Dr. Alan Gills and Dr. Gasser in memory of their significant contributions to the study of nerves.

Business News

### Speculation in Exchange Rates Leads to Simultaneous Fall in Gold Notes and Securities

Yesterday, due to reports of the US dollar being unfrozen, the efforts to manipulate the market became even more energetic. At the same time, rumors spread that the official exchange rate for the US dollar would be set below 1,000 yuan and that the official gold price in the wartime capital [Chongqing] would soon be abolished. As a result, the market was exhausted and unable to rally, with the bullish side completely defeated. The outlook was even more timid. From the initial 780,000+ in the morning, the market trended downward. The midday price closed at 854,000. In the afternoon, the situation deteriorated, and the price continued to fall in line with the US dollar. In the end, it retreated to below 730,000, resulting in a drastic drop of 47,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold ornaments at silver shops continued to be quoted low at 78,000, while silver taels were at 650, leading to silver dollars remaining unchanged at around 460. The unofficial discount rate edged down from 1.5 to 1 jiao.

US Dollar: Initially, due to reports of the US dollar freeze being lifted, the market opened weak, with widespread selling. It immediately broke the 1,300 mark and continued to fall. Around noon, it hovered around 1,260 yuan. However, unfavorable rumors continued to circulate, claiming the official exchange rate for the US dollar would be set at 1,050 yuan, and eventually there were claims of a rate below 1,000 yuan. Buyers disappeared, and the final buying price retreated to below 1,200 yuan, resulting in a drastic drop of over 90 yuan compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar also weakened accordingly, resulting in a drop of 15 yuan. New issues fell 4 yuan.

Government Bonds: Yesterday, due to a lack of support and an oversupply, the market was relatively stable, but ultimately fell again by around 30 yuan.

Chinese Stocks: Many institutional investors sold off, and retail investors also stood by and watched. Trading was light, so popular stocks underperformed less popular ones. As a result, cotton yarn shares fell 25 yuan, American Asiatic Company shares fell 50 yuan, and various small stocks fell 2 to 4.5 yuan.

Foreign Stocks: Initially, the market was relatively stable. However, due to the decline in the gold and dollar markets, it eventually succumbed and fell by 0.5 to 10%.

Rice and Grain: Yesterday, the rice market saw a slight rebound in domestically produced rice, while imported rice orders were in storage. Therefore, confidence was low, and prices fell. High-quality rice plummeted 600-700 yuan, while medium and lower-quality rice fell by a staggering 1,000 yuan. Flour sales were sluggish, with supply exceeding demand, and prices fell by 200-300 yuan. There were still occasional inquiries. Oil prices remained stable due to the supply from Qingdao. Store sales were sluggish, and prices continued to fall by over 1,000 yuan. Transactions were very rare. High-quality soybeans were unsalable, with a slight rebound of 600-700 yuan. Medium and lower-quality oil mills were active but not thriving, with prices falling by 100-200 yuan. The liquor market was sluggish and lacked vitality, entering a state of decline.

Yarn Market: Both buyers and sellers were waiting and seeing, resulting in few transactions. Prices were similar to the previous weekend, and sentiment was calm. Currently, the price of 20-count ordinary yarn is hovering between 510,000 and 580,000. Selling pressure from factories emerges at higher prices. Conversely, a demand of customer emerged when prices fall to around 510,000, this has been the general trend in the yarn market in recent months.

Coal Market: The market was exhausted and unable to rally. It is widely rumored that the industry association's previous application to the fuel management authority for the allocation of low-priced household white coal was rejected. However, the industry association has reapplied and is expected to be approved. As a result, buyers are hesitant, and confidence is weakening. Holders, due to financial constraints, can only sell at discounted prices. Therefore, the prices of all grades of white coal have fallen again. There were slight inquiries about superior anthracite coal dust, but the market trend was also weak.
