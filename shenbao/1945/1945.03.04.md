It was first considered that a specific aircraft factory needed to be managed by the Ministry of Munitions. At the cabinet meeting on the 2nd, the "Emergency Measures Outline for Maintaining Aircraft Factories under Enemy Air Raids" was presented.

Weekly Review

### My Views on the Issue of Evacuating Schools

— Dai Yingfu

I believe that the significance of evacuating schools is active, and it should not be regarded as purely passive and cowardly behavior of seeking refuge. Of course, in order to protect the younger generation and preserve some of the vitality of the nation, it is necessary to avoid becoming victims of enemy air raids as much as possible. But I believe that in addition to this, there are more active educational reasons.

Shanghai is not the best place to study in the ideal sense. Educators have this view. However, there are especially many schools in Shanghai. Due to the sins of the past concessions and the dominance of commercial capital, education in Shanghai has been subjected to various temptations and influences. Inevitably, a part of it has been distorted. This is undeniable. Therefore, we should seek the reform of Shanghai education while actively maintaining it. It is not only for one place, but we should start from the big picture, the small picture, and the nearby picture, because the success or failure of Shanghai education is enough to affect the future of the entire education system.

Therefore, the issue of evacuating schools should be regarded as a kind of reform in Shanghai education, and the emphasis should be placed on its active significance.

If we plan to go to a suitable evacuation location and create a new educational environment, we can truly run the ideal education – an education that is suitable for the Chinese tradition. Here, there are bamboo fences and thatched houses that can be our classrooms and dormitories. There are fields and land that can be used for farming and self-sufficiency. Small industries can be established to manufacture daily necessities. Hospitals can be established to ensure hygiene and the treatment of diseases. There are many expert professors and many excellent young people who study agriculture, engineering, or medicine. They study, practice, labor, and produce at the same time, living a common life, shouldering a common mission, and cultivating Chinese youth who can truly shoulder the responsibility of reviving China and defending East Asia. Of course, the following points must be accomplished first:

(1) Teachers and students must have this understanding and determination;

(2) The immediate family members of teachers should evacuate with them;

(3) The government should allocate a large amount of funds to handle this matter.

Based on the above opinions, we should first evacuate colleges of science and engineering, medical colleges, and agricultural colleges. National universities that belong to this category should be evacuated first. For private colleges and universities, we should first establish a joint university at the evacuation location, and have a part of the staff and students go there, and move all important equipment there. The Shanghai main campus should be temporarily maintained, and if necessary, it should be moved completely. Liberal arts colleges, business colleges, senior high schools in ordinary middle schools, teacher training schools, and senior vocational schools should also be prepared in advance and evacuated gradually. As for the measures for primary and secondary school students to evacuate with their families and return to their hometowns, I have already mentioned this to the reporter of the Pingbao News Agency, so I will not repeat it here.

In this new educational environment, all educational facilities can be rebuilt, and the shortcomings of the past will naturally be eliminated. Destruction is construction. I can assert that new educational achievements will be obtained in the evacuation of schools.

Capital Communications

### New Year Vignettes in the Capital

— Renping

In the capital, the annual Spring Festival is extraordinarily decorated with an atmosphere of peace and prosperity, as if the smell of gunpowder has been completely forgotten.

Qinhuai Lantern Market

The crowds on the banks of the Qinhuai River become more crowded day by day as the Spring Festival approaches. This liveliness is even greater than in previous years. Who says that wartime material resources are difficult and life is expensive? They are still spending and still enjoying themselves. Colorful lanterns, as in previous years, are towering into the clouds, lined up neatly in front of the Confucian Temple, hanging in strings and competing for beauty! In this era of rising prices, lanterns have also risen in price in general, calling for hundreds to thousands of yuan per lantern, but they can still find their patrons. The Chinese are the most fond of liveliness, especially on the banks of the Qinhuai River, a land of Six Dynasties smoke and water.

Bits and Pieces of the Festive Scene

The area around the Confucius Temple is the center of the capital's popular revelry. There are cinemas, Peking opera houses, and spoken drama. What is special is that the Qing singing (a form of Chinese folk song performance) can be said to be full of seats day and night during these few days. Among them, the cinemas are of course the best in business, because they are cheap and good. What is different here from other places is the special preferential treatment for soldiers. They can buy a soldier's ticket for only one-fifth of the price for ordinary people, but there are no people entering the venue without buying a ticket.

In addition to normal entertainment, there is of course the same improper entertainment, which should actually be ordinary entertainment, but taking advantage of the opportunity of the Spring Festival, every family, big and small, is filled with the sound of gambling. Although there is no large-scale gambling, it is still breathless. The daily necessities of life, such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, are so expensive. The minimum monthly expenditure for a low-level family is tens of thousands of yuan. Even a rickshaw puller has to earn two thousand yuan a day to make a living. Of course, the life of civil servants, although their salaries have been raised again and again, is still among the lowest-level consumers.

In order to take into account the people's livelihood and improve the people's livelihood, the authorities have formed a "Capital Commodity Price Stabilization Committee," but the scene of winning or losing millions, which is not less than that, exists in this bright city in a distorted way, and is at ease outside the authorities' strict ban on gambling.

Speaking of Prices

Although it is not uncommon to throw away 100,000 yuan today, it is still limited to special classes. The life of ordinary people is still threatened by commodity prices. The strict management of commodity prices and the implementation of price limits on eight daily necessities, such as firewood and rice, are especially effective and have achieved considerable results by the end of the lunar year. The extortion of military police at various city gates and station docks has also been thoroughly eliminated. The violators are punished with the death penalty, and there have been two cases of shooting in Yuhuatai. Because starting in February, the authorities have allocated special funds to all military police in the city, and each person's immediate family member is given a living allowance of 10,000 yuan for every two people. The subsidy will also be increased if there are more people in the family, and it will be increased at any time if commodity prices rise in the future.

The implementation of this method has given the citizens of the capital great expectations, but with various industries in a semi-rest state during the New Year, price fluctuations seem to be secretly active again. Although the authorities have announced that the price of rice should not exceed 20,000 yuan, the capital, which has always been full of black market rice, has also disappeared. At the same time, the price of cooking oil has soared from more than 400 yuan a scoop to more than 800 yuan a catty, which is said to be due to insufficient supply. The high price of vegetables is also frightening, often costing hundreds of yuan a catty, and firewood is also not easy to buy.

Recently, because the gold shops opened on the first day of the market, gold was listed at 300,000 yuan per tael, so various industries have taken the opportunity to raise prices. The number of stores with big sales in the city is no less than a thousand, but in the end it is just a facade.

Stabilizing the people's livelihood has been listed as one of the important policies of the authorities and has the greatest determination, and the capital is a touchstone, and the people are waiting to see!

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Mr. Kobayashi Tsubasa, President of the Political Association, in order to dedicate himself to organizing a large political association and realize its constitution, issued a statement advocating the establishment of a national political system of certain victory. In addition to clarifying the important mission to China and foreign countries, he also issued a notification to about 3,000 people, including members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, influential people in the private sector, leading figures in the central and local governments, and those related to the Wing Support Association, requesting cooperation from all sectors.

### Ministry of Health Adjusts Air Raid Relief Situation

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Due to recent frequent enemy air raids in various locations, causing casualties among innocent civilians, the Ministry of Health is concerned about the preparedness for air raid relief in different areas and the adequacy of medical supplies, as these are directly related to the lives of the people. To understand the air raid relief situation in various provinces and cities and the necessary medical supplies for air raid relief, in order to facilitate overall planning and distribution, a special Air Raid Relief Survey Form has been created. This form has been sent to various provincial and municipal governments, requesting them to provide detailed information on the deployment of air raid relief personnel, the number of personnel, the equipment of relief locations, the practice of air raid relief work, the regular storage and quantity of relief medicines and materials, and the preparation and quantity of relief equipment.

### Tianjin Enthusiastically Donates Airplanes

Tianjin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The airplane donation campaign involving 800,000 Chinese and Japanese residents of Tianjin is becoming increasingly enthusiastic with the progress of the war. Since the initial donation of four million yuan by 7,000 Japanese residents, various sectors of the city have responded enthusiastically. Subsequent donations include 2.3 million yuan from the Tianjin branch of the North China Fiber Association, 1.87 million yuan from Tianjin citizens, 1 million yuan from rice companies, 800,000 yuan from the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, and 400,000 yuan from the Tianjin Alkali Joint Sales Co., Ltd. By the end of February, the total number of donated airplanes had reached 738.

### US Production Board Official Talks About Japan's Strong Potential

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a New York dispatch, Mr. Batt, Director of Raw Materials and Resources of the US War Production Board, stated in a speech on the 1st regarding the future of the US-Japan war that although the US has massive production capabilities, the future of the war against Japan is still very difficult. There are three reasons for this: First, the existing Japanese army is comparable to the German army during its peak period. Second, a new and sharp army is stationed in North Manchuria. Third, the Japanese army still possesses considerable potential.

### France and Italy Restore Diplomatic Relations

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: According to news from Paris, France and Italy have restored diplomatic relations, and an agreement has been signed. Count Sforza has been appointed as the first Italian ambassador to France.

### Center of Eastern Front Battles Still on Northern Flank

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: The focus of the Eastern Front battles remains in Pomerania and East/West Prussia within the past 24 hours. Enemy forces attacking various strongholds are constantly receiving reinforcements of infantry and tanks. The major battle in East Prussia continues fiercely, but the focus has shifted from the vicinity of Grudzborg to the southwest of the Neistan-Mörsach line, with the aim of advancing towards the highway connecting Königsberg to Elbing. The Soviet attempt to sweep through the German front line along the Vistula River from Tucheler Heide in West Prussia has failed. The main Soviet pressure is now in East Pomerania, with vanguard troops advancing north to the Schlawe-Köslin highway, ten kilometers south of the coast. The situation is unchanged on the line from Schwetz to Lauban, with Lauban now serving as an important pillar at the southern corner of the front.

### German Official Comments on Roosevelt's Declaration: Determined to Fight for Survival

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the main purpose of Roosevelt's declaration is to make the American people believe in the decisions of the Yalta Conference, but the results of this meeting have not yet been determined. Germany will resolutely fight to the end against the American plan. If the anti-Axis powers remove Germany's machinery and vehicles, the German people will have no way to survive. Therefore, implementing Roosevelt's plan is tantamount to starving the German people to death.

### Turkey Still Under Threat from Germany

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the Turkish Embassy in Chongqing announced on the 21st that if the anti-Axis powers attempt to shorten transportation lines, the Turkish government can send troops to East Asia. The power of the German army in the Balkan Peninsula still directly threatens Turkey's security. Therefore, the significance of this declaration of war is more profound for Germany than for Japan.

### US Lieutenant General Harmon Killed in Plane Crash

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News, New York: Lieutenant General Harmon, commander of the Strategic Air Force in the Pacific, was killed in a plane crash in the Pacific.

### Anti-Axis Forces on Western Front Cross Erft River; Fierce Battle for Trier

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: The major battle surrounding the Rhineland-Westphalia industrial area is intensifying. The main actions of the Allied forces in the past 24 hours are as follows: (1) The Canadian 1st Army continued its slow offensive between Kleve and Xanten. (2) Strong tank units of the US 9th Army advanced towards the Neuss area. (3) The British 2nd Army attacked German defenses in the Venlo area in southeastern Netherlands. From this, it can be seen that Montgomery not only wants to occupy territory but also wants to carry out large-scale encirclement operations. The Canadian army is now advancing southeast, seemingly aiming to progress towards Xanten and Rees, while the American army is advancing north towards Neuss-Düttingen, with the clear intention of cutting off the rear transportation of the German forces still fighting in the Meuse area. The US 1st Army advanced towards Cologne, which is more linear than the 9th Army's advance towards Düsseldorf. Although the anti-Axis forces were able to cross the Erft River on the Düren-Cologne highway, they were stopped in front of the new German positions.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: The enemy's attack on the historically significant city of Trier has begun. About 100 tanks of the US 3rd Army departed from the Saarlouis bridgehead and advanced to the eastern suburbs of Trier. A tank battle has now commenced.

### Train and Ship Tickets Revised with New Prices; Telegraph and Telephone Fees Redetermined

(7) Regarding the proposal to establish a senior commercial course in the Qianye Primary and Secondary School and to request all member money shops to bear the expenses, it was decided that each shop would contribute 10,000 yuan, with even better contributions from those who donate more. (8) Regarding the proposal to convert the cash deposited in the treasury fund into substitutes for payment by member shops, or to collectively purchase assets with the already deposited funds to solidify the foundation, Lu Shuchen first explained that each shop previously extended 300,000 yuan and paid 100,000 yuan into the treasury fund. It has now increased to 3,000,000 yuan per shop, while the fund remains at 100,000 yuan. It seems appropriate to increase it to balance rights and obligations. Subsequently, it was decided that the fund deposited by each shop would be changed to 500,000 yuan and can be paid with substitutes. (9) and (10) were deleted. (11) Establishing a practical research committee for the money shop industry was approved. (12) According to a letter from a member, the Money Shop industry should be included in short-term lending from the Central Reserve Bank, and the principle was approved. There was considerable discussion on adding handling fees to returned check vouchers and the treasury regulations.

### Future Construction Work Will Focus on Road Construction; Director Xu Reports at Routine Press Conference

The sixth routine press conference organized by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held in the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. Director Xu Jitun of the Construction Bureau immediately answered the questions raised by the newspapers in detail. The record of Mr. Xu's remarks is as follows:

The Establishment of the Municipal Construction Bureau

After I was appointed as the Director of the Construction Bureau, I followed the Mayor's instructions to implement the principle of administrative simplification. The internal adjustment of the bureau is largely completed, and the affiliated agencies are expected to be taken over and adjusted within a few days. Regarding the merger of the two bureaus and the establishment of the Construction Bureau, after receiving the order, I immediately evaluated the past work of the two bureaus. In the past, the Public Works Bureau focused on the management of water, electricity, and transportation, while the Engineering Bureau focused on the technical work of road administration and construction. There was some overlap in the work of both bureaus, but they also had their unique characteristics. Therefore, the establishment of the Construction Bureau's departments was carefully considered, and a total of six departments were established to maximize their original work efficiency. In accordance with the principle of simplification of the Municipal Government, the employees of the two bureaus were reduced by one-third to make the best use of their talents. Although one-third of the staff were laid off this time, the bureau's work is still proceeding as usual, with the aim of achieving maximum work efficiency with the least amount of manpower. As for the laid-off employees, in accordance with the Municipal Government's regulations, in addition to paying their March salaries as usual, they were also given three months' worth of salary for January to facilitate their departure. This is the process of establishing the Construction Bureau. In the future, the work of the Construction Bureau, in addition to carrying out the original work of the two bureaus, will also focus on road construction projects to assist in the preparation for population dispersal. This work will be implemented soon.

The Problem of Rickshaw Pullers Raising Prices

Regarding the problem of rickshaw pullers not complying with the official prices and arbitrarily raising prices, which is currently a concern for the general public, the bureau is also paying close attention. When the bureau approved the Rickshaw Guild's price increase, the representatives of the guild were instructed to operate in accordance with the official prices. According to numerous reports from citizens, rickshaw pullers are raising prices without authorization, which is an illegal act. In addition to ordering the guild authorities to strictly order their members to comply with the legal prices, the bureau also hopes that citizens will cooperate with the bureau and report any incidents at any time so that action can be taken. At the same time, in order to facilitate citizens' reporting, we are planning to set up mailboxes on important street corners so that citizens can report the rickshaw number to the bureau after being extorted by the rickshaw puller for thorough investigation. In addition, in order to unify and process the stoves and public buildings in the city, the bureau has sent personnel to investigate, hoping that citizens will cooperate to ensure the rationality and safety of various facilities.

### Changes in Leadership at the Oil and Grain Committee

Chen Ziyi, the Chairman of the Oil and Grain Control Committee, has requested a three-month leave of absence due to illness. The Executive Yuan believes that oil and grain control is important and should not be left without someone in charge, so it has temporarily appointed Yang Heqing, the Vice-Chairman of the committee, to act as chairman. Ling Yangwu, a standing member of the committee, had previously requested a leave of absence due to illness and recently resumed his duties. In addition, Pan Jingxian, the Chief Secretary, has also resigned due to illness, which has reportedly been approved.

### Shipping Lines Resumed Operations Yesterday; Coal Problem Resolved

Shipping in the city has been temporarily suspended since mid-February due to coal shortages, which has not only affected the source of supplies but has also directly impacted the people's food supply. After repeated discussions between the shipping industry and the relevant authorities, the coal problem for shipping has been resolved. As a result, shipping lines have resumed operations since the 3rd. The schedules of the various shipping lines are listed below: (1) North Jiangsu Line: The Chaji Wheel goes directly to Ruwei, Kou'an, and Tianxing Bridge; the Hana Wheel goes directly to Tianshenggang; and the Zhejiang Maru goes directly to Chongming. (2) Suzhou-Kunshan Inland River Line: The Fuxing Wheel goes directly to Kunshan, and the Dashan Maru goes directly to Suzhou and Wuxi.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Strictly Enforces Price Controls; Butchers Raising Pork Prices Punished by Police Bureau

The Municipal Economic Bureau believes that rising prices have a significant impact on people's livelihoods, so it has followed emergency price control measures to assess new price limits for sixteen major commodities. Among them, five are subject to the control system and must be assessed separately with the relevant control committees, while the remaining eleven price limits have been assessed and announced for implementation by the Price Evaluation Council. It is learned that some butchers in the city have raised the price of pork, exceeding the limit of 100 yuan per catty, with the highest price reaching 1,800 yuan. Director Xu was furious upon hearing this and immediately sent personnel to investigate. More than 20 butchers who exceeded the price limit have been handed over to the Police Bureau for punishment, and investigators continue to be sent out to secretly investigate. Strict punishment will be given to any industry found to be violating price limits.

### Municipal Government Strengthens Technical Office

After Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, they actively adjusted the structure and personnel of the Municipal Government and its various bureaus and offices, and the work has been gradually completed. The Municipal Government's Technical Office has been strengthened, with senior technicians Dong Daqiu and Xu Guansan responsible for reviewing matters related to municipal construction. It is said that both Mr. Dong and Mr. Xu are engineering experts, and it is expected that the construction projects of the Municipal Government will be improved in the future.

### The Second Anti-Aircraft Training Class Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday

The second training class of the Anti-Aircraft Training Institute, which is managed by the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, held a graduation ceremony at the Racecourse Institute at 10:30 AM yesterday (3rd). The graduates of this training class included a total of 194 Baojia police officers. The officials who attended the ceremony to provide guidance included Cao Jinhang, the Chief Secretary representing Director Zhou, who also serves as the Director of the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters; Hiraoka, the Second Section Chief representing Vice Director Watari; Noguchi, the Director of the General Affairs Office; Gu Jiwu, the Chief of the Baojia Section of the Municipal Police Bureau; Ide, the Director of the Fire Department; Tsukazaki, the Commander of the Police Force; Yamamoto Shin'ichirō, the Chief of the Air Defense Section; Li Zhenshi, the Deputy Section Chief; and the chiefs of various police branches, the Baojia district chiefs, Baojia members. The guests included Huang Tianrong, the Director of the General Affairs Office of the Central Market, and over two hundred others. The Laozha District Baojia Band came to the venue to play music. The ceremony began with a review led by Ōtani, the Director of Education, accompanied by Zhou Jinhang, the Chief Secretary representing Director Zhou, and the accompanying officials. After the review, Ōtani, the Director of Education, tested the graduates on key anti-aircraft issues on the spot. Then, an anti-aircraft drill was held, with each graduate demonstrating drills such as alarm defense, firefighting, and rescue. The graduation ceremony was then held, and the ceremony was completed by noon.

### Changshu District Establishes Model Self-Defense Corps

The Changshu District Baojia Sub-Committee held a ceremony for the establishment of the Model Self-Defense Corps at the Donghua Stadium on Daxing Road at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Attending were Branch Chief Yu, Director Yang of the Second Division, Liu, the Deputy Section Chief of the Training Section of the Baojia Office, and over four hundred members of the various Deputy Lianbao Chiefs, Jia Chiefs, and Model Self-Defense Corps members.

### Social Welfare Bureau Mediates Labor Disputes

Recently, due to various reasons, many factories and shops have closed or downsized, leading to labor disputes. Zhou, the Director of the Social Welfare Bureau, made the following remarks: (1) Factories and shops that close or downsize due to various difficulties must take into account the livelihood of the laid-off or terminated employees. After communicating with the employees, the employer should provide severance pay. The standard should be three months' salary (including food and accommodation expenses). With the severance pay subsidy, unemployed employees can find a way to return to their hometowns and will not be stranded in Shanghai. It is hoped that all closed factories and shops can automatically follow this standard to find a solution. (2) As for factories and shops in difficult circumstances, the severance pay standard should be lowered, or for employees who have a history of labor achievements in the service factory, a request for additional retirement pay should also be negotiated by both parties sincerely. When a resolution cannot be reached, a request should be made to the Bureau for mediation. However, employees must maintain order and must not take any disruptive action.

### New Movement Branch Takes Over Youth Corps

Since the General Association of the New People's Movement in the capital issued a unified management decree, all units and organizations of the National Youth Corps are under the jurisdiction of the General Association of the New People's Movement. From this month, the various organizations of the Shanghai Youth Corps will be managed by the Shanghai Branch of the New People's Movement. It is reported that the Shanghai Branch has successively taken over the Shanghai Municipal Youth Corps Headquarters, the Fourth Brigade of the Model Youth Corps, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Youth Hall, and the Youth Guidance Office in the Qingxiang District. As a result, the internal organization of the New People's Movement has expanded, which is more conducive to directing future youth movement work under centralized management.

### New Association Shanghai Branch Held Yesterday: Divine Eagle Song Concert - Magnificent Singing Moved Listeners

The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, in order to promote the great achievements of the Allied Japanese air combat soldiers, specifically publicly solicited Divine Eagle praise lyrics, and commissioned famous artists to compose music for the top three winning works. The branch also, in order to allow the public to hear the Divine Eagle praise songs and promote the "Kamikaze Spirit," held a Divine Eagle praise song concert yesterday (3rd) at 5 p.m. at the Waibaidu Bridge (Bund) Cathay Hotel. Attendees included the chairman of the branch, Chen Binhe, executive director Chen Riping, directors Lu Feng, Zhu Yongkang, and others from Chinese and Japanese circles, including Minister Matsudaira of the embassy's information department, Minister Matsushima of the fleet's press department, Captain Matsumoto, Captain Hirata, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Lin Junfu, Sakazume, Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, and over 2,000 others. Chen Binhe first gave a report, followed by a speech by Minister Matsushima. After the speech, the performance began. The first part included Chinese and Japanese songs and the Divine Eagle praise song. The Chinese and Japanese songs were conducted by Hattori Ryoichi, and the Divine Eagle praise song was conducted by Chen Gexin. The singing was magnificent, and the listeners were moved. Then, a film of the war was shown, and the meeting adjourned. The texts of the speeches and the original lyrics of the Divine Eagle praise song are recorded below:

Chairman Chen's Speech: "Since the enemy America's encroachment in the Pacific last winter, the Allied land, sea, and air forces have organized Divine Wind special attack teams with the principle of 'one person, one plane, one ship,' continuously establishing immortal achievements in Taiwan and the Philippines. This is the general model of the spirit of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia, called the 'Kamikaze Spirit.' The birth of the Kamikaze team dates back 670 years when Yuan soldiers attacked Japan from Mongolia. Suddenly, a gale arose, blowing the Yuan Dynasty's ships into the sea. Of the 100,000 Yuan soldiers, only three survived. At that time, Japan called it 'Kamikaze' (Divine Wind). A spirit, especially the Kamikaze Spirit, cannot be cultivated and achieved temporarily, nor can it be expressed casually. The Allied powers launched the Greater East Asia War with long-term preparations in this regard. The Kamikaze Spirit shown in this Greater East Asia War is the Kamikaze special attack team. After their departure, they did not want to return alive, bravely attacking and reducing enemy ships, promoting their Divine Wind, and using a small number of troops to defeat a large number of troops, achieving final victory. This association, considering that this Kamikaze Spirit needs to be publicized and promoted, and needs to be promoted in various wartime work in the rear, the former Shanghai News Federation specifically publicly solicited 'Divine Eagle praise lyrics' in December last year. The number of applicants was very enthusiastic. Finally, Li Hanying, Xie Junwei, and Zhou Aijiang were selected and awarded bonuses. The lyrics were published in various newspapers on January 9. Then, we humbly invited Mr. Chen Gexin and Yan Jie to compose the music. After today's performance, it will be widely spread among the people, hoping that the Kamikaze Spirit can be demonstrated in various wartime work in the rear of China."

Minister Matsushima's Speech:

"Today, the News Association is hosting the Divine Eagle praise song concert. I am very grateful to everyone for taking the time to participate. I would like to express my gratitude to the organizers and all participants.

Loyal and Brave Martyrs

On October 25th of last year, during the continuation of the battle in the Philippines, when naval and air operations were becoming increasingly fierce, our naval and land special attack teams successively appeared in the Leyte Island area, descending from the sky with demon-subduing swords, causing the enemy to be fearful and achieving the effect of 'must hit, must kill,' which I believe all of you are already aware of. As the war situation has developed recently, after the enemy landed on Luzon Island in early January this year, the decisive battle has become even more intense. From that time until the end of January, the special attack teams achieved the single achievement of sinking 82 enemy warships, aircraft carriers, and other ships, and destroying 75 of them. Such a major blow to the enemy was entirely due to the land and sea special attack teams using their bodies and planes to collide with enemy ships. The loyal and heroic spirit of Japanese soldiers sacrificing themselves for their country is truly unparalleled in ancient and modern times. This is the patriotic spirit of 'sacrificing oneself for righteousness,' as Confucius said. Of course, this is nothing more than the national character shown by the people of China and Japan in the construction of Greater East Asia.

Favorable Situation

Recently, the enemy has relied solely on material quantity and is eager to end the war, repeatedly engaging in reckless and bloody operations, but this is exactly what Japan's guiding tactics are aiming for. From a macro perspective, Japan is temporarily enduring tactical disadvantages and gradually gaining strategic advantages, completing preparations for the final victory. In the Luzon Island area, the enemy has spent nearly two months since January 9th. They have suffered unprecedented bloodshed. Although they have poured in 18 divisions, the progress of the battle is still not easy. As a result, they landed on Iwo Jima on February 19th. However, they also encountered fierce resistance from us in that area, and once again encountered a major bloodshed that had never occurred since the beginning of the Pacific War. As of today, the landing force is approximately 45,000, and it is estimated that at least one-third have been killed or wounded. According to enemy sources, they are losing two men every minute, just as the enemy Marine Corps commander said, "the most brutal battle in the 168-year history since the founding of the Marine Corps." We have observed the course of the Battle of Manila in the same situation. The enemy seems to be gradually approaching our inner circle, but the result is inevitably a large amount of bloodshed, which has greatly hindered the supply of human resources. This can also be understood from U.S. Secretary of the Army Stimson's statement. The enemy is approaching our Japanese mainland step by step. From Japan's perspective, this is a planned strategy, and it will enter the stage of destroying the enemy. During this period, Japan will adopt a completely different strategic thinking from the past, enriching the best equipment and combat power, and we firmly believe that we will be able to reduce the enemy in the final stage.

Special Attack Spirit

Today, the people of Japan are thoroughly developing the special attack spirit and striving for the victory of the war. Moreover, the special attack spirit is expanding to all aspects such as politics, economy, and thought, whether on the front line or in the rear, and is gradually transforming into invincible combat power. The News Association has completed the Divine Eagle praise song composition and scheduled its first performance today. This has profound significance for China and Japan to fight together, and I am confident that it will have a great effect. Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in this effort."

### Divine Eagle Praise Song

— Lyrics by Li Hanying, Music by Chen Gexin, Yan Jie

(1) The Divine Wind soars, our might is displayed, invincible in the Pacific;

The American bandits attack from the east, their fighting power is strong, adding glory to the southern sky, the light of the yellow race.

(2) The Divine Eagle spreads its wings, every attack hits the mark, crushing the old and decaying, the war blood is red,

Working together with one heart, sea, land, and air, the brave soldiers are all heroes.

(3) Loyal, righteous, and brave, regardless of their own lives, their spirit swallows mountains and rivers, making ghosts and gods weep,

The enemy generals lose their courage, the enemy's heart is frightened, enemy planes are destroyed, enemy ships are leveled.

(4) Only our friendly nation has a decisive and heroic spirit, destroying Britain and America, establishing East Asia,

Sharing both joy and sorrow, and sharing victory, Divine Wind Divine Wind, the greatest achievement.

### The Defection of Colonies and the Relationship Between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union

A Seasoned Debtor

With trade, shipping, and overseas investment having no means of revival, all that remains in Britain's hands is the experience of having led international politics and economics for many years, and the façade that accompanies it. To compensate for its lack of real strength with cunning power plays can be said to be the particularly adept and signature skill of hypocritical Britain.

In a famous speech given in London in December 1943, the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Jan Smuts, after acknowledging the fact that Britain's national strength had significantly declined compared to the United States and the Soviet Union, proposed a countermeasure: to bring together the countries of Western Europe under its umbrella. To reorganize the so-called Sterling Area from these Western European countries and British self-governing colonies, and to use its strength to compete with the United States and the Soviet Union, is thought to be the basic tone of Britain's future policy.

Britain's policy of clinging to the Sterling Area can also be clearly seen in the words of Chancellor of the Exchequer Anderson's response to a Member of Parliament's question in the House of Commons on October 9, 1944. In addition to implying that the post-war international currency plan of the Bretton Woods Conference was an idealistic plan lacking feasibility, Chancellor Anderson also said:

"There is a clear distinction between the necessary measures for the issue of external debts arising from the war and various issues in the post-war transition period, and the stability of international institutions that Britain and other countries are pursuing as their ultimate goal. The handling of British pound funds currently held by various countries in London falls within the former category."

Let us look at the arguments of the "Financial News":

"Regarding the British pound funds locked in London by various countries, legally speaking, they should be disposed of through normal international financial transactions in the future. However, if this argument is accepted, then Britain, in this war, in addition to losing most of its foreign investment, will also have to bear an external debt of 2 billion pounds, which is more than double the debt of the First World War... Of course, debts to neutral countries will certainly be recognized and repaid by normal methods. However, for other countries, the disposal of locked British pound funds should be carried out in a different way than for neutral countries... Because Britain's war debt is not only for Britain itself, but also for the necessary war waged for all other anti-Axis countries or the United States and its territories."

To put it bluntly, the money borrowed from you was spent for your benefit, so it is inconvenient to treat it as an ordinary loan. Isn't Britain's attitude even more callous than that of a habitual debtor? The British government's publication of the "Bankruptcy White Paper" is precisely for this reason.

Wishful Thinking

What best reflects the inside story is the issue of the handling of Indian funds in Britain, which was heavily discussed at the recent Bretton Woods anti-war currency conference. It is said that the British pound funds held by India have reached 720 million pounds, which accounts for more than half of all the locked funds held by Britain. This is the price of food and military supplies taken by Britain by issuing dud checks, which they used during the last Great War by promising dominion status after the war and through armed repression, which left the Indian people mired in starvation and poverty. Moreover, Britain simply did not supply India with goods during this period, with the result that the depletion of Indian resources has become terribly frightening. Therefore, it is only natural that India should freely dispose of British pound funds and exchange them for US dollars or gold to seek the restoration of its national wealth.

"In response, the British side said that the spot goods of consumer goods in India have indeed been greatly reduced; this is a global phenomenon, not unique to India. The food famine last year caused difficult situations, but this was the result of the general public hiding food and the incompetence of local authorities, and not caused by excessive purchases by Britain."

While Britain is shouting like this, it is creating various pretexts, such as: the current exchange rate of the British pound to the rupee has nothing to do with India's high prices; Britain's burden on India's defense costs has increased, so the 1939 agreement must be revised, etc.; thereby trying to prevent India's British pound funds from being disposed of outside the Sterling Area. And Britain's real intention is to eliminate the aforementioned British pound funds by means of exchange rate manipulation in the future, in order to sell the goods it squeezed from the Indian people at a high price for only a small price. "Financial News" once frankly described it as follows:

"The use of these British pound funds can only be used as funds for purchasing goods from Britain, or transferred to within the Sterling Area. If there is still a surplus of British pound funds held by various countries in this way, they will be listed as non-interest-bearing claims against Britain and kept in deposit, and only allowed to be appropriated when various countries are short of foreign payment methods."

This is truly a completely wishful thinking! However, the United States aside, among the neutral countries and self-governing colonies, Britain only provides gold-like guarantees for debts to Argentina, so this issue will arise to some extent for the countries of the Sterling Area. Only the strength of the counterpart country will affect the degree of Britain's attitude.

Many Relatives Dissenting

Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the various self-governing colonies of the British Empire are gradually turning away from their home country. Britain's attitude towards Indian British pound funds, etc., is also a kind of struggle that Britain is making under helpless circumstances, knowing the existence of this trend. However, India no longer believes in the old empty check of dominion status after the war, and earnestly demands practical things.

"During the previous Great War, India gave Britain a donation of 100 million pounds from 1917 onwards... and gave a huge donation when peace came. But in this war, because there is a very fierce anti-British political struggle within India, there is no sign of a second donation."

India is becoming more uncooperative with Britain, and there is another reason today, which is that the power of the United States has begun to permeate India. There is no doubt that the United States covets the Indian market, and the reason why it has repeatedly criticized Britain's India policy is because it has this intention. Although the United States and Britain are birds of a feather, India is happy to approach the United States when it begins to approach India, because India also wants to take advantage of the opposition between the United States and Britain. This makes Britain very nervous, so like the recent Phillips incident, it jumps up in anger when an American interferes in the governance of India.

Next, what about Canada? Due to the war, this country's political and economic dependence on the United States has also been increasing. Recently, rather than being a member of the British Empire, it sees itself as a bridge between Britain and the United States. At the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in May 1944, Canadian Prime Minister King said: "Canada is the link between the New World and the Old World. Canada is connected to the mother country by sacred bonds, and connected to the United States by deep friendly relations." Australia and New Zealand today not only depend on the United States militarily and economically, but also have not forgotten the fact that Britain did not provide any assistance when the two countries were on the verge of an unprecedented crisis in the early stages of the Greater East Asia War. South Africa is somewhat more friendly to Britain, but it also advocates restoring the gold standard together with India, and thus opposes Britain on currency policy. As a result, large-scale British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences, etc., although they contain a sense of friendly posture, have no concrete results, and the view of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams is unavoidable. On the contrary to what Britain hopes, the ties of the British Empire will become looser in the future.

Furthermore, the Western European Group plan, which has been widely discussed recently, although it is hoped for by Britain, has been opposed by the Soviet Union and the United States. Especially the Soviet Union, which regards this as an anti-Soviet move and severely criticizes it. Judging from the fact that France and other countries are taking advantage of this situation to launch a "using barbarians to control barbarians" diplomacy, it can be seen that the countries of Western Europe are not necessarily more pro-British than the self-governing colonies of the British Empire.

Digging One's Own Grave

Britain, which is facing domestic problems of increasing labor class power and the defection of autonomous colonies, is also suffering from the expansion of the power of the United States and the Soviet Union in the anti-Axis camp abroad, but it must continue the war. Britain's reason for declaring war on Germany was to guarantee Poland's borders, but today it is at a loss as to what to do about the Soviet Union occupying Polish territory. Britain also had significant interests in the Balkans before the war, but now it cannot prevent it from gradually falling under the influence of the Soviet Union, and is only busy defending the Mediterranean route. In the United States, there are various discussions, such as continuing to borrow the air bases borrowed from Britain after the war, etc., and even advocating that Britain be merged into the United States. Britain cannot protest against this too much. Churchill frequently greets Roosevelt and Stalin, prostrating himself to preserve his sphere of influence, which is Britain's current attitude.

This is nothing more than the consequence of Britain's actions since the start of the war, which has been to take advantage of others. It was the Soviet Union's resistance that contained Germany's power in the East and gave Britain time to breathe. In response, Britain's promised Second Front was delayed. It was the escort of US aircraft carriers that reversed the crisis on its Atlantic transport line; and it was the Lend-Lease Act that supplied Britain with military equipment and food to enable it to continue the war. Even the current Second Front would not be realized without relying on the power of the United States. However, while using the resources of the United States, Britain wants to prevent the United States from interfering in the British Empire, and even wants to bring the countries of Western Europe under its umbrella. Indeed, as British Information Minister Brendan Bracken said when publishing the "Bankruptcy White Paper," Britain "has sacrificed most of the legacy since the Victorian era" in the war, but Britain does not want to work hard itself, but only hopes to use others to restore its losses. Having lost its strength and still trying to preserve its former sphere of influence, I am afraid that there is no other way than to kowtow to the United States and the Soviet Union.

The road to destruction is indeed wide! While using threats and appeasement to squeeze the self-governing colonies of the British Empire, and relying on the United States and the Soviet Union, the opportunistic policy of always taking advantage of others to seek its own interests will be the basic factor leading to Britain's demise. In the past, Britain had the ambition to fly over the seven seas. When it had huge overseas investments and lived on interest, Britain was only concerned with protecting its family property. Today's Britain, however, does not fully recognize the reality of its declining strength and dreams of a golden age that will never return. The one who destroyed Qin was Qin itself. The collapse of the ancient Roman Empire was due to the decadence of the Romans themselves; the one who will destroy the British Empire will also be the English themselves!

As a result of the exchange of technology and designs between the warring countries, the shapes of small aircraft are almost identical, making them difficult to distinguish. When judging from the ground, the first thing is to be familiar with the planform of enemy and friendly aircraft. Taking this as the main point, several similar Japanese and American small aircraft are shown. As for their horizontal stabilizers, they are generally similar to the main wings. The shape of the vertical stabilizers is quite difficult to distinguish on the ground, but it can be noticed during vertical turns, etc. Secondly, because the vertical stabilizer is far behind the horizontal stabilizer, the aircraft seems very white.

The Japanese "Hien" fighter is the only water-cooled type, and its nose is slender, which is more delicate than the "Hayabusa", "Chung Kui" or the Navy's Zero fighter, and is very easy to distinguish. The spacing between its main wings and tail wings is extremely small. The Chance Vought F4U fighter's main wings are upturned at both ends, forming a W shape when viewed from the front. As for its planform, it is quite ordinary. Also, its vertical stabilizer extends behind the horizontal stabilizer. The Douglas SBD3 with a wingspan of 12.65 meters is described as follows:

The Japanese "Chung Kui" fighter's leading edge of the main wing is a straight line, and the trailing edge forms an arc towards both ends, unlike the American Grumman F6F's leading and trailing edges of the main wing that are slanted towards both ends, and is similar to the Curtiss SB2C. Generally speaking, because the head of an aircraft is equipped with a large-horsepower engine with a huge diameter, the fuselage is bound to be thick, but depending on the spacing between the main wing and the horizontal stabilizer, it can make people feel either thick or thin. This point must be carefully studied in the diagram to understand the wing's leading edge is also a straight line, and the trailing edge is inclined forward, with rounded ends, which is different from the Grumman F6F, etc., which have angular ends.

The American Curtiss SB2C is a two-seater aircraft. The main wing is very similar to the "Chung Kui", but it is larger than the horizontal one compared to ordinary fighters. The fuselage between the main wing and the tail wing is thinner, and the tail is upturned. Finally, the Grumman F6F, its shape is quite comical, quite like a washboard mounted on a beer barrel, and is the easiest to distinguish.

Shanghai Municipal Affairs - Zhou - Topic - Fourth Issue
Implementation Steps of Evacuation Work
— Yu De

Large-scale evacuation of the population is a complex task, and in the current urgent situation, it is especially hoped that it can be implemented quickly. Now, I will briefly present my views on four steps based on chronological order:

The first step is registration and investigation. During this period, the city's Baojia organizations should register the situation of those who voluntarily evacuate within their jurisdiction according to a unified format, such as the number of evacuees, destination, number of luggage pieces, and economic ability. At the same time, the evacuation committee should cooperate with various hometown associations to investigate the transportation capacity of each transportation line, the price, security, and accommodation capacity of the main evacuation destinations, so as to plan and coordinate in a comprehensive manner.

The second step is organization and liaison. On the organization side, those with hometown associations should be handled by the hometown associations, and citizens without hometown associations should be divided into teams by the evacuation committee according to their destination, and designated persons in charge of leading and directing each team. On the liaison side, such as increasing the number of train and boat trips, reducing fares, simplifying inspection procedures, and relaxing restrictions. All of these must be completed before the evacuation to avoid temporary chaos and crowding.

The third step is to implement the evacuation. Such as issuing evacuation certificates, collective reporting of household registration, reasonable allocation of transportation, purchase of group boat tickets, and allocation of escorts, and then proceed in batches. The procedures must be simple, and the handling must be fast.

The fourth step is follow-up. The purpose of the evacuation work is not only to solve the difficulties of transportation, but also to take care of the living problems of the evacuees after the evacuation. Otherwise, the evacuation result in Shanghai will cause serious social problems in various places; therefore, in each main evacuation destination, the evacuation committee must also contact the local government and public groups to organize temporary institutions to provide practical and effective assistance in resolving housing rental disputes, household registration declarations, job introductions, and temporary relief.

The current situation is so tense, the possibility of air raids is so great, and the price of rice is so high that all citizens who do not need to stay in Shanghai hope that the evacuation will be implemented as soon as possible. In extraordinary times, only extraordinary methods can be used. It is necessary to avoid the complicated procedures taken in the past in administration, and to seek agility and perfection in everything, and only by reducing the suffering of the evacuees can the success of the evacuation work be achieved. Two prerequisites for evacuation work.

### Transportation and Security are Two Prerequisites for Evacuation Work

— Bao Zhonghua

Since the enemy planes have bombed many times, the citizens, in view of the terror of air raids, coupled with the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood at present, many citizens are willing to evacuate voluntarily to safer places—the countryside. However, the difficulty of purchasing black market train and boat tickets, and the extortion of red and black hats, and the poor security in the countryside, all make voluntary evacuees want to go but stop again. Now the municipal authorities have established an organization of the Evacuation Population Committee for the evacuation of the population. The Shen Bao has specially opened the Shanghai Municipal Affairs column to solicit the opinions of citizens for the reference of the authorities. The author is willing to offer a humble opinion from the citizens' point of view, without taking the liberty.

Increasing transportation and eliminating the black market are prerequisites for the evacuation of the population. It can be asserted that if these two cannot be done, the evacuation work will be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Like the recent trips between Shanghai and Ningbo, only one "Ningshao" ship is available. If it travels to Ningbo seven times a month, with 7,000 passengers each time, it will only be 50,000 people in a month. Also, like the black market train tickets, it is said that they have been sold for more than 10,000 yuan. Assuming that an evacuated family has four people and five pieces of luggage, the train ticket alone requires 50,000 yuan, and each piece of luggage requires 4,000 yuan, which requires 20,000 yuan, plus the extortion of porters and the blackmail along the way, an evacuation of a family costs no less than 100,000 yuan. How can a salaried class afford this huge expense? Therefore, the authorities' evacuation of the population work should first solve the above two major problems.

In recent years, bandits have sprung up in the countryside, and security is poor. The war has caused all industries to wither, unemployment is increasing, and prices are soaring, and life is becoming increasingly difficult, so there are many people who have been forced to become bandits. However, the failure of politics to get on track, allowing corrupt officials, hooligans, and local bullies to run rampant everywhere, is also a major reason. For example, the author's hometown of Qijia in Zhenhai has been robbed four times, which is evident. Now the authorities are evacuating the population, starting with the unemployed and vagrants. If they are evacuated to the countryside without appropriate disposal measures, it will be enough to disturb the local area. The author sincerely hopes that the authorities will consider three times when evacuating vagrants, so as to seek perfection.

My hometown of Xinlaozhou is one of the major towns in Zhenhai. In the past, there were thousands of households, making it the crown of each village. Now, nine out of ten houses are empty, which is unspeakably desolate. The political problems, ramparts everywhere, and the wind of robbery are heard every day. The villagers cannot withstand the threats, and most of them have moved to the cities, and there are many who have come to Shanghai to live. Since my hometown is like this, how can other villages be different? Therefore, when evacuating the population, the authorities are especially hoped to do well in rural security.

### The Treatment of Baojia Personnel

— Huang Gong'an

The Baojia organization in Shanghai has been in existence for more than two years. In these two years, although I dare not say that it has made some real contributions to society, the elimination of thieves, the subjugation of evil-doers, self-defense, the maintenance of security, the promotion of air defense, and all other public organizations, the Baojia has made the greatest effort.

The Baojia is the link between the government and the people. Above, it promotes laws and regulations, transmits and implements government policies; below, it conveys public opinion, contributes reviews of the demands of the people, and cooperates in promoting municipal administration. The Baojia is an organization of the people, assisting the government, maintaining social order, supporting the good, eliminating the evil, and serving the public.

Mayor Zhou said: "The Baojia organization should promote the government and assist the government." He also said: "In the future, the municipal government will distribute goods, and I hope the Baojia will assist." Secretary-General Luo said: "The Baojia has assisted the military and police and has achieved results, and the reporting of all bad elements depends on the cooperation of the Baojia's self-police. The Baojia has the responsibility to supervise and report all crimes in society."

The responsibilities of the Baojia are so important, and their work is worthy of the country and the people. But what about the lives of those who directly engage in Baojia work? Let us study it.

Before the recovery of the concessions, the Lianbao of the French Concession had a monthly subsidy of 450 yuan as office expenses, and the salaries of the staff were also paid from this. After the recovery of the concessions, the office expenses of each Lianbao increased to 1,500 yuan, but it was not paid for a long time. In July of the 33rd year, after the unified collection of Baojia funds, each Lianbao received 7,500 yuan a month for office expenses, and each Bao also received 5,000 yuan a month for office expenses. However, the scope of the Bao and Lianbao has been expanded to seven times that of the past, and the previously owed funds have been written off and will no longer be mentioned.

Each Baochang has set up a Bao office, hiring one or two staff members. After deducting 1,000 to 2,000 yuan for necessary items such as ink, stationery, and paper from the office expenses, there are only 3,000 to 4,000 yuan left. Moreover, the superior also deducts odds and ends. The staff can only get 1,000 to 2,000 yuan from these deducted leftovers as monthly living expenses, as the price of a month of hard work. On the Lianbao side, due to the increase in printed materials, after deducting the rest, each staff member can only get this little bit.

Starting from the 34th year, although the Baojia Department increased the Baojia fee, preparing to double the office expenses to improve the treatment of Baojia personnel, but after the increase, each Bao can get 15,000 yuan a month, and each Lianbao can get 22,500 yuan a month. Even if there are no expenses deducted, all of it is used as staff subsidies, and each person can only get 7,500 yuan. In today's soaring living standards, the kind-hearted seek other jobs, or take on side jobs; the evil-doers use their power to extort good people, making the people fear or resent the Baojia. The Baojia's work is not active today, which is produced under this situation.

Recently, the government authorities have been vigorously cleaning up corruption and establishing a clean government, and the Baojia, which is in direct contact with the people and has a great relationship, has produced this situation, which is really distressing. Of course, "in times of chaos, heavy penalties are used." But you can't work with an empty stomach, you always have to eat and dress warmly to do things.

Today, we dare not ask to increase office expenses, so as not to increase the Baojia fee paid by the people to disturb the people; but we hope that the government authorities, when implementing key distribution, will include us in the ranks of public officials, and issue key distribution uniformly, so as to stabilize our lives and work hard in the position of the Baojia.

### Price Limits and Refusal to Sell

Amidst the relentless rise in prices, the Shanghai Economic Bureau recently assessed price limits for sixteen kinds of commodities. Upon seeing the announcement of the new price limits, it seemed that the stipulated prices were not particularly low. It is evident that the authorities considered the cost of each item, the profits of the merchants, and all other aspects, and it cannot be deemed unreasonable or unfair.

However, on the merchant side, many still felt that the price limits assessed by the Economic Bureau were too low to allow for exorbitant profits, leaving them unsatisfied. Under the Economic Bureau's strict order not to sell above the limit, they did not dare openly express opposition or secretly raise prices for sale. But merchants have their own methods and means, which is refusal to sell. They felt that the new price limits were not enough to satisfy their desire for wealth, so they hoarded goods and implemented a refusal to sell.

The most prominent example of this is cooking oil. The new price limit was 620 yuan per catty (approximately 1.1 lbs). Before the announcement, cooking oil could be bought everywhere. Once the announcement was made, going to any oil shop, they all unanimously claimed to be sold out. Although some oil shops were selling oil at the limited price under the supervision of the authorities, only half a catty per person, because the space was limited, long queues and jostling were observed.

We can conclude that most oil shops have oil, but they are hiding it and refusing to sell it because the limited price cannot satisfy their desires. Cooking oil is a daily necessity for citizens and is indispensable. Now that household oil cannot be rationed on schedule, and black market cooking oil is being refused for sale by merchants, citizens are already suffering from a lack of oil.

If this problem is allowed to continue, the public's fear regarding cooking oil will only intensify. I believe that in addition to enforcing the new price limits, the authorities should go a step further and thoroughly investigate the oil merchants' and oil shops' stock. If they discover hoarding oil and refusing to sell it, they should be severely punished. Otherwise, price limits will be just price limits. When merchants think the price limits are too low, they will refuse to sell, and apart from cooking oil, other goods among the sixteen newly limited-price commodities might follow the example of cooking oil and implement a refusal to sell!

### Homeless Man

— Yi Fan

Lao Fang is a strange man. Among his peers, he is lonely; but in the group of children, he does not lose his innocent vitality.

"He's been ready to find a wife for a long time, yet he's still with the children, aren't you afraid?" The cook, A Fa, always jokingly teased him half in jest and half seriously.

Ying saw that he was tall and big, yet sensitive and meticulous. Perhaps this sentence touched his sorrow. Think about it: he's thirty years old, has been wandering for many years, yet is just a tea server at a school. Of course, he has to be alone, unable to afford a wife. He felt ashamed, and his face really turned red.

He can't love women, so he loves children.

In the evening, as soon as the back door opened, he would come out looking for the children; no, it could also be said that the children came out looking for him. The children formed an inextricable bond with him. They liked him, listened to him, and greeted him by calling him "old friend".

"Come on, kids! I'll give you some candy." Lao Fang raised his hand, holding a few pieces of peanut candy.

The children immediately snatched them, surrounding his legs, chewing the candy he distributed with relish, looking up at his kind face with interest.

"Old friend, didn't you take Xiao Liu and them to see Shaoxing opera last time? Would you take us again tonight?" One child hooked his arm.

"Um, --uh." Lao Fang rummaged in his pockets, and had to answer evasively.

But in a few days, he secretly took three or four children to the Golden Grand Theater. At night, when the children returned, they said with great interest: "Old friend is really good, he took us there, and we even rode in that red car, it was really fast and comfortable. During the opera, old friend told us in detail what the one singing in a loud voice was called, and what the one pinching his throat was called. Later, when we came out, we all clamored to be hungry, and he took us to a restaurant to eat mutton noodles before coming back."

Everyone knew that he was very frugal. Originally, what money could a tea server earn? However, he would generously use his accumulated hard-earned money for the children. The children's parents all said he was a kind person and often asked him to come to their homes to play, but he had a peculiarity that did not match his burly body, which was that he was afraid of meeting strangers, so he never went to people's homes. Only when people had children, held full-moon parties, or celebrated birthdays, he would reluctantly send a small gift, shyly step into the door, hug the child warmly, and shed tears of joy.

One day, he exceptionally bought a few catties of meat and old wine. He asked the old woman in number nine lane to cook the meat for him, and then invited me and another neighbor to accompany him for drinks.

Once the wine entered his stomach, he became more talkative.

"If there were no children to play with me, my life would be so boring!" He shook his head with a bitter smile.

"You like children so much, why don't you like women?" The old woman interjected: "Think about it, if you have a woman, you will have children too, haha!"

"Women all look down on me, but I only have one woman in my heart. She was a good girl: silky hair, dark red cheeks, bell-like laughter, and a cheerful personality. I fell in love with her, and suddenly one day, she was forcibly taken away by an evil spirit and defiled. She was a chaste girl, she didn't want to live anymore, so she jumped into the water. In this way, I lost her forever. After losing her, I can't forget her, and I don't think about other women anymore." He said quickly and passionately, his face flushed.

"Even so, you are so old, you should go back and find a woman from your hometown." My neighbor comforted him.

"Go back? Where do I go back to?"

So I asked him where he was from.

"I don't even know it myself. I only remember when I was a child, my father took me wandering everywhere, from the south to the north, and from the north to the south, but we still couldn't fill our stomachs. Of all the places, we lived in Jinhua, Zhejiang for the longest time, and it can barely be said to be my hometown. The scenery there is really good: there are mountains forever, there is water in the mountains, the water is green and the mountains are blue, how lovely it is! But unfortunately, my father died there. Looking back, the green mountains and green waters are always dotted with my father's purple bloodstains. I'm scared, I'm sad, I can't bear to go to such a lovely place again, and I can't bear to see the long green grass on my father's grave!..." His tears dripped into the wine glass, but he lifted it up and drank it with the wine and tears.

This couldn't help but evoke my memories of passing through eastern Zhejiang a few years ago: sitting on a simple folk boat drifting on the transparent green stream, I once forgot the pain of wandering and fully enjoyed the winding and beautiful mountain scenery. The water is not locked, so it is called a stream. And the mountains, the mountains stand in the water, forming strange and steep cliffs. But it is not a straight and whole piece, but also winding and craggy, with a heroic beauty contained in the majesty. The boat glides through a section of plain, and as it turns a corner, a stack of peaks suddenly flies into view, giving people a startling admiration... Thinking of this beautiful scenery, I also had sympathetic feelings with him.

We drank silently for a while. Seeing that the meat was almost finished, he stood up and said with a hoarse voice: "I really want to invite you to drink and chat again. Really, living alone is too lonely!... But I'm afraid this opportunity will be difficult to have."

"Being alone is free, you can do what you want to do."

He thought for a while, then nodded and laughed loudly: "Yes, considering the four seas as home, maybe it's a kind of fun for people like me."

He tried to leave, but suddenly turned around, took my hand and said lowly: "I don't want to stay here anymore. I always remember a friend from a few years ago, who said he was going to find a meaningful life and asked me to go with him, but I never agreed. Thinking about it now, I really regret it..."

So he turned around and strode away.

I didn't see him for many days. One evening, my little brother came home from school and told me anxiously, "Old friend is gone!"

"Where did he go?"

"Who knows?"

Only then did I realize that his last meat-cooking wine invitation was his final farewell to me.

Thinking of him under the lamp, I couldn't help but remember the two lines of poetry "From now on, the four seas are home, the autumn wind is blowing through the reeds".

In his future wandering life, I hope there will be no more autumn leaves.

### Appeal

— Fang Xuan

These few days my mood is extremely bad. Why does fate treat our kind group so harshly? This is what I doubt most. Thinking of my own things, which I rely on to make a living, being forcibly taken away by others, even the most magnanimous person cannot avoid being angry. But what can I do? My things have already been taken away by others, and this person has declared bankruptcy. I remember his smug look in the judicial office of the police station, as if he was not being sanctioned by the law, but being protected by the law.

"If you want it, this is the number!" He said firmly, spitting loudly. It was very obvious that he offered half the market price to seize other people's things, and then used this "surplus" amount to seek favors outside the law!

— Is this a world with laws?

I saw the lawyer he hired eagerly pursuing his own desires, offering each other cigarettes, and I couldn't help but sigh.

But — who told us to be so poor? We can't afford a lawyer to negotiate with him! We had to withdraw from the group of victims and "settle privately" with him alone. He designated his wife to negotiate, and one snowy morning, we rushed to his home.

His wife was still in bed. She yawned, stretched, and slowly got out of bed. She opened her wallet, took out a cigarette case, wrote on the back in her husband's handwriting, and said with a straight face:

"Write a receipt according to this writing, don't be indecisive."

I picked up the note with trembling hands. What is this? He wants me to admit that I took back the original thing? — God, what I got from you is less than half of what you seized. Even a robber should show some conscience. Why do you want me to write such a receipt?

Even the mediator he hired felt that the other party was too ruthless. He hesitated, rubbing his hands, and took a cold breath and said:

"Then you draft a receipt yourself, go to the police station to see Mr. X, and write it after you agree!"

I nodded, opened the door and walked out, and behind me came the woman's sharp voice:

"Go see him, he's not angry! — Humph!" This sentence made me tremble all over as if ice water was flowing down my spine. Is it only the vicious people in this world who deserve to speak, and is "reason" on their mouths?

After I drafted a more reasonable receipt, I went to the police station to see him. He looked at the note for a long time and laughed in his nose:

"Then I'll give it to you cheap!"

He took out a checkbook from his side and signed two checks. I took the checks and asked stutteringly:

"Mr. X, will these checks be returned when they are due?"

"Of course, how could my checks be returned... You know I have some property besides being detained!"

He said seriously, and I couldn't help but laugh at my own stupidity.

Yes, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, I will be able to get a sum of money that is neither too big nor too small. I can safely get through this year-end, but after this year-end, how should I live my life?

It is illegal to be a robber — the so-called law may be a threat to us!

### Bitter Leaves

— Cheng Xia

I remember back then, when I first tasted the bitter leaves of love,

How did I spend those long nights:

Silent tears fell all over the pillow,

And then cried the back of the pillow wet until dawn.

XXX

Now, there is only this unspeakable astringent knot,

Lost the sigh, and can't even remember a complaint.

Looking at the distant lights, that ball of halo waxes and wanes,

The eyes, like a shallow pool at the bottom of a dry well, are sucked dry by the barrenness again.

I only wonder how my heart was so tender back then?

Yet now it cannot squeeze out a drop of juice;

The golden-tailed love has dried into a dead fish,

No longer paddling, only turning up its grey-white belly.

### Piano Genius Franz Liszt

— You Shanhu

Franz Liszt happened to be a century earlier than Hollywood's big star Robert Taylor. From the age of fifteen until his death at the age of seventy-five, there was never a moment when women did not surround him, flatter him, tempt him, kiss his hand, desire his body, threaten him with suicide, and fight each other to compete for the public lover.

These crazed women cut off his hair and hid it in their hearts and on their chests. They fought to drink the coffee he left over. They collected the oranges and chairs he sat on, because they had been pressed by his immortal buttocks.

Liszt liked this: he was fond of women. His father, Adam Liszt, was originally a steward in a Hungarian family. In order to cultivate his son and make him a standout among men, he was willing to give up his job. When he was dying, he still told his son on his sickbed: women would ruin him. At that time, he was only sixteen years old.

In less than a year, the French Minister of Industry and Commerce returned home after midnight and discovered that his daughter was with this important figure in the living room. The young people said that they had fallen in love while learning music. The father opened the door and kicked him out. After that, Liszt withdrew from social life and lived a monastic life for two years.

As a result, he transformed into Europe's most romantic youth, leading a dengue fever-like social life, revolving between Parisian salons and private residences, sometimes self-deprecating and self-pitying, and sometimes self-respecting.

His first scandal was eloping with Countess d'Agoult. The countess, named Marie, was intelligent, charming, but a bit picky, nicknamed "Six feet of snow on twenty feet of volcanic lava."

The two lived together in Switzerland and Italy for four years and had three children: Blandine, Cosima, and Daniel.

Marie gave up everything for her beloved: money, reputation, status, relatives and friends. She did her best to make him live well and work quietly; but for him it was only for three months. Every time he moved to a new place, he gradually invited guests, filling his house, and mingling with the local first-class high society. Banquets and hunting became his daily tasks. But his wife Marie always stayed at home. Occasionally, he would sneak off to Paris alone, returning home after a month or two. He claimed to be raising money for a charity fund. He ran to Vienna, and from then on, he became famous and became the most famous "piano-virtuoso" (piano virtuoso who plays impromptu without sheet music).

Liszt traveled around Europe for ten years, performing everywhere, and was welcomed everywhere. Art-obsessed students and wildly desperate women flattered him in every way. Medals, gifts, invitations... were constantly sent to him; money flowed like water, and he spent it like water. He disturbed and sensationalized every capital! Lisbon, Saint Petersburg, London, Constantinople.

Every week, he wrote a letter to Marie, describing his success: "I am at the top of this city, especially among the nobility and women... The king is very polite to me... I am the lion of the London season here." At the same time, every week, jealous friends wrote letters to Marie, exposing his recent amorous affairs: actress Planer, Princess Bai Qiaozhuosa, Mrs. Sha Moluo, and Europe's most famous prostitute Luo Limontan.

Marie endured for six years, and finally left in despair, saying that he was a nouveau riche-style "Don Juan" (European lover), a big liar!

Liszt performed everywhere, showing off his unparalleled talent. His long hair, sparkling eyes, large nostrils, and sad expression became the paradigm of contemporary impromptu pianists. He changed a new tie every day, and then wore a large Hungarian shawl, slowly took off the green leather gloves on his hands, and threw them on the ground before officially starting to play.

In Russia, he traveled on a Spanish-style sailboat, with a dining room, bedroom, and kitchen in the boat. In Germany, people pre-arranged a piano at each train station, and when the train arrived, they invited him out to perform.

He would not flatter the dignitaries. He once refused to perform for the French King Louis Philippe, because he was a usurper who stole the throne. He refused Bolivia's Rutilio I, because he had an affair with the famous prostitute Lola Montez; he refused Spain's Queen Isabella, because according to their etiquette, he could not introduce the queen.

This was not excessive arrogance. In that era, musicians were regarded as servants and could only enter the room to perform after the host allowed it, and meals were enjoyed in the kitchen. So with his actions, musicians were able to raise their heads, become proud, and win a noble position in society.

Suddenly, he gave up everything and became a music consultant in Weimar, Germany, with a salary of one thousand yuan a year. He no longer played for money. He conducted the orchestra, composed music, and wanted to establish permanent honor.

Several times, he almost married Princess Wittgenstein. The last time, everything was ready, but the princess suddenly changed her mind. He hid alone, smoking a cigar, and completed the twenty-five volume book: "The External Causes of the Decline of the Church Interior".

Liszt was always a high-class lecher who seduced good women. When he died of pneumonia in a train at the age of seventy-five from a cold, many women were still surrounding him, vying to take care of him. His daughter was so angry that she refused to give him the brandy he had to drink.

In addition to his private life, which was fought over by groups of women, in music history, he completed twelve symphonic poems, "Faust" and "Dante". As for his yearning for "futurist music", it was never completed. This is also a strange genius in the history of music.

### Basketball League A and B Groups: Hua Lian and Zhong Bei Stand Side by Side; Disputes in A and B Groups between Zhong Bei B and Dong Hua; Women's Group Green Team Achieves Perfect Victory Record

The battle schedule for the third Shanghai Basketball League, Groups A and B, and the women's group, has been completed and should have come to an end. Unexpectedly, due to Hua Lian and Zhong Bei each winning one game, the championship could not be produced, and a final battle is still needed. However, due to venue issues (West Qing is no longer available for borrowing), the date and location will be determined by the board of directors. According to Chairman Dai Changling: The two teams tied for the championship in the Shenbao Cup, but it was agreed to compete once again for scholarship funds for the Shenbao authorities. This opportunity can be used to achieve a win-win situation, which the two teams will definitely agree to, and is also to fulfill the previous agreement, so fans can wait for good news. This article reviews Hua Lian's victory over Zhong Bei in the second cycle of Group A, my opinion on the dispute between Zhong Bei B and Dong Hua in Group A and B, and introduces the advantages of the women's champion Green Team, as a general review before the basketball league's Group A and women's group are about to come to a successful conclusion.

### Review of the China United vs. Zhongbei Match

In the first round, Zhongbei defeated China United, which was commented on last week. Their second round rematch took place on Wednesday this week (February 28th) at 5:30 PM at the Xiqing Billiard Hall. Fans, awed by the great reputations of these masters from the North and South and knowing future opportunities would be rare, rushed to secure tickets, fearing they'd miss out. Despite the high ticket prices of 500 to 2000 yuan, the venue was packed, with no space to spare, surpassing the attendance of the first match by half, creating a truly grand spectacle. The weather that day was oppressively hot, intensified by the crowd's energy, causing moisture to drip from the billiard hall's walls, making the court slippery. This was the only flaw in the event.

Before this game, China United's [character unclear] was sick, leading many to worry about China United and predict another Zhongbei victory. However, after the match began, China United immediately found their rhythm. Their chosen lineup and man-marking strategies proved to be key to their success. For instance, replacing Wu Chengzhang with Bert to guard Chen Xuesong was a calculated move based on the weaknesses exposed in the previous game, assigning the right person to the defensive job. This must be attributed to Zhang Xiang's skillful use of strategy. China United's offensive methods were particularly successful, as the man-marking tactic required using screens during attacks. In my review of their first match, I pointed out that both sides used too few screens. This time, China United used this method extensively in their attacks. Zhang Liangxiong and Bert were able to score more points largely because Xi Xilin took the lead in setting screens, creating opportunities for them to penetrate the defense. Additionally, the refereeing was very strict this time, resulting in China United having four players fouled out. However, thanks to their deep bench and Coach Zhang's effective management, they were able to cope throughout the game and secure the victory, which is truly commendable. The reason for Zhongbei's defeat was their defensive strategy, which failed to stop the opponent's screening tactics. Their offensive approach remained stubbornly traditional, which China United recognized and countered effectively, preventing them from scoring easily. Furthermore, the slippery court disadvantaged Zhongbei's taller players, making them more prone to losing balance. The Northern style, known for its fancy techniques, was harder to execute due to the court conditions, which contributed to their failure. Finally, after three players were fouled out, and Shen Yugong was injured and unable to play, Zhongbei was left with only four players, making a comeback impossible. When down to four players, Li Zhenzhong strenuously advocated for focusing on gaining possession rather than trying to reverse the defeat. This showed great insight and leadership. In man-marking tactics and in a match between two evenly matched teams, it's impossible to win against a majority when outnumbered. Therefore, it's better to minimize the point difference to improve the final record. In the end, China United won 39 to 34, avenging their previous loss and making a rematch necessary. The fans were truly treated to a spectacle.

### Dispute Between Zhongbei B and Donghua

Among the teams in Groups A and B, Zhongbei B and Donghua were the strongest, each having defeated strong opponents. When these two teams met, it was like a final match, extremely tense. Donghua held a lead throughout, but unfortunately, in the last eight minutes, with Donghua leading 30 to 22, referee Wang Ji'en made an erroneous call. The fact was that Zhongbei B's Wang Jinghu dribbled deep, and Donghua's Tan Fuzhen forcefully blocked him, resulting in a foul. As the whistle blew, the ball simultaneously went into the basket from Zhongbei B's Shen Yuan's hand. Wang Ji'en ruled that the basket counted, and Tan Fuzhen committed a foul. At that moment, Donghua's captain Jia Youliang questioned the referee, stating that Tan Fuzhen's foul was against Wang Jinghu, but the shooter was Shen Da. Since the foul occurred before the basket, how could the basket be counted? However, Wang Ji'en was determined to stick to his mistake. Eventually, Donghua refused to continue the game, and Wang hastily declared Zhonghua the winner. Later, Donghua appealed to the Basketball Federation's board of directors, but the authorities have yet to make a public announcement. This has left the championship title for Groups A and B unresolved. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the authorities will make an official announcement soon, as the public is deeply concerned about this matter. I have heard that the authorities are preparing to reject Donghua's protest, giving their full reasons. However, I suggest that Zhongbei B agree to a friendly match with Donghua. If Zhongbei B wins, Donghua should accept it calmly. If Zhongbei B loses and Donghua wins, then even if Donghua cannot claim the championship, they can at least vent their frustration. This is a humane approach, but it may not be agreed upon by the authorities or both parties.

### Green Team's Unblemished Record

In the women's division, the Green Team has won all ten of its games, with each victory by a significant margin, demonstrating the team's true ability. The dedication of Qian Xucang and Xie Yiqin is the reason for this excellent result. Since its founding, the Green Team has never lost in round-door ball, volleyball, or basketball. This is enough to make them the envy of any team in Shanghai. Looking back at Shanghai's sporting history, no team has ever achieved this. Here is a brief assessment of the advantages of this women's team:

### Sharp and Unmatched Forwards, Rotating Guards

The Green Team's forwards are generally center Yan Weiwei, right forward Huang Mingyuan, and left forward Rong Feijian. Captain Li Zhi is often on the bench, allowing her to observe key gains and losses alongside Coach Qian. All three forwards have accurate shooting skills. Yan Weiwei relies on her height and never misses when receiving passes from the backcourt. Huang Mingyuan excels at cutting and following up. Rong Shujian, a veteran player, is steady and reliable, and her left-handed layup is almost always successful. Furthermore, the three players' teamwork has reached a point of deep understanding, making them swift and skilled. This has reached the highest level of mastery. The guards are Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Yinlan. Women's defense generally relies on man-marking. However, when the defense is focused on tightly marking the offense, there are always gaps, or when the opponent uses screens, there will be opportunities. The Green Team's three guards effectively use rotating man-marking, based on the above situations. Depending on the positioning and the opponent's tactics, they must switch assignments, saving energy and minimizing gaps. Therefore, the Green Team's three guards are often seen exchanging assignments in tacit understanding, preventing the opposing forwards from attacking.

Finally, I feel that each of these six women has individual weaknesses that should be pointed out, in the hope that they will strive for perfection, not to nitpick. Yan Weiwei often wastes opportunities, Huang Mingyuan sometimes lacks composure, Rong Shujian often commits traveling after getting the ball, Wang Weizhen commits too many unnecessary fouls, Liu Zhenbao lacks speed, and Ren Yinlan is not serious enough. These are all minor points, but if they can be eliminated or improved, they can certainly reach the next level. What do you think, Xucang?

### A Quick Sketch of Miss Wu Zhenxiong, Member of the China Film Women's Basketball Team, on Her Wedding Day

Miss Wu Zhenxiong, daughter of Wu Wenchao, a key figure in the China Film Sports Association, celebrated her wedding day a few days ago (the 2nd). Miss Wu is also a pillar of the China Film Women's Basketball Team.

The groom is said to be an athlete as well. The wedding was held at the Four Sisters Cafe.

Because Wu Wenchao is an active figure in both the sports and film circles, many people from both industries attended, making the event extremely lively.

The wedding ceremony was simple yet solemn. The master of ceremonies was film star Huang He, who had a beautiful voice.

The introducer, Han Langen, gave a speech with his usual humor. He said, "I am a ready-made matchmaker. The reason they invited me is because I have many children, and the bride and groom hope to have many children and grandchildren as well."

Guest Yin Xiucen said in his speech, "The fat man said that the bride and groom hate speakers who talk too much, so I won't say much. I hope that next year on this day, we will be invited to eat red eggs. May their union be as fat as me, Yin Xiucen."

After the wedding ceremony, refreshments were served. The guests requested that the Four Sisters sing. After repeated applause, the eldest sister, Xi Qiuxia, finally went to the microphone and sang the new song "Is It a Dream or Is It Real?" Her crisp and melodious voice satisfied everyone. As Xi's sister's song echoed, I left early, unable to hear the voices of Chen Qi, Zhang Fan, and Chen Juanjuan.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (13)

— Liang Zhao'an

The main purpose of pivoting is to maintain individual ball control and evade the opponent's defense. There are two main methods: (1) Forward pivot. This method is often used when the opponent is tracking from behind and trying to steal the ball. For example, when the opponent is approaching from behind, if they are positioned to the right, lift the right foot and pivot forward to the left or backward. Conversely, if they are positioned to the left, lift the left foot and pivot forward to the right or backward to escape. However, the pivoting foot depends on the position of the feet after stopping. If both feet land simultaneously and balanced, either foot can be lifted. If the feet are staggered and do not land simultaneously, only the front foot can be lifted. The back foot cannot leave its original position, otherwise, it is traveling. (2) Backward pivot. This method is often used when dribbling forward and encountering an opponent blocking the way. After stopping the dribble, if the distance between the player and the defender is less than one yard, to avoid touching the opponent's body and committing a personal foul, only a backward pivot can be used to get away from the opponent, turning one's back to them so they cannot easily steal the ball. When stopping, if both feet land simultaneously, either foot can be lifted and the body can be turned backward to the left or right. If the feet are staggered and do not land simultaneously, only the front foot or the last foot to land can be lifted to pivot. There are more than just these two pivoting methods, but other methods can be adapted from these two. The main purpose of pivoting is to keep one's body between the opponent and the ball being held, to prevent the opponent from stealing it. Those who can properly use various pivoting techniques will be able to adapt to the situation, cleverly break through the opponent's defense, or make various feints and bluffs to deceive the opponent and attack them by surprise.

### Sports Miscellany

The Football League Group A match between Donghua and Chailian is scheduled for today (the 4th) at 10:00 AM at the Race Course. Due to yesterday's rain, it may be postponed again. Hopefully, it will be clear today, so the match can take place.

The Dahua Basketball Team plans to host a women's basketball league on its own court. Judging by the booming development of women's basketball teams in Shanghai, it is expected to be a lively event.

Liu Fushen, formerly a pillar of the South China Basketball Team and now a member of Zhongbei B, has made rapid progress in his skills. Chen Xuesong appreciates Fushen very much. (Da Ke)
