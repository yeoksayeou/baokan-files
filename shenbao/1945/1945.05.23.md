Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese air force units braved adverse weather conditions on the night of the 21st to launch a surprise attack on enemy aircraft at Iwo Jima. Bombs hit the Motoyama airfield, causing large fires in six locations and major explosions in three.

Ryukyu Islands Base, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - There have been no major changes in the war situation in the southern Okinawa Island area. Since the enemy's formal offensive began on the 9th through the 21st, they have continued to use over ten tanks to forcibly advance north of Shuri in the Unadama Forest, Ona, and Asato areas, attempting to break through Japanese defenses. The enemy is encountering heavier-than-expected casualties in the Okinawa Island campaign.

### Tōgō Diplomacy: Four Key Characteristics. Emphasis on Implementation in China Policy

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Tōgō's repeated clarification of fundamental diplomatic policies at the recent conference of ambassadors to China has drawn significant attention from the public. His past experience in negotiations with the Soviet Union has yielded remarkable results, hence the widespread association of Tōgō with diplomacy towards the Soviet Union is not without cause. However, the subsequent steps Tōgō will take are a key focus. The first step of Tōgō's new diplomatic policy was to adapt to the new European situation by announcing the invalidation of the Axis Pact and the abolition of the Anti-Comintern Pact. The next issue is the China problem, which was clearly instructed at the conference of ambassadors to China on the 21st. Some people have questioned Tōgō's policies towards China due to his lack of prior postings there. However, a review of his instructions reveals that he holds extraordinary insight into the China issue. Let us now examine the scope of his instructions. The fundamental principles of Tōgō's China policy are: Firstly, to assist China's unification, independence, and freedom, and to implement equality and mutual benefit in Sino-Japanese relations. This is no different from Shigemitsu's diplomacy. At the same time, the importance of the China problem is characterized by this instruction as "viewed from the overall perspective of war guidance," which is a major characteristic. Regarding the overall aspect of war guidance, it must be discussed at the Supreme War Guidance Conference to determine the overall policy, which is the second characteristic of the instruction. The third is to overcome all obstacles. The slight difference between Tōgō's diplomacy and Shigemitsu's diplomacy lies in its emphasis on implementation, which is consistently praised by knowledgeable figures in diplomacy. To realize the plan, overcoming all obstacles is an indispensable prerequisite. The fourth is that realizing the China policy is a major key to breaking through difficulties. From this, we can understand the main direction of Tōgō's diplomacy.

### Fierce Battle at Tarakan: Japanese Forces Firmly Defend Positions

Southwest Pacific Base, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Tarakan front has become fierce since the 16th. The enemy has been mobilizing flamethrowers to attack daily, but ultimately cannot break through the Japanese front-line defensive positions. Japanese forces are still firmly defending their positions in the northern area of the airfield and the oil field areas. The area occupied by the enemy so far is only one-tenth of the entire island. The enemy is eager to use the airfield and the oil field areas, but due to close-quarters attacks by Japanese forces, construction is impossible and use is even more so.

### Surprise Attack by Japanese Forces on New Guinea Island Throws Enemy into Confusion

Southern Region, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - At Madang, the northwestern tip of New Guinea, Japanese troops have been bravely fighting the enemy since late April. On May 4th, 8th, and 9th, they launched surprise attacks on enemy barracks, throwing the enemy into great confusion. A portion of the enemy forces has already fled to the Twin Islands and is retreating towards the Oma area. The enemy airfield on the Twin Islands seems to have begun operations, but the number of active aircraft is extremely small.

### American Wixon Admits Difficulties in War Against Japan

Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - American War Mobilization Director Wixon submitted the following report to Truman on the 17th regarding the wartime system the United States should adopt after Germany's defeat: It will take a very long time to defeat Japan. We are forewarned that we have not yet encountered the main force of the Japanese army. The Japanese fleet still possesses the strength to inflict severe blows on the U.S. military within the air defense zone of its land bases. Furthermore, the Japanese mainland, Korea, and Manchuria have large reserves of important raw materials, and their arms reserves will be able to continue resisting for at least another year. Moreover, blockading the connection between Japan and the mainland is very difficult, so the starvation strategy to force surrender is also difficult. In the next year, seven million troops must be mobilized, and the entire U.S. fleet must also participate in the battle. Some troops in Europe should be rapidly transferred to the Pacific, but their nature and equipment still need to be trained and improved. To replenish troop losses, the army and navy should continue conscription, as the Pacific War so far has been a preparatory action for the war against Japan.

### Truman Issues a Warning

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Washington dispatch, President Truman issued the following warning to the House of Representatives during the 19th Lend-Lease Act session, stating in brief: The United States and the Allied nations currently fighting Japan have not yet encountered the full strength of the Japanese army. We must be vigilant at all times and in all places against powerful Japanese units that have an advantage in shortening supply lines. We need to do our best to fight Japan.

### U.S. Navy Authorities Call for Accelerated Aircraft Carrier Construction

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The U.S. mobile force in the Pacific region is gradually reducing air strikes due to continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese air force. According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy authorities called on shipyards across the nation on the 20th to dedicate their full efforts to building new aircraft carriers, stating in brief: As the Pacific War gets closer to Japan's important islands, the losses suffered by aircraft carriers become greater, because enemy base air forces are gradually increasing in strength. Although the U.S. Navy currently possesses the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, the shipbuilding industry must still devote all its efforts to building new ships, and those currently under construction must be completed as soon as possible.

### Chiang Kai-shek and Soviet Ambassador Hold Cordial Talks in Chongqing

Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 21st: Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet on the afternoon of the 20th for the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador, Mr. Petrov, and cordially discussed the current international situation with him.

### U.S. Military Establishes New Air Base in Guiyang, Chongqing

### The Truth Behind the Conflict Between Xinjiang Locals and Chongqing-Soviet Troops Last Year

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a New York dispatch: The armed conflict between the people of Xinjiang Province and the Chongqing army since September of last year seems to have subsided recently. The Chongqing authorities have restricted the leakage of information about this incident, so outsiders have not yet obtained the truth. However, because Xinjiang has a special relationship with the Soviet Union, the Chongqing authorities attach great importance to this matter. The New York Times recently published an article titled "The Conflict in Xinjiang Province," stating the following: The situation in Xinjiang Province has been unstable since November 1943, and it has become increasingly dangerous last year. A sudden incident occurred in the Altai region of Xinjiang Province within a few weeks after the Soviet victory in Stalingrad. At that time, Governor Sheng Shicai, who had severed relations with the Soviet Union, led three isolated regiments and a small number of air force units to suppress the incident. Although the Soviet Union did not oppose it, the Mongolian government claimed that Sheng Shicai's air force had bombed Outer Mongolia and lodged a serious protest. In early March 1944, aircraft of the Outer Mongolian air force marked with Soviet symbols indiscriminately bombed Xin Zhangjun in the northern part of the province, and continued bombing for twelve days despite the province's protest. The situation in the province has not improved. Chiang Kai-shek is trying his best to avoid a head-on conflict in order to prevent the situation from escalating, but Yenan has not expressed any attitude towards this.

### Wuhu to Establish Welfare Committee

### Understanding the New Situation

The nearly two-month-long Okinawa Island campaign is becoming increasingly tragic and intense, with the enemy, the Americans, suffering an average of four casualties per minute. At the same time, the differences of opinion between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the San Francisco Conference, as well as the evolution of the Polish problem and the situation in Yugoslavia, are once again revealing contradictions. It turns out that the new development of the international situation after the end of the European War is like this!

After the end of the European War, some people believed that since Japan had lost its European allies, and the enemy, Britain and the United States, could transfer large armies to the East Asian front, the prospects for the Greater East Asia War would be adversely affected. However, the changes in international affairs are not so simple. The aforementioned is just one example. If we conduct a more thorough investigation, we should pay attention to the following points regarding the new international situation after the end of the European War:

The collapse of Germany and Italy means that Japan's allies, who were enemies of the Soviet Union, have disappeared. Therefore, Japan can stand from a new perspective and act freely, announcing the abolition of the treaties and anti-communist agreements signed with Germany and Italy, making the neutral relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union clearer. This may not be a disadvantage for Japanese diplomacy.

After Germany's surrender, Britain and the United States not only lost the uniting factor, but will also face a struggle for hegemony in Europe. The stalemate of the Polish problem and the rise of the Yugoslav situation are manifestations of this. Although these contradictions are unlikely to immediately constitute a conflict, they may evolve into a gradual deterioration of relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

In recent years, Poland and the Balkan countries have all entered the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, and the power of the left wing in the Nordic countries of Finland and Sweden, and in the Western European countries of France and Spain, is also rising daily. Now that the Soviet Union has been liberated from the war, it will inevitably take advantage of the opportunity of Britain and the United States continuing to fight to expand and establish its political power. Therefore, Britain and the United States not only need to retaliate against the Axis countries, but also need to prevent the unlimited expansion of the Soviet Union, and have no choice but to maintain a considerable strength in Europe. In other words, British and American troops are inevitably constrained by the Soviet Union in terms of the situation, and therefore cannot transfer most of their troops to East Asia. This is the most troubling thing for Britain and the United States today.

According to British and American authorities, in this European War, the United States suffered more than 950,000 personnel losses, and the British army suffered more than 1.12 million personnel losses. As for the massive consumption of materials, it is even more conceivable. Now that the British and American forces have to continue to sacrifice tragically, the result is only to give the Soviet Union the opportunity to rest, reorganize, and expand, which has aroused dissatisfaction in the United States and Britain. In order to avoid long-term sacrifices, Britain and the United States are eager to end the war, but if they seek a solution through military means, the deeper they go into the war, the more their sacrifices will increase. This is another difficulty that Britain and the United States are currently facing.

The continued consumption of the enemy, Britain and the United States, in the East Asian theater is beneficial to the Soviet Union; especially during the period when the European political problem has not been resolved, that is, the period when the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union continue to grow, the Soviet Union will inevitably stand outside the East Asian war situation in order to pressure the United States and Britain to make concessions. Assuming that the Soviet Union adopts a non-interventionist attitude, and the United States and Britain can continue to mobilize military forces that are superior to Japan's to fight, then under the inevitable situation of deeper invasion leading to greater sacrifice, it is sufficient to make the comparison of military strength between the two sides change from the superiority of Britain and the United States to a balance, and then to the possibility of becoming Japan's superiority. Furthermore, assuming that the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are never reconciled and continue to increase and expand, it may promote the great unity of the entire Asia to jointly resist the war waged by Britain and the United States.

Here, we should consider what attitude we Chinese should take when the war situation has reached a decisive moment? Everyone knows that Britain and the United States are not only the vanguard of imperialist aggression against us, but also harbor deep-rooted discrimination against us yellow people; therefore, we must eliminate the aggression of Britain and the United States and shatter their sense of racial superiority, so as to create equality and friendship among nations. Now that Japan treats us with equality and mutual benefit, China and Japan should quickly complete full peace and cooperation, strengthen their forces, and jointly destroy Britain and the United States' ambition to dominate East Asia. This world war started because of the Sino-Japanese Incident and will also end with Sino-Japanese peace. This is what we should deeply reflect on.

If the reduction is not completed soon, the disaster is inevitable, which will affect the increase in production. It is heard that the committee yesterday ordered all counties to cooperate in preventing and eliminating locusts in accordance with the provincial measures for governing locusts.

Beiping, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to complete this year's food production increase and protect the healthy growth of plants, the cooperatives of each county in Yanjing Road, together with farmers, enthusiastically launched a locust eradication campaign, and separately formed investigation teams to engage in investigation work.

### Magic Is Useless: Leader of Heretical Sect Killed

Wuxi, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the discovery of the Xiantian Dao bandits in Wuxi, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have repeatedly persuaded them earnestly, with all the kindness and sincerity, but they have never realized their mistake, and internal opinions are also divided. Recently, the so-called Jinguang Dharma sect, led by Jiang Xunbo, who claims to be a member of the Xiantian Dao sect in North China, was discovered. Those who join the sect must be cut with a knife eighty-one times, and the knife will not enter the body each time. Xiang soldiers are mobilized, and tens of thousands of people have joined the sect. The masses are all confused. The authorities sent people to persuade them to stop their activities, but Jiang did not know how to restrain himself and volunteered to come to the city for an experiment. On the 18th of this month, Jiang led dozens of disciples to perform rituals in the northern suburbs, reciting spells to the gods. Then, at a distance of 300 meters, Jiang and all his followers were shot dead. Tens of thousands of spectators applauded and praised the deep belief that heretical religions cannot be trusted.

### France Implements Pressure Tactics; Serious Situation in the Near East; Arab League Interferes in Lebanese-French Disputes

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: The Arab League has formally taken its first intervention measures regarding disputes between Near Eastern countries and France. The League's Chief of General Staff, Asem Bey, issued a statement supporting Syria and Lebanon, stating that world Muslim public opinion supports the current actions of Syria and Lebanon. The Arab League will convene an Arab conference after the conclusion of the San Francisco meeting if necessary. He further stated that Arab nations, unanimously supported by the Muslim world, will forever stand on the side of "freedom and democracy."

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A report from a British correspondent in Cairo states that while the Arab League is actively holding meetings to discuss resolving the Near East issue, the situation between France and Near Eastern countries is becoming increasingly tense. According to a traveling group returning to Cairo yesterday, there were demonstrations in Damascus and Beirut supporting the strong stance taken by the Syrian and Lebanese governments. In particular, in the eastern parts of these areas, there were demonstrations by women. A small bloody riot occurred in Damascus, with seventeen people injured. It is widely believed that the rapid escalation of this situation is due to France suddenly increasing its military presence in the area during talks with Near Eastern governments. The Lebanese government has lodged a protest with the four major powers, arguing that France should not have landed reinforcements in the area without the consent of the Lebanese government. However, France has justified its intrusion into the area on the grounds of strategic, economic (based on agreements granting France economic priority), and cultural development.

### Syria and Lebanon Firmly Reject French Demands

The French public feels that the British government should support the French government's demands, as Britain itself enjoys special status in Egypt, Iraq, and other places. However, the British authorities are about to approve the declaration of freedom and independence for Near Eastern countries proposed by Catroux, intending to support the proposals made by Lebanon and other countries. Currently, Lebanon and Syria have reached a consensus on their response to French demands. The response states: 1. They will never hold talks with France while France uses military force. 2. The proposals made by France seek to destroy their freedom and independence. 3. They will never grant France greater preferential treatment than Britain and the United States.

### Remnants of the European War Affect the Near East

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Amidst the increasingly intense disputes between Tito's government in Yugoslavia and Britain and the United States over the Trieste issue, the remnants of the European war have also affected the Near East, causing friction between Arabs in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq and France. Although Syria and Lebanon declared their independence as republics on September 16, 1941, breaking free from French control, French troops remained stationed in the country. Now, France, under the pretext of troop rotation, has sent new soldiers to Lebanon, exceeding the original number of troops, and has also sent a large number of French officers and generals to infiltrate the area and engage in secret activities, causing dissatisfaction in Lebanon and leading to a stance of resistance against France, although the resistance is passive.

### Iraq Protests Against France

Iraq formally protested against France on the 20th, criticizing the landing of French troops in Lebanon, and also proposed two measures to Near Eastern countries: 1. To resist such forceful actions by France, Arab countries must form a common front. 2. To crush France's policy of the strong preying on the weak and to establish international justice, this issue must be submitted to the San Francisco Conference for fair handling, calling on the Arab nations to unite and resist France. The future of this issue is highly significant.

### Bloody Conflicts Occur in Syria

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to an official statement released last night in Damascus, bloody conflicts occurred in Syria, resulting in eight deaths (including four students) and twenty-five injuries. However, French news sources claim that "three French citizens were killed."

### San Francisco Passes Amendment

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a San Francisco dispatch: An amendment to the "Regional Alliance" agreement in the world security organization was passed yesterday at the world security conference held by the five major powers. The amendment states: "If another country uses force to invade any member of the alliance, this charter will absolutely protect the right of self-defense of the individual or group, unless the Security Council presents good countermeasures to maintain international security. However, any measures taken under this 'right of self-defense' should be immediately reported to the Security Council and should not hinder the Security Council's power and responsibility to use all means to maintain international security at any time."

### Three-Power Conference May Not Materialize

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters, Prime Minister Churchill and President Truman are eager to hold talks with Chairman Stalin to discuss issues such as Poland and Yugoslavia, but Stalin has not responded to their invitation.

### British General Election Expected in Early July

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to London news, Prime Minister Churchill exchanged letters with leaders of various parties over the weekend, so it is generally believed that the "July general election" may be held between July 5th and 11th. Prime Minister Churchill has strongly argued that the British government will continue to exist as long as the Pacific War has not ended, and all parties should consider how to extend the life of the current parliament.

### Tito Proposes South Slavic-Italian Talks

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a Belgrade radio broadcast: General Tito, in order to resolve the issues of Trieste and Istria, proposed that South Slavic countries and Italy hold direct talks before the peace conference.

### Air Traffic Between Moscow and Berlin Resumes

### Welcoming the 40th Navy Day Anniversary

— by Colonel Matsushima, Head of the Navy Press Department, China

First, Introduction

We now welcome the 40th Navy Day anniversary during the most intense stage of the decisive battle. The military achievements of the Japanese Navy over the past forty years, as well as its valiant battles in this sacred war, relying on its prestige and repeatedly achieving merits, are truly deserving of our boundless respect for all our predecessors and the heroic spirits of past battles. This is one of the things for which we are currently most deeply grateful. The Greater East Asia War has entered a truly profound decisive battle stage. The strategic situation centered on Okinawa Island is a major key to the future course of the war. At the same time, the situation in Europe is rapidly affecting the Pacific war situation. At this moment, we can only strengthen the special attack spirit of our 100 million compatriots and rapidly advance the perfect state of destroying the arrogant enemy. The details are categorized and explained below:

Second, The Current Stage of the Decisive Battle in the Pacific

Since the enemy captured Iwo Jima in mid-March of this year, they have aimed to attack Okinawa Island, an important stronghold for attacking the Japanese mainland. They first used mobile units to attack Kyushu, Shikoku, and the Seto Inland Sea, intending to cut off Japanese aircraft from their source and block communication between the Japanese mainland and Okinawa, seeking a swift decision on Okinawa. From the perspective of the Pacific war's progress, or based on the repeated declarations of the enemy's leaders, this could have been foreseen. The enemy is following its planned efforts to acquire bases to encircle the Japanese mainland. As the enemy unexpectedly suffered fierce blows and extremely heavy personnel losses during the attack on Iwo Jima, they were unusually cautious and seemingly well-prepared when attacking Okinawa Island. Under the command of Commander-in-Chief Nimitz, they mobilized the entire Pacific Fleet and even allowed the British fleet, which had previously been incompatible, to join the same operation, forming a joint British-American force, gathering 1,400 ships and six divisions of land forces, attempting to capture Okinawa Island in one fell swoop. The enemy's operational actions began with the enemy's mobile unit attacking southern Kyushu on March 18th and 19th, but the enemy suffered significant damage in that area and temporarily retreated its mobile unit to the southeast, soon receiving new advanced units from the rear to replenish the losses of the front-line mobile unit. From March 23rd onwards, they launched fierce air raids on Okinawa Island. On the 27th, they landed on the Kerama Islands west of the island, attempting to use them as an important base for capturing Okinawa Island. Afterwards, they launched fierce shelling and bombing of Okinawa Island, and finally, on April 1st, landed near Kita-Nakagusuku in the western part of the island with approximately three divisions of troops, and the war situation became tense.

Looking at the situation of our defense formation, on one hand, we concentrated elite army and navy units on the Okinawa side, constructed extremely complete fortifications based on past operational experience, to block the enemy's attacks from land, sea, and air. At the same time, we dispatched strong air force and naval units from the Japanese mainland and other bases, setting up a posture to annihilate the enemy's amphibious forces coming to Okinawa. The US military initially thought that the operation would be easy, but then gradually increased its forces. By early April, it had mobilized three army divisions and two marine divisions, approximately 100,000 troops, and occupied the Okinawa northern and central airfields. It then advanced to the south, intending to seize the key Japanese strongholds and air bases centered on Shuri and Naha, pressing the so-called southern front. A portion of the troops landed near Nago Town in northwestern Okinawa on April 7th, and then landed on Ie Island, a stronghold to its west. They also consolidated the Nakagusuku Bay anchorage, which became a base for their fleet. As a result, the decisive battle between the Japanese and American forces gradually intensified.

At that time, the Japanese army and navy units relied on the solid terrain for defense when the enemy landed, and then, when the opportunity came, launched the first phase of the general offensive from land, sea, and air on April 6th, followed by the second attack on the 12th and the third attack on the 16th. Although the weather was bad during these days, the Japanese army still launched special attacks on the enemy's troop concentrations, inflicting heavy damage on them. By April 18th, they had established a record of sinking or destroying 393 enemy ships. By May 2nd, this number had increased to over 520 enemy ships sunk or destroyed. The purpose of these attacks by the Japanese army was, of course, to destroy the main force of the enemy's mobile units, and secondly, to concentrate attacks on the enemy's battleships, cruisers, etc., which directly supported the landing operations, the enemy's transport convoys, and the enemy's air power at the land bases. The aforementioned war results of the Japanese army were mostly enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, etc., almost all belonging to the core of the enemy's combat units, so the enemy suffered unexpectedly heavy blows. On April 20th, the enemy's main mobile unit, due to excessive damage, retreated to the rear. Only a specially formed aircraft carrier unit was left to handle communication between the two sides. Around the 30th, a mobile unit composed of two enemy fleets, based on about three formal aircraft carriers and two specially formed aircraft carriers, approached the eastern side of Okinawa. However, it was heavily attacked by the Japanese army and disappeared around May 7th, causing a major setback in the enemy's mobile unit's operational support capability. However, at this time, the enemy repeatedly gathered B29-type aircraft from the Mariana Islands and P51-type aircraft from Iwo Jima to destroy the Japanese bases in Kyushu and cut off communication between the Japanese mainland and Okinawa Island, repeatedly carrying out several long-range enemy air raids. On the land front, the enemy forces, consisting of the Army's 10th Corps (four divisions) and the Navy's 1st and 6th Divisions (approximately 100,000 troops), began a fierce offensive around April 16th, intending to reach the southern front, heading straight for Naha on the west coast, Shuri in the center, and Yonabaru on the east coast, continuing the fierce offensive under the support of large tank forces, air force, and naval artillery fire. The enemy has repeatedly stated that the Okinawa front is an unprecedented fierce battle in the Pacific operation, repeatedly praising the skillful preparation of the Japanese army's positions, the formidable power of the Japanese army defending as if it were a fortress, and the great effect of the Japanese army's heavy artillery. The enemy units on the front line were also exhausted by the fierce fighting. Finally, in late April, the enemy's Army's 96th Division of the central unit seemed to have suffered heavy losses and had to dispatch the Navy's 1st Division and the Army's 77th Division, which were operating in the north, to participate in the battlefield in that area, which shows the enemy's hard struggle.

In addition, the enemy's senior officers, who initially tried to remain silent about the special attack spirit of the Japanese air force, were unable to continue to hide it. Finally, the enemy General Nimitz also frankly admitted that no warship could completely defend against the Japanese kamikaze attacks, so once hit, damage was inevitable. The US military has self-reported that its losses up to April 27th totaled 11,470 dead, wounded, and missing. This number, although understated, gives a glimpse of the situation.

Regarding the actions of the British mobile unit fighting alongside the US military, it was announced that the main battleship, HMS King George V, was damaged when the British mobile unit attacked the Sakishima Islands around April 6th, but no further details were released, which suggests that the actions of the British fleet, which had about two battleships and four aircraft carriers, were very lackluster. Therefore, the strategic situation between the Japanese and American forces centered on Okinawa Island in early May was absolutely favorable to the Japanese side. The enemy's landing troops were constantly attacked by the Japanese army, and the enemy's naval forces were repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army, and were gradually destroyed or forced to retreat. The number of enemy ships around Okinawa also decreased sharply, and by around May 7th, it had about five battleships, ten cruisers, thirty destroyers, and sixty transport ships.

Under this kind of situation, the war situation progressed, and the Japanese army had clearly grasped the divine opportunity for victory. The strength or weakness of the front line depended on the supply situation from the rear. The enemy painfully felt the extreme danger of crossing the broad 4,000-mile Pacific Ocean and the expansion of the distance. The Japanese side took advantage of this opportunity to reverse the war situation in one fell swoop.

Third, Overview of Operations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans

The enemy forces in the North Pacific have been inactive for a long time, but as the climate in that area warms up, it is expected that the enemy will attempt to invade Japan's Kuril Islands. As expected, on February 19th, the enemy dispatched some aircraft and ships to attack Shimushu Island and Paramushir Island, but were repelled by the Japanese garrison. The war situation has not developed since then. From the enemy's advertised encirclement of the Japanese mainland, the United States is paying close attention to that area. However, because the focus of the current Pacific operations is concentrated on Okinawa Island, it cannot launch a large-scale attack on that area, and this is only a partial feint.

Next, in the Philippines, the enemy forces have gradually occupied Japanese strongholds, and are currently engaging in land battles in the Baguio and Cagayan Valley areas of Luzon. In Mindanao in the south, the fighting is extremely fierce around Davao. In late April, the enemy mobilized a joint US-British-Australian-Dutch force to attack Tarakan Island on the east coast of Borneo, and fierce fighting is currently underway in that area. In addition, the enemy is conducting sweeping operations along the entire line from the northern coast of New Guinea, New Britain Island, and Bougainville Island in the Japanese South Seas, and local battles are taking place in various places. The Japanese army is bravely fighting in the hot and malarial regions, firmly defending the isolated and unsupported locations, and inflicting heavy blows on the enemy in various regions. In other places, such as Saipan, Tinian, Guam, and Iwo Jima, the remaining Japanese troops are still engaging in guerrilla warfare, causing the enemy to be alarmed and frightened, and venting the immense spirit of the Greater East Asian nations. We express our heartfelt gratitude to these soldiers who are united in spirit and action.

Fourth, The War Situation in the Indian Ocean

The British-Indian and Chinese forces on the Burmese front, with approximately twenty divisions, are gradually approaching the Japanese army's strong positions from the northern mountainous areas. After the Japanese army retreated from Mandalay, the war situation resumed. Fierce fighting continued in the Monywa area from mid-April. In addition, the British-Indian 14th Army is moving south along the Burmese railway line, using the Irrawaddy River for water transport, in coordination with the 15th Army advancing near the coast, attempting to overcome the area near Rangoon, and it seems that they are in fierce fighting in the Rangoon area. At this time, the Indian Ocean Fleet suddenly appeared and shelled the northern and western coasts of Borneo on April 27th. A portion of the forces attacked the Nicobar Islands, all as feints to the operation to attack Rangoon. The enemy's offensive in that area will become increasingly active, and if they have the opportunity, or if they can take advantage, they may launch operations towards the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, mobilizing sea, land, and air forces.

Fifth, The End of the European War and the Pacific War

The European war took an unfavorable turn for the German army this spring. The Soviet army on the eastern front and the joint British-American-Canadian-French forces on the western front advanced extremely rapidly. Finally, on May 2nd, the Soviet army captured Berlin in one fell swoop. The German army suffered heavy casualties. German leader Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, along with General Keitel, died in battle. The European front was in great chaos. At this time, Germany's new President Dönitz inherited the legacy of Führer Hitler and rose up to save the country. Approximately 200,000 German troops defended the southwest border area of Czechoslovakia, continuing the final resistance. However, the German troops on all fronts were exhausted due to difficulties in supply and long-term hard fighting, and surrendered to the enemy. As a result, the European war quickly came to an end. According to a statement released by General Eisenhower's headquarters on May 7th, representatives of the German side signed an unconditional surrender on that day.

Most of Italy had fallen into the hands of British and American forces. Prime Minister Mussolini, who fought to the end, was also arrested near Milan on April 28th along with his staff and executed by the insurgents. The German troops in northern Italy and southern Austria also surrendered to the enemy, and the war situation was completely under the control of the anti-Axis forces. However, we see that the complex relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the strategic situation in Europe, make it impossible for the US military to quickly deploy to the Pacific. Although the enemy, the US military, will quickly replenish its forces in the Pacific in order to end the Pacific war in one fell swoop, we have a great determination and need to be extremely vigilant against the US military coming to the Pacific and the Chinese army and the British and American forces attempting to launch a counter-offensive on the Chinese mainland.

Sixth, Conclusion

In short, the world war situation has taken a sharp turn. Japan has lost its two allied countries, Germany and Italy, and is facing the strength of the United States and Britain in the Pacific to determine the outcome. The fate of victory or defeat has become hundreds of times more important. At this critical moment, Japan resolutely bears the sacred teachings, to annihilate the arrogant enemy, the United States and Britain. Under the banner of a total attack by 100 million people, we are showing the world our blood and justice. Although the enemy army is powerful, the Japanese army still holds important strategies and favorable situations, and the fierce fighting spirit of 100 million special attack forces. We shoulder the imperishable group of the Empire, holding the great spirit of eternal glory, and at the same time, the authorities take appropriate measures externally, which will inevitably lead to a war situation that is favorable to Japan, which we firmly believe.

Now, under this intense decisive battle, we welcome the 40th Japanese Navy Day anniversary. Recalling the spirit of our predecessors who fought bravely at that time, we firmly believe that the tireless efforts of the Japanese Navy over the past forty years are realized today. We must work even harder to build a permanently indestructible pyramid for the East Asian nations that will be deeply engraved in history. The spirits of the imperial ancestors and the heroic spirits of tens of thousands of war dead are soaring in the sky. We will resolutely move forward, with ghosts and gods clearing the way, and our army, even if it is tens of thousands strong, will resolutely advance bravely.

### Negotiations with the Jiangsu Provincial Authorities: The Implementation of Agricultural Loans; A Record of the Visit to Jiangsu by Consulting Committee Member Chen Binhe

The Shanghai Municipal Consulting Committee proposed the establishment of agricultural loans in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province. The Agricultural Loan Syndicate was established on the 20th of this month. However, certain implementation issues need to be discussed with the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Therefore, the Consulting Committee dispatched Committee Member Chen Binhe to Suzhou to consult with Provincial Governor Ren. He departed for Suzhou by the early train yesterday and returned to Shanghai in the afternoon. A reporter from the Central News Agency immediately visited Mr. Chen to inquire about the progress of the negotiations, and he reported as follows:

Since Provincial Governor Ren took office last November, he has implemented many reforms in provincial administration. Although originally from Suzhou, I have not returned to my hometown for over a decade and have long desired to visit Suzhou. This time, due to the agricultural loan matter, it was necessary to negotiate with the provincial authorities. Upon the order of Chairman Li Sihao of the Consulting Committee, I made a special trip to Suzhou to meet with Provincial Governor Ren. The results of the talks can be summarized as follows:

Shanghai and Jiangsu Province Share a Close Relationship

The Jiangsu Provincial authorities have always prioritized stabilizing people's livelihoods and increasing agricultural production as key policy focuses. The provincial government's implementation of in-kind tax collection last year and Shanghai's initiative to launch agricultural loan programs align with the province's policy priorities, for which the province expressed its extreme welcome. Shanghai and Jiangsu share a close relationship in regional economics. The success of this agricultural loan will further promote a close relationship. Therefore, the provincial authorities expressed admiration and gratitude for the concern and cooperation of Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and leaders from industry and commerce, especially the financial sector.

Provincial Government Forms a Committee to Prepare Implementation Plan

After the provincial government accepted the agricultural loan proposal, it treated the practical handling of the matter with great seriousness. After receiving the news of Shanghai's agricultural loan initiative, it dispatched Finance Director Pei, Construction Director Sun, and Liaison Director Jin on May 16 to Shanghai for multiple discussions with various parties. Currently, the provincial government has organized an Agricultural Loan Committee to handle the matter, with Provincial Governor Ren serving as the chairman. They are preparing all implementation plans, with Liaison Director Jin Dazuo and experts from his department providing enthusiastic assistance.

The Farming Season is Imminent; Hoping to Raise Funds Quickly

The farming season is fast approaching, and Jiangsu Province hopes to raise the full amount of 5 billion yuan for agricultural loans by early June, in order to implement the lending plan. Delaying the fundraising efforts would be a case of twice the effort for half the result. The agricultural loans are primarily intended to directly benefit farmers, preventing manipulation and exploitation by intermediaries.

Selecting Funds, Purchasing Rice, and Transporting to Shanghai; The Provincial Government Will Fully Facilitate

The Jiangsu Provincial authorities are extremely concerned about the food supply in Shanghai. When Mayor Zhou first took office, they expressed their willingness to cooperate. With this agricultural loan program, the repayment of principal and interest will be used by the grain control agencies to purchase rice and transport it to Shanghai, addressing the food needs of the people. The provincial government will certainly provide assistance and facilitate this effort to the fullest extent. (When discussing the issue of assisting Shanghai's food supply, Provincial Governor Ren expressed an extremely responsible and affirmative attitude.)

Provincial Governor Ren will personally visit Shanghai in the near future to express his gratitude for the cooperation of the municipal authorities and all sectors of society.

Furthermore, when I went to Suzhou, I carried a formal letter from Chairman Li of the Consulting Committee to Provincial Governor Ren of Jiangsu Province, which is transcribed below along with the reply from the Jiangsu Provincial authorities:

Letter from the Consulting Committee to the Jiangsu Provincial Government

Respectfully,

We, the members of this committee, are aware that the Shanghai's food problem is closely related to the increased grain production in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province. The resolution of Shanghai's food problem depends on the increased grain production in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, and the anticipation of increased grain production must begin with relieving the economic suffering of farmers. Based on this understanding, we have proposed the implementation of rural loans in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, which was approved at the 14th committee meeting on April 16, and a subcommittee was established to promote it. After three discussions, it was decided to organize an Agricultural Loan Syndicate Committee, with nine committee members elected. Sihao was nominated as the chairman, responsible for raising the total amount of 5 million yuan in agricultural loans. Given that the farming season is approaching and farmers are in dire need of funds, we are making every effort to implement the loan program in the shortest possible time. In order to achieve close cooperation with your provincial government for the implementation of the loan program, we have entrusted your provincial government with full authority to handle it. However, to effectively benefit the people of Shanghai, when the new grain is harvested, we ask you to assist with how to use the principal and interest from the agricultural loan repayments to purchase grain and transport it to Shanghai, thus regulating the food supply. We respectfully submit this letter and hope for your review and reply.

Sincerely,

Li Sihao, Chairman of the Current Affairs Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Consulting Committee. (May 21)

Reply from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the Consulting Committee

Respectfully replying: We have received and carefully reviewed your letter. We are deeply grateful for Shanghai's agricultural loan initiative, which will assist in increasing agricultural production in Jiangsu Province. Regarding the request that the Jiangsu Provincial Government assist with using the principal and interest from the agricultural loans to purchase rice for Shanghai through the grain control agencies to regulate the food supply, the Jiangsu Provincial Government will certainly facilitate this matter to the fullest extent to fulfill the noble intentions of your Consulting Committee in planning for the people of Shanghai.

Sincerely,

Ren Yuandao, Provincial Governor of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. (May 22)

At this point, the discussion of the agricultural loan issue came to an end. Mr. Chen added that he also discussed Jiangsu's construction issues with Provincial Governor Ren and was very willing to relay them to the reporter, but due to the lateness of the hour, he promised to arrange a follow-up conversation tomorrow.

### Oath-Taking Ceremony for Baojia Personnel in the Three Districts of Southern Shanghai; Committee Chairman Luo Attends and Addresses the Gathering

The Baojia personnel from the three districts of Southern Shanghai – Yimiao, Penglai, and Xieqiao – held a joint supplementary oath-taking ceremony at Penglai Square at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd). At the same time, the first graduation ceremony of the Baojia Cadre Training Class was held. Secretary-General Luo of the municipal government attended and addressed the gathering in his capacity as Chairman of the Municipal Baojia Committee. Director Gu of the Baojia Office, who also serves as Director of the Southern District Office, personally presided over the ceremony, which was simple yet grand. Details are as follows:

Oath-Taking Ceremony

Those present included Committee Chairman Luo, Director Gu of the Baojia Office, Director Da of the Chuanma Office, directors of various district offices, representatives from various departments of the Municipal Police Bureau, Chief Noguchi of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters, chiefs of various sections of the headquarters, police chiefs of the Yimiao, Penglai, and Xieqiao districts, the captain of the Japanese Military Police in Southern Shanghai, and over five hundred people, including the chairmen and chief liaison chiefs of the eighteen Baojia districts in the city. The ceremony began with a review of the cadre training class and the model white-shirt corps members from the three Baojia districts, presided over by Committee Chairman Luo and accompanied by Director Gu. This was followed by a march-past. After the march-past, a joint supplementary substantive oath-taking ceremony and the cadre training graduation ceremony were held. After everyone performed a ritual of obeisance, Deputy Director Xiao Gang of the Southern District Office of the Baojia Office gave a report, and then the oath-taking ceremony was held, supervised by Director Gu, who also issued certificates and awards. Committee Chairman Luo and Director Gu of the Baojia Office then gave successive addresses, offering much encouragement. Guests were then invited to speak. The captain of the Military Police in Southern Shanghai briefly stated: "In the past, the Baojia in Southern Shanghai provided much assistance in maintaining local order. In the future, they must continue to work hard, especially to cooperate fully in the current situation of the Greater East Asia War." Chairman Chen Fukang of the Taishan District, representing the Baojia districts of the city, briefly stated: "I hope to work hard and live up to the Baojia's mission." Telegrams of respect from Acting Chairman Chen of Shanghai, the director of the Police Bureau, and Secretary-General Luo, who also serves as committee chairman, were then read aloud. Finally, a representative of the chief liaison chiefs of the three Baojia districts gave a speech of thanks, and the ceremony concluded.

Chairman Luo's Address

Chairman Luo said in his address: "I am attending today's graduation ceremony of the cadre training class and the joint inauguration of Baojia personnel from Yimiao, Penglai, and Xieqiao districts in my capacity as Chairman of the Municipal Baojia Committee. At the same time, I am holding an inspection. I am very pleased to be able to speak with all the comrades participating in the actual work. Southern Shanghai is an important area of Shanghai. Before the [war] incident, it was quite prosperous in terms of culture and commerce. The Baojia system has been implemented in various parts of Shanghai for many years. Not only have past achievements been good, but local security has also been relatively stable, and local construction has gradually improved. I am deeply gratified. I also worked in Southern Shanghai for five years, presiding over the Central Tax Police Regiment and the Tax Police School, so I am quite familiar with the situation in Southern Shanghai. Now, the Baojia in Southern Shanghai, through the efforts of Director Gu and all of you comrades, has been formally established as a legitimate institution, and personnel have also been adjusted. I firmly believe that there will be unlimited development and solid consolidation in the future. All of you have professions, fulfill your local obligations, work with enthusiasm, do not forget the responsibilities of the people themselves, and lay the foundation for self-governance and defense. And use this foundation to exert strength, to assume major missions, to serve the country and the nation. At the same time, the Baojia is a bridge between the state and the people, to convey the situation upwards and downwards. The opinions of the people should be put forward to the government. Those of you who are engaged in real practical work should also be models for the people, abide by the law, become model good citizens, and work hard in society to shoulder the important task of national revival. My ambition in working in Shanghai has always been to modernize China and make Shanghai Chinese, to create a modern China, to make Shanghai a purely Chinese city, and to eliminate all malformed phenomena. All of you have a long history in Southern Shanghai and should work together to restore and revive it. At the same time, you are all very clear about the current situation. In this tense situation, we should work harder, not give up our responsibilities, and jointly assume responsibility. Finally, I wish you all a boundless future."

Director Gu's Address

The Director of the Baojia Office stated in his address: "The Baojia has made considerable progress, especially since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo arrived in Shanghai. Looking back, all aspects of Shanghai have indeed progressed a great deal. Thanks to everyone's efforts and hard work, the Baojia has achieved today's results. Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, they have put in the greatest effort to administer Shanghai and maintain local order. Therefore, we must first clearly identify our loyalty to and protection of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, and actively serve the public interest of the local area with a selfless spirit. Today, in my capacity as the concurrent director of the Southern District, I am speaking to you. Since you have an organization and training, support the government's policies, and work together under the leadership of Mayor Zhou, work hard in your respective positions, and constantly examine and correct your shortcomings, strive to make the people happy, trust us, and seek progress."

### Household Flour Rationing Will Be Distributed This Month

The Flour and Wheat Association Shanghai District Rationing Office, in order to supplement the lack of food for the people, continues to find ways to maintain the household flour rationing program, despite many difficulties. In the past few months, flour was rationed three times a month, and the rationing price was kept low, unwilling to raise it easily. In the past two months, however, the amount of wheat purchased has gradually decreased, and the price of wheat has gradually risen to the same level as rice. The production of flour is low and the cost is heavy. After several consultations, it was decided to maintain the livelihood of the average common people, and the number of rationing times was changed to once a month. The price of flour was increased threefold starting in April. According to reports from the reporter, the April household flour rationing has been completed, and the May household flour rationing is in preparation and is expected to continue to be distributed by the end of this month, with the price remaining the same. The amount per person is still one jin. Rationing for various honored and special people is also in the planning stage.

### County Administration Office Rectifies County Police Discipline; Orders Compliance with Various Regulations and Orders

Since its establishment, the Municipal County Administration Office has followed the instructions of its superiors and strived to strengthen the police discipline of the police in the counties under its jurisdiction, as well as the implementation of police administration, in order to establish a model police style. The office has now formulated more than ten measures to rectify the police discipline in each county for the convenience of implementation, based on the matters agreed upon at the police administration symposium on April 20 of this year. These measures have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and filing, and the office has issued orders to its subordinates to strictly and conscientiously comply with them from now on. At the same time, in order to understand whether the people's suffering can actually be reduced after the promulgation of this measure, and whether the police in each county are superficially compliant and secretly defiant, the office has decided to secretly dispatch cadres to each county to conduct investigations at any time, in order to achieve the goal of eliminating abuses and purifying the atmosphere. The measures to rectify the police discipline in each county are summarized below:

The Shanghai Special Municipality County Administration Office (hereinafter referred to as this office) has formulated these measures in order to correct the bad behavior of the police in the counties under its jurisdiction, and to severely crack down on acts that disturb and harm the people, so as to grasp the hearts of the people and establish a model police discipline under the wartime system.

County police officers should be loyal to their duties and must not be perfunctory, compromise with the environment.

County police officers should be committed to sacrificing for the sake of the local area, not yielding to intimidation, not being tempted by profit, and especially should love the people and relieve their suffering at any time.

The heads of the police bureaus in each county should self-examine and self-discipline, be role models for their subordinates, and strengthen the lower-level cadres at any time to share the responsibility of rectification.

The heads of the police bureaus in each county should pay attention to the etiquette, clothing, and spirit of the police officers under their jurisdiction at any time, and should especially review and reform whether the handling of incidents is prompt and legal. The following situations should be severely cracked down on and absolutely not allowed to exist.

Forming cliques for private gain and seizing everything.

Colluding with bandits to harm the local area.

Fattening on the people and oppressing the good people.

Extorting supplies from the local area.

Extorting the people under the guise of official duties.

Any county police officer who violates the provisions of the preceding article shall be dismissed or detained by the competent officer, and if criminal offences are involved, the matter shall be reported to the superior authorities and transferred to the judicial organs or the Shanghai branch of the Special Court for strict handling in accordance with the law.

If the head of the police bureau or the competent person in each county knows about the illegal acts of dereliction of duty of the police officers but does not report them, or hopes to shield them, once discovered and verified, the competent person shall be punished as an accomplice, and those who fail to supervise strictly shall also be held jointly responsible.

The police bureaus in each county shall personally or send personnel to investigate the work of the police officers under their jurisdiction, and shall urge them to achieve the goal of eliminating abuses and purifying the atmosphere.

In addition to accepting fair advice from the public, the police bureaus in each county shall reform police affairs at any time, and shall set up suggestion boxes in appropriate locations to accept the opinions of the people, the implementation of which shall be formulated by each police bureau and reported to this office for approval.

### Establishing the Eternal Monument of the Fazang Lecture Temple

Since the winter of the thirty-first year [of the Republic, 1942], Fazang Temple has spared no effort in rebuilding the Pure Land Taoist site and rectifying the doctrinal style. Now, in order to publicly announce that this temple will forever be a forest of the ten directions, Master Xingci has personally formulated nine articles of the Eternal Rules and Regulations, and has personally drawn and engraved them on stone, so as to preserve them forever. On May 26, the Eternal Monument will be erected in the Great Hall of this temple. From now on, all those who preside over this temple should follow the outline of the rules and regulations in their approach to propagating the Dharma and in their legislative actions.

### The Inscription on the Eternal Monument of the Fazang Lecture Temple

Fazang Lecture Temple was founded by me, in order to uphold the wish of the Buddha to guide all sentient beings, specializing in the Pure Land Dharma Door as the correct practice. I also lament the decline of the Dharma path, and think of propagating the teachings of the Tiantai school, so that all may open the Buddha's knowledge and vision as an auxiliary practice, hence the name. The temple was built in the spring of the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], and the east house and west building were completed in the autumn. After several years, the Maitreya Grand Hall was completed in succession, and after several renovations, it has its current appearance. Since I founded this Taoist site, leading the people in reciting the Buddha's name and lecturing on the teachings, for twenty years, I am deeply grateful for the pressure of circumstances, and the Dharma affinity is growing day by day. Only remembering that I am old, the task of revitalizing the industry and maintaining success awaits those who come after me. In this late age, temples lack regulations, so I have to plan for the future in order to maintain it for a long time. Therefore, I have listed the main points, handwritten them and engraved them on stone, so that those who preside over this temple in the future will have something to follow in their actions and legislation. May all my disciples follow this guidance, and may all virtuous people of the ten directions witness this sincerity.

1. This temple will forever be a forest of the ten directions.

2. This temple takes the practice of the Pure Land Dharma Door and the promotion of the Tiantai teachings as its doctrinal style. Those who live together must truly practice and study hard, and expect to achieve this.

3. The abbot of this temple is chosen from the ten directions. The abbot is elected by the leaders and those with virtue, prestige, and talent inside and outside the temple to preside over the temple affairs. The term of office is five years, and they may be re-elected consecutively.

4. The heads of the classes and the stewards of this temple are appointed by the abbot. All appointments are based on merit and talent. Those who are heads of classes must have cultivation and practice, and understand the teachings. Those who are stewards must be proficient in current affairs and be impartial and selfless.

5. No one may arbitrarily sell or change the temple property. If it is necessary for the benefit of the temple, the abbot may convene the stewards to discuss and decide.

6. The temple's finances are open. The usual expenses are divided into Dharma propagation and administration. All expenses must be based on the budget, and frugality is the main principle.

7. The temple's documents must be carefully preserved. The inner Buddhist scriptures and are especially cherished and provided for circulation and study.

8. As this temple is a Pure Land site, benefactors who come to the temple to cultivate blessings must not engage in wine, gambling, or other practices that defile the Pure Land.

9. If the abbot or any member of the congregation is unworthy and violates these key points, they may be impeached and moved out. Winter month of the thirty-third year of the Republic of China [1944]. Tiantai Mountain Shilong Bhikkhu Xingci Dan. Xiao Tuo of Mount Yue inscribed the plaque.

### The Authorities Continue to Investigate Goods Exceeding Price Limits; Those Found Guilty Will Be Severely Punished According to Law

Recently, prices in this city have risen again due to the instigation of unscrupulous merchants, threatening the people's livelihood. It is understood that the economic police authorities, in order to completely suppress prices, previously joined with the military police to form an investigation team, which was dispatched to commercial markets, companies, and firms in all districts of the city to conduct strict investigations. Those who are found to be exceeding price limits and engaging in black market trading will be punished. More than 3,000 illegal shops have been punished, and active and thorough investigations are still underway. All eleven major commodities must be sold in accordance with the price limits reviewed and approved by the Commodities Evaluation Committee. Other commodities must also be sold in strict accordance with the prices agreed upon by the respective industry associations and approved by the authorities. If anyone is found to be exceeding the price limits or engaging in black market trading, they will be severely punished according to law. Citizens are encouraged to report such cases in order to curb the evil trend of raising prices at will and to maintain the people's livelihood.

### Second Phase of Gold Certificates Issued; Today is the Last Day

The second phase of gold certificates issued by the Central Reserve Bank is listed at 130,000 yuan per tael. After the continued issuance began on the 21st, people from all sectors of finance and citizens went to purchase them enthusiastically. It is now understood that today (the 23rd) is the last day of the second phase of issuance. After the deadline, the certificate stubs for the amount of gold certificates sold in the three days and the gold reserves to be paid will be submitted to the Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Committee for inspection and safekeeping tomorrow (the 24th) in order to begin payment on June 22.

Commercial Banks Adopt Subsidiary Ledgers

According to sources in the banking industry in this city yesterday, major commercial banks have recently adopted a subsidiary ledger system to prevent accidents. All accounts of correspondent clients are retained as copies. In addition to the head office, branch offices in this city also have special subsidiary ledger sections. This measure is a necessary procedure during an emergency period to provide greater security for customer deposits.

Silver and Money Instruments Exchanged Every Other Day

The exchange of instruments between the silver and money industries in this city was originally scheduled to be completed on the same day. However, it has been felt that the large number of instruments, the mixed collection and disbursement of silver, and the crowded market exchange have doubled the difficulties for the industry. In order to alleviate the difficulties between colleagues, the two associations of the two industries and the person in charge of the Money Clearing House are actively planning for the exchange of instruments every other day. According to sources in the financial industry, the implementation of this every-other-day exchange method will greatly benefit the industry, and the difference in the exchange amount can also be reduced as a result. However, whether the customer service side will experience difficulties due to the every-other-day exchange is also being considered in negotiations. It will be implemented as soon as a decision is made.

### Supervisory Office Holds Farewell Banquet for Outgoing Director and Welcomes New Director

Colleagues at the office held a farewell banquet for Director Guo and a welcome banquet for Director Zhan at the Xinhua Restaurant last night. Deputy Director Er Gong delivered a welcome speech, followed by speeches from Director Guo and Director Zhan, respectively, expressing much encouragement and gratitude. The atmosphere was very harmonious.

### Embezzlement of Rice for Police Officers Under Strict Investigation

In order to show consideration for the lives of police officers, the Municipal Police Bureau has been distributing rice to each officer free of charge since February of this year, ranging from 2.5 dou to 6 dou per month. It has recently been heard that some branches and teams have been embezzling part of the rice and privately distributing it. Police Chief Zhou was furious upon hearing this report and immediately ordered the First Supervisory Office to investigate thoroughly and ordered all subordinates that if such incidents are found to occur in the future, they will be severely punished.
