### Soviet Sailors Rescued Express Gratitude for Japanese Hospitality

Sapporo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 13th of this month, the Soviet freighter "Transbalt" (10,000 tons) was attacked by a U.S. submarine near Sakhalin while returning to Vladivostok. Ninety-four crew members were rescued by the Japanese navy and accommodated in a hotel in Honto-cho on the west coast of Sakhalin. The crew members were extremely grateful for the rescue. When the rescued survivors arrived in Honto-cho, still in the evening light, they embraced each other with extreme excitement. Of the 94 rescued crew members, five are still missing and presumed dead. Among the rescued, there were five female crew members. None of them were injured and all are in good health. They are residing in a local hotel and are very grateful for the protection provided by the Japanese side. When local reporters visited, they repeatedly expressed their gratitude. Captain Gabalilov, representing the entire crew, told reporters: "Since our rescue, we have received the utmost hospitality from Japanese officials. We can only express our gratitude."

### Chongqing Army's General Counteroffensive Still in Preparation

Central News Agency report – Chongqing military authorities have recently claimed that the situation for a general counteroffensive has reached a certain stage and stated that a general counteroffensive has been launched on the entire front. However, the actual military situation of the Chongqing army has not improved as much as Chongqing had anticipated. Judged from an objective perspective, it has not yet emerged from the stage of a local counteroffensive. In recent days, Chongqing has been reorganizing its military arrangements in various aspects. However, its troop deployment still places the Central clique's direct line troops in Kunming, Chongqing, and the Shaanxi area surrounded by the CCP. Previously, only miscellaneous troops or peripheral troops were dispatched. However, the war zone south of the Yangtze River facing the Japanese army has undergone a change in the division of war zones, and the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army was established, with He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief. The Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan regions under its command were divided into four army groups, incorporating and reorganizing the remnants of the Hunan and Guangxi campaigns from last year to this spring. In addition, they are looking forward to using the Stilwell Road for supplies and are eager for American-style equipment. It is said that military arrangements for more than ten divisions have been completed, which is the general counteroffensive boasted by Chongqing. However, the Japanese army suddenly launched offensive operations in northern Henan and southern Jiangxi, causing the Chongqing field armies in those two regions to suffer heavy blows. In northern Henan, the Japanese army is around Xushi, and in southern Jiangxi, they are deep in the Longnan, Dingnan, and Qiannan, the so-called "Three Southern Regions." After several days of fighting, they have been completely captured. Although it is unknown how the Japanese army will advance in these two regions in the future, the Japanese army's preemptive offensive has achieved its purpose. From this operation, it can also be seen that Chongqing's general counteroffensive posture is extremely fragile and still in its initial stage. According to the American famous military commentator Swinger in a recently published magazine, "Chongqing's military operations have not yet reached the stage of a counteroffensive." Moreover, Chongqing's deployment of the Central clique's direct line troops in the rear is to avoid direct and strong pressure from the Japanese army, and the dispatch of miscellaneous troops and peripheral troops to the front lines is an attempt to eliminate them naturally. This intention is not difficult to imagine. Currently, Chongqing is striving to strengthen its combat readiness for a counteroffensive, which cannot be denied. However, the military activities on each front today are still limited to local actions.

### Chief of Military Police Chen Visits Wuhu

Wuhu, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – Chen [name missing], Chief of the Central Military Police, arrived in Wuhu by car from Nanjing in recent days to inspect the duties of the military police stationed in Wuhu and the general military and political situation in the area.

### Nanjing Attacked by Air Yesterday

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – At 2:05 AM and 4:17 AM on the 21st, an enemy aircraft twice intruded into the airspace over Nanjing. Under the intense anti-aircraft fire from the ground, it hastily fled to the southeast.

### Increased Production of Native Cloth in Various Regions; Shipped to Shanghai for Sale

After the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, various regions, considering clothing as essential, have successively developed the handicraft industry of spinning native yarn and weaving native cloth to achieve self-sufficiency. The surplus production is also supplied to the market. According to industrial sources, the cloth woven by factories in Shanghai is becoming increasingly expensive due to the high cost of raw materials. The purchasing power of the citizens is very weak. Therefore, in recent times, merchants from various regions have gradually improved the wooden looms for making native yarn and native cloth products. The spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing have also improved slightly compared to before. The designs, colors, and quality are gradually becoming excellent, and the production volume is increasing frequently. They are shipping these products to Shanghai in large quantities to be sold separately in the market. Because of the low price, citizens are mostly purchasing them for clothing. The breadth of sales has broken previous records. It is also learned that the native cloth manufacturing industry in various regions is booming, and the amount of dyes shipped from Shanghai to other places is increasing daily.

Nenendo Hirokichi Appointed Counselor to China

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – Nenendo Hirokichi, Chief of the Accounting Section of the Minister's Secretariat of the Greater East Asia Ministry, has been transferred to the position of Counselor to the Embassy of the Republic of China and was officially appointed on the 20th.

Shandong Abolishes Four County Governments

Jinan, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Shandong Provincial Government has abolished the county governments of Linqu, Rizhao, Zhucheng, and Juxian and replaced them with offices to save expenses.

U.S. Army Air Conference Held in Washington

### The Enemy's U.S. Strategy Fails in Okinawa Operation; Military Commentator Discusses the International Situation

A certain military commentator recently made the following remarks regarding the Okinawa battle situation and the international situation:

Enemy's Military Strategy Fails in Okinawa

The enemy air force attacking Okinawa has very few aircraft and shows no activity. The Japanese special attack force continues its fierce attacks on enemy warships, cruisers, and destroyers escorting ground troops concentrated from the southern region. The Japanese army has obtained a strong southern air base and continues its fierce and strong battles. Regarding the enemy's strategic failure in Okinawa, enemy military commentator Hanson Baldwin severely criticized it, and Laurence also criticized Nimitz. Since the battles of Makiminato, Kadena, and Gushikawa began, it has been three months. Now, reaching the Makabe Line, it is fourteen kilometers north to south, with a daily advance of only 175 meters. From the capture of Makiminato through Kadena to [Mak]abe, it is seven kilometers, with an enemy force of 80,000 (all six divisions).

Buckner Discusses Operational Difficulties

Before Lieutenant General Buckner died, he met with reporters at headquarters and criticized the difficulties in the Okinawa Island operation, saying: "The Japanese defense line in the Shuri area is the strongest stronghold the U.S. military has encountered in the Pacific, second only to Iwo Jima. The U.S. military is also facing difficulties due to heavy rain, which makes it difficult for mechanical units to maneuver, and is engaged in a bitter struggle." The U.S. military used coral reefs and initial offensive-defensive tactics on the southern coast of Okinawa Island, so there were fewer landing operations on Okinawa Island to maintain a mechanically advantageous position, thus concentrating on one battle line. The enemy initially attempted to land at Minatogawa in southern Okinawa, but failed several times. Later, the 1st and 6th Marine Regiments were ineffective, so they joined the army units going south. Therefore, American commentators have harshly criticized this operation: The U.S. military's failure is due to concentrating its forces on one battle line.

Enemy/U.S. Losses are Doubled

The Japanese army in Shuri inflicted considerable losses on the enemy. The main reason is that Lieutenant General Buckner told reporters: "If the U.S. military could use all landing forces on Okinawa Island, the navy and roads for landing would be extremely crowded. At the same time, because the number of troops would be doubled, the U.S. military could constantly pressure the Japanese army. As a result, the losses suffered by the U.S. military would also be doubled." The U.S. military's failure is because it used a one-sided attack, which caused the ground troops to suffer 80,000 casualties over a long period of ten days. The British and American mechanical units were exposed to Japanese special attack units all day long and were subjected to fierce attacks. Therefore, Hanson Baldwin criticizes that the enemy's losses are estimated to be at least 340,000 or more. Laurence's criticism is also very appropriate. On other Pacific battle lines, such as Luzon, Borneo, and New Guinea, the Japanese army is still engaged in fierce battles and inflicting considerable losses on the enemy.

Harvest of San Francisco Conference

Internationally, the San Francisco Conference, which began on April 25th and lasted for two months, created a legalistic world security organization and closed on June 23rd. Before the conference, it was promoted with all possible means, but the result was only a treaty. Its value in the world remains to be proven by history. According to recent San Francisco broadcasts, there is agreement on the trusteeship system, the declaration of the purpose of dependent peoples, and the objectives and concepts of the United Nations in and out of the scope of trusteeship. After the First World War, the issue of trusteeship also became a problem. Even if the conference comes to an end, whether it can actually be resolved remains a question. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 19th, Truman traveled by plane from Washington to the West Coast on the 19th to attend the closing of the San Francisco Conference on the 23rd, but it is rumored that the conference will be postponed again. Song Ziwen, who participated in the conference on behalf of Chongqing, returned to Chongqing by special plane on the morning of the 20th with 13 staff members, including Jiang Menglin.

It is also reported that the U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, and the Supreme Commander, Wedemeyer, jointly declared: "The rumors that we and our colleagues have conflicting opinions in both public and private matters are completely unfounded. Although our opinions may differ, they can always be resolved satisfactorily. U.S. diplomatic personnel and military representatives in Chongqing currently have no differences of opinion and are working hard, and we expect this to continue in the future." From this statement, we can see their animosity. According to a United Press dispatch on the 20th, the Soviet Union broadcasted on the 20th, slandering the Chongqing Kuomintang's undemocratic dictatorship.

Soviet Trends Deserve Attention

Looking ahead to the world, the San Francisco Conference, which was widely publicized, has come to an end. The issues of Poland and Central Asia and Lebanon have also ended. However, this is only a temporary end and cannot be said to be a real solution. The future direction of the Soviet Union deserves considerable attention in the world situation. The Three Great Powers will meet sometime in early July after Churchill's defeat at the polls, near Berlin. What attitude Stalin will take at that time is a matter of great interest.

U.S. Military Has No Practical Action

On the one hand, the Pacific Theater is suffering from the failure of the U.S. military in Okinawa, and the morale of the U.S. military is low. The fighting spirit against Japan is only verbal and there is no practical action. Admiral Nimitz organization of the Western Pacific Rear Area Command for future war against Japan, the command is given to Lieutenant General Williams Tyree, in preparations for war, transport, supplies, construction, and health preparations. This indicates that the U.S. military is shifting from Nimitz's short-term operational tactics to Admiral Nimitz Mccallum's long-term operational approach. Whether the enemy and the United States can continue [the war for many] years remains to be seen.

Editorial

### Watching the Trends of the Mainland Battlefield

Since the end of the European war, the enemy has exaggeratedly publicized the plan for a general offensive against Japan with transferred troops. However, in reality, since Germany's surrender on May 8th, almost a month and a half has passed, and the enemy's military actions in East Asia have not undergone any major changes. Even in the Battle of Okinawa Island, the enemy's commander-in-chief was sacrificed, but they still failed to overcome the special attack spirit of the allied nation. Regardless of how the enemy's strategic changes in the future, after this 87th extraordinary session of the Diet, the allied nation has gradually completed the strong defense capability to turn the entire homeland into a battlefield. Therefore, so far, the enemy's strategy of quick decision and quick victory against the Japanese mainland has clearly failed to materialize.

It is difficult to predict the future direction of the enemy's strategic goals. However, there will probably be no decisive action taken before the Three Powers Conference reaches a conclusion. But that is no reason for us to relax our defenses against the enemy. In particular, regarding the mainland China operation, no matter how the international situation may evolve in the future, the enemy's strategy will not change and will only be intensified. At the same time, the two major forces in the Chongqing camp, regardless of whether they will cooperate or fight each other in the future, do not have the awareness to oppose the mainland becoming a battlefield. They all have the intention to use the mainland operation to expand their own power. Therefore, the future of the battlefield in mainland China is worthy of constant vigilance.

Recently, the enemy's attempts to land on the mainland coast at various places guarded by British and Americans, seem to have a gradually improving tendency. At the same time, Chongqing and Yan'an are also rumored to be carrying out so-called "counter-offensive" deployments in various places. From the perspective of the fate of the entire China, this is obviously very unfortunate.

Currently, the Allied forces in China are launching new offensives on various lines in the mainland. In the Central Plains and southeastern regions, they are gaining decisive victories with lightning tactics. In particular, in the Guangdong and Jiangxi regions, they dealt a blow to the main force of the Chongqing army, 60,000 men of the Yu army, who were entrenched in the key areas of South China, and achieved the victory of the Three Souths in Jiangxi. This time, the Allied forces' offensive in mainland China, on the one hand, shattered all the rumors and speculations about the China battlefield in the past one or two months. On the other hand, it also demonstrated the strength of the Allied forces, which is enough to make the Chongqing and Yan'an armies finally consider whether to return to East Asia and jointly defend the East Asia people's East Asia with Japan, or to continue to follow Europe and the United States and plunge the country into a state of crisis. Third, and most importantly, the victory of the Allied forces in Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces has destroyed the Chongqing's counter-offensive posture that was being deployed under the direction of the enemy Americans. Locally, it has created a new defense line around the peace zone, and broadly, it has strengthened the defensive capabilities against the enemy along the Chinese coast. In addition, the recent plan of Chongqing and Yan'an to open up the route for counter-offensive in Central and South China has also been thwarted.

The significance of this victory by the Allied forces has been described above. With the development of the internal and external situations, the importance of the mainland battlefield in the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War will increase rather than decrease. We should take this battle as a starting point, increase our vigilance, and cooperate more closely to jointly defend China and defend East Asia.

### San Francisco Conference Scheduled to Close Tomorrow; Song Ziwen Returned to Chongqing the Day Before Yesterday

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – The San Francisco Conference, which began on April 25th of this year, will have lasted for nearly two months and is scheduled to conclude on the 23rd of this month. As a result of this conference, the International Security Charter (commonly known as the San Francisco Charter) will be established, which is extremely incompatible with the current world situation. Therefore, it can be said to be repeating the mistakes of the former League of Nations. Although the San Francisco Conference has formally concluded, in reality, major issues that require the actual handling of the International Security Mechanism, such as the Polish issue, the Trieste issue, the Austrian issue, and the handling of the German border issue, have not been discussed. Moreover, the British, American, and Soviet representatives who drafted the new International Security Charter further stated that the reason why the former League of Nations had no military background and therefore had no ability to implement when dealing with international disputes, resulting in failure, was that they stipulated that when a country in dispute refuses the advice of the Security Council, they will jointly initiate military force to resolve the dispute. Moreover, they further stipulated that when military force is initiated, it will be decided by the Security Council, which is dictated by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Among the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and France, if a country experiences an international dispute, that country has the right to refuse to initiate military force. When this point was brought up on the conference floor, although it was opposed by Australia and other small and medium-sized countries, it was forcibly passed by the Permanent Council. According to this, the Council has no power to prevent the five major powers from attacking or invading other small countries. Therefore, the San Francisco Conference implemented a regional system, recognizing the right of member countries in each region to conclude regional security treaties. In other words, the United States and the Soviet Union have each established a national security system in their respective hemispheres. The fierce competition between the United States and the Soviet Union has also given rise to other phenomena. We can also get a glimpse of this from the international trust issue discussed on the conference floor in San Francisco. The United States insisted that all regions seized from defeated countries in this war and all territories entrusted to the League of Nations after the last war should be trust territories. When the occupying country administers, the "Trust Committee" appointed by the Dehui shall bear complete responsibility. It also stated that the strategic islands in the Pacific occupied by the United States by military force should not be subject to the supervision of this Trust Committee. The Soviet Union also knew very well that the reason why the United States proposed this plan was to obtain strategic islands in the Pacific in order to prevent Soviet forces from advancing into the Pacific. Therefore, the Soviet representative at the San Francisco Conference suddenly proposed on the floor of the Voting Committee on June 14 that the charter should stipulate "any member country may withdraw from the conference at any time, regardless of the reason," in order to refute the United States, causing the last major turmoil at the San Francisco Conference.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, Song Ziwen returned to Chongqing on the 20th from San Francisco.

### Swiss Commander-in-Chief Kourson Resigns

Bailen, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to news received from this question, the Swiss National Army Commander-in-Chief, aged seventy-one, General Kourson, submitted his resignation to the parliament yesterday, because the military service of the Swiss state ended on August 20 of this year.

### Belgium to Implement National Referendum System

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a British dispatch received last night from Brussels, the Belgian Communist Party, in opposition to King Leopold's decision to return, is calling on the public to launch a nationwide demonstration movement. A Catholic member of the government led by Achille Van Acker, named Van Cauwelaert, suddenly proposed yesterday the adoption of a "national referendum" system to resolve Belgium's political crisis. Van Cauwelaert is currently the Minister of Justice. His proposal aims to resolve the issue of the King's forced abdication. A right-wing political organ in Brussels commented on Van Cauwelaert's proposal as follows: "The national referendum system is the only genuine way to promote public opinion in the country. However, this system must be gradually implemented under calm, free, and stable control."

### Former Head of French Anti-Communist League Sentenced to Death

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Paris, the Paris court sentenced Marcel Déat, the head of the anti-Communist league under Laval who had collaborated with the German army, to death in absentia on the morning of the 19th.

### British, American, and Soviet Diplomats Continue Negotiations on Polish Issue

—Polish Political Leaders Unlikely to Face Death Penalty—

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Moscow, the British Ambassador to Moscow, Kerr, hosted a dinner party at the British Embassy on the night of the 19th, inviting Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky and US Ambassador to Moscow Harriman. They discussed the establishment of a new Polish coalition government. Furthermore, the conference of Polish democratic factions scheduled for the 19th did not take place and is expected to be reconvened soon to discuss specific proposals from various factions. The atmosphere of the conference has gradually eased due to the fact that anti-Soviet elements from the Polish government-in-exile in London have been handed over to military tribunals.

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Moscow, during the continued trial of sixteen Polish political prisoners in the Moscow court yesterday, Prosecutor General Afanasyev stated that he had no intention of imposing the death penalty on the four major culprits of Poland. However, they should all be sentenced to "lifelong deprivation of freedom." He continued, stating that most Polish people wanted to sow seeds of discord among the United Nations and prevent the people of the Soviet Union and Poland from ever reaching mutual understanding. Although August Emil Fieldorf and many other defendants did not personally kill Soviet generals, they should bear full responsibility for the killings, as they were instigators who issued orders. Evidence of this has been obtained. Although it could be argued that their crimes warrant the death penalty, we are at the stage of victory in the war. Even if they do not die, they cannot harm our strong Soviet Union. Therefore, we do not wish to impose the death penalty on them. The two main culprits among the four Polish culprits are General August Emil Fieldorf, the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Home Army, and Jan Jankowski, the Acting Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London and Chairman of the Council of the Polish Underground State. The guilt of the four major culprits has been proven. They were the organizers and leaders of the Polish Underground State's sabotage activities against the Soviet Union. The remaining twelve defendants will be judged as accomplices.

### Conflicts Erupt Again Within Syria

Casablanca, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Beirut yesterday, clashes between French and Syrian forces occurred again on Tuesday in the Arab Punar region near the Turkish border in northwestern Syria.

### Hitler's Death Reportedly Due to Poisoning; Actress Braun Dies Simultaneously

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a report from a Reuters special correspondent, details about the simultaneous deaths of German leader Adolf Hitler and actress Eva Braun in the Berlin Führerbunker were revealed last night by Hitler's SS guard, Kunno, who was detained at the headquarters of the British Second Army in Germany. Kunno stated: "I arrived at Berchtesgaden (Hitler's villa) in mid-February 1945, where I personally saw the bedrooms of Eva Braun and Adolf Hitler. There was a 'connecting door' between the two bedrooms. No one in the villa dared to call Braun 'Miss Braun,' only referring to her by the abbreviation of 'Eva Braun,' 'E.B.' When I returned to Berlin, rumors spread within the SS that Hitler and Miss Braun had married at the end of April. On April 30th, I suddenly met Miss Braun alone in a basement. She looked depressed and said, 'I would rather die here than leave and go elsewhere.' Her voice was very sad. At that time, I could only try to comfort her and call her 'Miss Braun.' Unexpectedly, she urgently said, 'From now on, you should call me Mrs. Hitler.' During the final days of the siege of Berlin, all SS guards in the Führerbunker were ordered to only pass through a tunnel sixty meters deep because the Soviet artillery fire was extremely intense. Hitler slept on a camp bed every night, but from April 18th, he also went to the tunnel and stayed there day and night. On May 1st, when I passed through the tunnel to deliver breakfast, I saw Hitler sitting quietly in a rocking chair, lightly tapping the chair with his left fingers, showing signs of nervousness. At that moment, Captain Manguha entered. Hitler immediately stood up and shook hands with him, repeatedly asking 'What's the news?' This was the last time I heard Hitler speak. At around 5 PM on the same day, while passing through the tunnel, the tunnel was empty. Looking around, I saw two of Hitler's personal staff, including Schaar. One of them looked very resentful. Seeing me, he couldn't help but shout, 'The Führer is dead and burned to death!' I turned back to the tunnel and found the bodies of Hitler and Miss Braun lying on the sandy ground about three yards from the fire exit. Hitler was lying face down with his knees slightly bent. Miss Braun was close beside him, face down. Although both bodies were charred by fire, they were still identifiable. Miss Braun's usual summer clothes and black leather shoes and Hitler's khaki military uniform were unmistakable. Four motorcycles were parked near the bodies. Based on my personal observation, Hitler and Miss Braun were poisoned by Professor Stumpfegger, the chief medical officer in the Führerbunker. I suspect they were poisoned by him because I saw him poison Hitler's beloved dog 'Blondi' the night before. At the same time, all the SS guards deeply believed that Hitler must have taken poison, as he had sworn before his death that he would rather die by poison than be captured by the Soviet army. At that time, the bodies of Hitler and Miss Braun lay quietly in the silence, without any ceremonies or funerals. That night, the SS guards gathered beside Captain Crookes, listening to his solemn declaration, which roughly stated: 'It is a great pity that none of the German generals mourned the death of the Führer. I am proud to have witnessed the Führer's last remains with my own eyes.'"

### Papen Commits Suicide

### Eisenhower's Remarks

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New York, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, arrived in New York by air from Washington on the 19th.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the current Supreme Commander of the European Expeditionary Force who has returned home, stated while meeting with reporters on the 19th that the strength of the German military must be completely destroyed. His remarks were as follows: "We must completely destroy the old German General Staff. Because since 1706, the German General Staff has intentionally dominated Europe. Therefore, for the sake of future peace, those related to the German military must be isolated from each other so that they cannot cooperate, and the German military staff system must be completely eliminated."

### Jiangyin Today

—Lan Huo

Current Population

Becoming a vital Yangtze River fortress, Jiangyin is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, facing Jingjiang to the north, bordering Changshu to the east, Wujin to the west, and Wuxi to the south. To the north of the city are Huangshan, E'zuibi, and Xiaojiaoshan mountains, standing on the riverbank, forming a very strategic terrain. The county covers an area of 3,600 square li and has a current population of over 797,400.

During the Ming Dynasty, Jiangyin was called "Lianyang Prefecture." Before the Ming Dynasty, it underwent several reforms and had different names. It was officially changed from Jiangyin Prefecture to Jiangyin County in the second year of the Hongwu era. The local people are relatively strong-willed, and their customs are still quite simple. The religious faith is mainly Buddhism.

Transportation to Neighboring Counties

From Wuxi to Jiangyin, take the Xicheng long-distance bus, which runs twice daily and takes about two and a half hours to arrive. In addition to public buses, there are also private cars from United Motor Transport, which are more expensive but do not have fixed schedules. To get from Jiangyin to Changshu, take an inland river steamboat. However, due to recent activity by the "Big Knife Society" in the rural areas and the occasional presence of guerrillas, most people detour through Wuxi, take a train to Suzhou, and then take a long-distance bus to their destination. There is a road connecting Jiangyin and Wujin.

Burden on Merchants and Residents

Due to its remote location and inconvenient transportation, commerce has been exceptionally depressed since the war. The bustling streets are only in the northern and western parts of the city, but even these are not as good as the small towns west of the Fanhangdu area in Shanghai. There are no large stores there. Having a double-door storefront with two or three display windows to sell some daily necessities is considered quite impressive. On the one hand, prices are high and the people's purchasing power is weak. On the other hand, it is said that the burden on merchants and residents there is particularly heavy, with various military and police supply fees and many detailed items, adding up to a considerable amount. Therefore, merchants with larger capital, seeing no profit in opening their doors and prices rising sharply day and night, are unwilling to put their goods on the market. The "Jiangyin County Administrative Overview" mentions the recent situation of commerce, including a section stating: "The county's commerce has recently been affected by rising prices, and all industries are exceptionally depressed. The County Chamber of Commerce convened a membership meeting on March 15 to re-elect the current supervisors, directors, and chairman. The elected chairman, Zhang Dilou, declined the position. For two months, no one has been responsible. The County Government has ordered the person in charge to be dealt with, but it is still in progress." In major cities, being elected as chairman is considered an honor, and some even spend money to campaign for it. However, in Jiangyin County, the elected person actually declines the position, which shows the reality of the situation.

Currency Panic

In terms of industry, there is one large-scale yarn factory and five small-scale yarn factories, which can produce 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn annually. Cotton cloth production is mainly local cloth, with an annual output of approximately 400,000 bolts, which are sold to neighboring counties. Other handicraft facilities are still scarce. The financial industry is not very developed due to the impact of commerce. There are currently four banks and seven money shops. Recently, there has also been a currency panic, with tight cash flow, insufficient funds, and an unstable situation.

Urging People to Pay Grain

The county has a total of 1,183,300 mu of farmland. Districts 3, 4, 5, and 7 are rice-producing areas, District 6 mainly produces cotton and beans, and Districts 1 and 8 have both. The annual rice production is over 1,024,100 shi. Wheat and cotton production are also considerable. The irrigation system is smooth, with Taihu Lake to the south, the Yangtze River to the north, and the Grand Canal and Yingtian River as main waterways. The crisscrossing harbors and rivers provide natural convenience for irrigation. However, due to a locust plague last autumn, the harvest was poor, which has affected the collection of land taxes. To date, only half has been collected. The local county government is actively urging people to pay their grain taxes, distributing notices to grain households, and posting slogans promoting tax payment. Starting from July 1, a late payment penalty will be added based on the average rice price of each month, with a 20% increase in July, 40% in August, 60% in September, 80% in October, and 100% in November. For example, if the rice price on June 20 is 200,000 yuan, then completing the grain payment in July, plus the 20% late payment penalty, will require 240,000 yuan.

Teachers' Strikes

The educational assets in Jiangyin are quite abundant, including real estate, grain fields, and sand fields. However, the educational facilities are not good, and the treatment of teachers is lower than in other places. Not long ago, there was a teachers' strike. A middle school teacher's monthly salary is 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, plus a wartime living allowance, totaling only about 10,000 yuan. Primary school teachers are, of course, even more pitiful. Although they also receive three dou of rice, it has not been distributed for five months. Moreover, the wartime living allowance is not paid monthly. Since the teachers' strike, there has been some news that the owed rice will be calculated at a discounted price of 20,000 yuan per shi, totaling 30,000 yuan per person. The current rice price in Jiangyin is over 400,000 yuan, but the 30,000 yuan converted from the five months' worth of rice has not yet been received. There is one county-run middle school, nine private middle schools, and over eighty public and private primary schools (including those in various townships), with a total of over 900 teachers and staff in the county's middle and primary schools.

Charitable Undertakings

Due to limited funds, the health facilities currently available are only epidemic prevention injections and smallpox vaccinations. The urban area currently has four private clinics, seven private hospitals, and one public hospital, with twelve practicing doctors, including four qualified and registered doctors. The more successful charitable undertakings include the Pujitang and the Infant and Orphanage. The orphanage currently houses 105 boys and girls, while the Pujitang houses a total of over 30 elderly, weak, and orphaned men and women.

The Native Religion Case

The Native Religion was rampant in the county for a while. After several people, including Jiang Mingbo of the so-called "Golden Light Method," publicly failed in their experiments in Wuxi, most farmers have awakened. Although it has not been completely quelled, it is no longer as rampant as before. The Native Religion in the county originated from districts 3 and 4 of Wuxi. Due to the farmers' ignorance, many were deceived, so it spread rapidly and soon became widespread in various districts, with over 20,000 members. Their stated goals were to refuse to pay grain taxes, resist illegal military and police, and overthrow local bullies, rascals, and tax collectors. After their power expanded, unfortunate incidents occurred repeatedly. The most tragic was the Zhouzhuang incident, in which over 50 patrol officers were brutally killed, including four police chiefs, who were beheaded and their heads displayed to the public.

Gardens and Scenic Spots

Recently, coal has been scarce, and the urban area has been without electric lights for two months. After nightfall, the shops close, and the scenery appears desolate. For entertainment, there is only one storytelling performance to add some color. The best scenery is at Yushan Mountain, six li from the city. However, the mountain is currently a military fortress, and tourists are prohibited from climbing it. There is a park in the city, with a large area and hillsides full of tall trees. One can hear the singing of valley birds in the forest, and being there is peaceful and enjoyable, with a unique natural flavor.

### Various Charitable Organizations to Implement Forced Evacuation; Evacuation Committee Decides to Start with Women and Children's Groups First

The city's Population Evacuation Committee has been actively carrying out evacuation work to this day, and arrangements have been made for the only means of transportation, boats and vehicles. In order to strengthen the work and quickly promote the evacuation of the population, the committee held a second joint meeting of various groups on the second floor of the City Hall at 3 PM yesterday and continued to convene a meeting of representatives of various charitable organizations in the city at 4 PM, deciding to implement forced evacuation of charitable organizations in addition to citizens who wish to leave Shanghai and return to their hometowns voluntarily, and decided to implement it from July 1. The circumstances of the two meetings are as follows:

### Second Liaison Meeting of Various Groups

The second joint meeting of various groups of the Evacuation Committee was attended by the City Welfare Bureau and the committee's general affairs, survey design, liaison, and execution groups, as well as staff members Cao Jingang, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Jiwu, Zhou Yuying, Huang Jingzhai, and Ling Dade from the shipping and land transport committees, totaling over 20 people. After the meeting was convened, Chairman Chen Binhe first explained the situation of the committee's office in the Shen Bao newspaper office since its establishment, detailing the process of contacting and renting boats and vehicles in the evacuation work.

### Resolution of Important Cases

After the report, discussions were held, and several proposals were resolved on the spot, with the following being selected and recorded:

Regarding the evacuation of various charitable organizations, it was resolved that forced evacuation would be implemented from July 1 of this year, starting with women and children's groups, but the order of departure would be decided by the charitable organizations themselves. The regular expenses of those evacuated to their destination will be uniformly allocated by the Shanghai social welfare organizations.

Regarding the evacuation of citizens from northern provinces living in Shanghai, it was resolved to contact and negotiate with the China Central Railway Company as soon as possible to designate vehicles. Citizens from Nanjing and above and from various parts of North China who need to leave Shanghai can apply to the committee for execution according to the schedule.

### Charity Organization Representatives Meeting

Following the conclusion of the second meetings of various groups under the Evacuation Committee, a meeting of various charity organizations in the city was convened. In attendance were Director Zhou Yuying of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, Cao Jingang of the Evacuation Committee (representing Liu Han), Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Jiwu, Huang Jing, Ling Dading, and representatives from various charity organizations, including the China Relief Society, Junhua Jushantang, Shanghai Fuyouyuan, Shanghai Jiliangsuo, Shanghai Cilian Relief Association, the Social Service Department of the Xinwen Bao Newspaper, Canfei Yanglaotang, Ai Yu Tang, Taiping Temple, the Salvation Army, Subei Orphanage, Ren Ci Charity Association, Shanghai Orphanage for Children, Shanghai Charity Group, and the Pingjiang Children's Education Institute, totaling over fifty people. Director Zhou Yuying presided over the meeting. First, Director Zhou explained the significance of the compulsory evacuation of charity organizations. Subsequently, Gu Jiwu and Chen Binhe delivered speeches. Next, Xiang Kangyuan discussed the registration application for Xishan as the evacuation destination, suggesting that various hometown associations could handle the registration themselves and then submit it to the executive group for processing evacuation travel documents.

The meeting concluded around 4 PM. It was reported that the Evacuation Committee would soon convene meetings with various Shanghai-based hometown associations from northern Jiangsu and other areas to begin preliminary work.

Personal inspection report. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM. The speeches and reports are recorded below:

Director Zhou's Speech

Director Zhou of the Social Welfare Bureau, a member of the Evacuation Committee, stated, "Since this committee was ordered by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to handle the population evacuation of this city, it has been over three months. To date, all conditions for evacuation, such as boats and vehicles, have been resolved, and evacuation is officially underway. Evacuating the population is a policy implemented by the government to adapt to the wartime system. If evacuation is successful, it can reduce the government's difficulties. During wartime evacuation, it can further reduce the number of casualties from air raids. Moreover, the price of rice is currently high in this city. Evacuating the population can further reduce consumption in the city. Therefore, based on the above, evacuating the city's population is imperative. Today, this committee is convening various charity organizations to prepare for compulsory evacuation, starting with women and children groups. There is truly no need for women and children groups to remain in Shanghai, enduring the threat of enemy air raids and the suffering under high living costs."

Director Gu's Speech

Director Gu of the Evacuation Committee's Executive Group stated, "Director Zhou has already explained the meaning of evacuating the city's charity organizations. I will add a few points. The steps for evacuating the city's population will begin with those who do not need to reside in the city, and then gradually expand. All charity organizations are unnecessary to remain in Shanghai during this time of war. Therefore, this committee has decided to begin compulsory evacuation of women and children groups from charity organizations starting from the first day of next month. The destination has been set as Xishan in Dongting, Jiangsu."

Chen Binhe's Speech

Director Chen Binhe of the Investigation and Design Group stated, "The evacuation of charity organizations is necessary, and it is now compulsory. The committee has completed the preparation of transportation, and we can no longer delay. The danger of air raids and the soaring price of food make early evacuation the best course of action. The expenses for evacuation and the costs after evacuation are all unified in the plan. The expenses of various charitable organizations have always been borne by social welfare organizations or individuals in this city. All expenses after evacuation should continue to be covered. If any charitable organization still does not comply after the implementation of compulsion, society will no longer bear its expenses in the future. Moreover, we have a production plan at the evacuation destination. Now, please listen to Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's report on the situation in Xishan, who has returned from an on-site inspection."

Xiang Kangyuan's Speech

Xiang Kangyuan, Director of the Liaison Group, reported: "Regarding the situation in Xishan, I can report simply: the land is fertile, there is a lot of open space, and the lakes are very shallow. Generally speaking, there are only 8,000 mu of arable land in Xishan, and the annual income is only enough to pay taxes. In fact, there are more than 30,000 to 40,000 mu of good land, but the residents do not cultivate enough. Local guest farmers can harvest about 15,000 shi of wheat each year, using 10,000 shi for their own consumption and exporting 5,000 shi, which is enough for self-sufficiency. Now that charity organizations are evacuating there, if they cultivate rice paddies, they can be self-sufficient in half a year. Except for daily necessities that need to be transported from other places, all other meats and vegetables are at least cheaper than in Shanghai. Moreover, there is a lot of fish production, reeds are everywhere, and vacant temples, villas, and ancestral halls can be borrowed for accommodation. In short, Xishan has unlimited development potential as long as people go there to develop it. Xishan is indeed a good place, and I hope that charity organizations will move there as soon as possible."

### Business Firms Collect Special Tax as Agents; Issue Invoices According to Regulations; Violators Will Be Investigated and Penalized by the Finance Bureau

The Municipal Finance Bureau previously formulated rules for business firms to collect special consumption tax as agents and issue invoices, which were announced on April 14 of this year and published in various newspapers. According to the rules, all business firms collecting special consumption tax as agents (including hotels and restaurants) should uniformly purchase and issue the invoices. If they use self-prepared invoices with serial numbers, they should apply to the Finance Bureau for permission to affix the bureau's seal. Retailers with a very small scale who are truly unable to issue invoices must first apply to the Finance Bureau for approval to be exempted. The Finance Bureau may verify their business income and order them to pay taxes using estimation methods. Violations of the above regulations may be subject to a fine of up to 50,000 yuan. In severe cases, they may also be subject to suspension of business or other penalties. It has been two months since the announcement. It has recently been reported that many business firms are complying with the regulations by purchasing and using the special tax invoices, but some have not yet purchased them or have purchased them but are not issuing them to taxpayers according to regulations. Others are using self-prepared invoices without applying for permission to affix the seal, or they are stores that are unable to issue invoices but have not applied for exemption. The Finance Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate, and many business firms have been found to be in violation and have been penalized. The investigation and penalties are continuing.

Measures to Rectify Tax Evasion of Special Taxes

Furthermore, the Finance Bureau previously found that hotels, restaurants, cafes, tea rooms, and various entertainment venues in the city were deliberately lowering the price of tea and collecting surcharges and miscellaneous fees outside of the official accounts in order to evade special taxes. To rectify tax collection, several measures have been stipulated: Hotels and restaurants are prohibited from collecting surcharges and miscellaneous fees; otherwise, they should be included in the bill and subject to special tax. The same applies to the tea fee portion. The amount of special tax collected as an agent should be separately stated on the invoice and should not be mixed with other small amounts. Issued invoices should be destroyed immediately if customers do not take them and should not be reused. Small accounts should not exceed the amount of special tax due, that is, not exceed 20% of the official account. Violations of the above regulations will be penalized immediately. This was announced on May 28 of this year and published in various newspapers in the city. The Finance Bureau is currently sending people to secretly investigate whether various hotels and restaurants are complying. It is hoped that business firms and operators of banquets and hotels will pay close attention to the above measures to avoid severe penalties.

Deadline for License Renewal and Penalties

The temporary rules for penalties for overdue renewal of business licenses by the Municipal Finance Bureau have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. However, due to the Finance Bureau's late collection of business license fees for the spring and summer seasons of this year, a flexible approach is being taken to ease the difficulties of businesses. Regardless of whether the license is monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual, the renewal deadline is extended to the end of June. Those who fail to pay by the deadline will be penalized with 50% of the license fee due for each period. There are few days left until the end of June. Business people in the city should quickly pay the fees and renew their licenses before the deadline to avoid penalties.

### Second Phase of Gold Certificates Redeemed Starting Today

The second phase of gold certificates issued by the Central Reserve Bank from May 21 to 23 of this year has reached its one-month maturity. Gold redemption will begin today (the 22nd). To maintain redemption order and avoid congestion, redemption numbers have been scheduled. For one-tael certificates, redemption will be from numbers 1108 to 1600 on June 22, and from numbers 1601 to 2052 on June 23. For five-tael certificates, redemption will be from numbers 50553 to 50644 on June 22. For ten-tael certificates, redemption will be from numbers 101010 to 101510 on June 22, from numbers 101511 to 102010 on June 23, and from numbers 102011 to 102533 on June 25. If certificate holders cannot redeem on the scheduled dates due to circumstances, they can redeem at any time after June 25 without any time limit.

Finance Bureau Imposes Special Tax on Gold

The Finance Bureau has formed a special tax committee on gold to enrich the municipal treasury by collecting special taxes on gold. Sun Yaodong, Yang Jitang, Wang Boyuan, Shen Chang, Xie Bingquan, Pan Bingchen, Kang Xueyuan, Zhang Yuanbai, and Chen Kai have been appointed as members of the committee, with Sun Yaodong designated as the chairman. The committee will be established immediately to prepare for the collection of special taxes on gold.

### Police Bureau Distributes Affordable Miscellaneous Grains

Chief Zhou, also the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, is improving the lives of police officers. In addition to adjusting salaries and providing free rice, he has also tasked the Police Welfare Society with purchasing and distributing various daily necessities. It is reported that the recent purchase of more than 2,000 bags of various miscellaneous grains will be sold to police officers at affordable prices starting today. Each person will receive 20 jin, and the responsible officers from various departments, bureaus, teams, stations, and institutes will handle the payment and distribution matters to the society.

Two Miscellaneous Grain Stores Penalized for Raising Prices

The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, to protect the city's food supply, submitted a plan to the authorities to sell seven types of miscellaneous grains at fair prices through its member stores. The Economic Security Section of the Police Bureau and the Economic Police Corps, to prevent illegal miscellaneous grain stores from refusing to sell or exceeding the fair prices, mobilized the entire economic police force to conduct strict investigations. If such situations were found, penalties would be imposed. It is reported that yesterday, Qishi Miscellaneous Grain Store at 706 Qiding Road and Qiaofeng Miscellaneous Grain Store at 313 Huaian Road were found to be selling red beans at black market prices of 4,000 yuan and 3,200 yuan per jin, respectively, while the fair price was 2,300 yuan per jin. After investigation, the store owners Lian Yuanqing and Zhang Zipu were summoned to the bureau and penalized according to the law. At the same time, personnel are continuing to investigate, and those who refuse to sell goods will have their goods confiscated. Citizens are encouraged to report violations.

Dealing Strictly with Profiteers on Discounted Vouchers

The economic police authorities continue to mobilize and conduct secret investigations into illegal activities such as discounting payment vouchers for high profits. In particular, the First Team of the Economic Police Corps dispatched its entire staff yesterday afternoon to conduct a major secret investigation in the financial district. Dozens of illegal economic criminals have been arrested and detained. They will be charged with disrupting the financial order and will be handed over to the Third Division for transfer to the court for strict punishment according to judicial procedures to curb the bad trend.

### Zhang Dasan Executed by Firing Squad This Morning for Forcibly Extorting Civilian Property; Verdict by Special Court Branch

The respective heads will preside over the meetings to report on and review the police situation of the week. They will also hold inspections of internal affairs, firearms, and uniforms according to the police inspection rules issued by the Ministry of Interior. Furthermore, before the collection and dispatch of duties every night, each branch should assign patrol officers to give spiritual speeches, elaborating on the general principles of police service.

The Municipal Economic Bureau has set a deadline of the end of March in the 34th year for unregistered factories to complete their registration. It has been found that many have complied with the deadline, but some have not complied. While they should be penalized according to regulations, a lenient approach is being taken and the previous order is reiterated. All established but unregistered factories and businesses are required to complete registration by the end of this month. Newly established factories and businesses should promptly apply for registration in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Registration of Managed Factories and the Commercial Registration Rules.

### Edible Oil Association Handles Registration of Incoming Goods

The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Association recently received instructions from Secretary-General Luo of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to investigate and register the quantity of edible oil purchased by fellow members from production areas.

Any concealment or misreporting will be punished according to the law.

### Buddhist Celebrities Organize Releasing Lives

Li Sihao, Wen Lantao, Yu Zhijing, Nie Yuntai, Tao Xiquan, Ding Fubao, Li Yuanjing, and other famous Buddhists in Shanghai recently initiated the Yiyou Releasing Lives Association, electing Elder Master Xingci as the president and Fan Gunong and Wu Yunzhai as the vice presidents. Starting from the fifth month of the lunar calendar, one session of releasing lives will be held every month. Each session will begin with Elder Master Xingci leading the congregation in practicing the Dharma at the Fazang Temple, followed by releasing lives. Basic members must commit to at least one vow per month, with each vow being 10,000 yuan. Ordinary members may contribute any amount. The collection point is at the Kongming Electrical Material Store at 359 Guangdong Road, at the intersection of Shandong Road. The purpose is briefly stated as follows: "Do no evil, make abstaining from killing the priority, practice all good deeds, make releasing lives the first priority. Today, with vast tribulations filling the sky and war raging everywhere, to lighten the turbidity of the tribulations, we rely on kindness. We hope all circles will actively participate and widely solicit like-minded people."

### Unable to Endure Economic Pressure, Fishmonger Hangs Himself; Fishmongers' Association Raises Funds for Relief

The "Li Bao" newspaper reported on the 20th of this month that a fishmonger, unable to endure economic pressure, hanged himself. Upon hearing this news, the Fishmongers' Association immediately sent representatives, and Mr. Chen initiated a fundraising campaign to provide relief to the deceased's family and to find solutions for fishmongers lacking capital. After contacting a small loan department of a certain bank to provide assistance to impoverished fishmongers, those fishmongers who genuinely need loans for their businesses can contact Mr. Chen He of the association. Furthermore, given that recently various fish businesses have been using the excuse of cash transactions to refuse fishmongers' payment slips, or otherwise requiring a discount of about 20 cents per dollar, which is quite unreasonable, the association has published an advertisement to oppose this practice. Relevant authorities have summoned the person in charge of the association for questioning, and it is expected that this evil trend of discounts can be eliminated soon.

### China Children's Welfare Association This Year's Fundraising Target: 50 Million Yuan for One Month

The China Children's Welfare Association in this city has been dedicated to rescuing orphaned and impoverished children for over a decade. Since the outbreak of the war, the association has successively sheltered a cumulative total of 10,000 refugee children and currently cares for more than 300. The usual expenses for education and care rely on donations from all sectors of society. In November of last year, the association raised over 10 million yuan in donations and purchased grain, which was exhausted by the end of April this year. Currently, in addition to loans of 3 million yuan from the Xinhua Bank obtained successively by the standing committee members Lin Kanghou and Zhao Jinqing, Mr. Wu Yunzhai, Mr. Chen Bin, Mr. Ding Boxiong, and Mr. Yang Pengnian have each advanced 1 million yuan to cover recurring expenses, allowing the association to continue operating until now. At a time when resources are becoming increasingly scarce and expenses are soaring, it is felt that it is increasingly difficult to maintain operations. If it were not for a broad appeal to benefactors, it would be truly unsustainable. Therefore, it has been decided to launch a fundraising campaign for this year's refugee children's education and care expenses, starting on the 25th of this month, for a period of one month, with a target of 50 million yuan. It is sincerely hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will, at that time, still hold the spirit of "loving other children as we love our own" and contribute generously, so that the association's educational work will not be terminated due to the exhaustion of funds. The benefits to the refugee children will be immeasurable.
