### Fierce Attack by Elite Japanese Troops Near Manao, Luzon; Enemy Attempt to Advance South from Lingayen Gulf Foiled

Luzon Front, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy forces that landed in Lingayen Gulf attempted to advance south along the highway leading to Manila. Elite Japanese troops launched a fierce attack near Manao, killing 200 enemy soldiers and destroying three tanks on the 17th. On the 18th, they continued to intercept enemy reinforcements, setting four tanks ablaze and driving them back. Japanese units in northern Luzon have also been continuously sending raiding parties deep into enemy positions, completely destroying the enemy's main forward bases. As a result, the enemy has been forced to transfer troops landed north of Lingayen, in areas such as Santo Tomas, to reinforce the southern flank. Furthermore, since the 18th, the enemy has repeatedly used B-24 and P-38 type bombers from base air forces to cover the troops landing in Lingayen Gulf, while also intensifying reconnaissance over southern Luzon, revealing an intention to take advantage of the decisive battle in Luzon and attempt to move further from the Lingayen Gulf area to other locations.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Associated Press report from the Luzon front: In the past 24 hours, fierce tank battles have unfolded on the highway between Lingayen Gulf and Manila. Two Japanese soldiers carrying bombs destroyed American tanks, causing extreme shock among American soldiers.

Philippine Base, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – From the night of the 18th to the morning of the 19th, Japanese air forces twice heavily bombed the enemy positions near the coast of the Camotes Islands, shattering several enemy fortifications.

Japanese War Results Expanding

Lingayen Front, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy forces that landed in Lingayen Gulf, under the cover of intense artillery fire and bombing, are gradually attempting to move south. Since the 16th, they have faced fierce Japanese attacks and counterattacks, and their anxious advance has been thwarted. Elite Japanese troops waiting for action launched a powerful attack on the enemy's main bridgehead line towards San Fabian on the night of the 16th, penetrating deep into enemy positions. Simultaneously, a unit carried out an amphibious landing on the coast, attacking the enemy from the rear, and burning and destroying enemy ammunition, tanks, and vehicles piled up on the coastal highway and in civilian houses, throwing the enemy lines into great chaos. At the same time, Japanese artillery also fired intensely, and Japanese air forces dropped bombs like rain, with combined air and land attacks greatly startling the enemy forces on the Lingayen Gulf coast. On the morning of the 17th, black smoke billowed from Japanese positions near the coast and the San Fabian enemy positions, with extremely tragic sounds of fuel explosions. The unit led by Lieutenant Sato, which broke through enemy lines and returned to their positions, destroyed four enemy M4 tanks, forty automatic cannons, and eight vehicles. Other main forces destroyed and burned countless enemy ammunition depots and warehouses, and the war results continue to expand.

### Overall Situation in the Philippines

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The situation in the Philippines is as follows: After the enemy American forces established a bridgehead at Lingayen Gulf, they gradually shifted to mobile warfare. The main force of the enemy landing forces, consisting of four divisions, including a tank division, advanced from the northeast coast of Lingayen Gulf through Mount Cabaruan. The Japanese first-line units and enemy forces north of San Fabian, who were using the undulating plateau terrain extending southward to construct fortifications, were suddenly subjected to Japanese counterattacks and acted extremely passively. In the Damortis area, enemy forces near the coastline around San Fabian and Aringay have constructed fortifications along a line approximately four kilometers long, preparing for battle. South of San Fabian, the enemy offensive is very active. Another enemy force has invaded near Biti, six kilometers east of San Fabian, at the Japanese first-line positions. Currently, Japanese forces are intercepting this enemy force in front of the first-line positions and in the area between the first and second lines. The enemy force facing the Japanese right-wing positions in the highlands west of Lingayen is moving extremely slowly. At Lingayen Airfield, the enemy began to use a small number of small aircraft around the 15th. The enemy is also advancing south from Lingayen and Dagupan into the Pangasinan Plain, gradually reaching the Agno River area. A portion of the enemy has crossed the river and is attacking the south bank area. Japanese forces north of San Fabian have been intensifying their charges since the night of the 16th, greatly shocking the enemy. The results of the night battles on the 16th were announced by Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 19th, and the enemy's subsequent losses were even greater. Japanese forces in the highlands west of Lingayen have also launched courageous charges, hindering the enemy's use of Lingayen Airfield and achieving significant results. The Japanese air force, fully aware of the enemy's ambition to invade Luzon, quickly converted all aircraft into special attack units since the enemy approached the coast of Lingayen, heavily bombing enemy warships. They are now inflicting heavy damage on enemy supply convoys. There have been no major changes in the Leyte and Mindoro areas, and Japanese forces are still intercepting the enemy. Furthermore, the enemy mobile task force, primarily the 38th Task Force, later intruded into the South China Sea and attacked Taiwan, the southern coast of China (Guangzhou, Hong Kong), and the Hainan Island area on the 12th, 15th, and 16th, respectively. It appears to still be patrolling the sea northwest of Luzon.

### Enemy Positions Blasted Across From Thabeikkyin

Burma Front, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 18th, Japanese air forces heavily bombed enemy positions across the Irrawaddy River from Thabeikkyin, about 70 kilometers directly north of Mandalay, destroying three surface installations. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base. Furthermore, one hundred enemy P-47 aircraft attacked the Meiktila area in central Burma on the 16th. Japanese air forces intercepted them, shooting down two and destroying one.

Essentials of Timely Measures for National Mobilization in Japan

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government, in the fourth item of the five major emergency measures, advocated strengthening the work ethic and comprehensive national labor mobilization. Recently, with the Ministry of Health and Welfare as the central focus, concrete measures have been formulated. The General Mobilization Deliberation Council decided on the "Essentials of Timely Measures for National Mobilization" on the 10th. According to the purpose of these essentials, the goal is to promote the rapid progress of military mobilization and labor mobilization and to enable the effective functioning of emergency measures under air raids, thereby maximizing the full potential of national labor. Therefore, it can also be considered a law delegating full powers of mobilization or a "fundamental law of mobilization." Its main contents include ensuring the necessary personnel and employment, rationalizing mobilization preparations, organizing mobilization methods, legalizing functional allocation, and improving mobilization administration.

### Japan Increases Tax Revenue to Supplement Temporary Expenses

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government, in response to the increasing war expenditure, decided to implement a tax increase plan of approximately 1.8 billion yen annually from fiscal year 1945. At the same time, sixteen amendment bills including the Income Tax Law were submitted to the current Diet session. Furthermore, in order to increase the above-mentioned tax revenue and monopoly fund revenue, it was also decided to increase cigarette prices. Finance Minister Ishiwata submitted a draft proposal at the cabinet meeting on the 16th, requesting the understanding of each cabinet member. On the afternoon of the 19th at 3:00 PM, the Finance Minister officially announced that the increased revenue for fiscal year 1945 would be over 690 million yen. Combined with the previous two revenue increases, it has reached an unprecedentedly large amount. Due to this tax increase and the increased revenue from monopoly profits, the national treasury revenue has reached a huge sum of 2.5 billion yen. The increased revenue from this price increase will be entirely used for the special account for temporary military expenses.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacking Osaka-Kobe Area Damaged 23

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Approximately eighty enemy B-29 aircraft attacked the industrial zone in the Osaka-Kobe area of Japan on the afternoon of the 19th. After Japanese forces intercepted them and investigated the results, about one-third, or twenty-three, of them were damaged. Several of them have been confirmed shot down. Three Japanese aircraft did not return.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Approximately eighty B-29 aircraft from Mariana bases invaded the Osaka-Kobe area from the direction of the Kii Peninsula in several waves from 1:48 PM on the 19th, dropping bombs and incendiary bombs. By about 2:30 PM, they retreated to the sea in the south. This was the first time that the enemy attacked the Osaka-Kobe area with a strong formation. The enemy's intention was to destroy Japan's supply sources and focus on destroying aviation production facilities. However, due to the brave interception by Japanese air defense units and the solidity of the ground defense lines, the damage was minimal. The results of the interception battle by the Japanese air defense units are currently under investigation. Recently, the enemy has attacked Nagoya, Shizuoka Prefecture, and the Kanto region with a small number of aircraft, dropping bombs near Okazaki, but the damage to Japan has been very minor.

### Bombing of Macau; Portuguese Consul's Remarks

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Portuguese Vice-Consul in Guangzhou, Agnelo de Queiroz, made a statement on the afternoon of the 18th regarding the bombing of Macau, stating: "Because the government of Macau has not yet released any official statement, I do not know the full details of the bombing, which is regrettable. However, since American planes have bombed Macau three times, it is definitely not a case of mistaken targets. Furthermore, the vast majority of Chinese residents in Macau are extremely angered by the atrocities of the American planes."

Weekly Review

### Standards for Tuition Collection and the Issue of Teacher Salary Distribution

— Zeng Niwei

Since the Municipal Education Bureau promulgated the regulations on the standards for collecting student fees from private primary and secondary schools on the 9th of this month, setting the high school tuition fee at 7,500 yuan, junior high at 6,000 yuan, senior elementary at 4,000 yuan, intermediate at 3,600 yuan, and junior at 3,200 yuan, it is said that some private primary and secondary schools have repeatedly held meetings to discuss this and once sent representatives to discuss directly with the Municipal Education authorities, requesting consideration of the difficulties in the lives of teachers and staff, and making reasonable adjustments to the already promulgated standards for collecting tuition fees. However, the authorities believe that if tuition fees follow the general price increases and are arbitrarily raised, it will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in the number of students dropping out of school. Therefore, they expressed the hope that the education community in the city will assist the authorities in promoting methods to rescue dropouts with the spirit of "education for education," and that they do not intend to consider further adjustments to the already promulgated tuition fee standards.

Under such circumstances, what is the response of the various private primary and secondary schools? According to surveys, it is divided into two attitudes: one is "going their own way," and the other is "waiting and seeing." Regardless of how we evaluate these attitudes, it is a serious problem worthy of attention by those who care about the future of education, and it cannot be denied.

It is very clear that the core of this problem lies in whether the standards for tuition collection take into account the burden on students' parents and the livelihood of teachers and staff who rely on tuition revenue to support their lives. If the standards for tuition collection can take both of these aspects into account, then the private primary and secondary schools should not arbitrarily raise tuition fees under the pretext of being unable to maintain the lives of teachers and staff, disregarding the sharp increase in the number of students dropping out of school due to their high tuition fees. The education authorities, and even the highest administrative organs, should prioritize education and take decisive measures against private schools that do not comply with the law, in order to demonstrate the government's determination to safeguard education. On the other hand, if it is indeed impossible to maintain the lives of teachers and staff as a result of complying with the tuition fee standards, we hope that the education authorities, based on the principle of "stabilizing people's livelihoods," one of the national policies promulgated by the highest state organs, will also take into account the reality of Shanghai today and make reasonable adjustments to the already promulgated laws and regulations, in order to maintain education with determination. Otherwise, the flight of excellent teachers due to the inability to maintain the lives of teachers and staff will also have unimaginable consequences.

According to the previous curriculum standards of the education authorities, the distribution of courses, number of students, and teaching hours for teachers in secondary schools is as follows: (1) The number of students in each grade is at least 30 and at most 50. (2) The number of class sessions per week per class is 30, with each session lasting 50 minutes. (3) Each full-time teacher should have a maximum of 20 teaching sessions per week.

As for the principle of salary distribution for teachers and staff, it is: after deducting the school building rent from the total amount of all tuition revenue, 30% is used for the school's operating expenses, and 70% is used for the salaries of teachers and staff. As for the distribution of teachers' and staff's salaries, 30% of the teachers' and staff's salaries is used for the salaries of the staff, and 70% is used for the salaries of the teachers.

Based on the above standards, and with the changes in the wartime environment! Assuming that the number of students in each grade is 40, and the full-time teachers increase their working hours to 30 teaching sessions per week, according to the Municipal Education Bureau's standards for collecting student fees: (Junior high school fee standard)

The tuition revenue per grade is 240,000 yuan.

The monthly classroom rental fee per grade is tentatively set at 200 yuan, totaling 1,200 yuan. According to 30% of 238,800 yuan, or 71,640 yuan, for the school's operating expenses, there is still a remaining 167,160 yuan. Then, deducting 30% of the staff's salaries, or 50,148 yuan, the remaining teacher salaries are 117,012 yuan. The monthly teacher salary (calculated for six months) is 19,502 yuan, and the weekly teacher salary is 4,875.50 yuan. With 30 teaching sessions per week per class, each teaching session totals approximately 162.50 yuan. Each full-time teacher teaches 30 sessions per week and receives a weekly teacher salary of 4,875 yuan, with a monthly salary of 19,360 yuan. With this amount, it is impossible to maintain a living in Shanghai, even for a "bachelor," and it is impossible to maintain the minimum requirement of three meals a day. As for supporting a family, even with the "priority ration rice" of three dou per month, which is converted to 12,000 yuan at the recent peak black market rice price of 40,000 yuan per dan, the total monthly income is 31,360 yuan. It is indeed difficult to support a family of four with this amount of income. However, if the government has a firm grasp and can find a way to compensate for the living expenses of all teachers and staff in the city who are deficient as a result of complying with the standards for tuition fees promulgated by the bureau, then it is unnecessary to say that the various private primary and secondary schools should absolutely comply with government laws and regulations. Otherwise, the education authorities should also pay attention to reality and should not disregard the lives of teachers and staff.

However, based on the facts of the past semester, almost all principals of private schools in the city have made huge profits. Those who used tuition revenue to open ham stores, and those who used tuition income as capital for the school principal to "run a side business" (see "A Record of the Investigation of School Stores" in the January 18th issue of the New China News), are not worth mentioning. Even those who "abide by the rules" and only use the collected tuition fees to earn interest are making considerable profits. Let's calculate again using the above examples, the principal's income, and the actual income and expenditure situation as follows:

With a revenue of 240,000 yuan per grade, calculating with a monthly interest rate of 10%, the actual revenue per grade at the end of the first month is already 264,000 yuan. Paying the first month's teacher and staff salaries of 27,860 yuan, plus the first month's classroom rental fee of 200 yuan, totals 28,060 yuan. Adding the school's operating expenses of 11,940 yuan, the total expenditure for the first month is 40,000 yuan.

Subsequent expenses remain the same, while the income is still calculated according to the above method. After six months, the income and expenditure are offset, and a net profit of more than 116,000 yuan can be obtained. The salaries of teachers and staff under the expenditure item remain the same each month, and the rent aspect, in fact, rarely increases. On the operating expenses side, there is no such huge expenditure per classroom each month.

Therefore, according to this calculation, the principal of each classroom with 40 students can obtain a minimum net profit of more than 116,500 yuan in one semester. If there are a total of six grades in junior and senior high school, with 40 students in each grade, the net profit obtained by the principal will reach more than 699,800 yuan. This huge amount of income is taken from the labor and effort of teachers and staff and goes into the principal's private pockets. This unfairness is also an undeniable fact. We believe that the distribution of teachers' and staff's salaries must be re-adjusted to achieve a reasonable level of sharing both the good and the bad, and to avoid the unfair situation of happiness and suffering being vastly different.

As for how to distribute the salaries in a reasonable way, the following points can be provided for reference:

(1) The salaries of teachers and staff are paid in one lump sum for six months at the beginning of the semester.

(2) The salaries of teachers and staff are prepaid for three months at the beginning of the semester, and the remaining three months are divided into six installments and paid monthly.

(3) 70% of the monthly interest earned from tuition fees is extracted as a "living allowance" in addition to the teachers' and staff's salaries. (For example, if the interest income in the first month is 24,000 yuan, 16,800 yuan should be extracted as a "living allowance" in addition to the teachers' and staff's salaries. The remainder will be used as the principal's "living allowance" to demonstrate fairness.)

Originally, the salary distribution method promulgated by the ministry was a fair arrangement. However, when this method was promulgated, neither the rise and fall of currency values nor the fluctuations of commodity prices were as crazy as they are now. Therefore, in order to adapt to the current economic situation and to achieve a reasonable solution to the lives of both "labor and management" in the education sector, it is impossible not to change the facts. Regarding this point, the principals of private primary and secondary schools should also be deeply ashamed of being criticized as "school store owners" and should treat teachers and staff with a fair attitude and a spirit of "shared destiny," devoting themselves to the education cause to which the life of the nation and the people is entrusted. At the same time, it is also hoped that the government authorities will face the difficult realities and give full consideration to the rescue of dropouts, and also attach equal importance to maintaining the lives of teachers and staff.

In short, it is necessary to endure hardships and reduce material enjoyment in life during wartime, but we cannot ignore the need to guarantee the minimum living standard. The so-called "starving stomach to serve the public" is not something that can be done in real life.

### Japanese Commando Units Severely Damage American Forces

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since landing on the southern coast of Lingayen Gulf on the 9th, American forces have been exerting all efforts to establish a bridgehead there. They have recently launched offensives but have encountered fierce counterattacks from Japanese forces near the coast between Lingayen and Dagupan, resulting in heavy casualties. Currently, they have advanced to the Agno River, between ten kilometers south of Lingayen and twenty-five kilometers south of Dagupan, with a portion of their forces crossing the southern bank of the Agno River. Simultaneously, enemy forces facing San Fabian are also expanding their bridgehead, utilizing undulating terrain about one hundred to two hundred meters high to construct fortifications. A portion of the American forces has broken into the Japanese first line of defense, intensifying the battle. However, viewed broadly, the decisive battle between the main forces on both sides in the Luzon Island campaign has not yet reached its climax. General Yamashita, the supreme commander of the Japanese forces in the Philippines, upon assuming his post, immediately ordered his subordinates to exert their fighting spirit in the vast Philippine territory. Luzon Island, resembling a continent in shape and possessing the characteristics of mainland warfare geographically, is a battlefield where the Japanese forces are most proficient. The main Japanese forces are maximally utilizing the geographical characteristics of Luzon Island, maintaining an immovable defense, and preparing for battle. Since the enemy landing, Japanese commando units have been continuously infiltrating enemy positions day and night with war poles and hand grenades, engaging in brave attacks. On the night of the 16th, several powerful Japanese commando units launched fierce attacks on enemy positions in San Fabian, Alacan, six kilometers east of San Fabian at Labit, seven kilometers east of San Fabian, and other locations, achieving significant results. On that night, Lieutenant Sato led commando troops, taking advantage of the night, to infiltrate the enemy position in Alacan, destroying eight new tanks, forty-six self-propelled guns, and many motor trucks, and also blowing up a grain and ammunition depot about one kilometer long. Lieutenant Sato then made a lone advance into the enemy position in Bitik, six kilometers east of San Fabian, destroying eleven enemy barracks with hand grenades. By this morning, the entire unit had returned safely to their defenses. Furthermore, the commando unit led by Lieutenant Urakami attacked the enemy position in Labit on the night of the 16th, killing a large number of enemy soldiers and capturing four heavy machine guns, three light machine guns, one automatic rifle, and about two thousand rounds of handguns and machine gun ammunition. Other Japanese suicide squads that infiltrated San Fabian also achieved great success. On the night of the 16th, large explosions and fires occurred in the enemy camp, causing many areas to be burned. The enemy artillery positions around San Fabian, Labit, and Alacan had been fiercely shelling the Japanese positions for days, but after the Japanese commando units attacked, they ceased fire from the night of the 16th to the morning of the 18th, completely halting their operations. At the same time, after a fierce attack by elite Japanese units north of San Fabian, enemy casualties reached about one thousand six hundred by the 17th, not including those killed by the Japanese assaults. In addition, one enemy heavy artillery piece was destroyed, and fourteen boats were sunk. The number of heavy and light machine guns, handguns, and vehicles captured and destroyed was extremely high. Even before the main Japanese forces have moved, the enemy has already suffered heavy damage. Therefore, the Japanese commando tactics have terrified the enemy.

### American Supply Difficulties After Landing in the Philippines

Zurich, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch obtained in Geneva, after the American forces landed on Luzon Island, the Allied merchant fleet must simultaneously supply both the eastern and western fronts, making the shipping problem extremely difficult. The round trip from the United States to the Philippines takes one hundred to one hundred and four days, allowing for only two or three round trips per year. The Washington Quartermaster Corps expects General MacArthur to face real difficulties in supply. There are two major difficulties: (1) The Philippine theater consists of thousands of small islands, with very narrow waterways, making navigation difficult. (2) The American supply lines connecting Leyte, Mindoro, and Luzon are constantly threatened by the Japanese air force.

### Urgent Appeal!

Within Ten Days - Achieve the Goal - Five Thousand Students - Eagerly Awaiting

"In just ten short days, the predetermined goal must be achieved,"—20 million yuan. Because in just ten more days, schools will open, and poor students are like baby birds waiting to be fed, waiting for the distribution of scholarships. And we have been running around calling for help, almost to the point of exhaustion. In the past fifty days, the donations received have only reached six-tenths of the goal; even if the remainder is raised, it will still be insufficient for distribution. There is too little porridge for too many monks, and we always feel caught in a dilemma. Some people often worry on our behalf, thinking that even if we raise 45 million yuan for more than 4,500 students, each person will only receive 10,000 yuan, and in fact, this 10,000 yuan is not enough. That is true, but we have a firm belief that we can achieve the goal within ten days. Moreover, Shanghai has so many enthusiastic people and so many wealthy merchants. Would they stand idly by? I think no one wants to see poor students drop out of school for no reason! And no one wants to see the scholarship movement on the verge of collapse! Our only wish is that all the virtuous and enlightened individuals will quickly donate so time goes by like an arrow. Do not hesitate! Do not wait and see! Poor students are waiting impatiently.

(Note) This newspaper's "special fundraising" has been enthusiastically promoted by various circles in Shanghai, for which we are deeply grateful. In particular, the students from various schools have provided the strongest support. However, fundraising has a certain method. For example, when soliciting donations from relatives and friends individually, first fill out the recognition team notification form and send the donation to this newspaper, or notify this newspaper to send someone to collect the donation. Only "official receipts" will be considered valid. Recently, students from a certain school have been publicly soliciting donations in public places. This method is prone to cause misunderstandings and many abuses, for which this newspaper is not responsible. We hope that the students of various schools will pay attention.

Special Issue on Tuition Fee Standards

Introduction

This semester has ended, and the next semester is about to begin. Regarding the issue of tuition fees for all levels of schools in the next semester, although the Municipal Education Bureau has announced fee standards, there are different opinions due to different standpoints. Schools argue that tuition fees should be increased proportionally due to high prices, while parents argue that tuition fees should not increase sharply due to the high cost of living. Teachers and staff hope that schools will improve their treatment with the increased tuition fees. The standards set by the Education Bureau also have their objective reasons and are by no means easy to decide. This newspaper has received many letters expressing opinions from all sides. We have selected several articles to compile into a special issue, trying to preserve the subjective opinions of the commentators as much as possible, to provide objective judgments to the authorities and those concerned about education, in order to stimulate research and obtain a more reasonable conclusion. In addition to the four articles published in this issue, another article will be published in the weekly review. We hope readers will pay attention. In addition, it is heard that the education authorities are already considering increasing the fee standards and deciding to announce them. The main purpose should still be to take into account the burden on parents and the actual expenses of the school, and it will certainly not be as high as the standards set by some private schools, which can be imagined.

### Save the Parents of Elementary School Students

— Da Ke

Recently, prices have soared. Parents of elementary school students not only bear the heavy pressure of supporting the whole family, but also have to raise funds for their children's tuition fees for the next semester. According to the highest standards for tuition fees charged by private primary and secondary schools set by the Education Bureau, the lower grades of elementary schools should not exceed 3,200 yuan, the middle grades should not exceed 3,600 yuan, and the higher grades should not exceed 4,000 yuan (see Shenbao on the 9th of this month). However, the reality is quite different. According to what the author has heard, Zhongxi Elementary School has decided to charge 22,000 yuan, Peter Elementary School has set 20,000 yuan internally, and other private elementary schools generally charge more than 10,000 yuan. It can be said that there are very few schools that charge according to the highest standards of the Municipal Education Bureau. Assuming that a parent has to support four school-age children, the expenses, including books, etc., will inevitably require raising nearly 100,000 yuan. Given the current difficult living conditions, most parents cannot afford it, and the result is only dropping out of school. Some people may say that if school fees are too high, they can change to another school, but on the one hand, school fees are generally increasing, and on the other hand, elementary school students must choose schools that are closer to home and convenient for commuting, and there is often no possibility of changing schools.

I don't know what standards are used to calculate the high tuition fees charged by general elementary schools. Assuming that each elementary school student's tuition fee is 20,000 yuan, and there are 40 students in a class (in fact, about 50), 800,000 yuan can be collected. If teachers' salaries are calculated at 70% (according to Article 4 of the fee standards set by the Education Bureau), 560,000 yuan can be obtained. If there is one teacher per class on average, then the monthly salary (averaged over six months) will be no less than 100,000 yuan. Not only is the salary of university professors beyond reach, but even in terms of the salaries of ordinary people, it may not be so high!

Since the Education Bureau has set the highest standards for tuition fees, what attitude does it take towards these schools that do not follow the standards and charge seven or eight times higher than the standards? In order to maintain the government's prestige and reduce school dropouts, the excess parts that have been collected should be ordered to be returned. If the fees have been set but not collected, they should be ordered to be revised. If there is any violation, the board of directors should be directly ordered to rehire the principals and teachers.

Finally, I have a word to say to these schools that charge seven or eight times higher than the standard. Education is a job, not a business. In this turbulent era, education is the most important part of revitalizing the nation. People who dedicate themselves to education must maintain a minimum standard of living on the one hand, and on the other hand, they must have the spirit of sacrificing for education and cannot be eager for material comfort. Now that the general public is living in such difficult circumstances and elementary school tuition fees are so high, it directly forces students to drop out of school and indirectly cuts off the lifeline of the country. This is certainly not the original intention of education providers. Moreover, although prices are high, elementary school teachers' monthly salaries of 100,000 yuan are also too luxurious, aren't they?

### My Opinion on the Tuition Fee Issue

— Qian Tianqi

After the news of the restriction on tuition fee standards for private schools was published in various newspapers this time, many parents were relieved, but people in the education sector were very disturbed. Some private school authorities who seriously run education have to take into account the burden on students' parents, the lives of teachers and teaching efficiency, and the law; therefore, they have encountered unprecedented difficulties. Here, I would like to discuss the issue of tuition fees (limited to primary and secondary schools) from the perspective of a citizen and propose countermeasures for the reference of those concerned about education.

(1) The General Situation of Private Schools in This Semester: For private schools above the general level, the tuition fees for the last semester were about 6,000 yuan for high schools, 5,800 yuan for junior high schools, and 4,000 yuan for elementary schools (when tuition fees were set, the price of rice was 8,000 yuan per stone). Teachers' salaries accounted for more than 70% of the total income. Teachers' salaries are calculated by the number of hours. The average salary for high school teachers is about 200 yuan per hour per week, 180 yuan for junior high school teachers, and 120 yuan for elementary school teachers per 50 minutes. Full-time teachers teach an average of 25 hours, and the monthly salary is 20,000 yuan for high schools, 18,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 12,000 yuan for elementary school teachers. These schools have more students and more income, so they have voluntarily given up requesting food rations and education association subsidies. The number of teaching hours per week is more than 31 hours in middle schools and more than 1,400 minutes in elementary schools. The allocation of courses, the progress of teaching, the general study and the examination of students' homework and grades can all follow the old habits before the war without any slack. This semester has finally passed smoothly. The tuition fees for the next semester are about 30,000 yuan for high schools, 107,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 16,000 yuan for elementary schools. As far as I know, after most schools announced the amount of tuition fees, the number of students who paid the fixed amount of money was more than 80%. As for schools below the level, the tuition fees for this period are between 3,000 and 5,000 yuan, but some only have classes for half a day, or the number of hours per week is only about 25 hours. Teachers' salaries can only provide teachers with the lowest standard of living. Teachers and students are free to be absent. Teachers need to be of lower and lower quality. Students have no homework other than class.

(2) Review of the Recent Tuition Fee Notice: According to the news published in Shenbao, the tuition fees for high schools in the next semester are set at 7,500 yuan, 6,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 5,000 yuan for elementary schools. In addition, the amount of food rations has been increased (recently, 3 dou per person per month) and administrative subsidies have been allocated. This plan was also quite reasonable; but why are the authorities and teachers of various private schools so disturbed? There are three reasons. First, it is said that the standard for tuition fees was set when the price of rice was still 12,000 yuan. Now that prices have soared, if it is not modified, then in another month or two, the school will simply become a dried fish. Second, the food ration has been increased to 3 dou this month, which is enough for one and a half people to consume. On average, a family of three still has one and a half people who have no rations (this only refers to eating raw rice). As for teachers' salary income, if it is in accordance with the prescribed standards, it is about the same as this semester, between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan. How many coal balls, how much green vegetables, how many pounds of butter, and how many pairs of socks can this amount buy? If there is any obstacle to the distribution of rations, the consequences can be imagined. Therefore, teachers cannot help but be disturbed. Third, assuming that the administrative subsidy fee is 500,000 yuan per school per semester on average, but according to the current price index, the monthly repair and purchase of school buildings, school equipment, staff and school workers' meals, water and electricity, rent and taxes, teaching consumption, and miscellaneous consumption of each school are more than 500,000 yuan. How can the budget be balanced? Moreover, the number of large, medium, and small schools in Shanghai that should receive subsidies is far more than 300. It is still questionable whether each school can get an average of 500,000 yuan. Therefore, the authorities of various schools cannot help but have some doubts.

(3) Reasonable Standard for Tuition Fee Increase: In a country that is on track, tuition fees are not a problem. Elementary schools not only do not charge fees, but even textbooks are provided by the state. But in the past, Shanghai had a population of 3 million, with more than 250,000 school-age children, while the number of municipal primary and secondary school places was less than 50,000. Therefore, private schools came into being. But now, when people's purchasing power is extremely weak, middle and lower class families can no longer afford private school tuition fees, so there is a call for tuition fee restrictions. Speaking of the tuition fee standards of private schools, I think there should only be one formula:

(The minimum cost of food, clothing, shelter, and medical care for the average family of three of all school teachers + the total administrative expenses of the school) - (Government subsidies + food and daily necessities rations) = the total amount of tuition fees that students should bear.

The Chinese have always prided themselves on being a country that respects teachers and values education. Can we sit idly by and watch teachers' hair unkempt (it now costs 500 yuan to get a haircut), their bodies dirty (it costs 1,000 yuan to take a bath), and their clothes tattered (a set of old cloth short shirts and pants costs 8,000 yuan, including labor)? Can we sit idly by and watch teachers' wives and children cold and hungry, and teachers go to the podium with empty stomachs? Can we sit idly by and watch teachers suffer from malnutrition and be sick in public (it now costs 2,000 yuan for medical treatment and medicine for a cold and fever)? If the government takes into account that student families cannot afford huge tuition fees, it can only find ways to provide relief, and it cannot simply think of reducing the minimum living expenses of teachers. If it is considered that the government is unable to bear it, then students' parents will have to bear more. You need to know how much Central Reserve Bank notes the monthly feed for a Dutch cow costs now. Is the value of a teacher's teaching really less than ten pounds of milk? The manager of the dairy farm also knows that the feed for the cow can be reduced a little, and the quality can be slightly worse, but he calculates that the amount of milk produced will also decrease, so he has to spare no expense. This is the so-called minimum cost of living. In short, you get what you pay for. If you want the horse to be good, you have to let it eat more grass. I believe that students' parents are willing to endure it temporarily within the possible range, so that their children will not drop out of school, and they will not be greedy for small advantages at the moment, and let their children suffer from negligent teaching and waste a semester of time. You need to know that children's education expenses should be included as the first item in the family expenditure budget. After all, people live for their children. As for the school authorities, they should be economically absolutely open, and strive to save administrative expenses (but the teaching equipment, such as books and instruments, should not be less than the minimum), and the proportion of teachers' salaries should be increased as much as possible. As for the teachers, in addition to maintaining the minimum family life, they should not have extravagant demands, strive for a strict life, strive for serious teaching, and do not collect any extra fees from students under false pretenses. In this way, even if the average student parent bears a little more tuition fees, it is not a waste. There is one more point. The so-called minimum living expenses of teachers cannot be based on the life at the beginning of the school year. The living index in the middle of the semester should be used as the standard. However, such calculations are quite difficult. Therefore, I advocate changing the collection of real objects according to the example of the land tax and collecting rice, about 7 dou for high schools, 6.5 dou for junior high schools, and 5 dou for elementary schools, which can be used as a precedent. Teachers' salaries will be paid with rice. I know that this proposal is not easy to get the support of all parties, but we really can't think of any reasons to object.

(4) Remedial Measures After the Tuition Fee Increase: Now, according to what I know, in the dozens of relatively excellent schools, after the tuition fees for the next semester were set, only 20% of the students did not pay the retention money. Among them, 10 were going to receive scholarships from the Xin Shenbao newspaper, or were going to transfer schools, find employment, or return to their hometowns. Ten people were indeed unable to afford the tuition fees due to economic difficulties. For these students, the school should naturally waive their tuition fees. As for the schools with poor grades, some of the students who have not paid the fixed amount account for more than 50%. This situation is more serious (naturally, some of them are not because they cannot afford the tuition fees). In addition, there are new students who are willing to enroll, but cannot afford the tuition fees and are wandering outside the school gate. These all have to find another way. I have four countermeasures.

(1) The authorities should strictly order all schools whose tuition fees exceed the standards (which must be revised according to the living index) to strictly follow the law to increase the number of free and reduced-fee students and send personnel to conduct thorough investigations.

(2) All schools whose tuition fees exceed the standards shall not receive any subsidies, grants, or food rations.

(3) The municipal government can take out 30% to 50% of the original total amount of administrative subsidies for private schools and increase the funding for municipal schools, instructing the city to expand the number of schools and classes to accommodate students who have dropped out of school.

(4) All schools that receive administrative subsidies and other subsidies should re-regulate the number of free and reduced-fee students.

Finally, I will summarize it; (1) Do not ignore the reasons why some private schools perform well. (2) The adjustment of tuition fees must be considered under the condition that it does not hinder "the stability of teachers' lives." Do not interfere with schools where teachers' lives are relatively stable. (3) It seems unnecessary to reduce the fees for private schools where the tuition fees for the next semester are over 20,000 yuan and the number of retained students is 80%. (4) The tuition fee standards for private schools recently announced must be revised again. If the fees charged by schools exceed this revised standard, they will not be subsidized or given food rations. (5) The revised standard for tuition fees must be based on the living index of teachers' families. (6) The living index of teachers' families should be determined by calculating the living index in the middle of the semester based on the rate of increase in the living index in the most recent half year. The first semester must calculate the index in April, and the second semester must calculate the index in November. (7) A part of the tuition fees of private schools adopts a free system, and a part of the private schools that receive subsidies and food rations, and all municipal schools, charge fees according to the newly set standards, and increase the number of students and classes. In this way, the three aspects of students, teachers, and regulations can be taken care of.

### An Appeal to Private Schools

— Zhang Meng

According to a notice received by a parent from a certain private school authority, they are demanding payment of a reservation fee of $500 per student, a school janitor subsidy of $40, and a winter vacation practice paper fee of $100, totaling $640. They are also stipulating the tuition fees for the next semester: Senior high school $28,000, junior high school $26,000, middle school $24,000, and elementary school $16,000 (including book fees), all to be paid in full before the Lunar New Year. In contrast, the tuition fees for municipal schools are: Senior high school $2,400, junior high school $1,800, senior elementary school $1,600, intermediate elementary school $1,400, and junior elementary school $1,200. The tuition fees charged by municipal and private schools are as different as heaven and earth. So, what is the basis for these private schools' standards?

It is very common for a family to have five or six children in school. Enrolling children in municipal schools is currently very difficult, but enrolling them in private schools requires a family to pay over ten thousand dollars in tuition for five or six children. Parents earning a monthly salary of two or three thousand dollars must consider both household expenses and their children's education. In reality, it is impossible, and their children will have to drop out of school.

Everyone has a sense of compassion. I hope that the municipal authorities will strictly supervise private schools and implement the school fee standards announced a few days ago.

### How to Solve the Tuition Fee Problem

— Gui Fu

Time flies, and the semester is coming to an end again. Due to soaring prices, tuition fees for the next semester in various schools have increased several times compared to the previous semester. It is rumored that some private schools in this city will charge the following tuition fees for the next semester: elementary school from $15,000 to $20,000, junior high school from $20,000 to $25,000, senior high school from $25,000 to $30,000, and universities over $40,000. While the increase in tuition fees aims to maintain school expenses and teachers' livelihoods, it also increases the burden on parents, which will inevitably lead to a large number of students dropping out of school. As citizens, we are concerned about this serious problem. I, despite my limited knowledge, would like to propose a few specific measures for the authorities to adopt:

1.  Impose Education Taxes. I remember that someone proposed this idea in the "National Forum." The government can levy entertainment taxes and taxes on various consumer goods and luxury goods, or add a small amount to these taxes as subsidies.

2.  Increase Rations. Compared to the salaries in other industries, teachers' salaries are the lowest. The income of a middle school teacher is only enough to maintain their personal life; the income of an elementary school teacher is not even enough to maintain their personal life (even in schools that follow the Education Bureau's regulations for open financial management). Fortunately, the education authorities, understanding the difficult lives of teachers, provided a special ration of rice last semester. This allowed them to barely maintain their personal lives. However, this is only limited to individuals. To support a family and allow teachers to focus on their work, the same rations should be provided to their families. Mr. Dai, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, was particularly concerned about this issue during his speech at the end of last year, and the *Shen Bao*'s editorial also made a strong appeal recently. We have high hopes for this.

3.  Use Commercial Profits to Subsidize Education Expenses. The Economic Bureau should order various trade associations to bear a proportional share of education expenses based on the number of their members and their position in the commercial world. Subsequently, whenever prices rise, this funding should increase by the same multiple as the price increase.

In addition to being responsible for raising these funds, the Education Bureau and the Economic Bureau should also be responsible for supervising and managing the funds. The management must be fair, and a detailed investigation of the situation of each school must be conducted. There should also be reasonable regulations for teachers' salaries, and measures should be taken to prevent corruption.

In summary, although these are not thorough solutions to the tuition fee problem, as long as one of them can be implemented, the tuition fees for the next semester can at least be temporarily resolved. Students can avoid the worry of dropping out of school. However, "stopping boiling water by pouring it out is not as good as removing the firewood from under the pot." To fundamentally solve this problem, one must start by stabilizing prices. If prices continue to rise, even if tuition fees are reduced to a minimum, parents will still be unable to afford them and will have to force their children to become street vendors, apprentices, or even scavengers (this phenomenon is already very common). "He who loves his country must love his people." I hope that the authorities will address the earnest expectations of us common people and find a solution as soon as possible.

### Unwavering Faith

— Captain Shioda, China Area Fleet News Department

Since the beginning of the New Year, the war has intensified. In the Philippines theater, the enemy Americans landed in Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island on the 9th of this month, fully demonstrating America's posture of a general counterattack on the Philippines. It is true that the enemy Americans, with their landing at Leyte Gulf on October 20th of last year, their landing on Mindoro Island on December 25th, and the current landing at Lingayen Gulf, have been able to proclaim to their own people that the day of the Philippines' recovery can be foreseen. However, from our perspective, it is precisely the opposite. The enemy Americans are now deeply mired in an unprecedentedly astonishing war of attrition. Although the United States suffered a devastating blow in the Leyte Gulf and Philippine Sea battles last October, they still collected all their remaining fleets, implemented a fleet preservation policy, and used diplomatic tactics to manipulate Churchill, not allowing the British fleet to grow too large and increase its voice, so they demanded that the British fleet be sent to East Asia to fight. In short, the enemy Americans' goal is to break through Japan's inner line with one blow. Due to the current unstable domestic situation and the dead-end strategy, the enemy Americans have had to pay a great price in the Philippines. If we estimate the huge losses in the Philippines, the success of the three landings at Leyte, Mindoro, and Lingayen is by no means a blessing for the United States.

Situation of Battles in the Philippines Area

Everyone knows that landing on the Philippines, which consists of over four thousand islands, is extremely easy and not surprising, nor is it due to the Japanese army's lack of foresight. It is just like the arrangement made in advance by the Japanese army, hoping that the Americans would attack along the ninety-two miles from Lingayen to Manila, in order to carry out the tactic of concentrating and annihilating them.

However, everyone should not ignore that the Japanese army on Leyte Island is still completely intact. In seventy days, it held back one million tons of American ships and tens of thousands of troops, and annihilated tens of thousands of American soldiers, while always protecting the Bulaven and San Pablo airfields. As for the losses suffered by the enemy Americans when two divisions landed on Mindoro as a springboard for attacking Luzon, they were also enormous.

MacArthur once declared that recovering the Philippines would require 200,000 troops. From this point, it can be proved how huge the military supplies, aircraft, and ammunition that the general counterattack will require. However, according to information from various sources, it can be determined that the enemy Americans will concentrate all their strength on the Philippines at any cost and regardless of any sacrifice. In terms of troop strength alone, although 200,000 troops have already been concentrated on the Philippines, this manpower and material resources are constantly being attacked by the Japanese army's courageous attacks and suffering enormous losses. In particular, the Japanese air force has all become Kamikaze special attack teams, bombing enemy American ships. Even reconnaissance planes carry bombs to bomb enemy ships. Special submarines have formed swimming special attack teams, each carrying a bomb, to attack enemy American transport ships. All of the above facts have given the enemy Americans unexpected and enormous attrition, causing the enemy Americans to panic.

Nimitz and MacArthur, stealing past the Japanese submarine and air force surveillance networks from Australia, New Guinea, Hollandia, etc., and then through Ulithi in Palau, bring in soldiers and equipment, which are attacked everywhere by the Japanese army's human torpedoes, often destroying eight hundred, one thousand, or one thousand five hundred people at a time. Such losses cannot be considered small for the United States. These special attack teams will, together with the human torpedo breaching tactics at 203 Hill carried out by our fathers or grandfathers in the previous Russo-Japanese War, be forever recorded in history.

Such enormous attrition will certainly have a significant impact on the enemy Americans' combat power in the final decisive battle. From this point, it can also be seen that the reason why the anxious enemy is constantly carrying out battles that are not permitted by tactics and advancing into the Japanese army's inner line. In other words, it can be determined that the enemy Americans are establishing several bridgeheads to carry out unsound operations, using adventure to prevent domestic unrest. Therefore, the enemy Americans are trying hard to land in southern China or Annam and establish bridgeheads to cut off Japan's supply line with the South Seas. The enemy seems to have already understood that whether they are stopped in the Philippines or proceed to attack the mainland, they will suffer extremely bitter battles. It can really be said that an American path to decline has already unfolded before the enemy Americans who are trying to destroy Japan. The enemy knows very well that if they carry out a long-term war, they will only collapse internally, disintegrate, and destroy themselves. The enemy's attempt to carry out unreasonable operations on the mainland can also be guessed from the fact that General Nimitz dispatched the main fleet to disrupt the waters east of Taiwan and the Philippines. Furthermore, in terms of material resources, the United States also has an absolute advantage, and the antiquated British dilapidated fleet is also coordinating with Nimitz's offensive, continuing to stir up trouble in the waters off Sumatra. In addition, there are the American Fifth and Seventh Fleets operating in the Philippines, Fraser's British Fleet, and the Australian Fleet, all actively operating. This is enough to see where the enemy will operate further.

Enemy Americans' Attrition Cannot Be Sustained

As for where the enemy will send a large number of mainland troops to China, the United States is suffering from the depletion of human resources, which is an undeniable weakness of the enemy. If the enemy American transport ships currently engaged in diversionary operations in Lamon Bay attempt to land in Lamon Bay, the outcome must be that a considerable force will be dispatched from MacArthur's army, which is currently engaged in combat. However, MacArthur, who is personally directing operations on Luzon Island, is already suffering from a shortage of troops, so how can he have the spare capacity to send troops to help others? Under the guidance of General Yamashita, the commander-in-chief, and Vice Admiral Okawachi, the father of the Shanghai Iron-Blooded Landing Force, the Japanese army is not carrying out a decisive battle in Lingayen, but wants to wait at leisure and fight the enemy in the great plains of Luzon south of the Agno River. Even if the enemy has the continuous reinforcement of a superior air force, there is no doubt that the enemy will suffer enormous losses in manpower and material resources.

A few days ago, three enemy American destroyers, full of troops, which had gathered in New Guinea, were blown away by a typhoon and their whereabouts are unknown. It can be said that this is no small loss for the enemy. Even if the entire population of the United States, 136 million, is calculated as Americans, even if the number of people who can be mobilized is 50%, it has already exceeded 50% now. For example, Secretary of the Army Stimson said on the 11th of this month: "The war against Japan has already used more troops than budgeted, but in order to meet the demands of the front line, we must continue to draft soldiers from farms, factories, and government agencies." This year alone, it has already been decided to draft 80,000 soldiers in January, 80,000 soldiers in February, and 100,000 soldiers in March. However, for fear that production on the other hand will decrease, they are trying their best to make production machinery automatic in order to save manpower. In any case, the excessively high rate of manpower attrition means that the United States will be unable to cope.

As for material resources, domestic unrest is forcing war leaders to adopt short-term operational strategies. This year's aircraft production has decreased by 2,000 aircraft compared to last year, which is the reason why the American army is eager to come far to the Philippines and the eastern Pacific to seek an opportunity for a decisive battle. However, the enemy Americans, having not yet recovered from the material attrition suffered in the Taiwan-Philippines sea and air battles, will never establish favorable tactics.

The Japanese Fleet Appears and Disappears Like Ghosts

The Japanese Combined Fleet will certainly not allow the Nimitz Fleet to invade Taiwan, Annam, the South China Sea, or the Philippines. The Third Fleet, the USS Halsey, which barely escaped from Japanese shelling in the Philippine Sea battle, will certainly not escape Japanese shelling this time.

Just like the Japanese Combined Fleet staying in Japanese waters forty years ago, it seems to be adopting a defensive operational form on the surface, but as soon as the opportunity matures, it will immediately adopt an offensive operation. The excellent tradition of the Imperial Japanese Navy has always been offensive. As soon as the opportunity arrives, it will immediately strike without hesitation, and then it will always eliminate the American-Australian Allied Fleet and achieve victory. Fraser's British Fleet will repeat the tragic scene of its disastrous defeat in the Philippine Sea battle.

Last October, after the Japanese Combined Fleet achieved a brilliant victory east of the Philippines, it appeared and disappeared like a ghost, making the enemy Americans suffer from nervous pain. During this period, Japan replenished its lost aircraft, worked hard to prepare cannons and torpedoes, and conserved its energy to wait for an opportunity. Furthermore, our Japanese naval soldiers are working hard to carry out the task of replenishing the Japanese army in the Philippines, which is engaged in difficult operations, or to carry out transportation line protection operations, or to attack the activities of enemy American submarines and aircraft that are nibbling at the South China Sea, and are carrying out the most difficult transportation replenishment.

The so-called war of attrition is a war of replenishment, which is the only factor that determines the victory or defeat of the Philippines, and which is the only factor that determines the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the operations of the Imperial Navy are extremely important, and the Japanese China Fleet is also carrying out this equally important task day and night. The Japanese China Fleet, together with many other fleets, is centered on the Combined Fleet, and is advancing on the vast Pacific Ocean towards the path of defeating the enemy Americans. However, the current decisive battleground has already shifted to the Philippine Islands. At the same time, the enemy Americans want to further use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield, exposing their ambition, so the mission of our Japanese China Fleet will be correspondingly elevated.

Advancing Towards the Path of Victory

Our Japanese soldiers and civilians are completely united, giving the enemy Americans fatal blows everywhere on the sea and on the land in the Philippines, and exhausting their manpower and material resources, which will naturally lay a solid foundation for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. As mentioned earlier, the decisive battle is an extremely large war of attrition, and at the same time, the decisive battle is a continuous war. For this continuous decisive battle, a thorough victory system is needed now more than ever.

One is to increase production. A few days ago, a reporter said in a report on the decisive battle in the Philippines: "The enemy Americans have a favorable position in terms of air force strength." However, the Japanese soldiers and generals on the front lines of Lingayen personally saw enemy American transport fleets stop sailing due to lack of fuel, according to the reconnaissance of the air force unit. So we can imagine that the Japanese soldiers are eagerly awaiting air force replenishment. Frankly speaking, the replenishment of air force strength is one of the most important tasks at present.

The second is to raise the spirit of courage. Of course, every Japanese person has the unwavering belief in victory engraved in their heart. However, Nimitz is more determined than anyone else to invade the Philippines and the eastern Pacific, and finally establish a foothold on the Chinese mainland. As for MacArthur, he has been boasting every day for three years that he will recover the Philippines. At the same time, the American government, due to its domestic helplessness, will of course launch a torrent of strategic and ideological propaganda like a river bursting its banks. The Chongqing regime, which is lingering on the mainland, will seize this opportunity to launch aerial bombardments and carry out fierce propaganda work in peaceful areas. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party, which has been waiting for this opportunity for a long time, will certainly launch its forte—propaganda work—in Shanghai in order to expand its territory. All of this is still in the realm of imagination. We Japanese people, in Shanghai, which is in such ideological chaos, if we respond to the ever-changing phenomena with an unwavering belief in victory, then the chaotic thoughts in Shanghai can be swept away, which is easy to achieve. Therefore, everyone must make the idea of "not stopping the war until victory is achieved" their only belief.

The Greater East Asia War is certainly a huge war of attrition, but striving for victory in the war depends on the nation's will to persevere to the end. So, do not be worried or happy by the temporary changes in the war situation. Speak less and do more, and silently guard your respective occupational positions. No matter what difficult conditions you encounter, if you can persevere to the end and stick to your work, then I dare to assert that the enemy American fleet and landing army will certainly be buried in the belly of the fish, and not a single fragment will return. (January 15th)

Map of the Battle Situation on Luzon Island

The battle on Luzon Island is currently centered on Lingayen Gulf, with fierce fighting unfolding along a narrow front of fifty kilometers. Enemy troops are suffering fierce attacks from the Japanese army along the Agno River near Lingayen City. The Japanese army's powerful advancing troops also broke into the enemy's position near San Fabian, achieving great results.

### Smoke and Clouds

— Lin Mang

In the golden sunset, the wind whispers in the treetops. In the shadows, a crumbling section of wall. On the wall, clinging ivy, covered in moss and water stains. In the center, a huge character for "Good Fortune," its original vermilion paint still faintly discernible, like a weary eye, staring at the empty mansion across the way. Beside the steps in front of the door, a pair of stone lions stand guard. From their imposing bodies, we can imagine the past glory of this mansion. Their eyes are wide open—are they lamenting: failing to hold back the bygone years? Or perhaps they are angry: sometimes a gust of wind sweeps past, leaving a layer of dirty street dust on their backs?

The empty mansion, its doors wide open; the peeling paint on the doors, telling of the vicissitudes of life. Vermilion pillars and ornate railings, some already dismantled, some crookedly remaining—let the wind, rain, and insects corrode their memories. —Like an old man's crutches,勉力 supporting that decaying body. In the courtyard, flourishing weeds obscure the winding paths, and how many crickets are busy in the tangled kudzu vines? The lotus pond is also silted up—it is said that in the days of past glory, a maid, having endured the master's whippings, secretly jumped in. But now, whether hate or admiration, it is all covered by broken stems and withered leaves. On the roof ridge, "tile flowers" grow everywhere. Disordered tiles cover the barren roof frame. Some say it is the mark of wind and rain, others say it was broken by naughty children climbing up to steal bird eggs. In reality, who can complain? Anyway, it is aging.

In the past, who didn't envy the carriages and retinues at the gate. Passersby would also stop to admire this magnificent mansion, listening to the clamor within. When those who loved bustle gathered at the gate, they would be driven away by the doorman's scolding. Those who were driven away, besides sighing, what could they do? Returning home, they would teach their children, comparing the glory here to the model they should strive for in the future.

But, who has truly understood the principle of rise and fall, knowing that this mansion would also decline? Now, where are those who used to scold? Perhaps, like those who often sat here as honored guests, they have dispersed and gone far away.

Only the old servant remains, huddled in a corner of this mansion, having seen all the vicissitudes of life. He is so old: white hair at his temples, a face full of wrinkles, missing teeth, hissing air when he speaks. Stooped, he shuffles along, cherishing past dreams, still maintaining the old attire. But like this mansion, he is also decaying.

At dusk, a traveler passes by, his steps faltering, indicating that he has traveled a long road. He lingers at the gate of this mansion, sighing endlessly.

Because of this, the old servant is deeply surprised. With his hands behind his back, he steps down from the stone steps and glances at the traveler. (He has not forgotten the demeanor of the past.)

"Guest, do you know my master?"

"No." He pauses for a moment: "But, because of our not very different fates, perhaps we are not strangers."

"Then, you must have met my young master."

"No. I also ask you, has your young master ever met me? In such a big world, who will meet whom?"

The old servant is stumped by these strange words.

The traveler wanders around the courtyard, sighing.

"Old servant, what are you waiting for here?"

The old man laughs silently, shaking his head for a while: "Do you think I would leave this house? I have lived half my life here, do you think I would throw it away like garbage? Would I go far away like those who used to eat and dress here?"

The traveler is silent.

"Then, what about your young master?"

"Are you still mentioning him? That prodigal son, a fellow who can't manage money, he went away long ago. He treated the ancestors' legacy as water in a jar. He poured it out, basin by basin, and then left. He never came back. But, it's also pitiful to say, outside, who cares about his food and clothing? He is the young master of a noble family."

The traveler seems thoughtful: "Suppose, he unfortunately died on the road?"

The old servant pauses for a moment. Suddenly, he says resolutely: "No. His ancestors accumulated great virtue, he won't have such a fate."

He sobs.

"Guest, do you know the background of my family?"

"Didn't he inherit a lot of money from his ancestors? He had a distinguished position, and he was also good at managing money. At that time, wasn't the front of this mansion blocked by a large procession of carriages and retinues? Didn't he keep a lot of people, giving them food and drink? But, he had an unfilial son, who scattered all the money after his death. So, he left this desolate place, a place of many memories for him, and went far away."

The old man exclaims in surprise, "How do you know?"

"I have also had such cloud-like days."

"And more," the old man lowers his head, seemingly immersed in the old dreams.

"But, I am tired."

The traveler steps down from the stone steps, brushing the dust from his body. The setting sun casts on him, leaving a lonely shadow on the ground. He stumbles away.

The old man watches his lonely figure, quietly pondering.

A gust of wind passes, raising dust on the street, a gray haze. A few fallen leaves rustle on the ground. Are they also feeling the desolation of this world?

### Actress

— Shi Ting

In the morning, when the stage actress Guo Ying woke up, she heard a soft knock at the door, but she closed her eyes again, ignoring it. She was afraid that the person knocking would become impatient and break in. That person might be a reporter from the tabloid entertainment section, or perhaps a "critic"—no matter who he was, once he latched onto you, the morning would be miserable, with endless flattery that sounded like love talk, asking you for this and that... it was really unbearable.

However, the person knocked gently, without breaking in.

"Miss Guo," it was the voice of the old landlady, "an old man wants to see you."

"Tell him I'm not awake!"

"That won't do, Miss, the old man says he must see you, he has something important."

An old man with something important, strange. She thought, answering,

"Tell him to wait a moment, I haven't gotten up yet! Slowly, hey! What important thing does he have?"

"He won't say, the old man says he can't explain it clearly unless he sees you in person."

The actress sat at the table by the window, opening the letters she received yesterday. One was from the editor of a large magazine, asking her to write something about her recent "trip north," and another was from a fan. This letter, which took a great deal of effort to write, began like this:—

"I believe that being an actress is the noblest and most glorious... profession in the world," followed by a description of Miss Guo's beauty. Finally, he asked her to have coffee with him this afternoon.

The actress smiled as she finished reading the letter, counting that the person had used a total of twenty-one exclamation marks.

"Wu Yunfei"?! She read the man's full name, vaguely remembering a small clerk she met a few days ago at a company on Taishan Road. Wu Yunfei was that small clerk. That day, he entertained our Miss Guo quite diligently—to be honest, why shouldn't he be excited? Why shouldn't he be diligent? Think, in his whole life, could there be anything more significant than this? When Miss Guo bought something, he absolutely refused to accept the money. He also asked her for a signed photo, and wanted her to write like this:

"To Wu Yunfei," the actress thought to herself, tearing the letter with twenty-one exclamation marks to shreds and throwing it in the wastepaper basket. This was just as the old man, whom the old landlady had announced at the beginning of this article, strode into the room with a fierce look.

"Do you live in this room alone?" He looked at the furnishings in the room, asking:

"Two people live here," the actress replied, but she immediately felt that she shouldn't have answered that way. Why didn't she ask back: "Why are you asking?" Or simply chase him out. A stranger asking an actress this question upon first meeting was too dismissive of the other party's status.

However, the man sat down on his own. He seemed to have lost his rationality a little. In fact, such rude behavior was not in line with his upbringing. Read on, and you will know that he is an educated man.

"Miss Guo! Now I have only a glimmer of hope, please rent out this room! Perhaps..."

"Old gentleman, I don't understand what you mean," the actress said, "and besides, this room doesn't belong to me."

"I know, now I'm only asking for your consent, as for him, would he dare object?"

"This makes me even less understanding," the actress said, also muttering to herself: "She (Guo Ying is referring to the actress who lives with her) wouldn't dare object?"

The old man suddenly jumped up: "You vixen! You're playing dumb. Now I understand everything. Tell me, who gave you this room when you came back from Beijing this time? How many coats did he buy you? With so much money, if he doesn't spend it this way, where would it go?"

The actress laughed loudly.

"You're deliberately breaking up my family," the old man said agitatedly like a rooster; "Our family of scholars for generations is going to be ruined by your hand! Playing with actresses, will there be a good result from playing with actresses? Everyone knows that the Wu family is a family of integrity, who doesn't praise my good calligraphy? (Here, Guo Ying laughed again, she knew that some people are most afraid of others not knowing their special talents), take Yunfei, isn't this child always well-behaved?..."

"You say Wu Yunfei, is he your child?" The actress looked at this unfortunate old man, feeling indescribable sorrow. She already understood half of the tragedy.

"Wasn't he always well-behaved?" The old man continued: "But recently he suddenly lost over a hundred thousand, isn't all this money being spent on you?"

"Old gentleman, please calm down first, I want to explain to you, your son, Wu Yunfei, I know him a little..."

"Know him a little? You're lying again!"

"I really only met him once," she finally said, "as for cohabiting with him, etc., it's all nonsense. He probably lost these hundred thousand dollars gambling, or spent it on dance girls. I can guarantee with my personality that we actors will never spend other people's money unclearly, and we never thought of spending other people's money."

"Actress, has integrity? I don't believe your words, if you don't spend other people's money, whose money can you spend?" The old man became agitated again: "I personally found your photo on him, and people in his company all say that he often comes and goes with you..."

"Old gentleman, don't you suspect that this is all made up by your son? As for the signed photo..." So she repeated the truth again.

"Old gentleman, I also want to be impolite to your son!" The actress lengthened her face: "Let's go find him together, I want him to compensate for the damage to my reputation, we actresses are not easy to bully!"

"Miss Guo, don't get angry..." the old man said obsequiously: "It's better to talk it over, I'm just discussing with you, discussing, whether to rent out the room or not is up to you."

"The room doesn't belong to me at all, I told you earlier that two of us live here," she smiled "but that person is not your son, don't misunderstand," then suddenly said sharply: "I can't let others ruin my reputation outside, I want to deal with him!"

"Miss, it's better to talk it over" the old man said: "He didn't ruin your reputation! Don't be angry, this is all my old age's confusion, I didn't ask him clearly, you know, these two days have been so hard for me, my mind is completely muddled, these hundred thousand dollars, even if I broke my old bones and bankrupted my family, I still can't pay it back... Last night, in his drawer, not on him, I slapped him!—Found your photo, I thought this money must have been spent on you—Slapped me—My daughter said to me, you just came back from Beijing, this hundred thousand dollars is probably for renting a house, I thought this made sense, and thought there was a turning point, because if you rent this house, wouldn't you be able to repay this money? I didn't let Yunfei know, I came to see you early this morning, I'm so confused..." he cried, bending over and walking out.

The actress stood silently, she thought of the small clerk she met at that company on Taishan Road a few days ago, and also of the letter written with twenty-one exclamation marks, "2:00 PM this afternoon, I'll be waiting for you at the St. Brother's..." Haha, so confused.

"Being an actress is the noblest... profession in the world!" she repeated this sentence, clenching her teeth.

### Laundry Woman

— Xi Yun

A chill climbs the treetops, the garden is already desolate, only by the ancient well, the laundry woman is working hard. Rolling up her sleeves, bending her waist. One moment using the brush, the next moment using soap; striving to eliminate the dirt.

Rubbing carefully, the soap foam piles up like snow. Never tired of rinsing several times in clear water.

Drying in the sunlight, look—the gauze scarf is as white as new, the armbands vie with the blue sky in purity! The laundry woman, smiling, quietly rubs her swollen hands: "Can I wash away some of the dirt from the world?"

Sports

### The Third Shanghai Basketball League Opens—Hopes for Each Team

Just as the Shenbao Cup Basketball Tournament ended, the Third Shanghai Basketball League followed closely. With the flourishing of Shanghai basketball teams and the dedication of the promoters, the number of participants in the men's and women's groups is very high, which is a good phenomenon in the basketball world. Currently, the league has already started the Group A and women's matches this week, and the Group B matches will be held after this competition is over. In terms of interest, it is completely concentrated at one time, which will inevitably create a phenomenon of early prosperity and later decline. The authorities must have taken such measures to concentrate their efforts, which is not to be criticized. Furthermore, it is understood that this time the divisions are Group A, Group A-B, Group B, and Women's Group, four groups; Group A-A has five teams, the Women's Group has ten teams, and the Group A-B and Group B teams are more numerous. The first two groups adopt a double round-robin system, which gives fans more opportunities to enjoy good games and also brings considerable benefits to their own income. Furthermore, it can be said that more games for good teams can indeed improve the level, achieving multiple goals with one move. The author cannot help but express great admiration for this year's league.

Regarding the participating teams, the Group A and Women's Group teams are largely the same as those in the Shenbao Cup. Taking advantage of the opening, it may be worthwhile to review and express hopes for the heroic teams in Group A and the Women's Group. As for Group A-B and Group B, we will discuss them when there is an opportunity.

### Group A-A: The Five Strongest Teams in Shanghai

This time, those grouped into Group A-A are only five teams due to the scattered nature of the South China team. They are Zhongbei, Hualian, Wang Team, Renyu, and Jiashen. The above teams can be said to have collected almost all the top players in Shanghai. The name of the Group A-A team is still unfamiliar, but the players and their style are well known to the general public. The hopes for each team are described below:

Zhongbei: After losing to the Shan Team in the Shenbao Cup, its reputation almost fell apart. After overcoming the Hualian Team, the advantages of its Northern style once again emerged in the minds of fans, which is thought-provoking. In the author's opinion, there is no room for further improvement in the individual skills and experience of the team's players. However, there is indeed a need for further advancement in the team's tactics and the players' stamina. Looking at the game against Group A, for the above two points, it has gradually become more positive. In the past, their combat seemed to lack loyal strategy, but now it has been determined to use a man-to-man system. The stamina of each player is also gradually showing balanced progress. Furthermore, it is learned that Hua Ying Bao Songyuan has now also joined the team, greatly increasing its strength. If they can work hard as before, Zhongbei's performance will be beyond what we can imagine.

Hualian: The author expresses satisfaction with all aspects of the Hualian team. Their spirit of practice and research on tactics are especially commendable. Recently, the team's lineup may undergo significant changes. It seems that A Kong and Xilin have both become overweight, which is a significant disadvantage in terms of running speed. The most likely scenario is that Qinggong and Bo Tuo will try out as guards, while the forwards will still be very prominent, including Adi Xianlun Liangxiong Jiusheng, etc. In short, the team is full of talent, and adjustment is easy. With the wisdom and resourcefulness of Zhang Guixiang and Yan Youling, reaching the peak is to be expected.

Shan Team: I love the team's cooperative spirit, I admire the bravery of the team members. With these two merits, it is almost certain that a newly emerging team will be able to gain such achievements. What is lacking is still a lack of experience, which easily leads to inappropriate performances and no fixed results. This is not surprising, and there is no way to seek rectification in a short period of time. It is bound to be a part of the process, and it can be followed with time. The future of the Shan team is limitless. The hope is that they can work together and never change their minds.

Renyu: This is a team with a history, and its performance changes with the comings and goings of its members. However, the team can always maximize its strengths and sportsmanship under any circumstances. Joining the league this time, they will not focus on winning or losing, but will focus on promoting new talents in Shanghai. It is even more commendable that in the game against Hualian, the young players lived up to expectations, showing that they can train hard in a proper state at ordinary times to have this performance. The author has the greatest admiration for the team's spirit, not just looking at its record.

Jiashen: Since the team was just established, it is difficult to expect outstanding results. Moreover, the players all come from several teams, and cooperation cannot be tacit in a short period of time. Each player will rely on their own abilities and develop individually. Therefore, in the game against Zhongbei, they were also able to rely on each player to have a good situation. It is said that the team's authorities have high interest, and they have been practicing every day recently, so there may be a day to see each other with new eyes.

### Six Female Teams, Each with Their Own Strengths

Lianyi: This is a new product of the Lianyi Sports Association, performing in a brand-new way. However, since it is a new army, the performance is still not ideal. Therefore, the ladies should not be discouraged by defeat, but go forward bravely. I am confident that the Lianyi Women's Basketball Team can have a future.

Overseas Chinese: After the last basketball league, they have been inactive until now, and most of the team remains the same. It is found that the team members are healthy and have beautiful postures, which are unmatched by other teams. This time, there may not be an outstanding performance, but in terms of their physique and posture, they give us a satisfactory impression. It is hoped that the team will develop more in this regard.

Xuebai: Whether it is the forward and the defender or the tactics, all three have a good state of balanced progress. However, the individual skills are not yet pure, which easily leads to fouls. If they can pay special attention to this point, then what they gain can definitely exceed what ordinary people imagine.

Yikang: This team is a team with a coach, able to follow the rules and progress gradually. What is felt to be lacking is that it seems to be too formalized. The application of methods must strive to adapt to circumstances, so that it can achieve twice the result with half the effort. What does the team's coach think?

Sansheng: Because of the addition of new players such as Zhang Yue and Le Jashi, the team's performance is not weaker than before. It is generally believed that what is lacking is that the team has not been able to achieve contact and tacit understanding. Especially the guards are brave but lack strategy. If they can improve this, given the team members' strong physique, their success is to be expected.

Green Team: The team has a vibe of being invincible in Shanghai at the moment. This point is enough to prove that although the situation of women's basketball in Shanghai is enthusiastic, the level is actually still low. Therefore, the Green Team can never meet a team that is even slightly enough to compete with them. After all, there is no doubt that the Green Team will crush all the teams under the current situation. The team's shortcomings are the insufficient ability of the reserve personnel. If they can strive for perfection, then they will not lose the title of leader. One day they will go on expeditions to distant lands to show the power of the ladies in Shanghai, which is something to rely on.

In the women's group, the Green Team seems to be able to retain the championship. The strength of the remaining five teams is evenly matched, and there is a good opportunity for a double round-robin. A fierce competition will be added, and a lot of color can be added to the scene with the sounds of singing and talk.

### Sino-Western Boxing Championship Tournament Held This Morning

The highly anticipated Sino-Western Boxing Championship Tournament is scheduled to take place this morning (the 21st) at 10:45 AM at the Jai Alai Stadium. The sole reason for the delayed start time is to avoid a conflict with the football match scheduled for today. The extra fifteen minutes will allow football fans the opportunity to watch the football match and then come and enjoy the grand boxing tournament, the first of its kind this year.

The roster for the boxing match, after careful selection and a full medical examination by doctors, is formally announced as follows:

Fourteen Rounds: Caitantan Di versus Sam Liu Gu (three minutes per round)

Eight Rounds: Dan Li Duni versus Wen Nuo Gu (two minutes per round)

Eight Rounds: Luo Genstein versus Sai Weisuofu

Six Rounds: Li Peigen versus Weiduo

Six Rounds: Geluopifu versus Shi Weiya

Six Rounds: Xiao Mo versus Ya Ershifei

Four Rounds: Lin Zhongshou versus Xiang Hai

According to boxing fans who are generally experienced in boxing matters, Caitantan Di's boxing skills are excellent, with the surprise attacks and fierce lunges of the "First Seven" [Translator's Note: possibly a nickname or reference to a fighting style]. Combined with a calm mind, it seems that he is almost assured victory in this boxing match. However, Sam Liu Gu is no weakling either. He worked his way up from the bottom, eventually defeating the highest-ranked opponents. He possesses strength, wit, and courage, all of which are incredibly powerful. Therefore, Caitantan Di's future prospects are not necessarily optimistic. Dan Li Duni is a famous Italian warrior, and his fight against the German expatriate Wen Nuo Gu will truly be a battle between a dragon and a tiger, surely involving some extraordinary fierce fighting. Most noteworthy is the diligence of the Chinese boxer Li Peigen. He is never late, and often early, every morning, dedicating himself to practicing for an hour and a half. Such a spirit of hard work is rarely seen among boxers.

According to Li Peigen, he has declared to others that he is determined to defeat the Western expatriate in this boxing match and bring glory to the Chinese people. With such ambition and perseverance, he will surely succeed and achieve his desired goal. Another boxer, Lin Zhongfu, is also a promising and energetic young man. He is confident in his ability to defeat his opponent, Xiang Hai, based on his assessment of Xiang Hai's physical strength. It is hoped that both of them will achieve ultimate victory today! (Pei)
