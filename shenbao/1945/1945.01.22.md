Full Text of Prime Minister Koiso's Speech

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The main points of Prime Minister Koiso's policy speech at the 86th session of the Diet are as follows: The war situation is developing more actively, and the Empire is encountering the most critical situation since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, reaching a point of either thriving or collapsing. Last autumn, the Imperial Army and Navy intercepted the enemy's attempted invasion in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines, achieving an unprecedented victory. However, despite suffering this heavy blow, the enemy, supported by abundant resources, landed on Itaitai Island and invaded Mindoro Island. Currently, the enemy has landed on Luzon Island with several divisions, making the situation increasingly critical.

Demonstrating Special Attack Spirit and Seizing Opportunities for Victory

Since the enemy's invasion of the Philippines, the Imperial Army's soldiers have been filled with fervent spirit to defend the national polity. All personnel have transformed into special attack units, bravely ramming enemy ships, forcefully breaking into enemy airfields, or charging into enemy lines to kill enemy soldiers. These incredibly brave attack units are something that soldiers of any other nation cannot achieve. I am deeply grateful. Looking at the current stage of the war, the situation in the Pacific is not optimistic. However, the enemy's long supply lines are being attacked by our forces across the board. I believe we have a good opportunity to seize victory here. Furthermore, since last summer, the Imperial Army has launched operations on the Chinese mainland, destroying important strongholds of the Chongqing army in central and southern China, leaving the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing with no room to operate, and further opening up land routes between southern China and Vietnam. On the other hand, the Imperial Army in northern Burma is continuing to fight bravely against the Chongqing army's attempts to retake Burma. The Imperial Army soldiers guarding the north are ensuring that the British and Americans have no room to invade. In summary, it can be seen that our strategic posture for defending East Asia is extremely solid. Therefore, today, our 100 million compatriots must rise up and follow the brave special attack unit warriors.

Urgently Seeking to Realize Decisive War Measures

We must demonstrate a spirit of certain victory in production. The government will also exert its full strength to implement decisive war measures as soon as possible. Government and people must work together to overcome difficulties and enhance war capabilities so as not to fail the brave soldiers on the front lines and to complete the tasks of the rear. I believe that the results of the united efforts of our 100 million compatriots today will not only repel the enemy forces around the Philippines in the near future but also echo the Imperial Army soldiers in Rabaul, Bougainville, and other places, forming a decisive force to consolidate and transform the foundation of the war. The government's decisive war measures to address this critical war situation are fundamentally focused on rapidly mobilizing existing national power, placing it on key priorities, actively enhancing war capabilities, and establishing a certain-victory system to complete the war, strongly and decisively implementing various measures. I believe that the fundamental attitude of governing the nation under decisive war circumstances should be to avoid being happy or sad about the advances and retreats of the war situation, but to strive to realize strong politics that can boldly advance to the path of certain victory. To thoroughly implement decisive war measures, the government will first promote the comprehensive advancement of administration at the central and local levels, seeking more appropriate measures. At the same time, we will ensure that the heads of local administrative councils maintain close contact with local army and navy authorities to promote integrated and smooth progress. Regarding military and political measures for defense and enhanced war capabilities, the recent enemy air raids on the capital and various key areas of the mainland, especially the audacious attack on Ise Grand Shrine, have caused outrage among our 100 million compatriots. However, the damage from the air raids has been minimal, and the morale of the people has become even more invigorated, continuing to engage in astonishing activities in wartime production. This is truly gratifying.

Actively Increasing Production and Enhancing War Capabilities

We expect that enemy aircraft will continue to attack. Therefore, in order to rapidly strengthen the protection facilities of factories, with the aim of enhancing production under air raids without causing obstacles or delays, we are actively seeking necessary measures. At the same time, we are urgently seeking to thoroughly evacuate the population of large cities and to improve air defense and rescue facilities. Therefore, no matter how fierce the enemy air raids may be, the military, government, and people must unite to ensure the completeness of this air defense posture. We firmly believe that our 100 million compatriots will uphold the spirit of protecting the Empire, and whenever and wherever there is an enemy invasion, we will all resolve to shoulder the important responsibility of defending the national territory and demonstrate a spirit of brightness and struggle in daily life, such as production and air defense. Regarding the enhancement of military supplies production, it should be known that our frontline soldiers unanimously hope that those in the rear will mass-produce excellent aircraft weaponry. In this way, the special attack units can risk their lives to destroy enemy ships. In addition to aircraft weaponry, the government will also increase the production of steel, light metals, liquid fuels, etc. After establishing the foundation of war capabilities, we will also support and enhance production on the mainland. Regarding strengthening the mobilization of scientific and technological capabilities, we will spare no effort to create various decisive war weapons and improve their performance. Furthermore, in order to comprehensively strengthen production and defense, we will rapidly disperse or relocate military factories underground under careful planning. At the same time, in order to thoroughly transform labor and materials into war capabilities, we plan to promote the consolidation of enterprises in the future.

Diligent Labor Mobilization and Improving and Refreshing

Moreover, securing food is the foundation for stabilizing the national livelihood and enhancing war capabilities, which goes without saying. Hereafter, in light of the increasing demand for food and the current state of transportation capacity, we are determined to overcome all difficulties and implement extraordinary increased production of rice, wheat, sweet potatoes, etc., according to local conditions, and strive to actively increase domestic self-sufficiency. The fundamental key to securing and enhancing national war capabilities mentioned above lies in the total mobilization of the national labor force. Only by maximizing the diligence and efficiency of the entire population can these goals be achieved. Regarding labor mobilization and management, the government plans to strengthen consistent adjustments and implement effective improvements and refreshments to reap the rewards of a nation of workers. As for enhancing maritime transportation capacity, the government will overcome all difficulties and strive to promote the construction of new ships. At the very least, we will seek to ensure the maintenance of existing vessels to ensure effective military use.

Government and People Unite to Protect the Empire

The essence of this war is what is called "either survival or destruction," which has an extremely magnificent nature. Therefore, whether the national polity of the Empire can be maintained infinitely depends entirely on whether the efforts of the government and people today can support the outcome. In this war, the enemy engages in reckless discussions about post-war international institutions, seeking to eliminate all compromises with the Empire, and calls for unconditional surrender, attempting to obliterate the Empire. All of this is laughable. The only way to uphold the path of the Empire is for the government and people to unite, eliminate all obstacles, work together, and complete the purpose of the holy war. In summary, the government, based on the aforementioned policies, will vigorously implement various decisive war measures, establish a certain-victory situation, seize victory, and strongly promote central and local administration in order to realize this as soon as possible. The enemy British and American nations use the name of peace, but their ambition to dominate the world has gradually been exposed as the war progresses. Regarding the distribution of profits in their occupied territories, deep conflicts and opposition have already unfolded.

Moral Ideals to Protect East Asia

Conversely, the countries of our Greater East Asia are united under the common ideal of East Asian revival, uphold their beliefs, rise up to protect East Asia, and resolutely advance to complete the war and defeat the British and Americans. At the same time, the co-existence and co-prosperity moral ideals crystallized in the Greater East Asia Declaration cannot be compared to the goals of the British and American war of aggression. The Imperial Government sincerely expresses its respect for the spirit of struggle of the various East Asian nations. At the same time, based on the common beliefs and resolutions of the various nations as elucidated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we will advance to liberate East Asia and complete the common war in pursuit of realization. On the European front, our ally Germany, under the leadership of Führer Hitler, is exerting its full strength to counterattack the enemy, striving to make the enemy bow its head as soon as possible. We sincerely pray that the German people will continue to struggle in the future. The powerful counterattacks of the various East Asian nations, rising up to defend their homelands, have forced the enemy to divide their war power between the East and West battlefields, and their supply lines are under severe threat. The United States, which boasts abundant material resources, is now in a difficult situation due to the pressure of human resources. The production of military supplies is greatly insufficient. It has already warned its citizens that the future of the war is not optimistic and that the war cannot be ended in the short term unless a epoch-making increase in production is achieved, and has newly formulated a national conscription law.

Enduring Hardship to Achieve Victory

The current war situation has reached a decisive stage of endurance battle between us and the enemy, and it will become more severe in the future. However, we firmly believe that no matter what dangers we encounter, those who continue their struggle for certain victory to the end will be able to achieve final victory. At this time, our 100 million compatriots should echo the fierce battles of the frontline soldiers, uphold the belief of maintaining unity, endure hardships, strive to enhance war capabilities, defend the national territory, and complete the purpose of the holy war as soon as possible to set the Emperor's mind at ease.

### Hope to Solve Difficult Problems for Shanghai Citizens: Feng Bingnan's Speech at a Welcome Tea Party

Today, five groups, including the Shanghai Special Municipal Advisory Committee, the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Civic Welfare Association, the Shanghai Charity Group, and the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, held a tea party to welcome Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo. It is indeed a rare opportunity for everyone to gather here together.

Choosing the Difficult and Avoiding the Easy

I have been ill for two months recently. This recurrence of stomach illness has not yet fully healed, so I feel very sorry that I cannot attend the welcome party today. Although I cannot attend in person, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, and entrust Mr. Li Zanhou to convey a few words that I want to say. In his "Letter to the Citizens of Shanghai," Mr. Zhou said that the situation in Shanghai is complex and difficult. Because the situation in Shanghai is complex and difficult, I want to congratulate Mr. Zhou even more. Because in this complex and difficult situation, Mr. Zhou has an excellent opportunity to solve all kinds of complex and difficult problems for the citizens of Shanghai. We have a saying in our country, "choose the easy and avoid the difficult." I would like to reverse this sentence and change it to "choose the difficult and avoid the easy." I advocate "choosing the difficult and avoiding the easy" because difficult things no one is willing to do, or has the ability to do, while easy things everyone can do, and everyone rushes to do them. Mr. Zhou's talent is excellent, and I believe that when Mr. Zhou presides over Shanghai's municipal affairs, he will definitely be able to choose the difficult and avoid the easy, doing things that ordinary people are unwilling or unable to do.

Healthy Body and Mind

Now that Mr. Zhou is shouldering the responsibility of Mayor of Shanghai, this is a very rare opportunity. In addition to congratulating Mr. Zhou, I would like to offer a simple suggestion, hoping that Mr. Zhou can adopt it. I feel that the fundamental responsibility of a government official to the country and the people is to make the country strong and to make the people healthy in body and mind. The health of the people's body and mind is the foundation of the country's strength. It is not enough for the people to have a healthy body but not a healthy mind, and it is not enough to have a healthy mind but not a healthy body. I believe that government officials should take on this responsibility in times of peace, and even more so in times of war. If the people are not healthy in body and mind, the country not only has no hope of being strong, but even has no hope of existing. To achieve the goal of a healthy body, it is necessary to ensure that the people obtain the minimum amount of nutrition. To achieve the goal of a healthy mind, it is necessary to pay attention to general education. If the people can be healthy in body and mind, then the clean government that Chairman Chen has always advocated can be realized. However, integrity is not simple. Officials must be clean, and the people must also be clean. Confucius also said that only when things are investigated can knowledge be extended; only when knowledge is extended can intentions be sincere; only when intentions are sincere can the heart be rectified; only when the heart is rectified can the person be cultivated; only when the person is cultivated can the family be regulated; only when the family is regulated can the state be well governed; only when the state is well governed can the world be at peace. These sentences, which were familiar to beginners in the past, are known to everyone. However, a rectified heart and a cultivated person are not only related to the individual and the country, but also to the world. It is indeed a very important matter. There is much to say about these two issues, but now, due to time constraints, I just want to say a few simple words in an abstract way.

The Three Determinations Doctrine

I believe that in this time of war, to implement these most basic conditions, it is necessary to implement the "Three Determinations Doctrine." What is the "Three Determinations Doctrine"? The so-called "Three Determinations Doctrine" is (1) stabilizing the people's livelihood, (2) stabilizing finance, and (3) stabilizing prices. First, stabilizing the people's livelihood must start with the rationing of daily necessities such as rice, firewood, oil, and salt. The amount of rationing must be sufficient to meet the minimum amount needed for the health of the citizens, so that every citizen can obtain a certain minimum amount of nutrition. At the same time, the tuition fees of schools at all levels have been rising so sharply recently, the reason being the increase in living expenses. If the people's livelihood can be stabilized and living expenses no longer increase, then tuition fees will not rise so sharply, the phenomenon of dropping out of school can be eliminated, and the problem of education can be solved as a result. Not only education, but other general problems are also like this. Therefore, stabilizing the people's livelihood is a very important task. Second, stabilizing finance cannot use inflation or deflation as a countermeasure. On the one hand, wartime inflation is inevitable. On the other hand, deflation is also impractical in wartime. Therefore, I feel that we should seek a suitable and reasonable countermeasure between the two extremes of inflation and deflation. In this way, finance can definitely reach a stable state. Third, speaking of stabilizing prices, I often hear the saying that increasing production is the key to stabilizing prices. Of course, increasing production is the key to stabilizing prices, but to increase production, the first step must be to seek "reproduction." The so-called "reproduction" refers to the meaning that consumption can be continuously replenished. "Reproduction" can already stabilize prices. Increasing production can not only stabilize prices, but also lower prices. I very much believe in the "Three Determinations Doctrine." If Mayor Zhou is willing to adopt my proposal, he will definitely be able to implement the "Three Determinations Doctrine" because Mayor Zhou's cadres, as he himself said, are "young and promising." Mayor Zhou has a "young and promising" cadre, and this is something not only I envy him for, but I believe all the citizens of Shanghai envy him for as well. With such a "young and promising" cadre, holding the heart of "wanting to do well" in Shanghai to handle municipal affairs, "without perfunctoriness, without inertia, without complacency, without fatigue, without bureaucratic airs, and earnestly burying himself in hard work," especially Secretary-General Luo, although I have not yet met him, I often hear that his ambitions are extraordinary and that he handles matters with decisiveness. This is an essential element that administrative officials must not lack. I believe that he will definitely be able to seek welfare for the citizens of Shanghai. This is truly something that deserves our joy.

Finally, I wish Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo success in their mission, and I wish Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, the heads of the various bureaus and departments of the municipal government, and all the gentlemen of the various groups good health.

Commentary

### Urgent Tasks for Shanghai Now

— Chen Bin

Speeches delivered at a welcome reception for Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo hosted by five Shanghai organizations, transcribed below:

Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, public opinion has unanimously expressed goodwill, as the chairman has already stated. Various newspapers have also fully expressed their expectations and praises, which is not a coincidence.

The Book of Rites says, "Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger," referring to vexatious policies that are more ferocious than a man-eating tiger, illustrating the profound harm of oppressive government on the people. What I call oppressive government today is high prices, though not necessarily a policy. The high prices in Shanghai are the result of competition between officials and merchants. By "officials and merchants," I mean corrupt officials and treacherous merchants. We do not deny that high prices have economic causes, such as reduced production, lack of supplies, transportation delays, and unreasonable distribution. However, human factors account for a significant portion. Here are a few examples:

(1) In July of the thirty-second year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], the price of rice in Shanghai was 1,782 yuan per shi (a unit of dry measure), and by December of the thirty-third year [i.e., 1944], it had risen to 38,465 yuan, an increase of more than 21 times in a year and a half. This is the competition of treacherous merchants.

(2) In July of the thirty-second year, the price of rationed rice was 4.5 yuan per sheng (a unit of dry measure), flour was 2.2 yuan per jin (a unit of weight), sugar was 4.7 yuan per jin, and oil was 20.4 yuan per jin. By December of the thirty-third year, rice was 65 yuan, an increase of 14.4 times; flour was 31 yuan, an increase of 16 times; sugar was 560 yuan, an increase of 119 times; and oil was 280 yuan, an increase of 13.7 times. This is the competition of officials.

The increasing competition between the black market and official prices shows that on the one hand, treacherous merchants are raising prices, while on the other hand, officials are accommodating the facts and allowing increases, even instructing treacherous merchants to request increases, all for the sake of competing for profits. As a result, the people suffer under the oppression of high prices, and their lives become more and more difficult.

Now that Mr. Zhou and Mr. Luo have taken office, some people have the impression of "turning pale at the mention of a tiger." This tiger is the tiger that suppresses evil. And those who turn pale at the mention of it are not the common people, but corrupt officials and treacherous merchants. Why should they turn pale? Because they fear being punished. Recently, after news of corruption by officials of the Public Works Bureau was revealed in the newspapers, the authorities immediately detained and interrogated the suspects. However, similar malpractices are numerous. Here is one example: the day before yesterday, I met with the person in charge of "a Shanghai orphanage. They used to receive a ration of five bags of rice per month. Later, after the establishment of the Goods Allocation Office, the five bags of rice they were supposed to receive were no longer issued. After much pleading, they were allowed to receive three bags, but each bag was charged a handling fee of 3,000 yuan. The person in charge of the orphanage, in order to obtain food for the poor children, paid the bribe and, of course, dared not speak out. It is rumored that the Allocation Office has a corrupt organization, and a staff member who joined it can receive 500,000 yuan per month. We also know that the former director, Mr. Feng, was very upright himself, but his poor judgment in employing people cannot be denied. Generally speaking, corruption in various government departments is extremely widespread. We do not advocate excessive pursuit of past accounts, but we must know where past malpractices lay and then reform them. Therefore, the most urgent task now is to abolish oppressive government, with suppressing and stabilizing prices as the first priority, and eradicating long-standing malpractices as the second. Without first eradicating long-standing malpractices, prices cannot be suppressed and stabilized. This is the most important thing that Shanghai must do now.

Secondly, we must talk about ensuring public safety. In the past, the roads in Shanghai were "lined with checkpoints," extorting money along the way. Therefore, ensuring public safety is a major problem. Since Mr. Zhou and Mr. Luo took over, the extortion along the way has greatly subsided due to their reputation. However, we believe that if we cannot actively improve the treatment of the military and police who maintain public safety and continue to strictly prohibit it passively, then the phenomenon of "checkpoints" and extortion will inevitably revive, and the citizens will suffer again. At the same time, establishing public safety in the urban area is not enough; we should also establish public safety in the counties outside Shanghai's urban area, and thoroughly reform the county magistrate's selection and the security forces and police. Recently, we received a letter from a reader in Nanhui reporting that "in Nanhui, in terms of paying fees, in addition to paying the taxes stipulated by the government, the people also pay land tax, acreage tax, and business tax to bandits, which exceeds the government's regular tax by several times. And what is most hateful is that some civil servants belonging to the municipal government are running around for the bandits to help collect donations. Secondly, many speculators in Shanghai go to the countryside to manipulate the market, mostly manipulating rice and food supplies, in order to escape the eyes and ears of Shanghai people. Therefore, these people collude with local bandits to sit and enjoy huge profits, and public safety is hindered." This proves the importance of public safety in the counties surrounding Shanghai. Establishing public safety can also crack down on the activities of speculators. Therefore, ensuring public safety is the second most urgent thing that Shanghai needs to do now.

Third, we must strengthen the baojia (neighborhood self-governance) system and disperse the population. The establishment of the Shanghai baojia system has had considerable success in the past, and we hope to further strengthen the organization and complete unification. In addition, in order to reduce consumption of resources and help stabilize prices, in order to reduce innocent sacrifices during enemy air raids, and in order to help ensure public safety, it is necessary to disperse the population now. We hope that the government will lead, unite with civil welfare organizations, fellow-countrymen associations, and land and water transportation agencies, and organize a strong evacuation committee to effectively achieve the gradual dispersal of the population that does not need to stay in Shanghai. We do not advocate forced evacuation, because there are many who are willing to evacuate voluntarily. The most important thing is to provide the greatest convenience to those who voluntarily return to their hometowns. Here, the first difficulty is the many obstacles at the train stations and ports, which must be overcome with a large amount of effort. For example, the blackmail and extortion by the "black hats" (railway police) at the stations, and the theft of luggage, have been complained about by everyone and should be strictly prohibited immediately. The difficulty in obtaining tickets, the monopoly of black market ticket groups, and so on, are all problems that need to be solved urgently.

In short, to save Shanghai from the crisis, officials and the people must work together. To overcome the difficulties, the government authorities must have the courage to reform past malpractices and lay the foundation for a new administration. The citizens, especially the leaders of all sectors of society and intellectuals, must not stand idly by, but must take on their share of responsibility, contributing their efforts and money, and contributing their full strength under the unified leadership of the government, truly achieving unity between officials and the people. With a new face and new strength, we will naturally gain the trust of the Allied nations and naturally gain the assistance of the Allied nations. We expect to see small achievements within three months and major achievements within six months. We offer this fervent hope to Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and the heads of all bureaus and departments, and encourage all citizens to strive together.

### Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's Speech Clarifies Diplomatic Policy

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech at the 86th session of the Japanese Diet included the following main points:

Recently, the ties between the Empire and its allied nations have become increasingly strong. We must consistently fight alongside our allies. Today, it is truly amazing that our ally, Germany, continues to fight bravely despite overcoming countless difficulties. The German people, under the leadership of Führer Hitler, are united in spirit and will not allow the fierce enemy to defile their territory by even one step. This heroic act of iron and blood struggle is truly a magnificent sight among the Allied nations. As for Italy, under the leadership of Mussolini, it is now diligently training its troops and fighting alongside Germany with honor and glory. Germany's skill in battle has exposed the terror of the Anglo-Americans to the light of day. The war in Europe originated from Britain's intervention in the Polish issue, which is known to everyone. Today, the small countries that were initially used have been neglected by the great powers that used this pretext. Poland has become an abandoned orphan. The "Atlantic Charter," which was proclaimed at the beginning of the war, and the policy that was called the lifeline of the Anglo-Americans, have now been abandoned like dust. They call themselves "countries that love freedom," but their war aims are not to protect small countries, nor to respect freedom. Their true aim is to build a world organization of "great power dictatorship" centered on the Anglo-Americans. During their reign of power in this war, they have already decided on the next war and are preparing for it day and night. They have revealed a serious tendency to engage in contradictions regarding certain war aims. The Greater East Asia War was started by the Anglo-Americans to eliminate the Japanese power that hinders their ambitions. They want to seize the homeland of the East Asians as their permanent colony and use it as a base to dominate the world. We are staking our lives on this war to protect East Asia and liberate Asia. Liberating Asia and revitalizing East Asia has become even clearer. Today, Asia has awakened, and East Asia has been fully liberated. East Asia, liberated from years of Anglo-American invasion and exploitation, is now waging a sacred war to defend its homeland and destroy the enemy's re-invasion. However, if this war is lost, the East Asian nations will inevitably be invaded and exploited forever. The existence of the new Greater East Asian nations and the revitalization of East Asia as a whole will naturally become nothing but a bubble dream. The reason why the East Asian nations are uniting and cooperating with each other is to carry out this sacred war to defend their homeland. The reason why they can generate infinite power to complete the sacred war also originates from this. (To be continued)

### Japanese Army in South China Completely Occupies Huizhou, Now Mopping Up Remaining Enemy Forces

From a certain Japanese army base on the South China Front, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – A powerful unit of the Japanese army stationed in South China began operations towards the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway on the evening of the 14th, advancing eastward along the Huizhou-Zhangmutou Highway, defeating the main force of the Chongqing army's 20th Brigade, and capturing Huizhou, a key point on the Huijiang River controlled by the Chongqing army, at 7:00 a.m. on the 16th. Currently, they are mopping up the defeated Chongqing army in the area. Initially, the Chongqing army seemed to have detected the Japanese army's attack and immediately destroyed and cut off the Huizhou-Zhangmutou Highway. However, the elite Japanese army ignored all difficulties and continued to advance rapidly. On the evening of the 15th, they invaded the main position of the enemy south of Huizhou and surrounded it. At that time, they eliminated the resistance of the Chongqing army and broke into the city through the east, west, and south gates, completely occupying it. Currently, they are mopping up the area. After the mopping-up operation in the city is completed, the Japanese army will be dispatched to ensure the security of the surrounding area. Currently, order in the city is gradually being restored, and the people are gradually returning.

### War Results of the Japanese Army on the Burma Front

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – In the Nujiang River area of Burma, the 7th Division of the Chongqing Expeditionary Force attacked the front of Wanting. A part of it crossed the Longchuan River west of Wanting. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack at that time and repelled them. In the Nankan area, two divisions of the Chongqing army came to attack. The Japanese army secured Wanting and Nankan and had already repelled the Chongqing army. In early January, the Chongqing army abandoned 1,541 bodies and destroyed one tank and five artillery pieces. In the area east of the Irrawaddy River, the 50th Division of the Chongqing army and the 36th Division of the British army attacked the Mengmi area and were also repelled. In the area west of the Irrawaddy River, on the Shwebo and Monywa lines, the Japanese army countered a total of seven divisions of the British Indian 6th Division and the mechanized 1st Division. On the southern Indo-Burmese border, after the Japanese army withdrew from Hikai, the British Indian 26th Division advanced to that area. Currently, the enemy is trying to continue to increase its forces. On the 12th, a part of the enemy army also landed at a point 50 kilometers east of Hikai. The Japanese army on that side is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. West of the upper reaches of the Kaladan River, the enemy's 81st Division is still gradually descending along the river. The Japanese air force bombed enemy tanks and vehicle units near Shwebo, achieving great results. Since the 9th, it has continuously bombed enemy warships and landing sites attempting to reinforce Hikai from the sea.

### German Counteroffensive Launched on the Upper Silesian Border

Fierce Fighting in East Prussia

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Huitong News Agency reports that a German military spokesperson said: The war on the Eastern Front is intensifying. Strong Soviet forces are advancing towards the border of Upper Silesia (part of the province in western Germany) and have encountered strong German resistance. Soviet forces have broken into the Kempen district. The German army has taken counteroffensive measures there. The second focus of the war on the Eastern Front is in southern East Prussia. Soviet forces there have advanced to Gilgenburg, Neidenburg, and Ortelsburg. Although the German army has increased its resistance, the large scale of the Soviet operation makes it difficult for the German counteroffensive to be effective immediately. The Soviet offensive has clearly poured in most of its forces.

### President Roosevelt's Inaugural Address

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Huitong News Agency cites Washington as saying: President Roosevelt delivered his inaugural address yesterday, foreshadowing that the United States will no longer return to isolationism. His remarks were roughly as follows: We have learned a lesson in this war in 1945 with terrible sacrifices, but we will reap its benefits. Our welfare depends on the welfare of other countries. The United States is now undergoing a great trial, and we must use all our strength to achieve its success.

### Provisional Government of Hungary Declared Established

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Huitong News Agency reports: The organization of the Provisional Government of Hungary was announced by Moscow on December 24, 1944. Its prime minister is General Miklós. The government is currently located in Debrecen.

### Five Organizations Welcomed the New Municipal Officials Yesterday, Mayor Zhou Expressed His Determination

The Municipal Advisory Committee, the Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens Welfare Association, the Charity Organizations, and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association jointly hosted a grand tea party yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m. at the Hua Mao Apartments to welcome Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and the newly appointed bureau and department heads. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo arrived on time, and the new Director of the Economic Bureau, Xu Jiang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Xu Jidun, Director of the Publicity Department, Liu Dexuan, and other bureau and department heads of the municipal government also attended.

They were warmly received by the representatives of the five organizations, Li Sihao, Wen Qishi, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Binhe, creating a grand occasion.

Li Sihao's Speech: First, Li Sihao, the representative of the presidium, gave a speech, saying: "Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, directors, department heads, and guests: Today, our five organizations welcome all the newly appointed municipal officials. We are honored by your presence. Half a month ago, we also welcomed Acting Chairman Chen at this place, because Acting Chairman Chen was responsible for the central government and resigned from his position as Mayor of Shanghai. After coming to Shanghai on business, we still expressed our gratitude by holding a welcome reception. Today, welcoming Mayor Zhou and everyone else has the same meaning, but the emotions are different. Because Mayor Zhou and everyone else are our local officials, and every move of the local officials has a direct and close relationship with the citizens. Therefore, the emotion of today's welcome reception is particularly warm. Mayor Zhou's assistants in governing Shanghai and the current environment in Shanghai are complex and difficult. However, we believe that with your efforts, we will definitely be able to break the deadlock and overcome the difficulties. Judging from the unanimous praise from public opinion after Mayor Zhou and others took over for a short week, we can further strengthen this confidence. As for the Mayor's hope for the cooperation of the citizens, we will of course do our best to awaken the common sense of responsibility and achieve true unity between officials and the people. We wish Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and everyone good health and hard work."

Mayor Zhou's Speech: Mayor Zhou then gave a speech, saying: "The determination and ambition to come to Shanghai this time have already been explained in the announcement to the citizens, so I will not say more today. In short, we have made up our minds to do a good job in Shanghai. Regardless of whether the result is more effort than effect, or even complete futility, we must do our best, and then we can be acquitted. We will never blame the situation and environment for our own lack of effort. Mr. Li Zanhou just said that general public opinion has not been bad since we came to Shanghai. On the contrary, I not only do not feel happy, but feel anxious, because there is no guarantee that the expectations of public opinion can be realized in the future. However, I have considerable confidence in relieving the people of their suffering. We will try to do better in the past bad areas, but this cannot be done in ten days or eight days. We hope that citizens can be patient for a little longer. The method of raising the salaries of the police and security forces has already been decided. This time, I put forward a slogan: 'Public interest is more important than private interest,' and 'Society comes before the individual.' I encourage my colleagues with this, and at the same time, I hope that citizens will supervise us at any time. If any of my subordinates violates this principle, I will strictly correct them. I hope that if my eyes and ears are not attentive enough, the citizens will report to me at any time. I also hope that you will expand the meaning of today's welcome and do your best to help."

Secretary-General Luo's Speech: Secretary-General Luo then gave a speech, saying: "This time, I came to work in Shanghai's municipal government, standing in the position of a staff member. I am not worthy of the grand welcome. There are two old sayings in China: 'A reputation exceeding reality is a disgrace to a gentleman. We should act with conscience and work hard. This time I came to Shanghai, I don't want to live a good name, I just want to do some practical work in a down-to-earth and happy way, follow the Mayor's intentions, respect the public opinion of the citizens, and punish those who harm public interest and benefit themselves. I only ask whether there is a need for punishment, and I don't hear what power he has behind him. Secondly, I would like to state that I also serve as the Director of the Finance Bureau. I have already set a method for the financial reorganization in the future. I hope that the citizens, especially the leaders of all sectors of society, can make demands on the one hand and assist with strength on the other. Of course, no extra fees are allowed, but people with face in the society must not put on airs, not talk about personal relationships, and automatically pay taxes first. After the reorganization, I hope to increase the income from 400,000 to 1 million. I dare to guarantee that the municipal government will never waste it."

After Mr. Luo's speech, Mr. Chen Binhe and Mr. Feng Bingnan delivered speeches (the speeches are recorded separately). Then, tea and refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned at six o'clock.

### Anecdotes from the Welcome Reception

— Cheng

The most distinctive feature of this tea party held by the five organizations to welcome Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and others was that it was "full of guests." It was a rare grand event in recent years.

The second characteristic was "punctuality." More than 300 guests arrived within ten minutes around five o'clock, which was also a rare new spirit.

President Chen of this newspaper said in his speech that the unanimous praise of Mayor Zhou and others by the citizens of this city "is not an accidental matter." The two characteristics mentioned above are also not accidental.

Mr. Li acted as the representative of the host, holding the welcome speech and reading it clearly and seriously without his glasses.

Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo sat in the center, with high-backed chairs that were higher than their heads.

Several burly men stood in a corner of the venue, protecting the officials. When everyone bowed to the national flag, one of them stood still, facing the guests.

Mayor Zhou seemed very happy. His speech had few polite and superficial words, expressing the attitude that governing is not about talking too much, and had a confident determination to guarantee to relieve the people of unnecessary suffering.

Secretary-General Luo's attitude was very calm, and his speech was very powerful and courageous, making him a representative of Mayor Zhou's young and promising cadres. Next to him sat Xiong Jiantong, a typical young military officer and chief of staff.

The newly appointed bureau and department heads, Xu Jiang, Xu Jidun, and Liu Dexuan, all attended. Liu Xingchen, the director of the Materials Allocation Office, was absent, and it was heard that he went to Zhejiang to handle the transfer of the Finance Department.

Feng Bingnan, a member of the Municipal Advisory Committee, was unable to attend due to illness. His speech was read by Ling Daqi, the secretary of the municipal government.

Many of those who usually wear suits changed to long robes, such as Lin Kanghou, Chen Zhongfu, Yang Xinghua, and Chen Riping, probably because of the cold weather?

The coffee in the tea was donated by Mr. Zhang Baocun, director of CPC Coffee Company, as a sign of welcome. Mr. Zhang is very enthusiastic about social welfare. He has contributed a lot to this newspaper's scholarship fund. The Hua Mao Apartments used flowers to form the words "Welcome" and placed them in front of the VIPs, with exquisite designs.

Before the meeting, the signing area was busy, and after the meeting, the cloakroom was busy. The elevator temporarily suspended its schedule of one trip every ten minutes.

After the tea party, the Citizens Welfare Association held a board meeting to exchange views on the issue of population evacuation.

### Collection of Tuition Fees by Various Schools; Supplementary Measures Defined; Stipulations to Improve Teacher Compensation

In recent years, various private schools in the city have mostly resorted to increasing tuition fees due to rising prices. However, there has been no reduction in the hardship experienced by teachers and staff, while the burden on students' parents has largely increased. Moreover, the unlimited collection of tuition fees has significant implications. To stabilize the livelihoods of teachers and staff and to aid students who might drop out due to financial difficulties, the Municipal Bureau of Education mobilized several staff members last winter to conduct on-site investigations into the tuition fees and their allocation in private primary and secondary schools with longer histories. Based on the results of the investigation and statistics, and with reference to the prevailing cost of living index, a tentative standard for teacher compensation and student fee collection in private primary and secondary schools for the second semester of the 33rd year of the Republic was drafted. This draft was submitted to the Municipal Government for review by the Ministry of Education and was subsequently reported in the local newspapers. Later, due to a sudden and sharp increase in the cost of living index, Director Dai urgently prepared supplementary measures to address the factual needs. He believed that providing teachers and staff with in-kind rations was the most effective solution. He actively consulted with relevant parties, and with the deep concern of former Mayor Chen, the special rice ration for teachers and staff was immediately increased from 1.35 dou to 3 dou, hoping to provide some relief. However, the current situation is incomparable to that of even a month ago. Therefore, based on the fundamental principle of stabilizing the livelihoods of teachers and staff and aiding students who might drop out due to financial difficulties, eight supplementary measures were drafted based on Article 17 of the original standard. These measures are transcribed below:

Tuition Standards; Two Installments; Efforts to Increase the Variety of Material Rations for Teachers and Staff; Economic Subsidies for Well-Managed Private Primary and Secondary Schools That Have Been Registered and Approved, with the subsidy mainly for teacher compensation. Tuition fees collected by schools in the second semester are temporarily permitted to be increased by up to double the original maximum standard, i.e., no more than 12,000 yuan for high schools, no more than 8,000 yuan for senior primary schools, no more than 7,200 yuan for intermediate primary schools, and no more than 6,400 yuan for junior primary schools and kindergartens. Schools should still consider the fee collection situation from the previous semester and the economic conditions of most student families when making decisions. Furthermore, fees should be collected in two or more installments to facilitate payment for students' parents.

Financial Transparency; Increase Teacher Salaries; The number of free student places in each school should be no less than 15% for secondary schools and no less than 20% for primary schools and kindergartens. Schools that collect tuition fees according to Item 3 should each increase the number of free places by 5%, i.e., no less than 20% for secondary schools and no less than 25% for primary schools and kindergartens, to accommodate as many needy students as possible. The school board of directors should strictly supervise the school's financial income and expenditure. If the board of directors is not yet soundly established, the principal should inform the full-time teachers to organize a financial audit committee to review the income and expenditure accounts and absolutely implement financial transparency. The salaries paid to teachers and staff should be increased from no less than 70% to no less than 75% of the total tuition revenue, excluding rent, as stipulated in Article 4 of the original standard. Schools that fail to comply with the above measures will be subject to appropriate sanctions depending on the severity of the circumstances. Except as stipulated in these supplementary measures, the remaining provisions shall still be implemented in accordance with the revised "Provisional Standards for Teacher Compensation and Student Fee Collection in Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the Shanghai Special Municipality" that have been submitted for approval and promulgated. The above measures were approved by Mayor Zhou and will be implemented effectively.

### Newspaper Reporters Host a Banquet for Director Liu

The city's press corps, in view of the fact that the new Director of Publicity, Liu Dexuan, comes from a journalistic background, hosted a banquet at the Jinjiang Hotel yesterday (the 21st) at 6 p.m. to express their sincere welcome. Those attending included Du Shenyan of the Central News Agency, Cao Youzhi of the Xinwen Bao, Zhang Cheng of the Ping Bao, Yao Luochuan of the Xin Zhongguo Bao, Qian Jiaxue of the Zhonghua Ribao, Xue Xiaoxue of the Xin Shen Bao, Wang Fu of the Guomin Xinwen, and reporters from this newspaper, totaling more than ten people. Director Liu Dexuan attended the banquet on time, and the conversation was very pleasant.

### Seventh Period Household Coal Briquettes; Payment and Delivery

After a long period of preparation, the authorities in charge of the seventh period household coal briquettes allocation have gradually completed their preparations and will begin general distribution within this month. However, the quantity allocated per person and the standard selling price per catty (市斤), as well as the start and end dates, will be officially announced later. The Coal Briquette Industry Association has been ordered to carry out various procedures and has set a deadline of today and tomorrow for companies designated to sell this period's household coal briquettes to pay the money to the Association at 587 Jing'an Temple Road to pick up the goods from the designated manufacturers.

### Extension of Deadline for Distribution of Coarse Grains

The date for the distribution of coarse grains to residents in the former First District based on the Item Distribution Office's Comprehensive Distribution Certificate No. 36, which was previously announced by the office as running from January 10th to the 21st, is about to expire. It is heard that some residents have not yet received their allocation. The distribution of these coarse grains was delayed, and the relevant authorities only recently received the delivery vouchers. Furthermore, due to the transition between the old and new administrations, various retail outlets still had inventory from the Feng administration that could be used for sales. Therefore, the office issued a notice to all retail outlets on January 11th, ordering them to prioritize the distribution of existing inventory to meet the needs of residents. However, it has recently been discovered that some unscrupulous individuals are making excuses and delaying distribution, which is extremely deplorable. As for the previous reports in various newspapers stating that the deadline was the 17th, this was also a misrepresentation. The new Director Liu has issued a public notice informing everyone that the deadline has been extended to the end of the month.
