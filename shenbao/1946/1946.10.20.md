[Report from this newspaper] Government representatives Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen arrived in Shanghai by special plane a few days ago to invite representatives from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Third Force to go to Beijing to continue the talks that had been interrupted for several months. After two days of continuous efforts, their mission has been successfully completed. Leaders of the CCP and the Third Force, amidst thunderous cheers yesterday, decided to fly to Beijing by government special plane tomorrow morning. Of the three government representatives, Lei Zhen has already returned to Beijing due to official business. Wu and Shao also returned to Beijing last night.

The atmosphere yesterday was even more harmonious. Although the talks did not formally involve specific issues, all the participating representatives were extremely optimistic. They deeply felt that the ceasefire, which the compatriots of the whole country sincerely long for day and night, has moved a step closer due to the discussions of the past few days.

Yesterday morning, the representatives did not have a joint meeting, only exchanged views individually. At noon, the Youth Party hosted a banquet for all the representatives. At 4 PM, the Democratic Socialist Party held a tea party at its headquarters on Yuyuan Road. At 7 PM, the CCP hosted a banquet for all the representatives at Zhou's residence on Sinan Road. Formal exchange of views took place from 5 PM to 7 PM at Wang Ying's residence on Haige Road.

All the representatives were in very high spirits, and the atmosphere was full of peace and harmony as they toasted each other. Participants in the talks included Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Zhou Enlai, Li Weihan, Chen Jiakang, Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Zeng Qi, Hu Zhengzhi, Li Huang, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yang Yongjun, Yu Jiaju, Guo Moruo, Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Jiang Yuntian, and others.

At the tea party of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zhang Junmai first invited Xu Fulin, one of the founders of the party and a founding hero, to give a speech. Xu said that he hoped the government would broaden its perspective and make concessions for the sake of the entire country and the entire nation. He also hoped that the CCP would make concessions for the sake of the entire country and all compatriots. The Third Force is willing to do its best to promote the success of peace talks so that a new China can be created.

Wu Tiecheng then gave a speech, stating that the government's desire for peaceful unification is as urgent as that of all parties in opposition. Therefore, the government sincerely urges all parties and social elites, as well as representatives of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), to go to Beijing as soon as possible to resume peace talks, striving for the success of the talks and the realization of peace. He also hoped that all the virtuous people in opposition would become "in power," jointly taking responsibility, not only solving all the problems of the country but also jointly planning the construction of the country. He and Mr. Shao Lizi, representing the government and the PCC representatives, have come to invite all of you to Beijing to listen to your insightful opinions and ask for your guidance. We sincerely hope that you will go to Beijing. Our mission in Shanghai today can be said to have come to an end. If you cannot go to Nanjing together today or tomorrow, we also hope that you will make the trip as soon as possible. We will look forward to your arrival to discuss national affairs together. This is not only the hope of the government but also the hope of the people of the whole country.

### Negotiation Door Opened: Deeply Hope to Achieve Peace: Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Tea Party

Zhou Enlai then gave a speech upon invitation, stating briefly: He was not only excited but also more gratified by Mr. Xu's instructions. It is not easy for us to gather together. When the PCC opened in the past, the whole country rejoiced and cheered for its success, and the PCC finally succeeded. Unfortunately, twists and turns occurred afterward, and the PCC could not be reopened, resulting in all parties, factions, and social elites having to leave Beijing again in disappointment after arriving. Now that the peace talks have been suspended for five months, thanks to the efforts of the Third Force and the arrival of government representatives in Shanghai, we can finally meet and talk again. Informal negotiations have now begun. The door to negotiation has been opened, and we deeply hope to achieve peace, democracy, independence, and unity. All these have been stipulated in the PCC, and now we only seek their realization, especially peace, which is the ceasefire, as the most important. This is what the people of the whole country urgently demand. We are willing to follow Mr. Xu's instructions and strive to achieve our goals.

### Zeng Qi Hopes to Stop the Flames of War

Next, Zeng Qi gave a speech, saying: Today is the first grand gathering since the closing of the Chongqing PCC, which is extremely gratifying. Today's meeting is a symbol of national unity, which shows that the future is promising. The current dispute lies in the lack of cessation of the flames of war. The Third Force is a political party without guns. Today, the government and the CCP have gradually attached importance to the opinions of the Third Force. Because "if you do not respect the person, you will not respect their words," you must "respect the person and respect their party" in order to "respect their words." The Third Force feels both happy and fearful: happy that there is room for their opinions to be adopted, which can turn hostility into friendship; fearful that their ability is weak and they may not succeed. He believes that if both sides can sincerely respect the Third Force, then the Third Force will be able to maintain its impartial spirit and work hard from the standpoint of a truly third party. However, as the Doctrine of the Mean says, "You can tread on a bare blade, but you cannot practice the Doctrine of the Mean." The third party may still inevitably be scolded. This is his feeling today. He has known Mr. Zhang Junmai since 1919, nearly thirty years ago, and he hopes to make the greatest efforts together in the future to stop the flames of war and promote peace.

### Zhang Junmai Speaks, Calling Himself a Younger Brother

After that, Zhang Junmai invited Luo Longji and Shen Junru to speak, who both declined humbly, saying that the China Democratic League (CDL) and the Democratic Socialist Party are one family. Zhang then gave a speech, saying: "Today, it is an honor that the Kuomintang (KMT), the CCP, other parties, social elites, and virtuous people are willing to come and gather together. The Democratic Socialist Party is the 'younger brother' among the various political parties and is not yet a full year old. Today, it seems to have grown up. Since 1924, the history of China has been the history of the KMT and the CCP. The period from 1924 until the Japanese surrender can be called the darkest period in Chinese history. Today's gathering is truly rare after thirteen years. The 'younger brother' is willing to follow the 'older brothers' and hopes to make practical contributions to achieving democracy, unification, and nation-building." After the speech, there was thunderous applause. Wu Tiecheng stepped forward, raised his glass, and said that the guests should congratulate the members of the Democratic Socialist Party! Everyone happily raised their glasses. Wu then said with a smile: Although the Democratic Socialist Party has been born for less than a year, it has extremely sufficient innate qualities! The whole room was filled with joy.

### If an Agreement is Reached in the Negotiations in Beijing, a Ceasefire Order Can Be Issued Immediately

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The evolution of the current situation has taken a major turn for the better tonight. Due to the government's concessions, the opinions of both sides are converging. CCP representative Zhou Enlai and other representatives of various parties can be welcomed back to Nanjing by a special plane sent by the government on the 21st to reopen negotiations. The ceasefire issue can be discussed and resolved immediately in the Military Three-Person Group meeting. Because both sides sincerely agree to a ceasefire, the ceasefire order can also be issued immediately. This news was obtained by the reporter from a conversation with PCC representative Sun Ke at around 8 PM tonight. Sun told the reporter with an extremely optimistic attitude that the situation has indeed undergone a major change. All issues will be discussed when they come to Beijing. The CCP has agreed to the opinions put forward by the government and has agreed to return to Beijing immediately, which means that it no longer insists on the two opinions of the Yan'an side. They will return to Beijing on the 21st. If a meeting is held on that day, an agreement can be reached on that day, and a ceasefire order can be issued immediately. The "Three" and "Five" meetings can also be convened, and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee will also be held. As for the issue of the National Assembly representatives and the number of CCP representatives, it needs to be decided in the Comprehensive Group.

### Representatives Wu and Shao Advance to Beijing Last Night

The reporter was extremely anxious because the situation was unpredictable. At 6:30 PM, suddenly hearing enthusiastic applause followed by laughter, the reporter felt relieved. At 7 PM, all reporters were invited into the meeting room. Luo Longji, representing the entire group, made a statement, saying: The informal negotiations were held again today and were even more harmonious than yesterday. The peace talks have taken another step forward. It has now been decided to continue the informal negotiations in Beijing first. The government representatives will advance to Beijing tonight, and all representatives of the Third Force and the CCP will advance to Beijing by government special plane the day after tomorrow (the 21st) morning to continue the informal negotiations of the past two days.

Shao Lizi said that the current talks are the first part of "talk, stop, talk," which is "talk." Luo Longji added: The people advancing to Beijing on the 21st include all parties, factions, social elites, and virtuous people who participated in the talks in the past two days, not limited to PCC representatives.

### The CCP's Banquet Overflowed with Laughter

Chen Jiakang, when answering reporters' inquiries, also revealed that what the government is asking for is to maintain the status quo, and what the CCP is asking for is to respect the agreements. All the representatives then went to Zhou's residence on Sinan Road to attend the CCP's banquet. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves to the fullest, and the atmosphere was overflowing with laughter. After Wu and Shao left Shanghai, the reporter also interviewed several representatives of the Third Force late at night to inquire about their opinions on the prospects of the peace talks. All the representatives unanimously expressed optimism, believing that even if there is a distance between the opinions of the two sides, the war is bound to be stopped because a ceasefire is not only the common demand of the people of the whole of China, but also the desire of people all over the world.

### Lei Zhen Returns to Beijing to Report to the Chairman

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen returned to Beijing by night train on the 18th and arrived at 7:15 AM on the 19th. At 9:30 AM, he attended the report in the meeting at President Sun Ke's private residence. Attendees included Zhang Lisheng, Wang Shijie, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wu Dingchang, Sun Ke, and Lei Zhen. Lei reported the contacts in Shanghai for the past two days, especially explaining the meaning of the word "agree" in Chairman Chiang's statement, "Once the CCP agrees" and "After the CCP agrees to the above points." Sun said that agreement and understanding are actually the same thing and have the same meaning. If the CCP can understand this opinion, then negotiations can begin. Lei reported in great detail, lasting an hour. Then, the representatives expressed their opinions, all hoping that the representatives of the various parties could return to Beijing immediately and convene the Three-Person Group and the informal Five-Person Group meetings separately in accordance with the Chairman's eight-point guideline for resolving the current situation. Then, the ceasefire order could be issued. After the meeting, Chen Bulei and Lei Zhen went to see the Chairman at noon to report everything. In the afternoon, Lei informed Shanghai of this opinion by long-distance telephone. It is said that the meeting in Shanghai at 4 PM today was based on this opinion and discussed it. As a result, both sides reached an understanding and it was heard that they had decided to return to Beijing on Monday. PCC government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Shao Lizi are scheduled to return to Beijing by night train on the 19th and will arrive on the morning of the 20th. In addition, Liang Shuming of the CDL visited Lei Zhen at 7 PM and talked for an hour.

### "Shanghai Talks": Behind the News Line, Wu and Zhou Shake Hands with Smiles: The "Fourth Force" is Very Active

Yesterday, when the photographers from the Central Photography Studio were planning their work at Wang Lu, everyone said that there must be a shot of Wu Tiecheng and Zhou Enlai shaking hands. When the filming officially began, Secretary-General Wu said: "Please ask Mr. Zhou to stand in the middle, and Mr. Shao and I will stand on the side. Wouldn't it be better if we stood a little closer?" However, the reporters standing behind the photographers unanimously shouted from the bottom of their hearts: "Please shake hands! Shake hands!" Wu immediately smiled and extended his hand to Zhou Enlai. Zhou readily grasped it tightly. The sound of the camera rang, leaving behind this unforgettable scene!

When explaining "stop talking," "talk stop talk," and "talk stop," a certain representative smiled and said to the reporters: "We are interpreting for you. You have to deduct a portion of this month's salary for us." The venues for the talks these days are one at Fan Garden on Haige Road (the residence of Xu Zhimo's wife, Zhang Junmai's younger sister) and one at Wu Tiecheng's Wang Lu residence on Haige Road. Some reporters said that the talks would surely succeed because "Wang Lu" means there is hope, and "Fan Garden" means there is a range.

When the Democratic Socialist Party held a tea party on Yuyuan Road, the reporters said: "We are the fourth force." As a result, the "fourth force" was also treated with tea and refreshments. Zhang Junmai was in particularly high spirits. He said: "I want to take a photo with Mr. Wu and Mr. Shao," and "I want to take a photo with Mr. Zhou." He took one photo after another. No one had ever seen Mr. Zhang so happy.

Shao Lizi has been working hard for days, and he felt slightly unwell during the talks yesterday. There was a chorus of "Buy Tiger Balm!" in Wang Lu. Luo Longji said that Mr. Shao was dozing off while attending the meeting, but in fact, it was for the sake of the country. The elderly Mr. Shao is really tired. His loyalty to the country and his achievements are no less than those of the anti-Japanese soldiers. Secretary-General Wu's Wang Lu residence is the center for reporters to gather news during the "January 28th Incident" fourteen years ago. It is magnificent, elegant, and exquisitely decorated. The small living room where Wu met with reporters during his tenure as the Mayor of Shanghai is also the place where he met with reporters these two days. Even the photos on display are still the same as they were back then. The world has changed drastically in the past fourteen years, but the scenery in this small living room is still the same as it was back then!

The most tense moment the day before yesterday was at 4 or 5 PM when the terms of the Yan'an statement were suddenly heard at Zhou's residence. The most tense moment yesterday was also at 5 PM when the representatives closed the doors at Wang Lu to discuss matters. Perhaps Chinese history was at two of its most critical turning points at that time. When the reporters entered the conference room at 7 PM to hear the official announcement of the news, they hurriedly asked the representatives if the news was good. Huang Yanpei said: "It's good news." Shao Li also said, "Very good news." Zhou Enlai said with a smile: "Ask them, ask them!"

### Eastern Chahar Guyuan Recovered: National Army Approaches Chicheng

Chaigoubao in Western Chahar Can Be Recovered Soon

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] The battle near Zhangjiakou is nearing its end.

### National Army Enters Meng County in Northern Henan

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 19th] After the National Army recovered Wen County on the 14th in Northern Henan, it continued to advance and stationed in Meng County.

### Gunfire Heard in Yulin

[Report from this newspaper, Tianjin, 19th] The rapid repair of the Yulin Airport is the main reason for the communist army's invasion. Hu Jingduo, deputy commander of the Shaanxi Northern Security Team stationed in Hengshan, was lured into betraying by the communist army, which is another reason for the outbreak of war. Hengshan has been captured, and the soldiers and civilians in the city have been brutally killed by the communist army. The battle is currently taking place in Shiwang, Hengshan. Xiangshui is still in the hands of the National Army. The communist army has launched several fierce attacks but has been repelled. Yulin is eighty miles away from Fanshui, and the sound of gunfire can be heard, but the order in the city is still very good. However, food prices are soaring due to lack of supply.

### Fierce Fighting on the Outskirts of Fu'an

[Report from this newspaper, Taixian, 19th] The battle on the outskirts of Fu'an has reached a fever pitch. Both sides have engaged in hand-to-hand combat. General Li Tianxia personally went to the front line to command yesterday, and the morale was boosted.

### Years of Destruction Since the Republic: Revolution Should Focus on Construction: Ambassador Stuart Encourages Students in Hangzhou in His Speech

[Report from this newspaper, Hangzhou, 19th] This morning, Ambassador Stuart, guided by Mayor Zhou and Wang Kui-sheng, visited his former residence on Tianhan Zhou Bridge in the city. This place is the earliest Jesus Church in Hangzhou, built by his father in the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty. Ambassador Stuart was born here in 1876, spending his happy childhood. At the age of eleven, he went abroad to study. After completing his studies, he returned to Hangzhou with his newly married wife at the end of 1904 and also lived here. Therefore, Ambassador Stuart has a particularly close feeling for Hangzhou and expressed that he felt it a great honor to be able to speak a few words of Hangzhou dialect. Ambassador Stuart lingered in the room where he was born for a long time. At this time, the breeze was gentle, and the autumn sun was pleasant. Ambassador Stuart nodded with a smile, as if recalling his childhood dreams. The atmosphere in the room was peaceful. Seventy-one years ago, this messenger of peace for China was born here, with the enthusiasm of a missionary, willing to benefit the Chinese people for life. Now, the situation in the country is at a critical turning point. Visiting here has great significance. The tree planted by Ambassador Stuart in his childhood now covers the house, and the seeds of peace he is sowing now will surely have satisfactory achievements in the future.

Ambassador Stuart stayed at his former residence for half an hour and then took a short rest at the guest house before taking a car to Zhijiang University. Director Shen of the Municipal Public Affairs Bureau led the way, and Mayor Zhou and others accompanied him. President Li Peien warmly welcomed him. At 11:30 AM, he gave a speech at the school's Duke Hall. More than 700 teachers and students from the entire school went to listen. When Ambassador Stuart entered, everyone stood up automatically, and the applause was thunderous. After President Li gave a brief welcome speech, Ambassador Stuart began his speech in soft Chinese, stating briefly: With decades of educational experience, he deeply felt the great power of Chinese students. The Chinese student movement is a great miracle seen only in history. China's patriotic movements are all due to the power of Chinese students, such as the May Fourth Movement. This spirit will never be forgotten by me. In the past anti-Japanese war, it showed the spirit, will, unity, and organizational power of Chinese students. I deeply hope that this power will continue to be exerted to promote the realization of a peaceful, unified, and strong China, with freedom of thought, speech, religion, belief, and discussion of national affairs, so that the Republic of China can be named and actualized. Although there are many corrupt officials now, the blame should be placed on the people, not on the government. This is the way to reform the Republic of China. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, there has been destruction every year. From now on, we should focus on construction. Therefore, this revolution should also be a revolution of construction, not a revolution of destruction. Finally, he hoped that Chinese youth would all have religious beliefs, which could enhance their patriotism and their enthusiasm for serving society and the people.

### People's Organizations Fete Special Envoy: Reciting Opinions and Supporting Chairman's Eight Directives

At 12:00 noon, more than 200 representatives from people's organizations in Zhejiang Province held a banquet for Ambassador Stuart at the Dahua Hotel on the shore of West Lake. The Special Envoy arrived at the meeting after delivering a speech at Zhejiang University. Those present greeted him with warm applause and immediately took their seats. Li Pei'en, President of Zhejiang University, chaired the event and delivered a welcome speech, the gist of which was: Mr. Stuart was born in Hangzhou and should be regarded as a Chinese citizen under American law. Therefore, we should regard him as a fellow villager. We are delighted that our fellow villager has come home from afar. Ambassador Stuart was originally an educator, but was invited by the American government to serve as ambassador. This is a great honor for our village. Since taking office, Ambassador Stuart has worked tirelessly to seek peace for our country. All of this deserves our warm welcome. After Mr. Li finished speaking, he translated his words into English. Amidst applause, the Special Envoy stood up and delivered a speech in Hangzhou dialect, expressing his gratitude and saying that he dared not accept all the slogans in the hall, except for the one that said "Hangzhou is my second hometown," which he felt he deserved. He recalled fondly his childhood days wandering between the north and south hills of West Lake and the Lingyin Temple, finding great joy. He was very pleased to see that the lake and mountains were still in good condition. He hoped that everyone, under the leadership of Chairman Shen, would build a new Zhejiang and strive to build modern enterprises under the spirit of science and academia. He knew that Zhejiang's silk, tea, and Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors were all famous, and if they could be improved, their future would be limitless. Later, veteran diplomat Qian Shiqing recited the opinions of Zhejiang's people's organizations, the main points of which were: (1) seek internal political reform; (2) the unreasonable disturbances of the Communist Party should be effectively sanctioned; (3) Chairman Chiang's eight key points should be sincerely supported; (4) the convening of the National Assembly should not be delayed any further, and all parties should submit their lists of candidates as soon as possible; (5) the Communist Party should accept the Five-Man and Three-Man meetings and hold them quickly; (6) our two countries have always maintained friendly relations, and the anti-American movement does not represent the will of the entire people. After Chen Xisu, Principal of Hongdao Girls' High School, translated it into English, Chairman Shen Honglie delivered a speech, praising the grand occasion with democracy, freedom, unity, and peace. Then, students from Zhejiang University, including Ms. Mao Min, presented local products from major Zhejiang manufacturers. Stuart stood up again to express his gratitude, and then the luncheon began. They toasted each other several times, and the event ended happily at 3:00 p.m.

Special Envoy Speaks Earnestly: China Needs Unity and Peace, Starting with Education and Character

At 4:00 p.m., Ambassador Stuart attended the reopening ceremony of the YMCA. The auditorium on the fourth floor of the YMCA was packed. After the meeting was opened with fireworks and the rituals were performed, Lei Fazhang, President of the YMCA, reported on the establishment of the World YMCA and the history of the Chinese YMCA and the Hangzhou YMCA. Then, Ambassador Stuart delivered a speech in Chinese, saying that the Hangzhou YMCA was his first friend, and Wang Kui, the current General Secretary of the Hangzhou YMCA, was his old colleague. He was born in Hangzhou, so he loved China. China needed unity, independence, and peace to complete a strong nation, which should start with education and character, with love, honesty, unity, service, faith, and a spirit of sacrifice. Ambassador Stuart spoke earnestly, and the audience was moved. Then, Chairman Shen delivered a speech, saying that the YMCA was Christian, and the Christian doctrine was about cultivating the Way, and the Way was about love. Schools in Zhejiang Province paid attention to intellectual education but neglected physical education, especially moral and social education. The YMCA emphasized the equal importance of intellectual, physical, moral, and social education. He hoped to cooperate with people in the education field in the future to inspire young people to move forward. Finally, Liang Xiaochu, General Secretary of the National YMCA Association, delivered a speech, and Wang Kui, General Secretary of the Hangzhou YMCA, reported on the YMCA's development trends. They sang hymns and offered blessings. After the meeting, a ceremony was held to welcome Ambassador Stuart as an honorary citizen. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian presided over the ceremony and led the rituals, and then delivered a speech. Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, and Zhang Heng, Speaker of the Municipal Assembly, also delivered speeches. Ambassador Stuart responded, and the ceremony concluded. In the evening, Ambassador Stuart went to the YWCA to listen to music. He was scheduled to preside over his father's Hushan Hall service at the church on the morning of the 20th and tour Hushan in the afternoon.

### Chairman Shen Hopes Special Envoy Lives Seventy More Years

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 19th] After Ambassador Stuart arrived in Hangzhou, Mayor Zhou and his wife held a banquet at the foreign guest reception center at noon on the 18th. In the evening, they went to the provincial government to attend a joint banquet hosted by the provincial government, the provincial party headquarters, and the youth league branch headquarters. More than 40 leaders from all sectors of the party and government and social celebrities attended. During the banquet, Chairman Shen delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Tonight, we are welcoming not an ordinary envoy, but our old fellow villager. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country suffered heavy losses. Mr. Stuart has returned to his long-separated homeland and sees that the lake and mountains are still the same. The Hongdao Girls' School, founded by his mother, is thriving, and the graves of his parents are intact. This should be a great comfort to the Ambassador. The Ambassador was detained by the Japanese army for a long time, and now, at the age of 70, he is working for peace and is still in good health, which makes us even happier. I hope the Ambassador will stay in Hangzhou for a few more days, enjoy the lake and mountains, and I hope the Ambassador will live for another 70 years, continue his past spirit of compassion, and work hard for Sino-American friendship."

After Chairman Shen finished his speech, Secretary-General Lei translated it into English. Then, Ambassador Stuart replied in Hangzhou dialect, saying: "This time, I returned to Hangzhou to sweep the graves and tour West Lake. I grew up in Hangzhou and consider it my second hometown. I have been away from Hangzhou for many years, and I am very pleased to return. I am very grateful for the warm reception. I hope that Sino-American relations will become closer and that we will strengthen cooperation to build a foundation for world peace." After he finished speaking, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause. The guests and hosts happily dispersed at 10:00 p.m.

### Mrs. Cripps to Visit Yan'an at the End of the Month

### Northeast, with Endless Coal Mines, Faces Extremely Severe Coal Shortage This Winter; Government Agencies Share Office Space, Enemy Property Houses Unoccupied

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 19th] The Northeast, known worldwide for its endless forests and coal mines, is experiencing a severe coal shortage this winter. It is already late autumn, and the leaves are falling, but the city's eagerly awaited winter heating essential, coal, is still nowhere to be found. The black market coal price has already risen to 14,000 or 15,000 yuan per ton in circulating currency, but this is not enough to induce coal merchants to transport large quantities of it, because under the circumstances of a lack of transportation and strict control over coal production and sales, they are actually powerless. After the Japanese residents here were successively repatriated, the Japanese-style houses in the new urban area, full of flowers and plants, are almost entirely vacant. Although these exquisite and skillfully constructed buildings have all been received or registered for use, very few people have actually moved in. The reason is that there is a lack of coal for heating. In order to save coal, the employees and families of various agencies in the city are scrambling to live together, and some agencies with different affiliations are also agreeing to share office space in order to get through the harsh winter together. Recently, the Maritime Building, which was renovated by the Economic Commission of the Northeast Headquarters, is about to become a public winter shelter for agencies related to the economic sector. The building is large in scale, surpassing the Manchurian Coal Building previously occupied by the Northeast Headquarters. It has now been agreed that the Changchun Branch of the Northeast Unified Receiving Committee, the Food Administration, the Economic Affairs Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Real Estate Bureau will live together. In addition, the building has spare rooms that can accommodate 300 to 400 people for office work. Those who wish to borrow the rooms are invited to do so. The borrowing agencies do not have to pay rent and only need to share the coal costs and public utilities fees for the winter. This is a great irony to those in Beijing and Shanghai who are propping up houses with gold bars.

### Pinghan Railway Will Soon Be Open; Inspection Team Departs from Hankou Yesterday, Preparing to Start Repair Work

Editorial

### A Smooth Path for Developing International Trade

In order to restore the freedom of international trade after the war, the United States Department of State issued a white paper proposing a plan to develop international trade and raise employment levels in various countries, and suggested that various countries hold an international trade and employment conference to pass the "World Trade Charter" at the conference and organize an "International Trade Organization." The United Nations Social and Economic Council invited representatives from 19 countries, including China, the United States, Britain, and France, to hold a preparatory meeting in London starting on the 15th of this month to prepare for the procedures and agenda of the international trade conference. Except for the Soviet Union, all the world's major powers have representatives participating. The direction of world trade after the war is closely related to the success of this preparatory meeting and deserves our attention.

The nature of this preparatory meeting is roughly the same as the previously convened Bretton Woods International Monetary Fund Conference, which focuses on discussing the plan proposed by the United States. As for the content of the American plan, we have not yet seen the white paper issued by the State Department, so it is difficult to speculate; but according to a London dispatch from Agence France-Presse on the 17th, American representative Wilcox stated at the preparatory meeting that he proposed five principles for reviving the world economy: (1) substantially reduce tariff barriers; (2) countries exchange goods with each other; (3) no discrimination should be given to various imported goods; (4) countries should maintain a high level of employment; (5) all countries are equal in the international market.

The representatives of the 18 countries participating in this preparatory meeting expressed their approval of the American proposal to varying degrees. In particular, China, according to the speech of my country's representative Jin Wensi at the meeting: "The Chinese government attaches great importance to the tasks assigned to this meeting; we must ensure that the post-war world can enjoy the fruits of victory and no longer suffer the pain of poverty; the Chinese government expresses its deep approval of the American initiative to convene a world trade and employment conference; therefore, the Chinese delegation is prepared to accept the charter proposed by the United States as a basis for discussion; but it still hopes that the representatives of all countries can put forward positive and specific suggestions so that the less developed countries can also complete their industrialization tasks as soon as possible." Other representatives from various countries also expressed their approval; making this meeting full of a pleasant and harmonious atmosphere, everyone felt that the future was bright and optimistic.

However, if we study the wishes of the United States in putting forward this plan and observe the actual situation in the world today, we deeply feel that there are still some difficulties in restoring the freedom of international trade after the war, which still require the efforts of American political diplomats. The focus of the American plan is to organize the United Nations International Trade Organization and implement economic cooperation, on the one hand, based on the principle of mutual benefit, so that all countries have the opportunity to freely develop their trade and economy; on the other hand, according to equal conditions, all countries have equal opportunities to obtain markets and raw materials. In a word, it is to realize the American wish, which is to restore the freedom of international trade and gradually lift the restrictions on trade for all countries. But can this wish be realized? At least today, it is still a very serious problem.

The first is that the non-participation of the Soviet Union and its bloc of countries in this meeting is enough to show that there are already two major groups in the world today in terms of economics; one is a socialist system, with the Soviet Union as the leader; the other is a capitalist system, with the United States as the center. These two major groups are as incompatible as fire and water, whether in ideology or in interests. In particular, the Soviet Union's heavy iron curtain in Eastern Europe makes it impossible for other countries to inquire. Therefore, the scope of the international trade freedom movement advocated by the United States can only be the scope of the so-called Anglo-American group at most. If the Soviet Union group does not participate in the development of international trade, it will not be of much significance.

The second is that the other countries after the war, especially Britain and France, suffered major losses during the war, and it is not easy to talk about recovery and prosperity after the war. Therefore, they have imposed various restrictions on foreign trade. Although the United States does not hesitate to lend huge sums of money to Britain and France to help them revive their economies, it cannot completely lift all restrictions on Britain and France for a while. As French representative Alphand stated at the meeting: "The two world wars have caused France to suffer major losses, and France will still need a considerable period of time to be able to abolish its restrictions on imported goods."

The third is that economically backward countries, whose industries have not yet been fully industrialized, cannot, in principle, oppose the freedom of international trade; but in order to develop their own industries, they cannot but adopt the so-called "moderate protection" measures. Because economically backward countries cannot stand on an equal footing with the United States at all. The principles of freedom, equality, mutual benefit, and mutual interest proclaimed by the American plan only benefit the United States, while industrially backward countries cannot enjoy its benefits. If this contradiction cannot be eliminated, the future of developing international trade is also not optimistic. Although the United States can benefit a lot under the principle of free international trade, it must also pay attention to the industrialization of economically backward countries. Indian representative Nehru expressed his opinion at the meeting, criticizing the American plan for failing to take into account the interests of economically underdeveloped countries. This sentence is worthy of deep thought by the American authorities.

The fourth is the problem of unemployment in various countries after the war. Now all countries are successively demobilizing, but after the scourge of this war, all countries are full of devastation, and it is difficult to talk about recovery. In particular, the employment problem of the people is even more difficult to solve. So how can we maintain a high level of employment in various countries? It is also a serious problem that requires the United States to come up with concrete solutions, and empty talk is of no practical help.

AUSTIN, the head of the American delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, declared on the 18th that the United States is willing to take the world's leadership position, abolish war, resolve international disputes by peaceful means, and improve the living standards of people in all countries of the world in terms of knowledge, spirit, and material, in order to eliminate the causes of war. Therefore, we hope that the United States should take a broad view of developing international trade, face reality, coordinate the interests of all parties, and jointly seek the recovery and prosperity of all countries in the world; it must not be selfish and consider only its own interests everywhere, and be regarded as an economic imperialist. The future of international trade is built on the economic prosperity of all countries in the world. If all countries in the world are poor, then the United States cannot enjoy prosperity alone.

### Commerce in Gaoyou Gradually Recovering Severe Shortage of Legal Tender and Extreme Difficulty in Getting Small Change Surplus of Rice and Grain but Scarcity of Daily Necessities

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch, 18th] According to a telephone message from Gaoyou: Since Gaoyou was occupied by the Communist army, although it was only for two months, countless people were brutally killed. Especially, the market was desolate, and the scene was so miserable that it seemed like another world compared with other restored areas. After the county government entered the city on the 8th of this month, County Magistrate Zhang Guanqiu led the county government personnel to inspect the entire city and personally consoled the victims, and the people were all grateful and wept bitterly. A military-civilian joint celebration was held in the Grand Auditorium a few days ago, and Gao Zifang (retired soldier) and Xia Datong (doctor over 60 years old) reported, in a sad and tearful tone, the horrors they had personally experienced and witnessed under the Communist rule, and the listeners were all heartbroken. In particular, Xia Datong read out two seven-character quatrains on the spot: "The people of the whole territory are overjoyed, the blue sky and white sun shine again, saving the people from fire and water, everyone respects the generals, and blesses the heavens with longevity. Mao Zedong harms the country and the people, falsely claiming democracy to deceive farmers and workers, carrying out looting and massacre, and sweeping away all public and private property in the territory." Those who heard it were even more moved. The houses in the city are quite neat, and there are not many traces of artillery fire left. This is the luck of the people of Gaoyou. The shops in the north and south gates have been tidied up and are resuming business. However, there is a severe shortage of legal tender in the streets, and it is extremely difficult to get small change. What is needed here is a large number of materials, such as matches, candles, dry batteries, cloth, and groceries. What is in surplus is rice, wheat, flour, and beans. You still don't believe it, but in Gaoyou, which produces crabs, it is not easy to eat crabs, because they are packed and sold at high prices in Zhenjiang and Shanghai. Now, the Gaoyou County Government is starting to check household registrations and reorganize the baojia system. The east and west gates of the city are closed at 7:00 PM, and the north and south gates are under curfew at 9:00 PM. At the same time, there are no electric lights here. The shops all use kerosene lamps and candles. There is no market at night, and the residents rest as soon as it gets dark. Who said that the people of Gaoyou have not been slaughtered? On the afternoon of October 7, more than a hundred young men were arrested by the Communist Party outside the north gate and shot to death with machine guns. This was because of the defeat of Shaobo on the 6th, and the Communist army frantically staged this bloody tragedy to vent their anger. In Gaoyou these days, I have seen many people carrying tables and chairs, which were the objects distributed to the poor by struggle. Now the people have automatically returned them, fearing disputes. After the Communist army withdrew from Shaobo, knowing that relying on force was not enough, they concentrated in Gaoyou and then fled one after another, and moved away a large amount of materials. Wang Wanfeng Sauce Garden outside the south gate was also robbed of many pickles. Fortunately, the National Army was stationed quickly and returned twenty large boats of pickles. On the side of Taishan Temple outside the north gate, there is Qinyou Terrace, which is still intact, with many steles and inscriptions by Su Dongpo. Gaoyou after the disaster will gradually move towards recovery. The reporter silently wishes him to grow up early and restore his original appearance.

### Li Defu, an Important Bandit Leader, Captured by Xu Guoliang

[Our Newspaper Wujiang Dispatch, 19th] After the bandit Li Defu was brought to justice, County Magistrate Gu of Wujiang, in order to prevent the remnants from fleeing, specially ordered his subordinates to strictly defend and suppress them.

### Jiangsu Province Collects Grain Tax in Kind Five Counties Have Begun Collecting Other Counties Are Waiting for the Late Rice to Ripen

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch] According to Hong Qichen, Deputy Director of the Provincial Grain Office, in a conversation with reporters on the 17th: Among the 39 counties and cities in Jiangsu that collect grain tax in kind, five counties have already started collecting, including Jiangdu, Taixian, Yizheng, Gaochun, and Liuhe. The results are generally good. Gaochun has collected more than 20,000 dan, and Liuhe has collected more than 10,000 dan. As for the other counties that have not yet started collecting, they have requested an extension of the start date because the late rice has not yet fully ripened. According to the current situation, collection can be fully started by November 1 at the latest. At the same time, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of collection in kind, the office has dispatched personnel to important cities and towns in southern Jiangsu, such as Suzhou, Changzhou, Danyang, Kunshan, and Songjiang, to supervise and guide the work, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### The People of Shandong Province Cannot Bear the Burden

Elders Request Postponement of Grain Tax Collection

[Xian County Dispatch] Since the victory, the people of Shandong Province have been burdened with extremely heavy taxes. Eight or nine out of ten areas in the province are in the hands of the Communist army. Many local guerrilla teams are concentrated near the county towns along the railway lines, totaling more than 300,000 people, including their families, no less than one million. These troops have no salaries and generally collect supplies locally. According to statistics, the supplies provided to Xian County in one year have exceeded the collection and borrowing in kind by more than thirteen times. The situation in Anqiu and other counties is even worse than in Xian County, and the conscription of laborers and firewood and the construction of projects are beyond the capacity of the people, and many have abandoned their land and fled. This autumn, eastern Shandong counties have been plagued by continuous rain, and the bean harvest is hopeless. Farmers want to use sweet potatoes to fill their hunger, but they cannot get them. The disaster is serious, so how can they bear to collect and borrow in kind again? Recently, the Ministry of Food has established an agency in Qingdao to handle the collection of grain tax in kind.

### Suzhou Plans to Try Wireless Telephones Zhou Zhenzhi's Research Yields Results

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch, 19th] Zhou Zhenzhi, a local resident, has been studying wireless telegraphy for a long time and has gained considerable experience. In the past, ultra-shortwave wireless telephones were extremely popular in the United States. If they could be installed in China, even remote areas without electricity could use them to establish close contact with large cities. He has been studying diligently, and recently he has made a more advanced invention than in the United States, that is, the current wireless telephone in the United States has a radius of only about 20 kilometers, while Zhou's research results can reach a radius of 50 kilometers, and he is still continuing to improve. When the Suzhou County Government heard about this, because the garrison was requesting the installation of telephones in various important villages and towns to facilitate military liaison, and after dispatching personnel to plan the line network, it was estimated that 320 million yuan would be needed, which was difficult to pay. On the 19th, they invited Zhou to talk. According to him, this ultra-shortwave wireless telephone has the same method as a wired telephone, but with special equipment, it can avoid setting up telephone lines. The common layout method is to set up a headquarters in the urban area and branch stations in various district offices, and two mobile stations are also set up. If there are a total of eleven stations needed, the cost of all labor and material installation will be about 40 million yuan. Its special features are (1) convenient installation, (3) the line is not easy to damage, (3) it can be set up in places where it is impossible to plant poles and set up lines, such as the isolated East and West Mountains of Taihu Lake, (4) there are mobile radio stations, which can be continuously in communication at any time, which is very beneficial for military affairs, (5) it can also communicate with city telephones, and (6) if there are confidential matters, codes can be used. The county government thought that this equipment was 90% cheaper than wired telephones, and it was quite willing to try it, but the matter was a pioneering initiative, and it was feared that it would cause a sensation, so it urgently telegraphed the provincial government for instructions.

### Suzhou Construction Committee Decides to Repair Streets

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] People from all walks of life in this county, in view of the fact that one year has passed since the local restoration, although post-war construction is a hundred things waiting to be done, but because of economic constraints, nothing has been started so far. At this time of hardship, the initiation of construction is probably not something that the simple power of the local government can handle alone. The power of the people of the whole county should be mobilized to go to construction together in order to achieve success together. Therefore, the organization of the Wuxian Construction Committee was established and announced a few days ago. On the afternoon of the 16th, the committee held its first meeting in the county government. More than a dozen representatives from political parties, legal entities, and other walks of life attended the meeting, and they immediately elected County Magistrate Jianhua and Lin Shenghua, Chairman of the Conference, to serve as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. The three groups of general affairs design and audit were also designated to be responsible by special personnel. Then, it was decided to repair Wannian Bridge and Jingde Road first. After the design group has drafted the engineering plan and the engineering cost budget, the construction will be started on a fixed date.

### Improvement of Telecommunications in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Divided into More Than Ten Districts to Establish Command Bureau

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch, 19th] Mr. Chen Tianzuo, director of the Telecommunications Bureau of this city, recently returned to Suzhou from Nanjing and met with the special correspondent of this newspaper stationed in Suzhou. He said: The Ministry of Transportation, in view of the fact that the development of telecommunications is of great importance to the connection and communication of national political, economic, and military affairs, although the cities and counties in the recovered areas have successively restored the establishment of telecommunications bureaus in the past year, the progress in business has not been as ideal as expected. The key is that the Capital Telecommunications Administration oversees the telecommunications bureaus across the country, and it is difficult to achieve uniform command and close supervision in practice. After consideration by the General Administration, it is planned to implement a system of hierarchical responsibility. The plan is to temporarily divide the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui into districts and establish command bureaus in more than ten places, including Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Yongjia, Anqing, and Xuzhou. After success is confirmed, it will be extended to major cities across the country and universally established. The plan has been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Transportation and will be implemented immediately. The Suzhou Command Bureau has jurisdiction over more than 30 bureaus, including Wujiang, Kunshan, Songjiang, Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, Haimen, and Chongming. The powers of each command bureau are the dispatch of machine affairs and engineering affairs, the supervision of telegraph and telephone business, and the supervision of personnel work, and the preparation of accounting budgets, so that any instructions for reform and innovation from the General Administration can be quickly followed by all cadres without delay. Chen also told reporters that this plan is an unprecedented improvement in the history of Chinese telecommunications and may become a watershed moment in the development of the telecommunications industry in the future.

### Cannot Practice Without Gas

This semester, the St. John's University Science Laboratory has moved from the old science building to the new science building on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. Because the new building has not been used for many years and was once occupied by the Japanese army, all the equipment has been damaged. The gas installation for experiments is of course also unusable. After the school repaired it during the summer vacation, it is now only waiting for the gas company to come to the school to install it. Although the school has repeatedly negotiated with the company authorities, there is still no progress. I don't know why? More than three hundred of us chemistry students have been in school for more than a month and have not yet officially started doing practical exercises, which has led to a waste of our studies. We are very anxious! Mr. Cheng, the head of the department, has been running around for this matter, but there is still no solution. We hope that the gas company authorities, for the sake of our studies and the urgent need for talents for national construction, will quickly solve our gas problem. (A St. John's University Chemistry Student)

### Please Move the Guangqi Road Farmers Market

Guangqi Road in Nanshi connects to Fangbang Middle Road in the north and is now very lively. Fuxing East Road to the south is quite quiet. The original regulations for this farmers market stipulated that it should start from the northern end of Guangqi Road. Today, after a long time, various stalls have gradually encroached on Fangbang Road (an area where the police station prohibits setting up stalls). Not only does it affect the appearance, but it also obstructs traffic. Here is a suggestion: please move this farmers market to Fuxing East Road, or please start from the Huajin Road section of Guangqi Road to the south. This would be a permanent solution and eliminate the need for police to constantly disperse them. This is a simple and beneficial matter, and we hope that the relevant authorities will adopt and implement it. (Gaotang)

### Refugees Please Reissue Flour

We, the people of Northern Jiangsu, cannot withstand the brutal oppression of the Communist bandits and have had to flee to the Jiangnan area as refugees without clothing or food. Our relief authorities, seeing this, have provided universal relief. We, the refugees of Northern Jiangsu, are very grateful for this. However, because the refugees have no means of livelihood and are constantly on the move, many of them are unable to receive the flour that is distributed in each phase. The refugees are crying out for food and hope that the relief authorities will understand our difficulties and kindly reissue the flour, so that the refugees who have not been able to receive flour will be endlessly grateful. (Bao Zuolin)

### America Willing to Seek Friendship with All Nations - Key to Peace Lies with the Soviet Union - Byrnes Explains American Foreign Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] After returning home, Secretary of State Byrnes gave his first radio address last night, discussing the progress of the peace conference, US-Soviet relations, and the establishment of future peace. He stated: The American people are willing to extend a hand of friendship to the people of the Soviet Union and other countries who are tired of war. The slow progress of peace creates the impression that armed conflict is inevitable. The inability of Soviet leaders to dispel this impression is the root cause of our disagreement. The so-called American encirclement of the Soviet Union is a figment of imagination. We can know from Marshal Stalin's own statement that the Soviet Union does not find itself in a dangerous encirclement. Promoting understanding and sympathy between the US and the Soviet Union is a difficult task for politicians. The United States opposes the idea that one country must completely submit to all the demands of another. At the same time, the United States will continue to oppose the policy of forming individual alliances. I believe that if the idea that conflict is inevitable persists, there is no hope for the economic recovery of Europe. As for the Paris Peace Conference, most of the peace draft articles have not been decided, but this is not a cause for concern. What is concerning is the continued tension in Soviet-Soviet relations and its growth.

At this moment, the United States continues to seek friendship with the people of the Soviet Union and other countries based on justice and respect for the rights of others, but the fairness and respect of the rights of the United States itself must also be taken into account. The United States must participate in cooperation to establish a new world order, the purpose of which is not to support the status quo, but to maintain a just peace and freedom. Completing this task requires patience. We must steadily build a peace mechanism so that it is as solid as a rock.

### Wallace Criticizes

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace recently made a statement criticizing Secretary of State Byrnes's speech on American foreign policy today, saying that he "is more convinced that the United States will adopt a realistic foreign policy." Wallace continued, "Byrnes has made progress compared to when he gave the Stuttgart speech. I hope that he will continue to make progress in the future. I am convinced that the American Secretary of State will eventually realize that the American people need international justice, good neighborliness, and peace."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] Washington political figures are completely satisfied with Secretary of State Byrnes's radio address last night, believing that this is the clearest explanation of American foreign policy. If one can say, Secretary of State Byrnes has stated that the responsibility for peace now lies with the Soviet Union, because no one can doubt that American policy is a truly peaceful policy. At the same time, it must also be admitted that if the Soviet Union does not strive to resolve disputes with the United States, peace is impossible. The next international conference will be broader in scope, and at least it can open the door to resolving this dispute. When the four foreign ministers meet next time, the current world tension may be greatly eased. In fact, Byrnes's remarks should be regarded as the opinion of most of the American people and are fully endorsed by the cabinet. Byrnes's call for promoting friendship with the Soviet Union deserves attention. In short, the Secretary of State's call is by no means in vain.

### Yugoslavia Demands - Two Points of Treaty Amended

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 18th] Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Van Le Pete told this newspaper that if Yugoslavia wants to sign the peace treaty with Italy passed by the Paris Peace Conference, it must be amended on two points. That is (1) to increase the power of the people in the Trieste Free Zone to make appeals, and to restrict the powers of its administrative chief. (2) Re-surveying the border south of Trieste, that is, maintaining the existing boundary line without following the draft agreement. If the four foreign ministers pass the treaty in its current form at the New York meeting in the future, the Southern Kingdom will not be bound by it, and will still maintain its relationship with Italy based on the armistice agreement. However, if Italy admits its past crimes of aggression against the Southern Kingdom, the Southern Kingdom is also willing to negotiate directly with it.

### Southern Country Abuses American Citizens - United States Sends Note to Condemn

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The State Department today submitted a note to Yugoslavia expressing "disgust and condemnation" for the country's driving of 165 Americans into hard labor. It is said that the Tito government drove naturalized American citizens into concentration camps, abused them, and was extremely cruel. Some of them died because they could not bear the pain, and the survivors were hired by private individuals to work for a long time without pay. When asked about the number of deaths, a State Department official replied that two deaths have been confirmed, but according to outside knowledge, as many as ten have died. The American note also stated that the victims were deprived of their inherent rights and should be remedied quickly. Some of the slaves mentioned in the note are not considered American citizens by Yugoslavia. However, the State Department said that their applications for American citizenship have been approved. This matter seems to be worsening the US-Soviet relations, because according to official announcements, at least three of the people involved in the case have been transferred to the Soviet Union to be forced to work. Previously, Yugoslavia informed the United States that the detained people may be made to work in appropriate ways, denying the United States' so-called hard labor dispatch. The United States refuted it with a note.

### Soil Station English Daxia

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The soil ambassador to the UK told the press last night that the Tartar Strait is Turkish territory, and its defense should always be controlled by Turkey. Turkey has taken a very firm attitude on this matter and has not received any foreign support. Turkey feels strong and united, and cannot soften its stance on this matter. The control of the Tartar Strait is stipulated by the Mondru public. If the control is to be reformed to adapt to modern needs, an international conference should be convened to revise the treaty. Since the Potsdam Conference, Turkey believes that there is no need for relevant parties to hold individual discussions. Turkey's fundamental attitude is to maintain its independence and maintain friendship with the Soviet Union and Western countries. However, Turkey is a Mediterranean country and a Black Sea country. The Tartar Strait connects the two seas. Turkey does not want to see this strait jointly managed by others.

### Madam Windsor's Jewel Theft Case: Detectives Deployed Across Europe and America

[United Press London, 19th] The case of the Duchess of Windsor's stolen jewels, valued at $800,000, is currently being vigorously investigated by top detectives from Britain and France. Police authorities in North and South America, as well as diamond market centers in Europe, have been alerted to watch for any discovered stolen items. Among the stolen jewels is a 41.4-carat gold-set sapphire ring, with a gemstone as large as a pigeon egg. Another sapphire ring weighs 7.81 carats, and yet another ring weighs 58.2 carats.

[United Press London, 18th] Following the theft of a portion of the Duchess of Windsor's jewelry, police authorities have launched an active investigation. It is speculated that this case was the work of an international thief gang, hence the investigation is extensive, covering Europe and across the Atlantic. According to Windsor, the stolen jewels are worth approximately $880,000 U.S. dollars, and he is displeased by external overestimation.

### Jewish Riot in Jerusalem

### Göring's Poison Hidden in Navel

[French Press Agency, Nuremberg, 18th] Regarding the suicide of former German Air Minister Göring by poisoning before his execution, someone who witnessed the examination of Göring's body stated that the potassium cyanide Göring took was likely contained in a metal tube and secretly hidden in his navel. Göring had previously undergone abdominal surgery, and near his navel was a very deep cavity that could hold a metal tube, pencil-sized and up to 2-3 centimeters long. When experts examined Göring's body, they discovered ulceration around his navel, possibly caused by leakage from the tube, leading to skin inflammation. Although Dr. Pfoellockner, the German physician responsible for the health of the prisoners, frequently searched the convicts for poison, he apparently did not notice this peculiar feature of Göring's abdomen. It is generally believed that Göring hid the potassium cyanide before his capture, similar to what Himmler and Goebbels did. It has also been learned that the ropes used to hang the Nazi war criminals were burned along with the bodies, and any unused ropes were also destroyed by fire. The location of the cremation remains a closely guarded secret, it is only known that the four generals representing the Allied Control Council for Germany were present at the cremation to supervise.

### Egyptian Prime Minister in London, Treaty Revision Talks Underway, Special Precautions Taken in Cairo

[Reuters London, 18th] Foreign Secretary Bevin and Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha secretly exchanged views on the issue of revising the Anglo-Egyptian treaty for the first time inside the British Foreign Office. Prior to that, Prime Minister Attlee hosted a luncheon for Sidky Pasha at his residence, with guests including South African Prime Minister Smuts, British Defense Minister Alexander, Imperial Chief of Staff Montgomery, and Bevin. Although the luncheon was a social event, the participation of important imperial military strategists and politicians suggests the importance of Egypt in imperial defense. Currently, the main issues between Britain and Egypt are: (1) The deadline for the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, with the British recently suggesting three years. (2) The conditions for the activities of the Anglo-Egyptian Joint Defense Board: should they only be triggered when Egypt's neighboring countries are at war, or can they be triggered by just the threat of war? (3) Egypt's demand for the unification of Sudan, which Britain is not yet willing to unconditionally recognize.

[United Press, Cairo, 18th] British troops were ordered today to refrain from entering the city of Cairo, and the police have taken special precautions, especially in the vicinity of the El-Azhar mosque. In the past, every Friday, the Muslim Sabbath, thousands of people would attend noon prayers inside the mosque. Some observers believe that Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha's trip to England for negotiations is the reason for these precautions.

### The Yoshida Cabinet and Labor Unrest

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 15th] Since the outbreak of the National Railway Workers' strike, the labor camp under the leadership of the Communist Party, the All-Japan Industries Labor Unions Conference (General Council of All Industries Unions), and the government have been in complete opposition. The union recently issued a circular to all branches to launch the October Offensive, attempting to paralyze all production sectors with the weapon of joint struggle, namely a general strike, to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet. The development of this political strike movement has not only profoundly affected all industries but has also caused great anxiety in general social life. Recently, the government has planned to take a tough stance on the labor movement, suddenly announcing the implementation of the Labor Relations Adjustment Law on the 13th. The union believes this is a good opportunity to launch a joint struggle, proposing: (1) Absolute opposition to layoffs, (2) Achieving full employment, (3) Establishing a minimum wage based on living expenses, (4) Abolishing the 500-yen limit, (5) Implementing an eight-hour workday, (6) Revoking the Labor Relations Adjustment Law, (7) Establishing strike targets, (8) Establishing unemployment insurance and social insurance laws, (9) Opposing violence and government disruption of strikes, (10) Abolishing discrimination against women, (11) Reviving production with the people's hands, (12) Opposing oppressive taxes on farmers, (13) Overthrowing the Yoshida Cabinet. It is clear that the main goals of this October Offensive are: (1) Overthrowing the Yoshida Cabinet, (2) Establishing a democratic people's government. Currently, the workers who have decided to participate in the strike include coal miners, electricity workers, film workers, theater workers, postal and telecommunications workers, machinery workers, vehicle workers, doctors, teachers, and national railway workers, among whom the movements of the coal miners are the most crucial. All Hokkaido coal miners have already joined the strike, and a part of the Joban coal mine has also joined. Coal is the driving force of Japanese industry, and once the strike expands, coal production will inevitably decrease, which would be a major blow to the Japanese economy. The coal production plan for this month is 1.85 million tons. If the coal miners strike, the amount of coal allocated to various industries in mid-October will be reduced by half; in other words, the driving force of Japanese industry will be halved as a result. Once a general strike by workers in various industries is realized, the number of participants will reach 800,000. However, whether the October Offensive called for by the union will succeed is still in question, because (1) the positions of the various branches are not consistent, and it is questionable whether some branches will participate. For example, the workers in life insurance, port operations, Allied forces labor, lumber, and civil engineering have all had their wages improved considerably. (2) The opinions among the unions are not yet consistent, such as the Kyushu coal miners branch and the Shochiku film branch. (3) The Labor Adjustment Law has already been implemented. Industrial workers restricted by this law, namely workers in industries related to the public interest, cannot strike arbitrarily, including electricity, coal, news, chemical, and fertilizer workers. Prime Minister Yoshida met with newspaper reporters in Osaka yesterday, stating that he would crack down on labor unrest in accordance with the Labor Adjustment Law. In the general meeting of the House of Representatives on the 11th, he said that political strikes were actions that exceeded the scope of the labor movement. At the same time, the General Federation of Labor under the leadership of the Socialist Party, reversing its past passive attitude, convened a central standing committee on the 12th, deciding to oppose political strikes, believing that this move would alienate labor unions from the people and promote the rise of reactionary forces; and declaring that if the Yoshida Cabinet continues to adopt an industrial economic and labor policy that supports capitalists, it will be overthrown. The press in this area expresses great concern about the current labor disputes. The Asahi Shimbun stated in an editorial on the 12th that the headquarters of the industries unions should adopt a cautious attitude towards the general strike; the Yomiuri Shimbun, which is the most vehemently anti-communist, stated in an editorial on the 10th that the actions of the industries unions conference are no different from challenging the people and are enemies of society. This October Offensive is an important test period for the Yoshida Cabinet, but the continuation of the Yoshida Cabinet depends on many external factors. After the closing of the Diet, Yoshida met with reporters on the 12th, indicating that he would continue to govern and hoped that the Liberal and Progressive parties would merge, while Washington transmitted the news of an early convening of a peace conference with Japan. The internal and external situation suggests that the October Offensive called for by the Communist Party is not enough to inflict a fatal blow on the Yoshida Cabinet. Furthermore, it has been reported that the Japanese government awarded medals to the Japanese police officers injured in the 渋谷 incident. According to the Japanese Economic Shimbun of the 14th, Patrolman Yoshihiro Kawakami of the Meguro Police Station in Tokyo, while performing police duties with Chief Haga, who died in the attack on the 渋谷 Police Station on July 19, was shot in the chest but did not yield, and ultimately established outstanding merit. He was awarded the Police Merit Medal and a special medal on the 15th. It was generally believed that the patrolman would not recover, but he has now recovered completely, which is truly a miracle.

### Eleven Members of the Visiting Taiwan Journalist Group Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, The Governor-General's Office Held a Press Conference Before Their Departure, Explaining the Current Administrative Measures in Taiwan Province

A group of 22 journalists from Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Kunming flew to Taiwan from Shanghai on the 12th. After inspecting various parts of Taiwan, the visit has been completed. A portion of the members, eleven in number, returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:30 pm led by Xu Xiaoyan, the Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department and the leader of the visiting group. The remaining members will stay for another three days to gather more material from the general public and are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 22nd. The day before the journalist group returned to Shanghai, Chen Yi, the Chief Executive of Taiwan Province, and Jian Jingheng, the Secretary-General, invited the journalist group to hold a press conference at Caoshan Guest House. The heads of various departments of the Chief Executive's Office were also present. The journalists raised questions about the lack of understanding among people in mainland China regarding Taiwan Province, the current systems in Taiwan Province that caused dissatisfaction, and the issues of not allowing the four major banks to establish branches in Taiwan and issuing Taiwanese currency. Chen and the heads of the relevant departments answered these questions separately.

### Taiwan's Financial Issues, Before Domestic Currency System and Prices are Stable, Issuing Taiwan Currency is Considered a Good Method

According to Chen, the issuance of Taiwan currency was in accordance with central government policy. When Japan surrendered, the financial situation in Taiwan was quite stable. There were no branches of Japanese banks such as the Yokohama Specie Bank in Taiwan. Everything was centered around the Bank of Taiwan. To stabilize the financial situation in Taiwan Province, the government decided to temporarily maintain the status quo of the Bank of Taiwan and the Taiwan currency it issued. After the takeover was completed, new Taiwan currency would be issued, and it was decided that the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China would not establish branches in Taiwan for the time being. This was to wait until the central government had decided on a new currency system before establishing branches, so that Taiwan's financial system could maintain its old state and not be affected by the domestic financial chaos. The powers of the four banks would be exercised by the Bank of Taiwan on behalf. The interest rate on loans from the Bank of Taiwan was 3.6%, with a maximum of 6.6%. If other banks came to Taiwan to compete for deposits with high interest rates, and then used these deposits to operate in Shanghai, lending them out at interest rates as high as one dime or more, it would inevitably cause chaos in Taiwan's financial system. Currency is a matter of vital concern to the people. When this policy was implemented, not only did the mainland not understand, but even the people of Taiwan did not understand, especially the public officials and soldiers who came to Taiwan from the mainland. However, now it is known that it was fortunate that this policy was implemented, which was able to maintain the value of all the property of the people of Taiwan, and the consequences of low interest rates, low prices, and financial stability. This policy has been recognized as the best method in Taiwan Province. Before the central currency system and prices are stable, Taiwan currency must still be used temporarily to adapt to the needs of the environment. If the environment no longer requires it in the future, the national currency can be used at any time. The Bank of Taiwan has already been transformed into a bank with private capital. Its directors and supervisors are all appointed by the central government, and the issuance of Taiwan currency is also completely subject to the supervision of the central government.

### Powers of the Governor-General's Office

Regarding the powers of the Governor-General's Office, rumors that its powers were higher than those of the Japanese Governor-General's Office era are not accurate. Currently, the judicial, diplomatic, postal and telecommunications, and financial affairs of Taiwan Province are all handled by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Finance, respectively. Aviation is managed by the Air Force Headquarters. Some important enterprises have either been directly operated by the central government or jointly operated by the central government and the province. All of these are in accordance with the instructions of the central government and are in line with the overall national policy. The situation is very different from the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan during the Japanese occupation, which ruled over everything. However, due to the inconvenient transportation between Taiwan Province and the mainland, President Chiang Kai-shek granted the Governor-General's Office greater powers and can command all central government agencies in Taiwan. In addition, I also serve as the Commander of the Garrison Headquarters. Furthermore, because of the different names of the Governor-General's Office and the Provincial Government, it has been criticized by the outside world. Chen also said earnestly that the central government must give the provinces considerable powers and cannot be too strict, otherwise the provincial government will not be able to handle affairs. When he was in charge of Fujian Province, he and the chairmen of various provinces jointly requested the central government to grant the provincial governments the same powers as the current Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, but it was not approved by the Executive Yuan. Chen further stated that all of Taiwan's resources are in the mountains. Similar mountains are also found in Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces, and they have various conditions that are even better than those in Taiwan, but we cannot develop them. We feel that Taiwan is good after being operated by the Japanese, but if we follow the current organization law of the provincial government, it will definitely not be built well, and the supervisors can only be officials and cannot do things. Secondly, the province is too strict with the counties, so the province will also release as much as possible the governing power and funds of the province to the counties, implement the county autonomy implementation law that President Sun Yat-sen advocated most vigorously, so that all public officials and six million people in the province can do their best to develop their strength and further construction work.

### Monopoly is Not Control

Everyone says that Taiwan Province has a controlled economy and cannot understand the establishment of the Monopoly Bureau and the Trade Bureau, as well as the currency policy. In fact, Taiwan Province is the best place for our country to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. The benefits that can be obtained from public operation are distributed to the people. After Taiwan Province was recovered, 50% of the financial revenue came from monopoly income, so the people's taxes were very light. Most of the revenue in the province's budget also depends on monopoly and trade. This year's budget is 270 million yuan (Taiwan currency), but it is expected to exceed this number. If there is 500 million yuan in revenue, the excess amount can be used for construction. Furthermore, if this money is earned by businessmen, it will only increase personal luxury and then use this money for speculation and exploitation of the people, while the government will inevitably increase taxes and burden the people. Chen also guarantees that there is no official capital in the trade and factories operated in Taiwan Province. It is entirely national capital to reward the implementation of President Sun Yat-sen's national capital policy to develop industry. At the same time, the land policy is implemented to ensure that tillers have their own land. After the takeover, public land in Taiwan Province accounts for 70% of the province's area. Currently, all public land taken over by various agencies, except for those that must be retained for their own business, are all temporarily leased by the county and city governments to the original tenants or farm laborers to continue cultivation, so as to avoid the interruption of production. It is also planned to establish public land distribution promotion associations in various counties and cities this year to assist in reviewing and distributing the land. It is planned to complete the distribution work in three phases in July 1947. Chen also repeatedly and earnestly stated that national capital must be developed in Taiwan, and the public morality and integrity of service personnel must be cultivated, and they must be guaranteed in their living environment so that they can work with peace of mind, strengthen their organizational power, and develop industry, so that China's economy can be stabilized. Otherwise, the result will be that our country will become slaves to foreign goods.

### Civil Affairs Situation

Zhou Yiyi, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, answered the questions about the civil affairs situation in Taiwan Province, saying that the city and county councils in Taiwan Province were established one after another before March 16. The provincial councilors were produced on April 15, and the first meeting was held on May 1. The people of Taiwan Province are enthusiastic and frank, but because they have been separated from the mainland for 50 years, they have many gaps in their understanding of the culture and laws of the motherland. However, each meeting has been more on track than the previous one. In the past, Taiwan Province held reserve personnel for unemployed people. There were more than 5,000 registered educational, technical, and civil servants. Recently, a general registration was held, and more than 10,000 people have reported. They have been notified to the various agencies to be included in the reserve list, and they will be assigned to work after passing the examination and short-term training. A portion of them have already replaced the work of repatriated Japanese residents. The number of unemployed women is not very large. However, there is also a distorted phenomenon in Taiwan Province. On the one hand, people are calling for unemployment, and on the other hand, factories that have resumed work cannot find workers. The overseas Taiwanese do not want to work and hope to become civil servants, but their knowledge is not suitable for being civil servants.

### Current Financial Status

Yan Jiagan, the director of the Finance Department, answered various financial questions, saying that the amount of Taiwan currency issued in October 1945, when the takeover took place, was 2,897,837,519.50 yuan. At the end of September 1946, the amount of currency issued was 4,030,922,360.50 yuan, an increase of 1,133 million yuan compared to the time of the takeover. The Bank of Taiwan has lent 2 billion yuan to the production sector, with sugar loans accounting for 1.5 billion yuan. If loans were not held, the amount of currency issued would not have increased so much. Since the takeover, the price ratio has risen from 100% to 450%. The deadline for exchanging old Taiwan currency for new Taiwan currency will be at the end of this month at the latest. Recently, the Bank of Taiwan also plans to provide 6 billion yuan in sugar loans at low interest rates to increase production. Among the state-owned companies in Taiwan Province taken over by the Resources Commission, there are three companies, including the aluminum factory. Among the state-province joint-venture companies, there are seven companies, including sugar, cement, and mechanical shipbuilding. There are 18 province-run factories, including 13 industrial and mining factories, 5 agricultural and forestry factories, and 1 health factory. In addition to these 28 companies, there are more than 400 factories that are planned to be sold. The first batch of 23 factories has been publicly announced for sale, and the second batch of 30 factories will also be sold. After the organization of the ten province-run companies is on track, a portion of the shares will be sold on the market, so that the ownership of capital belongs to private individuals, while the right to use capital is controlled by the state, so that private capital and state enterprise funds can be coordinated.

### Opinions of Provincial Councilors, Hoping that the Governor-General's Office Will Be Changed to the Provincial Government, Eagerly Awaiting Domestic Peace and Implementation of Constitutional Government

Two hours before the journalist group flew away from Taipei, they were invited by the Provincial Council to hold a symposium at Zhongshan Hall. Huang Chaoqin, the speaker of the Provincial Council, and the councilors reported and answered the general situation of the people of Taiwan. The main points are as follows: (1) The Provincial Council insists that the province will not use the national currency in the next four to five years before the domestic currency system is stable. The people of Taiwan are willing to fully support the policy of using Taiwan currency in the Governor-General's Office. (2) During the most difficult period after the war, Japan levied indirect taxes in Taiwan. The Governor-General's Office still continues to levy these taxes without withdrawing them, which is regrettable. (3) The people of Taiwan unanimously hope that the Governor-General's Office will be changed to the Provincial Government immediately, the Governor will be changed to the Chairman, and local autonomy will be implemented as soon as possible. (4) Eagerly await domestic peace and the implementation of constitutional government. (5) Farmers' lives have been stabilized after the recovery because they are no longer oppressed and requisitioned by the Japanese consortiums. Their only current request is to ask for fertilizer relief. The price of rice is now 20 times higher than before the recovery, and the price of other commodities is even higher. There are 3 million farmers in Taiwan, and the taxes they pay are also 33 times higher than before the recovery. It is hoped that the taxes will be reduced. (5) Those who come to Taiwan for tourism think that Taiwan is good and that Taiwan's finances are more stable than those in the mainland, but in the eyes of the Taiwanese, it is worse than during the Japanese occupation and the economy is more painful. The reason is inflation and high prices. (6) Industry should be nationalized and not bureaucratized, otherwise production cannot be developed. It is hoped that a portion of the sugar will be given to private operation. (7) The unemployment problem is extremely serious. There are 200,000 Taiwanese who were conscripted by the Japanese to Nanyang and returned to Taiwan, together with the unemployed people in Taiwan Province, there are a total of 300,000 people. The middle and upper-level personnel who are accommodated by various agencies are mostly from other provinces, while the lower-level personnel are mostly from Taiwan Province, so the general Taiwanese are not interested in work.

### Restore Bombed Factories, Hold New Emerging Businesses, Encourage Sugarcane Farmers to Cultivate and Seek to Restore Pre-War Production

The situation of industry and mining in Taiwan is fundamentally different from that in the Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan areas. Last year, when the Japanese were about to surrender, most of the industry and mining had been shut down by bombing. Over the past year, we have done our best to obtain the materials, financial resources, and manpower, and most of them have now been restored. For example, the electricity is twice that of the time of the takeover, and the coal production is six times that of the time of the takeover. It can be seen from these two points that the general increase in production. In short, our main work in the past year has been to restore the bombed factories, especially to focus on basic industries such as electricity, coal, sugar, fertilizer, cement, electrolysis industry, and paper. In the future, in addition to continuing to do the above-mentioned restoration work, we also plan to hold new businesses, such as new fertilizer factories, glass plate factories, and flax spinning. The industry and mining in Taiwan used to be matched with what Japan needed and with the needs of wartime. In the future, they should be matched with what China needs and with the needs of China's revival. According to our plans in various departments, five years later, Taiwan can become one of the most powerful provinces in China's economy. Regarding rice grains for agricultural affairs, the output in the first phase of this year was 4,737,112 hectoliters. The main countermeasures of this office to restore pre-war production are: (1) Constructing water conservancy. As of the end of July this year, all 47 destroyed water conservancy projects in the province have been repaired. In addition, the Tsengwen Reservoir, Kaohsiung, Samsung, and Yuanlin water conservancy projects are being rushed to repair. (2) Distributing fertilizer. In the past year, more than 13 million kilograms of fertilizer purchased from domestic and foreign sources have been distributed to farmers. Recently, a chemical fertilizer of 200,000 tons has been purchased from the Executive Yuan. At the same time, fertilizer factories are being set up in the province to seek self-sufficiency. Sugarcane, in June, this office held a sugarcane business discussion meeting and stipulated: (1) The sugarcane planting target for 1947 is 91,425 hectares. (2) Implementing the sugar distribution method of 52% for the company and 48% for the farmers to encourage sugarcane farmers to cultivate. A loan of 90 million yuan has been approved to seek to restore pre-war production for outward promotion.

### Methods of Compiling the Living Index

The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Held Its First Lecture, with Representatives from the Municipal Government Attending to Explain

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held its first lecture at its headquarters, inviting the person in charge of the Municipal Government's Statistics Department to explain the compilation process of the workers' living index. Attendees included Zhou Shishu, a representative from the Municipal Government, Zhao Banfu, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhou Ze from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and 251 units from various trade unions. Zhou Shishu, the representative from the Municipal Government, reported on the methods used to compile the workers' living index, dividing them into three parts:

(1) Compilation Method: The currently published monthly workers' cost of living index is based on the "Household Survey" of 1942, with 1936 as the base period. The so-called "Household Survey" investigates the general living conditions of a certain class in order to determine the consumption level of various goods, which serves as the consumption quantity within the index. The method starts with bookkeeping and then proceeds to analysis. The analysis method involves adding up the consumption of the same goods by each household to find the average consumption per household, and the consumption quantity determines the types of goods that should be included in the index. Only the most commonly used items with the highest consumption quantities are selected, with several varieties chosen for each type. Currently, the index includes 54 selected items. Food category: including rice (Wu and), corn, flour (domestic Tong flour), noodles, soybeans (medium-sized), fresh pork (ribs), fresh beef (water buffalo sirloin), salted pork (ribs), fresh fish, salted fish, vegetables, spinach, chives, sweet potatoes, white radish, pickled mustard greens, soybean sprouts, sprouted beans, tofu, dried tofu, bean curd sheets, fermented bean curd, soybean oil, soy sauce, salt, white sugar, tea, sorghum, etc. Housing category: including housing, boiled water, electricity, matches, coal briquettes, firewood, etc. Clothing category: fine cloth, coarse cloth, striped cloth, flower-label cloth, bleached cloth, Indanthrene blue cloth, twill cloth, velvet, woolen cloth, cotton, socks, etc. Miscellaneous items: including streetcars, cigarettes, soap, toilet paper, haircuts.

(2) Price Investigation Method: The price of goods in this city is very chaotic, with different prices for the same item. Therefore, the investigation methods, areas, and deadlines are strictly regulated. The surveyed stores are allocated based on the distribution of workers. Currently, the surveyed areas are: East District (Hongkou area), South District (Dapuqiao area), and West District (Caojiadu Dazimingzhong area). The investigation period is set as once a week on Wednesdays, with staff dispatched to the designated stores to fill out the investigation form.

(3) Calculation Method: First, let's discuss the price averaging method. The price of each item used in the index is the average price of all stores each week, and then the arithmetic average of each period is taken as the monthly average price. As for the calculation method of the index, it is calculated according to the following formula: Recently, various sectors have had doubts about the index. This is because the numbers used to compile the living index are calculated using the monthly average price. When prices rise, the index cannot keep up with the speed of price increases because the monthly average price is different from the daily price fluctuations. The recent stability of rice prices is also a major reason why the index has not risen significantly. As for the 54 items in the index, their content may differ significantly from what a family of five encounters in their daily lives. Therefore, there have been considerations to revise the content of the index, but another "Household Survey" is required.

Finally, Zhang Zhusan suggested forming a living index research committee, and Zhang Zhusan, Hu, Zhou Zhongqing, Lin Chunting, Zhu Junxin, Zhu Weichang, Dong Renliang, Guo Xing, Wan Guangzhang, Gao Guoliang, Huang Yuexiang, Song Peiyao, Zhang Jindi, Yao Zhuoren, Feng Gangyin, and fifteen others were elected as members. It was also resolved that: (1) Soybeans and wheat bran should be removed from the food category, and the quality of non-glutinous rice should be improved. (2) The authorities are urged to conduct a new household survey, using the living standards of 1929 as the standard before the survey. (3) Child education and medical expenses should be added to the index as miscellaneous expenses. (4) The index should be published twice a month. (5) The index should be raised. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

[This Newspaper] At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out on the second floor of Mingshui Chang Wood Shop at 536-538 Sichuan Road.

### Drunk Man Wields Knife and Injures People: Returns from Prison to Find Wife Gone; Money Cannot Fill the Sea of Hatred

A local woman, Yang Ying, married Yang Shijun as her wife, and the couple had a very good relationship. Unfortunately, four years ago, Yang Shijun was detained by the court on suspicion of kidnapping and sentenced to imprisonment for four years and six months.

Two years ago, through the introduction of her elder sister, she became acquainted with Wu Pande (42 years old), a Sichuan native. The two lived together at 88 Hengmao Lane, Xizang South Road. Unexpectedly, Yang Shijun was released from prison this summer and learned that his wife had remarried. He immediately went to negotiate. Wu asked someone to reconcile with Yang and paid Yang Shijun 3.5 million yuan three times as compensation for giving up his wife. At around 10:00 PM the night before last, Yang Shijun went to a hotel alone to drink and got very drunk. Thinking of his wife being taken by someone else, he was very angry.

Then, he found a kitchen knife in the kitchen and started slashing at people. As a result, Wu Pande's shoulder was slashed, and a Xu surnamed person who lived with them and tried to persuade him had his left finger chopped off.

[This Newspaper] On the evening of the 2nd, four robbers went to Tu Yongtai Western Clothing Shop at 80 Chongqing South Road under the pretext of ordering Western clothing. They used weapons to rob over 40 bolts of woolen fabrics and fled without a trace. On the 5th, Chen Lansheng, a police officer from the Lu Family Station Police Station, received a tip-off that the robbers in this case were hiding at 165 and 186, Lane 313, Shunchang Road.

### Three Police Officers Praised for Integrity

[This Newspaper] In the past year, Shanghai's administrative facilities have been limited by manpower and material resources, and although there are still areas that are not completely satisfactory, the reform of the police force's atmosphere has been evident in fact. For example, recently, police officers Liang Fenggang and Gan Jiasi of the Laozha Branch Bureau captured a violator named Gui Tong on Ningbo Road on the morning of the 14th. Cao had attempted to bribe 200,000 yuan in the hope of being released. The police officers not only refused to accept it but also believed that it would tarnish the police's integrity and brought the bribe money to the bureau for handling together. Also, on the afternoon of the 18th, police officer Gao Yongfu was cracking down on illegal vehicles on Guangdong Road, and a pedicab driver named Guo Chengyu offered a bribe of 15,000 yuan, which was also refused by the officer.

### Important Notes on Declaring Rent for Rent Survey

[This Newspaper] The deadline for the Municipal Finance Bureau's rent survey is approaching soon. To facilitate citizens, the bureau will still process registration procedures for those who send their rent declaration forms after the deadline.

Also, the rental situation in this city is extremely complex. After considering the actual situation, the bureau has stipulated the following important notes for filling out rent declaration forms:

(1) The purpose of this rent survey is to allocate the amount of house tax and municipal construction tax separately so that the burden between the landlord and the tenant is clear. If the rent declaration is not detailed or is not submitted, making it impossible to allocate, the bureau will issue a payment notice listing only the total amount of the two taxes without listing them separately. After the supplementary declaration is submitted, a notice will be issued again. Alternatively, after the residents pay, they will allocate it themselves according to the rent paid. (2) If the rent is undecided due to housing rental disputes, the reason can be noted after the rent item on the declaration form. (3) For houses subleased by a sub-landlord who does not live in the house, the amount of rent paid to the sub-landlord can be filled in, and an additional note can be added at the end of the form. (4) If the rental situation of the house varies in different months, a note can be added month by month after the rent item. (5) When mailing the declaration form, seal it according to the regulations and affix sufficient postage.

### Ninety-Eight Cases of Artificial Pearls: A Russian Involved in the New Light Theater Case Allegedly Purchased Enemy Property

[Reported by This Newspaper] Following the arrest of Russian fur trader Isaii Vitesson in connection with the hand grenade case at the New Light Theater, authorities discovered that after the surrender of Japan, he purchased ninety-eight cases of loose artificial pearls from the Showa Trading Company at an extremely low price. This is a criminal act, as the artificial pearls were originally enemy property and should have been taken over by the Chinese government.

Vitesson’s accomplice, Birbrier, left Shanghai for Mexico shortly after the end of the war. It is also understood that some of the pearls have been shipped to other locations. The transaction took place in room 241C of the Grosvenor Apartments, which was Birbrier's residence. The transaction was facilitated by Captain Kuroki, a Japanese liaison officer of the Russian Emigrant Association. The case is currently under further investigation.

### Xu Jianping Sentenced to Five Years; Liu Quan to be Sentenced on the 26th

[Reported by This Newspaper] Xu Jianping, who successively held positions such as Chief of the Investigation Department of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, General Manager of the Puppet Central Trust Corporation, and Director of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Ministry of Finance, was yesterday sentenced by the High Court to five years in prison, with deprivation of civil rights for five years. All of his property will be confiscated, except for a portion set aside for the necessary living expenses of his family. Xu is currently 56 years old, a native of Jiaxing, Zhejiang. He graduated from Tsinghua University and later studied at the University of Michigan in the United States. After returning to China, he briefly headed the editorial department of the Continental Daily before collaborating with the Japanese after the Pacific War.

Liu Quan, who served as the Director of the Puppet Hankou Consolidated Tax Bureau and the Salt Administration Bureau, was notorious for his extortionate taxes and oppression of the people. After the victory, he was exposed and arrested. The High Court concluded his case yesterday, and the sentence is scheduled to be announced on the 26th of this month. Additionally, Russian citizen Mr. Voltolehoff, accused of working as an intelligence officer for the enemy's radio station on Jing'an Temple Road in this city, concluded his defense yesterday, and his sentence is also scheduled to be announced on the 26th.

### New Company to Take Over the Tangqiao-Datuan Highway

[Reported by This Newspaper] The highway from Tangqiao in Pudong to Yaojia in the Puhui County area was originally contracted by the Pudong Long-Distance Bus Company with the municipal government in November of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) for an advance payment road construction franchise agreement, stipulating a term of 30 years from the date of formal opening of the entire road upon completion of the project. After the victory, the majority of shareholders of the company re-pooled their shares in July of this year to organize the Pudong Local Construction Company and establish a new contract. The original Pudong Long-Distance Bus Company voluntarily terminated the old contract. It is reported that the Public Utilities Bureau has approved this. The route runs from Tangqiao, passing through Zhoupu, Nanhui, and Haichao Temple, reaching Datuan as the final point (near the border of Fengxian County), with a total length of 54 kilometers. The opening of this road is very beneficial to the development of Pudong.  [Reported by This Newspaper] In mid-July, this newspaper published a feature article titled "The Pig Meat Chapter," introducing the history of the pig. The article concluded: "National affairs are complicated, and the clouds of war are unpredictable. If a war breaks out, and the source of pigs is cut off, will it cause a meat shortage?" Three months have passed since the article, and although the feared meat shortage has not yet become a reality, meat prices have indeed risen to the point where ordinary people feel a sense of "sighing at the sight of meat."

From the hands of farmers to the stomachs of consumers, pigs undergo many transfers in the process of becoming meat, so prices increase layer by layer. First, pig dealers purchase them from the place of origin and transport them to Shanghai, where they are concentrated in warehouses around Yunzaobang, Zhanghuabang, and Zhoujiaqiao. Then, they are entrusted to pig brokers for sale. The nature of pig brokers is the same as that of brokers, only responsible for introductions, selling the live pigs to butcher shops and collecting commissions, but some also provide loans to pig dealers. After purchasing the live pigs, butcher shops slaughter them at the slaughterhouse and wholesale whole pieces to retail meat vendors, and finally they are sold in the vegetable market.

Yesterday's market price was 2,650 yuan per jin (approximately 0.5 kg) for live pigs, and the wholesale price of fresh meat was 2,400 yuan per jin. The retail price in the vegetable market ranged from 3,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan per jin, depending on the fat content. The large difference between the wholesale and retail prices is because the wholesale price is based on whole pieces with skin and bones, and what the meat vendors lose on the skin and bones must be recovered in the meat price.

Rising meat prices, worry the common people! Conversely, meat merchants should be getting rich. However, talking with them casually reveals that they are also full of complaints. They say: Pigs cannot be hoarded and speculated like gauze and grain to cause market price increases. The reason for the shortage of supply is the real reason. Why is there a shortage of supply? First, because the situation in major producing areas such as northern Jiangsu is unstable, the production of pigs has been affected, and pig dealers are even more reluctant to go. Second, because transportation is difficult, and there are many checkpoints along the way, with difficulties and exactions, further increasing the cost of pig dealers. In addition, the depreciation of the currency and high interest rates, pig merchants seeking profit, they also have to pay labor and expenses, and rising meat prices seem inevitable. So, in a word, even humble things like pigs are closely related to military affairs and politics!

### Panda to be Dissected; New York Cables Request to Transport to America to Study Cause of Death

[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the disposal of the panda's remains after its death, the New York Zoological Society has sent a cable, instructing that the panda's body still be transported to the United States for dissection in order to study the cause of death and internal structure. However, Dr. Seeley, the medical officer sent by the Zoological Society to China to take care of it, believes that if it is transported to the United States, the journey will take too long, and the body may rot. Therefore, it has been decided to dissect it in Shanghai, which can be done within one or two days.

[Another Report] The general opinion of experts in this city is mostly in favor of making it into a specimen and sending it to the museum for the appreciation of the people. A telegram has been sent to the United States to discuss this.

### Sino-American Agricultural and Fisheries Group to Inspect Various Regions in Southern China

The Fisheries Group of the Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Technical Team, in order to revive China's post-war fisheries, is setting off to inspect various coastal areas, so as to refer to the actual situation and provide relief to fishermen. According to Director Tang of the Agricultural Bank of China, who is participating in the inspection, the work of the Fisheries Group in inspecting North China has been completed. After all personnel return to Shanghai, they will depart to inspect the coastal fish-producing areas in South China, as well as Taiwan and Hainan Island, possibly departing at the end of this month. Currently, China's 10 million fishermen have suffered heavy losses during the war, and it is impossible for them to recover on their own after the war. The United States has agreed to donate a large amount of materials for manufacturing fishing gear to our government, which will then be made into tools by the government and distributed to fishermen in various regions. As for the cost of making these fishing gear, it will be facilitated by loans from the China Agricultural Bank. The detailed measures are still under discussion.

### Soviet Bishop Suddenly Arrested; Rumored Cause is Religious Dispute; Soviet and White Russian Émigrés Have Been Accusing Each Other for a Long Time

[Reported by This Newspaper] Viktor, the bishop of the Greek Orthodox Church in this city and a Soviet citizen, was suddenly arrested yesterday by personnel dispatched by the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command. It is understood that the Garrison Command was acting on the orders of the Ministry of National Defense. The crime committed by Viktor has not yet been announced.

In this city, Soviet and White Russian émigrés are distinctly divided in religion. Viktor is the religious leader of the Soviet side, and he and Bishop John of the White Russian church have been fiercely attacking each other. The followers of both sides also often have disagreements and mutually accuse each other of cooperating with Japan and Germany during the war. The disputes have a long history.

Viktor's arrest has caused considerable agitation among the Soviet church members. They believe that the bishop's imprisonment is due to old grudges and the secret machinations of enemies.

### Emergency Illness Loans

About 9 Million Yuan Needed in Half a Month

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Citizens' Emergency Medical Loan Society on October 1, many people have directly and indirectly benefited. As of the 15th, a total of 20 people have applied for loans from the society, including 8 with acute appendicitis, 3 with falls and injuries, 4 with difficult labor and monstrous births, and 5 with other conditions such as intestinal, anal, throat, and throat abscesses. Three people have now been cured, two have died, and loans have been paid to five people, totaling 350,000 yuan, which has been audited by accountant Xu Yongzuo. The remaining 15 people are still in hospital for treatment because their condition is more serious and treatment takes time. It is estimated that the total amount of outstanding loans will be 8 to 9 million yuan. The society has received a donation of 1 million yuan from Mr. Xu Wei transferred by the Shen Bao Social Service Office and a donation of 600,000 yuan from colleagues of small newspapers in this city transferred by the Robin Hood newspaper.

### Our Responsible Authority Requests Allied Headquarters to Have Japanese Factories Provide Textile Machinery, Because All Existing Spindles in Japan Must Be Reserved for Their Own Use

[Reported by This Newspaper] The responsible authorities are negotiating with the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo to request the four major Japanese textile machinery manufacturers to rush to build textile machinery for us first, in order to help revive our light industry. It is understood that these four factories had extremely large production volumes before the war, and their OMB textile factories produced products of extremely high quality. During the Pacific War, they were converted into aircraft factories, but they have now been restored to civilian industries. Allied Headquarters has expressed its willingness to give sympathetic consideration to this request, but because Japan currently lacks coal and iron, it is requesting our country to supply these two raw materials. This matter is still under discussion and a decision is pending. Related sources said: Japan currently has 2.4 million spindles in operation, which is equivalent to our country. It is currently impossible to ask Japan to use the textile machinery already in operation as compensation, because General MacArthur's headquarters believes that this move will hinder Japan's trade and employment plans and cause social order to become chaotic.

### Uniform Allocation Plan for Yarn and Cloth, Meeting to be Held Tomorrow to Discuss; Applications for Southern Transport Deadline, Reviewing Begins

[Reported by This Newspaper] Since Mayor Wu also took the position of Chairman of the Textile Industry Management Committee, he has decided to convene a full committee meeting at 3 pm tomorrow in the city government meeting room. In addition to the attendance of all committee members, the heads of the industry associations of the 6th District machine textile industry, cotton cloth industry, dyeing and weaving industry, knitwear industry, towel blanket industry, handkerchief industry, and yarn business will also be invited to participate in the meeting. It is heard that Mayor Wu will listen to the opinions of all parties, and at the same time discuss the reasonable pricing of cotton yarn and cloth, and plan a uniform allocation and distribution plan.

In addition, the deadline for the Yarn Management Committee to handle the registration of manufacturers of yarn and cloth for Southern transport has passed yesterday. A total of 405 registered distributors and 265 manufacturers (including large factories such as SpinKee, Wing On, and Shen Hsin) were registered. The committee has now dispatched personnel to begin the review and inspect the documents of the manufacturers. Once the review is completed, the qualification review will begin. Qualified applicants will be issued registration cards separately, based on which they can apply. If the number of applications cannot be approved this month, the review will be extended to the next month.

### Government Bonds Stable

Government bonds were even more mediocre yesterday. The transaction was only more than 4 million yuan in face value. Tong Bing opened at 2,100 yuan in the morning, and there were slightly more bulls selling. From 2,100 yuan, the outside bid fell to below 1,950 yuan, before a large household on the seventh floor came to maintain it. In the end, it still hovered around 2,100 yuan. As a result, there was no change compared to the previous close, and Tong Bing fell slightly by 30 yuan.

### Timber Industry Asks for Payment for Timber Requisitioned During the War of Resistance

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Shanghai Timber Trade Association had a large amount of timber requisitioned by the military police during the Shanghai War in 1937. The police bureau requisitioned 16,090 round logs from the association. Ruichang Timber Company requisitioned 120 round logs and 100 pine boards. The 88th Division of the Army requisitioned 279,501 feet of foreign pine from Yuanlong Fuji Timber Company. All of the above requisitions have official receipts from the authorities; and at the time of requisition, they were all promised to be paid at the market price. Later, due to the westward shift of the war, payment was not made in time. The Timber Trade Association has requested compensation from the Joint Logistics Headquarters, but the Logistics Department replied that "the military police unit numbers were not stated separately, and the descriptions in the documents are not detailed enough. After nine years, the units have undergone repeated changes, making it impossible to verify, so it is difficult to handle." The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that there must be records available for the requisition of civilian materials by government unit troops and sent a telegram to the Logistics Department yesterday to argue on the basis of reason.

### Firewood Continues to Rise

The market for fuel coal, coal briquettes, and other goods has been calm this week, but the market price of firewood continues to rise again. The reason is that the sale of firewood was sluggish before, and few people handled the goods. Recently, due to the frequent rise in coal prices, more people are using firewood, resulting in supply falling short of demand, and market prices rising sharply. According to industry insiders, if the wind direction does not change in the future, then the arrival of goods in early next month of the lunar calendar will be prosperous, and market prices can be expected to fall.

### Merger of Yarn Factories, Production Has Not Increased Significantly

[Reported by This Newspaper] This reporter recently visited Tian Fuji, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, to inquire about the recent issuance situation. He said: The Central Bank's issuance matters are all carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Finance. The situation each month is not the same. However, the recent rumors that the Central Printing Factory issues 16 million yuan of banknotes per minute are unknown on what basis. He said: The Central Printing Factory is indeed an investment of the Central Bank, but recently four factories have been merged into one. After the business is concentrated, it may be busier than before, but there is absolutely no such a large amount of banknote production. Moreover, the printing machines and paper used by the factory have never been dependent on UNRRA.

### China Trust Allocates Rayon, The Silk Weaving Industry is Delighted, Each Factory Requests Allocation, Hoping China Trust Will Investigate Strictly

[Reported by This Newspaper] After the allocation of rayon, the silk weaving industry expressed satisfaction, because the allocation is made eight times a month, which is equivalent to installment payments, allowing manufacturers to avoid the exploitation of high interest rates. Responsible persons of the association hope that in the future, the China Trust Bureau can directly investigate the factories requesting the allocation of rayon, instead of having the industry association handle it on their behalf. Taking this survey as an example, the association used more than 20 people to survey more than 300 companies, and it is inevitable that it was not precise; if in the future, the China Trust Bureau can conduct strict investigations and handle it fairly, it would be most ideal. In addition, when the representatives of the industry petitioned in Beijing, they negotiated a loan of 33 billion, and the responsible authorities agreed in principle, but the Four Joint Offices put forward two conditions: (1) each member factory needs to go through the procedures separately; (2) the loan must be secured by raw materials and finished products. Because the Four Joint Offices' lending conditions are very strict, only four large factories have been approved for loans. Later, the association proposed another method of contribution, called the public treasury method. All members of the industry association can deliver their raw materials and finished products to the public treasury at a price and request short-term loans at low interest rates. This method has been supported by a tycoon in the financial community and a concrete decision can be expected soon.

### Stock Exchange Brokers Association Formally Established Yesterday, Elected Directors and Supervisors, Moved Three Motions to Promote Early Restoration of Convenient Transactions

[Report from this newspaper] The Stock Exchange Brokers Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday at 2 p.m. on the second floor of the Stock Exchange. In attendance were Stock Exchange Directors Yu Huan-cheng and Zhuang Shuhao, General Manager Wang Zhishen, Assistant Manager Yang Yinpu, Chief Secretary Hua Wenyu, Manager Chen Jison, Ministry of Finance-appointed Stock Exchange Supervisor Wang Aotang, and over 180 brokers. After the formalities, Chen Jingminzu was publicly recommended as the temporary chairman of the meeting. The chairman reported the number of attendees, Preparatory Committee member Yang Yuankai reported on the preparatory process, Ministry of Finance Supervisor Wang Aotang delivered a speech, and Wang Zhishen delivered a speech on behalf of Stock Exchange Director Du. The articles of association were then discussed, slightly modified, and all 50 articles were passed. Finally, directors and supervisors were elected. The results were as follows: Elected directors were Chen Jingmin, Yu Mingshi, Wu Limen, Yang Yuankai, Qiu Lianggui, Shi Jiuzai, Lin Zongjing, Hu Jingqiu, Zhu Dingyi, Yu Mingyue, Shen Guangyan, Su Peishao, Dong Huasun, Yuan Qiuchu, Cao Maode, Xu Zhenqing, Zheng Xuegao, Wu Guoying, Zhu Chuanhan, Yang Xiqing, Gong Likui, Jin Songgan, Lu Dehuan, Zhou Hanqing, and Mu Zhuangwu, totaling 25 people. Alternate directors were Wu Wenhui, Wu Shisen, Zhu Dajun, Wang Naixu, Zhu Kaiyi, Gong Maode, Hong Zecheng, Qiu Yulin, Hu Mingshen, Liu Wuzhai, and Liu Baisen, totaling 11 people. Supervisors were Yang Changhe, Wu Zhilian, Ruan Gongchun, Yu Zijiao, Han Jixiang, Wang Shidan, and Wang Yiying, totaling 7 people. Alternate supervisors were Wang Xindi, Wang Jiaosheng, and Zhang Danqiu, totaling 3 people.

Yesterday, the association made three temporary motions: (1) Requesting the directors and supervisors to actively proceed with restoring the customer intercom telephones. (2) Requesting the Stock Exchange to improve the settlement methods to ensure that shares are received on the same day after payment is made. (3) To restore the convenient transaction system of one week as soon as possible.

A certain person in charge from the Stock Exchange who went to Beijing to seek instructions has returned to Shanghai a few days ago. According to him, the second batch of seven listed securities and 34 brokers are currently being submitted to the Ministry for approval. As for the matter of "convenient transactions," the Stock Exchange does not have this term. However, the Stock Exchange did submit the difficulties provided by the brokers to the Ministry for approval in order to study a plan to facilitate the brokers' business. As for the crackdown on off-exchange trading, it is said to be the responsibility of the administrative authorities, and the Stock Exchange is only in a position to assist.

### Bullish Sentiment Wary, Chinese Stocks Sluggish

Chinese stocks yesterday experienced renewed financial panic. When the market opened, investor sentiment was low, and all stocks opened significantly lower. After the opening, there was a slight rebound from bargain hunting, but the market atmosphere was already weak. The bulls were like startled birds. Many overnight bulls sold off their positions. Soon, the decline resumed. However, at lower prices, Guangdong merchants and yarn/fabric merchants eagerly bought Yong Yarn. There were small rallies in the middle, but the price of 740 yuan could not be sustained. Under unfavorable circumstances, the bulls were unwilling to linger and gradually liquidated many positions. In addition, No. 88 and other financial firms sold off Yong Yarn, and no one maintained the price. The supply side was eager to sell, finally breaking the 730 yuan level. Near noon, short covering was still strong, but the remnants could not support the price. Yong Yarn presented a seesaw pattern. In Zhongfang, financial firms such as No. 207, No. 88, and No. 232 added a small amount of purchases, which was relatively peaceful. The same was true for Huafeng. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yong Yarn, Maya, Xinhe, and Qinxing each fell by 3-4%, and Jingfu and Xinguang each fell by half a percent. Among the cold stocks, Zhongfang, Datong, Rongfeng, Xinya Company, Liann, Wuhe, and Neiyi slightly declined, and Tongyi Firecrackers each fell by about half a percent. Cement, Huafeng, China Silk, and Jinglun were still stable. The total transaction volume was 7.72 million shares. The rise and fall of various stocks off-exchange were both muted.

Foreign stocks, except for Yeguang Paper, which rose slightly due to a squeeze, many others fell back. As a result, compared with the previous close, British United fell by slightly less than 10%, and Yi Yarn, Jardine Matheson, Yi Beer, and Shipping all fell slightly. Steel, Paper, and Yeguang all rose slightly.

### Japanese Rayon Production Has Recovered

[Report from this newspaper] Japanese returnees reported that the speed of recovery of Japanese industrial production is astonishing. Taking rayon as an example, since August this year, monthly production has reached 50,000 cases, which is 88% of pre-war production. The rayon supplied to our country can be fully delivered by the end of the year to 10,000 cases. According to reliable sources, in addition to the 4,800 cases that have already arrived, 2,000 cases are on the way, and 3,000 cases are packed and ready for shipment.

### Silk Trade Dull

Yesterday, the weekend silk market was quiet, and prices were uniformly weak. The asking price for 120 Heaven Bridge with Guanglao packaging remained unchanged and the same as the previous day. A dozen or two cases of miscellaneous brands were traded, with prices about 50,000 to 100,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Factory brokerage was also quiet. C-grade and Qianjing were not opened. D-grade and E-grade, and ordinary goods, generally shortened by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan. Silk goods also weakened, and bed covers fell by a small amount of 50,000 yuan. Huajin Crepe fell by another 100 yuan yesterday.

### Yarn Market Improves, Awaiting Special News

Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned prosperous. Because there was a saying that the joint distribution was temporarily suspended, it aroused the attention of all parties. The situation turned better as a result. Nianzhi Special Shuangma rose back to 2.35 million, a rise of 30,000. Other yarns also followed suit, rising by 20,000 to 30,000. Investor sentiment stabilized and seemed to be awaiting special news.

### Abundant Taiwan Sugar Stock

Taiwan Sugar Company has recently continued to ship large quantities of Taiwan sugar. The company's current sugar warehouses occupy one-third of all the warehouses of the China Merchants Bureau, totaling more than 600,000 bags. Currently, about 40,000 bags are distributed to various sugar industry members and retail stores each month. The person in charge of the company said that the sugar price in this city will definitely not rise again, and the number of applications from various buyers is also less than before.

### Chaozhou Brown Sugar Gradually Rises

Yesterday, there was not much fluctuation in the sugar market, but green sugar rose again due to the shortage of stock. Shantou merchants offered 123,500 yuan for Tiban Green, and 120,000 yuan for Huanggang Green, up 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Less than 100 packages were traded. Mian Chi had a sandy bottom due to the poor quality of the goods, and the price was 117,000 to 118,000 yuan. Song Chengjiao, Xinghua merchants offered 135,000 to 136,000 yuan for Gongfen White, and 127,000 to 128,000 yuan for Xing Chi, a total of more than 150 packages. Jianbang Diaoqing was held back and not sold because there were not many goods left.

### Gold Prices Gradually Improve, US Dollar Black Market Rises

Yesterday was Saturday. Investor sentiment was high because the Central Bank did not sell much gold, and there were more delusions. The market was extremely stable. It opened at 2.205 million in the morning. The low price was no more than 2.2 million. Because investor sentiment was improving, scattered buying came in, and the price gradually rose. However, it was very peaceful at first. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 2.205 million. After that, the money market eased, and scattered buying continued to be strong. The price gradually improved. Near noon, it rose to 2.227 million. At noon, it struggled between 2.22 million and 2.225 million. In the afternoon, the spot price continued to rise slightly to 2.23 million, an increase of 20,000 yuan from the previous day. Ornament gold rose to 2.36 million, fine silver fell to 3,200, and silver dollars rose slightly. The unofficial discount was uncertain, and the interest rate was still from 1.5 to 1.8 cents.

Foreign currencies were slightly stable. The US dollar retail market was still buying at 3,500 yuan and selling at 3,530 yuan, and no transactions were made. In the black market, it was between 4,050 yuan and 4,150 yuan, a slight increase from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars stopped falling and rose, from 880 yuan to 900 yuan, which was quite stable, resulting in a slight increase of 10 yuan from the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate also increased slightly, from 890 yuan to 900 yuan. The Indian exchange rate also slightly increased to 1,070 yuan to 1,090 yuan. The British exchange rate was 14,100 yuan to 14,300 yuan. There were not many transactions. The US exchange rate was unchanged, and paired transactions were still quiet.

### General Ge Jingzhong to Fly to Japan to Negotiate Sino-Japanese Cocoon Shipment to China

[Report from this newspaper] Confirmed information: Ge Jingzhong, general manager of China Silk Corporation, and Zou Jingheng, director of the technical department, will soon go to Japan to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters on the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China. It is said that the formalities for going abroad have been completely completed, and they are waiting for a flight to the east. Relevant personnel said that the negotiation on the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China has been going on for a long time. In February this year, China Silk Corporation requested the Allied Headquarters to supply 20 million pounds of Japanese cocoons. At that time, the Headquarters agreed to supply half of the amount, but this decision was overturned by Washington. Later, our country based on the statistics of wartime losses collected by the Executive Yuan, and General Zhu Shiming represented our country to argue reasonably, which led to the incident in September when MacArthur's textile advisor Magana attacked our country's administrative authorities and China Silk Corporation. Later, China Silk Corporation struggled again, and Magana issued a second document attacking our country, with even more fierce language. As a result, Ma was recalled to the country. Now there is a very high hope for the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China, but the quantity has not yet been determined. Ge's trip to Japan hopes to strive for a supply of 10 million pounds, and also hopes to obtain preferential treatment in terms of price. As for the amount of cocoons stored in the silk factories in this city, it varies. The larger ones can be maintained until February or March next spring, and the smaller ones will be difficult to support by the end of this month.

### Guangxin Printing and Dyeing Factory Relocates its Distribution Office

Guangxin Weaving, Printing and Dyeing Factory in this city. Recently, due to the expansion of business, the original distribution office is not sufficient.

In addition, Yida Dyeing and Weaving Factory, an affiliate of the factory, also moved to the above-mentioned new address at the same time today.

### Industry and Commerce Supervision Office First Sets Up a Preparatory Office

[Report from this newspaper] The newly appointed Director of the Shanghai District Industry and Commerce Supervision Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ouyang Lun, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He told reporters that because the organizational regulations of the Supervision Office have not yet been passed by the Legislative Yuan, he is unwilling to make any statements on the responsibilities and policy plans of the office. However, it is said that the scope of jurisdiction of the Shanghai District Supervision Office will be the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. It may be established on the first day of next month. The personnel establishment is approximately 30 people. Now a preparatory office has been established and notices have been sent to all parties for reference.

### Rice Market Firm, Grains and Miscellaneous Grains Downstream

Yesterday, the North and South rice market registered over 10,000 shi of goods. The market sentiment was acceptable, Japonica rice was active, Indica rice was fair, White Yuan and Yin Yuan were stable, and wheat trading was scarce. A large batch of 30,000 packages of Northeast soybeans continuously arrived in Shanghai. Scattered goods also arrived at various ports along the Yangtze River, causing the market price to plummet by more than 2,000 yuan. Tea beans were stagnant in Nanyang. There were many sources on the Jinpu Line, which fell by another 2,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were still hovering, broad beans rebounded by 1,000 yuan, horse beans stabilized, red sorghum was dull, and weakened by another 1,000 yuan. Peanuts arrived in Shanghai continuously. Yang Zhuang remained stagnant, the local area was stable, bean cakes also fell by 100 to 200 yuan with other goods, and wheat bran slightly fell by 100 to 200 yuan. The oil market saw a boom in goods from Qingdao, and crude oil gradually decreased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and vegetable oil stood out.

### Domestic Wool: Cheap and Coarse, Fine and Soft After Processing

Domestic wool can be used for wool spinning and weaving industries and can be quite self-sufficient. The price is also lower. For example, Huzhou wool is 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per dan. After selection and washing, 50 jin of clean wool can be obtained, which can be spun into 40 jin of woolen yarn. Its cost is actually cheaper than Australian woolen yarn. However, the weave is slightly coarse, and various wool spinning factories can only use it for coarse wool fabrics. Fine wool fabrics still rely on Australian goods. Furthermore, because weaving wages are the same for both coarse and fine yarns, coarse goods are slow to sell in the market, and the selling price is also low, while fine goods sell well and the price is also higher. Therefore, most people use Australian woolen yarn to weave fine goods, which leads to domestic wool not being fully utilized. According to research by people in the industry, domestic wool can also be made into the fineness and softness of Australian wool if it can be specially processed, but the current labor costs are high and cannot be realized.

### US Cotton Prices Fall for Three Consecutive Days, US Senate Accuses Exchange Manipulation, British Newspaper Says It is Unrelated to President's Broadcast

[United Press, New York, 18th] Cotton futures have fallen for the third consecutive day today, a drop of $10 per bale, which has reached the daily maximum price limit, but after the opening, there was a sharp rise of $8.25 at one point. The market believes that the lifting of price controls may cause currency contraction. At the close, futures fell $1.75 to $5.50. In addition, New Orleans, 18th, today cotton futures closed down $3.55 to $5.45 per bale.

[Reuters, Manchester, 18th] The Manchester Guidance newspaper commented that one of the reasons for the recent fall in US cotton prices seems to be a view held by some people that President Truman's broadcast on October 14 foreshadowed the possibility of an early cancellation of cotton fabric price controls. But there is no clear reason to say that the cancellation of control of cotton fabrics is enough to promote the trend of raw cotton market prices, and at the same time, there is no significant reason to believe that the control of cotton fabrics will be cancelled soon. President Truman clearly stated that the control of goods with extremely short supply will continue to be implemented until large-scale production is achieved. From all aspects, the supply of most cotton fabrics in the United States has not been smooth.

[Reuters, New York, 18th] Senator Thomas, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, accused the cotton exchange of colluding to suppress cotton prices, which has been denied by the New York and New Orleans cotton exchanges. At the same time, officials from the Department of Agriculture in Washington said that we have not found any attempts to lower cotton prices from all aspects. There is no information available to prove Senator Thomas's accusation. Officials believe that the reason for the fall in cotton prices is nothing more than the law of "what goes up must come down."

### Profit Tax Increased by 50% According to Reported Amount, Handled According to Simplified Method of the Great Rear Area

At 4 pm yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened the heads of 68 industry associations such as banks, money shops, and chemical industries to continue discussing the method of reporting and paying the profit tax for the 34th year. Xu Jilong, Du Yuesheng, and Pan Shihao of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended the meeting. Accountant Xi Yushu also attended and heard about the simplified taxation situation in the Great Rear Area. The leaders of various industries conducted careful research on the reporting and payment methods, and unanimously decided to follow the simplified taxation precedents of the Great Rear Area and increase all amounts reported by each industry by 50%. However, the government originally set the budget for the profit tax for the 34th year in this city at 60 billion. After several consultations by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Director Wang came to Shanghai this time, and Du Yuesheng and Xu Jilong repeatedly argued with Director Wang, before he agreed to reduce it appropriately. However, even after the amounts originally reported by various industries were generally increased by 50% as decided, they could only barely reach the full amount of 20 billion. Therefore, both the tax bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce felt difficult about this. As for households that have not reported, the direct tax bureau has already set other methods to severely punish them.

Regarding the recent negotiation concerning the reappointment of Professor Zhu Xu-pin at Jida University, the university was represented by Da Jie, and the faculty was represented by Jian Hua, Yuan Fang, and five others.

### Visiting Ambassador Stuart's Former Residence

— Hangzhou News, 12th, Our Reporter Huang Xing-tian

Dr. Stuart, now in his twilight years, was appointed by President Truman as the U.S. Ambassador to China to discuss national affairs and mediate peace regarding the Kuomintang-Communist conflict. Although peace talks have not yet yielded ideal results, Ambassador Stuart's tireless spirit of working for peace, just like his dedication to nurturing talents as the President of Yenching University from 1918, is deeply and sincerely appreciated by the people of the whole country.

Sweeping Ancestral Graves at Jiulisong

Ambassador Stuart is an American, but he grew up in Hangzhou. It is decided that he will come to Hangzhou on the 18th morning and go to Jiulisong to worship at his parents' graves. Since being hired as a theology teacher at Jinling University in Nanjing in 1907, he has spent most of his time in Peiping for more than thirty years, and rarely visited Hangzhou. After eight years of the War of Resistance, although his hometown can be said to be "unharmed," nostalgia is human nature. Therefore, in the reporter's opinion, it is very necessary for Ambassador Stuart, in an atmosphere where national affairs are still dull, to steal some leisure time to come to the beautiful city of Hangzhou for a few days of quiet life. Shouldn't Dr. Stuart adjust his life and spirit?

Yu Ji-xian Recalls the Past

Ambassador Stuart's former residence is the Jesus Church on Tianhanzhou Bridge in Hangzhou. That road has now been renamed Zhongshan North Road. In Hangzhou, this road is relatively quiet. The appearance of the church is like an ordinary small church, and the exterior is very simple. Ambassador Stuart's "old home" is the middle one of three two-story buildings arranged side by side. Now it is inhabited by Wang Pu-sheng, Ambassador Stuart's top student, who is now the General Secretary of the Hangzhou Christian Youth Association. According to Mr. Yu Ji-xian, an old man of 58 years living there, the house is roughly the same as it was originally, without much change, although it has been more than 30 years. The interior of the house is very exquisite.

The Most Gentle Childhood Life

Seventy years ago (1876), missionary John L. Stuard and his wife Mang Harton Stuard gave birth to their first child, John Leighton Stuart, in this house. Mr. Stuard was originally a teacher and came to China with the spirit of missionary work to dedicate himself to education. Therefore, he opened a primary school. However, church members were very dissatisfied with this, believing that missionary work should precede school management. So the primary school was closed and turned into a church, which is today's Jesus Church still standing next to Zhongshan North Road. At that time, Mr. Stuard's eastern neighbor was a pastor surnamed Hong, and Miss Mai lived on the west side, both of whom were members of the church. Therefore, Mr. Stuart's childhood life was entirely in the air of the church. He traveled with his parents among the Chinese people, learned the language like Chinese children, and also learned to read and write, living the life of ordinary Chinese people. Yu Ji-xian, the only old man in the Jesus Church who can recall the past, can only say that Mr. Stuart was the eldest of three children and also the gentlest. The reporter wanted to inquire about Mr. Stuart's childhood life, but the only answer received was these two words: "gentle."

Thirty Years Since Leaving Hangzhou

Starting at the age of eleven, Mr. Stuart was sent back to his homeland by his family to study. In 1892, he entered Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, where his greatest interests were Latin and Greek. His hope was to become a scholar, a university professor. Hampden-Sydney is a smaller university in the United States that maintains its characteristics. The number of its graduates listed in the Who's Who is higher than that of Harvard University. Dr. Stuart not only left a glorious historical mark in the history of Chinese education, but is now also playing an important supporting role on the American political stage. In November 1904, he married Miss Aline Rodd. In December of the same year, he came to Hangzhou again to live with his father and began to study ancient Chinese literature to replace the study of Latin and Greek. From that time on, he began to understand Chinese culture and further understand many things about China. After preaching in Hangzhou for two years, their only son, Rev. John Stuart, was born. A year later, he was hired as a theology teacher in Nanjing, and from then on, he left Hangzhou and rarely ventured to his second hometown.

Visiting the Old Site, the Lake and Mountains Add Splendor

Ambassador Stuart has been away from his hometown for more than thirty years. The elm tree that he planted himself in the garden of his former residence has grown taller than their building, extending thick and strong branches and lush leaves, protecting their former residence. The coffins of his father and mother are still buried in Jiulisong, Hangzhou. The room he saw when he first came into the world and the room where his wife gave birth to their son, John Stuart, are still intact. Although the furniture in the room has been replaced, the walls and window frames are still the same as they were thirty years ago. According to Mr. Wang Yan-sheng, Ambassador Stuart wrote a letter the other day saying that he had decided to stay in his second hometown for three days, and the Hangzhou Youth Association has been actively preparing to welcome him. Not only will Ambassador Stuart's old friends and acquaintances welcome him, but the people of Hangzhou are also very happy about the coming of this old peace envoy. I believe that Ambassador Stuart's return to his old home will add a new splendor to the scenery of the lake and mountains!

### A Groundbreaking Visit: Beijing-Shanghai-Beiping-Kunming Journalist Delegation in Taipei

— Taiwan Air Report on the 13th, from Our Correspondent Jiang Muyun

The Beijing-Shanghai-Beiping-Kunming Journalist Taiwan Visitation Group, led by Vice Minister Xu and comprising twenty-two members, landed at Songshan Airport at 10:30 AM on the 12th, crossing the strait. The journalists, hailing from all corners of the country, expressed joy and enthusiasm as they faced the autumn breeze of the island nation on the vast, mountainside-backed airport.

Official Hosts Banquet

Chief Chen specially welcomed and hosted the journalists from afar at the most magnificent First Guest House in Taiwan. After introductions by Group Leader Xu, they gathered around a large rosewood table. The Chief reported on the current situation of the province in a friendly and casual manner, covering the progress in economy, politics, education, and construction. Dressed in a dark blue Zhongshan suit, the Chief appeared energetic and showed great concern and warmth towards the journalists.

After lunch, Chief Editor Chen of this newspaper had a separate meeting with the Chief, answering several questions raised by the Chief Editor. The Chief's banquet was the first event for the journalists upon arrival in Taiwan, and Secretary-General Ge will host a farewell banquet for them in Beitou before their return to Shanghai.

Chairman Speaks Freely About Taiwanese Compatriots

The first event for the journalist delegation that afternoon was a visit to the Provincial Party Headquarters. Chairman Li Shizhong spoke earnestly and sincerely, stating that the cultural level of the Taiwanese compatriots is relatively high, making them receptive to the Party's ideology. They had previously misunderstood freedom and equality and doubted the Three Principles of the People, but they have now made significant progress.

The compatriots are enthusiastic and possess a spontaneous organizational ability. There are many people's organizations, and they all work earnestly and diligently. Generally, those under twenty years old only understand Japanese, while the majority of those over thirty understand Chinese. He cited an example: Lin Xiantang, the head of the delegation who returned from the mainland, is proficient in both literature and poetry. Middle-aged people in the Taichung area can all write Chinese.

"The Taiwanese compatriots who have been oppressed by Japanese imperialism for fifty-eight years have never forgotten their motherland," said Youth League Director Li Youbang, Taipei Mayor You, and Vice Chairman of the Provincial Assembly Li Wanjui to the journalist delegation.

They particularly pointed out the major errors in the remarks made by American journalist Gray, who visited Taiwan for three days. Gray said that if the Taiwanese could vote to choose their master, the first choice would be the United States, the second would be Japan, and the third would be China. Such an observation is an insult to the provincial compatriots. The compatriots have a traditional love for their country and have never forgotten their motherland, and they will never forget their motherland.

Song Feiru, Deputy Director of the Department of Education, representing the provincial compatriots, cited a simple example to illustrate the considerable distance in understanding between the mainland and the island. He said that in a recent middle school entrance exam, the question was "In which province is Kunming located?" and some students answered Zhejiang. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the flow of historical and geographical knowledge. However, the mainland also misunderstands the Taiwanese compatriots. For example, when Xie Dongmin, Deputy Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, was in Shanghai, someone asked him if it was true that Taiwanese people had two pairs of horns on their heads. There are many such jokes.

He sincerely hopes that the motherland will not leave the 6.3 million provincial compatriots outside of the 400 million compatriots, as they are eagerly awaiting the love of the motherland.

Speaker of the Assembly Complains

Huang Chaoqin, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, complained to the journalist delegation. He said that the provincial people expect too much from the Assembly. If a proposal cannot be passed before 12:00 noon, you can see it being criticized in the newspaper at 2:00 PM, and even Assembly members cannot go home because the public will satirize them by blowing and beating Taoist priests as if holding a funeral. Conversely, if a proposal is resolved satisfactorily, they will not hesitate to spend thousands of yuan on advertising fees to publish "thank you notes." In reality, they do not understand the nature of the Assembly, which has no decision-making power.

He recalled the enthusiasm with which the public welcomed the National Army on this day last year. Most of them slept overnight at the train station, waiting for the anti-Japanese soldiers from Fujian, but this scene soon disappointed them.

In terms of employing local talent and factories, he hopes that the government will provide conveniences for the provincial people and give priority to hiring them.

Group Leader Provides News

Group Leader Xu, who is leading the "search for news leads," instead provided news facts to his provincial counterparts at Mayor You's banquet. He succinctly elucidated the situation in wartime news centers such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and Guilin, and explained the central government's policy towards the newspaper industry in terms of news administration and reporting techniques. He said that during the war, no newspaper did not comply with news censorship. Now that this system has been abolished and freedom of the press has been restored, this freedom is precious. Reporting should be based on facts, and do not spread rumors or slander, which would destroy freedom. The scope of the news industry is broad, and there are not enough talented people. The significant progress made so far is a fact, but it is not yet ideal, and this requires our own full efforts.

Museum and Democracy

When visiting the museum, the city's first sports meet was being held in the park, and students crowded the square. Some were flipping through books in the library. The journalists were deeply impressed by these second-generation students in tattered clothes and bare feet. The provincial history room in the museum particularly aroused their interest. Chen, the Chief Editor of this newspaper, carefully examined the discussion of the reward silver for the Zhangehua County Magistrate who killed a Japanese general in February of the 24th year of Guangxu and the flag of the Democratic Republic of Shu Jing-song. They all said that this was Taiwan's earliest democracy. Due to Chief Editor Chen's suggestion, everyone gathered together to discuss people's livelihood. After going downstairs, they looked at the locomotive from the Qing Dynasty. As the group strolled leisurely along the stone path, everyone gazed at the autumn clouds in the coconut grove, as if the travelers were already feeling another kind of weariness!

Visiting the Camphor Factory

The last event on the first day in the provincial capital was a visit to the Nanmen Factory, which is the Camphor Factory of the Monopoly Bureau. The factory was shut down for five years before the restoration and has partially resumed production after being taken over. The factory uses the roots, branches, and trunks of both camphor and aromatic camphor trees cut into slices as raw materials, which are then steam-distilled to produce white oil, aromatic oil, and then camphor, terpineol, red oil, green oil, and asphalt. The total production volume this year reached 1,100 tons, and it is expected to increase by 200 tons next year. (The highest annual production in the past was 8 million kilograms.) American artificial camphor seems to have captured the market for natural camphor, but medicine and high-grade fragrances still require the use of natural camphor. Therefore, several British and American companies are directly negotiating purchases, hoping to sell it for $2,000 per ton.

Thinking of the World as One Family

The journalist delegation left Taibei by train at 10:45 AM on the 13th. They will spend four days in central and southern Taiwan, and one day touring Keelung Port. The most prosperous coastal plains of western Taiwan will bear the traces of their sandals. Group Leader Xu decided to convene a symposium of provincial councilors on the evening of the 18th in his capacity as a resident member of the Political Participation Council and broadcast it to the provincial compatriots. Before their scheduled departure from Taiwan on the 19th, there will be a special interlude: preparing to be the officiant at the wedding of Lu Guanqun, the Taiwan special correspondent of the Central Propaganda Department and President of the China Daily.

This reporter went to the airport to welcome Chief Editor Chen of this newspaper and the senior members of the industry. This morning, I waved goodbye as they headed south, deeply feeling that, as H.G. Wells said, the distance on the earth's surface is shortened by the flight of airplanes. He could fly from New York to Siberia to hunt seals and return within 24 hours. This time, the journalists took two and a half hours to get from the Shanghai Bund to Taiwan. The world was originally one family, especially since Taiwan is a newly restored corner. Thinking of this made this reporter feel as if I had already seen the enthusiastic handshake of brothers between the mainland and Taiwan, which should no longer be a distant prospect.

### Speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly Zhao Yanwu Talks About Li Rui's Military Grain Case

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Yesterday, after reading a news item from Changsha in the Shanghai Shenbao on the 17th titled "Li Rui's Case of 50,000 Shi of Military Grain," this reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Zhao Yanwu, Speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly, to inquire about the details. He stated that the case unfolded as follows:

Hunan Province suffered severe disasters this year, making it difficult to allocate and purchase military grain. After the allocation and purchase was stopped at the end of June, the supply of military grain depended entirely on grain relief from Jiangxi and Guizhou and local procurement. On July 5, the Hunan Grain Administration purchased 10,000 shi of military grain through the Zhongyuan Company. At that time, the grain price in Changsha was still higher than the ordered legal price by 13,500 yuan. On August 2, it purchased another 10,000 shi of military grain through the Production and Business Management Office of the Republic University. At that time, the price of grain on the lakefront had already decreased, but the price ordered by the office was still 13,500 yuan. From the perspective of grain prices, the price was somewhat high. Furthermore, the office owed military grain to the Hunan Supply Bureau of the Joint Logistics Headquarters for June and July. On July 31, the office converted and issued 30,000 shi in gold yuan, which was done in accordance with the telegram order from the Ministry of Food and the Logistics Department, at a rate of 13,500 yuan per shi. (It is said that according to the telegram from the Ministry of Food, each bag could also have an additional 4,000 yuan in transportation costs.) It is said that it was all reported to the provincial government for approval. The Hunan Provincial Assembly raised questions about this case. After Director Li Rui attended the meeting to explain, everyone believed that Director Li was candid in his work and had not committed any illegal acts. However, the handling personnel made mistakes in the handling procedures. The Provincial Government has been requested to investigate and deal with the matter.

### Sounds of Lament: Small Ripples in the Shaanxi Provincial Assembly

— Xi'an Air Report on the 2nd, from Our Special Correspondent Li Chi

A Peaceful Assembly: The first session of the second meeting of the Shaanxi Provincial Assembly opened on the 15th of last month. After seventeen days of continuous meetings, it officially closed on October 1. More than eighty provincial representatives attended this meeting, and more than four hundred proposals were passed. However, summarizing the impression gained from this meeting, one feels that it "lacks vigor." The agenda of more than half a month proceeded in a relatively "calm" manner, with no "startling" "explosive questions" and no "debates" involving heated arguments. To borrow a familiar journalistic term: "a peaceful assembly," even if there were any, they were only small ripples. However, from the official policy reports at the meeting and the representatives' moderate inquiries, we can still find a lot of news material to supplement the shortcomings of daily newspaper reports.

During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese army repeatedly attempted to "break into" Shaanxi, but as a result, not an inch of Shaanxi's land fell into enemy hands. This is our good fortune. After the victory, the flames of civil war finally licked into the province from the Central Plains. Li Xiannian's troops of the Chinese Communist Party entered southern Shaanxi from Henan in late July. According to the news at that time, the conflict area was limited to four or five counties in the Shangnan and Longjuzhai area. Furthermore, since about mid-August, the newspapers here have not disclosed any records regarding this issue. The following report from the security authorities to the Provincial Assembly is the first disclosure and is worthy of attention.

Security and Relief: Dai Guimao, Commander of the Shaanxi Provincial Security Headquarters, said in his report: "The Communist army led by Li Xiannian infiltrated Shaanxi Province on July 15 this year, and infiltrated Huating, Gansu on August 25. Twenty counties in this province were ravaged." Also, "There are currently more than 10,000 people on the western suburbs highway."

Zhu Shaozhou, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, also mentioned in his policy report: "Li Xiannian's troops in northern Hubei and Wang Shusheng's troops entered the Shangnan and Zhenping counties of this province from the border between Henan and Hubei on July 15... Wang Shusheng's troops were blocked and retreated back to Hubei Province in August. Li Xiannian's troops, which harassed everywhere, were also blocked and dispersed. The First War Zone Headquarters has drafted a whole set of treatment methods for the remnant bandits..."

Judging from the above two reports, the Communist army's intrusion into Shaanxi Province this time is still an issue that has not been completely resolved. The Shaanxi Security Headquarters also announced: "The Communist army that infiltrated Baihe advanced to harass the county seat of Zhen'an last week. They were jointly suppressed by local teams and the public and were defeated on September 26..." For current urgent issues, please refer to the "Emergency Relief Measures for Bandit-Affected Areas" recently passed by the provincial government. It states that the counties most severely affected include Shanyang, Zhen'an, Weinan, and Shangxian. Counties that have been repeatedly affected include Shangnan, Zhashui, Ningshan, Foping, and Longyou. The less affected counties include Liuba, Yangxian, and Longxian. Representatives from southern Shaanxi in this meeting of the Provincial Assembly have repeatedly appealed for the people in that area.

Hail Kills Cattle: The people of Shaanxi Province are suffering from natural disasters in addition to man-made disasters! According to the report by Chen Guting, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, to the Shaanxi Provincial Assembly: "Twenty-two counties in this province reported spring disasters, and seven counties reported summer disasters. Relief wheat and relief funds have been issued. In addition, seven counties reported summer disasters and thirty-one counties reported autumn disasters." Although the provincial government has been providing various forms of relief based on the basic principle of "giving more and taking less," the burden on the people is still heavy. Please listen to the appeal of a representative from Shangxian: "150,000 people in Shangxian are living surrounded by "disasters" and "bandits." The public expenses allocated to the people are more than 780 million yuan. This year, Shangxian was hit by hail, which was so big that it killed cattle!..."

Collection of Actual Grain: Regarding the issue of this year's collection of actual grain and borrowing, the Provincial Assembly has made an important decision. The government's planned figures are 1.2 million city shi for both collection of actual grain and borrowing, plus 30% of provincial and county-level public grain, which is 360,000 city shi. This number is about 1.6 million city shi less than the borrowing of grain in previous years. The Provincial Assembly hopes that: "The additional 100% of the land tax, the 50% that has not been collected in this province this year, should still be exempted. The item of borrowing should follow the previous practice of "collecting one and borrowing half" and should not be increased." The assembly also telegraphed the authorities, requesting that 8.5/10 of the grain warehouse vouchers be returned to the local area, and the remaining 1.5/10 be used for subsidizing educational equipment and other expenses. According to the decision of the National Finance and Food Conference in June of this year, the provincial government only gets 20% of the amount of land tax collected in kind, while the county-level can get 50%. Of the 12-13 billion yuan of expenditures that have been approved in the Shaanxi provincial government's budget for the second half of this year, the reliable income is only more than 3 billion yuan. This "deficit" of nearly 10 billion yuan is a terrible number. It is said that according to regulations, during these six months, the provincial government can request the central government to allocate administrative expenses, but not for more than three months. The Director of the Finance Department, who recently returned to Shaanxi from the capital, told reporters that the central government has allocated more than 3 billion yuan in subsidies for July, August, and September, and another 1 billion yuan is for subsidizing the collection of taxes that did not reach the expected figures. The statement of financial revenue and expenditure for the second half of the year is still under review in Nanjing. The shortfall will probably be made up by subsidies from the central government.

Despite the provincial government's books showing such a huge "deficit," the authorities still have the courage to design and formulate long-term and large-scale construction plans, extending them to six years if five years are not enough, aiming to complete them from this year to 1951. This preliminary draft has been submitted to the current Provincial Assembly for review.

The Shaanxi Provincial Bank and the Longhai Railway Bureau have been criticized by the Provincial Assembly. The former is about its business dealings, and the latter is due to the recent shortage of train cars, which has led to the rising prices of coal, yarn, and flour. The Railway Bureau seems to have shown signs of accepting friendly suggestions recently.

Armed Drug Trafficking: Finally, I want to mention the Shaanxi Province's drug ban problem, which I originally intended to omit. According to official estimates, there are a total of 100,000 opium addicts in Shaanxi Province. Therefore, banning drugs in Shaanxi Province is indeed a difficult problem. It is said that a large amount of opium is being smuggled in a certain area, but the actual situation has yet to be confirmed. Officials also revealed for the first time at this assembly that opium seedlings were once discovered on the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi this spring.

"Armed drug trafficking" is not uncommon in Shaanxi Province. According to the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs in his report at the meeting: From January to July, force was used to investigate and arrest drug traffickers, resulting in "combat" (these two words are quoted from the original text) on 82 occasions! More than 5,000 taels of opium have been seized! According to another report by Chairman Zhu, a total of more than 1,100 drug offenders were investigated and arrested from January to August, and the weapons seized from drug traffickers included 7 rifles, 4 machine guns, 54 pistols, and 42 hand grenades. In addition, there were also some opium,赃款, gold, and silver. The Security Command supplemented the report of the Department of Civil Affairs, saying that in the same period, more than 1,000 taels of opium and more than 600,000 yuan of drug money were seized.

The Shaanxi Provincial Government has decided to force all opium addicts to quit smoking within three months starting from November this year, and has prepared more than 100 million yuan and several thousand taels of opium as the consumption for the implementation of the drug ban. If it can be completed smoothly as scheduled, it will of course be a supreme virtue. However, the effectiveness of all policy plans is ultimately determined by the lowest-level implementers, which is especially obvious in the case of the drug ban. Li Mengbiao, Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, said on the day of the closing ceremony, "May the words of the members of this Assembly be likened to 'the sounds of lament,' hoping that there will be a day when their wishes are fulfilled."

### Condolences to Comrades of the New China Drama Society

— Xiao Liang

It is reported that more than 30 members of the New China Drama Society and several members of the Yunnan Education Drama Troupe, who were leaving Kunming for Shanghai on a relief vehicle, had a car accident near Guanlingchang in Guiyang, resulting in 27 deaths and injuries. This is truly a loss for the drama community!

The New China Drama Society was established in Guilin, and most of its members were young people who loved art. They were energetic and studied diligently, but they encountered many setbacks due to the lack of funds and obstacles. Later, they performed in various places in Xiangtan and Hengyang, and received the welcome and help of local people, and the society's affairs made progress. Later, due to the drastic changes in the Xianggui War, they wandered to Kunming, a rear area that was an excellent professional drama troupe.

When Guilin held the first drama exhibition, "New China" returned with honor and participated in the performance. At that time, they could be said to be very popular, but they still lived a disciplined life, without being infected with any bad habits. All the members lived a life of art above all else, and the economy was open. All the money besides living expenses was used to develop the society, and the future was limitless!

Now that victory has been restored and they are repatriated, they came to Shanghai from Kunming, but unfortunately suffered a car accident on the way. This is truly a loss for the drama community and a loss for the cultural community!

I hope that the surviving members will continue to work hard and live up to the expectations of those comrades who sacrificed for art!

### A Record of the Peking Opera Symposium

— Zhao Jingshen

The Peking Opera symposium convened by Tian Han and Zhou Xinfang, recorded by Wang Dingcheng, has been published simultaneously in the monthly magazine and the Frontline Daily. What he recorded were all important words, and I will talk about the trivial matters at that time.

Everyone unanimously requested Guo Moruo to speak first. He could not refuse, so he stood up with a smile. His first sentence was: "Everyone is curious!" Then, everyone laughed. His meaning seemed to be that he was an outsider to Peking Opera, "You insiders (such as Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baishi, Li Ruilai, Lu Junqiao, Jiang Chunfang, etc.) want to hear what an outsider has to say." Later, he said that Peking Opera music seemed to lack harmony.

Zheng Zhenduo talked about facial makeup, saying that when he was in Europe, once in England, he was walking on the lawn in a garden and saw many terrible little heads on the glass window of a house. The faces all had colorful patterns. Later, he realized that these were all barbarians who had been killed, and the heads had become smaller because they had been soaked in medicine.

Pan Zhinong's talk about Sichuan Opera facial makeup was also very interesting. He said that the Green Snake in Sichuan Opera was originally a man, so he dressed up as a male character. During the drinking of realgar wine, there is a "face changing" performance. After the meeting, I said to Moruo that this was a bit like Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

Wu Renzhi's words were short but reasonable. He said: "Peking Opera often has many self-expressions or show-offs that are irrelevant to the plot, such as the swordsmanship of martial artists. These should all be given up without fear of pain. It must be something that should be in the plot before it can be put in, otherwise it will become a performance, not acting."

Tian Han's idea is quite strange. Ouyang Yuqian said before that the rotation of many wheel flags in a row can represent the rotation of machinery. Now Tian Han said that cars and motorcycles can be painted on the flags as cars, or the leaves of airplanes as airplanes.

Chen Zhiliang said that many of the Peking Opera scripts revised by the Ministry of Education have been published and can be used as good references.

Tian Han and Zhou Xinfang convened another meeting at the Red Cotton Restaurant on June 21. This meeting was just to prepare for the publication of publications and to solicit drafts from friends. However, Zhou Xinfang talked about two movements in performing techniques that were also quite interesting.

He said that when performing old men and old women, they often bend over and cup their buttocks. In fact, they should bend over and stick out their chests, and the buttocks must not be cupped. It is not easy to practice this skill.

He also talked about Xu Lingyun, a Kunqu opera performer, talking about the blind man in the fortune-telling scene in "The Story of the Red Plum Blossom." Most people perform the blind man by walking on the stage with a bamboo cane, tapping the ground step by step. But in reality, it is not like that. Since the blind man has no eyes, he relies entirely on his ears, so he should step onto the stage sideways, listen with his ears, and maybe his mouth will also be crooked to one side. He made that movement, which was very funny.

Later, they talked about Dai Ailian's "Deaf-Mute Carrying a Madman," where one person plays two people. Some people said that this is the same as a Shandong person playing two people fighting.

Xinfang said: "The deaf-mute carrying a madman in Peking Opera is actually an old man carrying a young man. One hand is used as the head of the old man, and the other hand is the left hand of the woman. The old man turns his head to look at the girl, and the girl slaps him in the face."

Tian Han said: "Guilin Opera is different. The old man is chased by a group of idlers. One hand is holding the old man's fake head, and the other hand is the old man's left hand. He turns his head to look at the people chasing him, and shakes his hand to tell them not to chase him, and then uses his hand to wipe away tears."

The above records are based on memory only. I did not take notes at the time, so there may be errors, for which I am responsible.

### Audiences in Beijing and Shanghai Watch The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty Together

— Hua Fen

The appearance of "The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" has probably caused a sensation among opera fans in Shanghai! However, do opera fans in Shanghai know that it had already fascinated opera fans in Chongqing before the victory. Because of it, people waited early in the morning at the "Kangjian Hall" to buy tickets, and our Chairman was also mobilized to watch it and invited all the actors to the Lizhi Society. Yang Cunbin was also summoned by the Chairman at that time and comforted him in person.

The government was repatriated, the people were repatriated, and "The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" also followed the actors to Shanghai. After several months of preparation and rehearsal, the "Audience Performing Company" used it as its first play. The director was still Yang Cunbin, and the actors were the first-class: Geng Zhen, Shen Yang, Ye Zi, Yang Hua, Zhang Yan, Wen Xiying, etc. "Zhongwan" also wanted to perform "The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty," and Yang Cunbin had no choice but to agree, but on one condition: Zhongwan had to perform in Nanjing first. Everyone agreed, so Yang Cunbin started to get busy. It was not easy to put the play of "Audience" on the stage in Lafai, and after he watched the first performance, Wang Ruilin immediately pulled him to Nanjing.

"Zhongwan" performed "The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" in Nanjing. All the actors and the head of the troupe, Wang Ruilin, and the director, Yang Cunbin, arrived. Not long ago, it was performed at the National Grand Theater in Nanjing, and it was decided to perform for ten consecutive days. The actors included Shu Xiuwen, Tao Jin, Chen Tianguo, Ruan Fei, Kou Jiabi, Qian Qianli, etc., all of whom were excellent actors. Compared with the "Audience" in Shanghai, they each had their own merits.

### 伊黛露碧諾受窘

— 朱曾汶

Don't let 伊黛露碧諾's small stature and seemingly young age fool you, on February 4th of next year, she will be celebrating her thirtieth birthday.

伊黛 smiles warmly, speaks capriciously, and loves to tell a joke about herself that happened in her birthplace of London. Although 伊黛 went to the United States at the age of thirteen, before the war, she would return to her father's theatrical birthplace every year to show that she did not forget her homeland and the kindness of her family's upbringing. One year, after she and her sister returned to London, they suddenly wanted to go see a movie. Coincidentally, the theater they went to had just shown a film starring her the previous week. As their car approached the theater, they saw that the front was crowded with people, so packed that not a drop of water could seep through. 伊黛 said to her sister, "My film must have done well when it premiered here last week. Look, they're all here to welcome me." But who leaked the news of her visit to England? She wrongly accused her sister of being the culprit, but her sister flatly denied it. At this moment, 伊黛 caught sight of a red carpet laid at the entrance of the theater, and she exclaimed, "Everyone in London must know I'm here." After she got out of the car, she put on her best demeanor, bowing to the crowd as she prepared to enter the theater, but just then, she heard a London policeman behind her shout loudly, "Ladies, please move forward quickly, the Prince of England is about to arrive."

Needless to say, 伊黛's face was as red as a pig's liver at that moment, but she still dares to tell people about it today, which shows that she has a pure heart and the courage to admit her mistakes!

### 伊黛露碧諾

### 評「清宮外史」演員

— 楊灝

Actors are the main part of a performance. Through actors, the playwright can specifically express his thoughts to the audience. Moreover, actors are in direct contact with the audience. Therefore, the quality of the performance is determined, and the actor's contribution is very important. In this performance, the actors showed a characteristic, that is, generally speaking, it is very balanced, and they maintained a good style. They do not specially express themselves on the stage, or make gimmicks to attract attention. They all obey the performance and cooperate very well.

葉子　葉子's Empress Dowager Cixi is very important in this play. Almost the entire "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" revolves around her, using her as the main line. Her quality is crucial to the entire performance. 葉子 portrays this character deeply and vividly. Her every move, every word, and every smile is enough to stir the audience's heartstrings, showing that she has put in a lot of effort, and she performs so skillfully that I feel like I am in the Qing Dynasty more than fifty years ago, and I can get a glimpse of this female ruler who dominated the world and China, and I am a little afraid of her power. Cixi is a person with a strong sense of self-confidence. There is very little expression of original and true emotions in her life, so her mood is very lonely. She wants to find happiness, she likes to talk, likes to laugh, and likes excitement, but she may not directly participate in these scenes. She may just like to hear people talk, like to watch people laugh, and from people's talk and laughter; she may find warmth and sweep away loneliness. (For example, Cixi's lines: "...Today we don't stick to etiquette, the more those who can talk and laugh, the more I like..." - Act II) But 葉子 will let her character laugh heartily, so sharply, it seems a bit frivolous and not in line with the identity and mood of her character.

耿震　耿震's Emperor Guangxu is the most pitiful emperor of the Qing Dynasty. This is a so-called "positive" character, but the playwright seems to be far less vivid in handling this kind of positive character than he is in handling special characters. In the script itself, Guangxu is a bit flat, with very few ups and downs. Therefore, this character is more difficult to play. 耿震 is a good actor. He does not add anything extra to this character, but simply and dutifully expresses everything that is given to him and asked of him in the script, so that we sigh, pity, sympathize, and are angry for this weak emperor.

陽華's Li Lianying is the biggest and most superficial "villain" in the entire play. The script gives this character a lot of richness. 陽華 plays this character very appropriately. He flatters, is humble, insidious, and vicious, portraying a character with both an ugly appearance and personality, almost making us feel that he is a terrible shadow lurking behind the Qing Dynasty. 陽華 is a talented actor, but when the play is in progress and after the play is over, we always feel that his performance is not very coordinated with the whole, and it always seems like there is something extra, that is, some places are slightly excessive. If he can restrain these excessive places a little, then his performance can be said to be very outstanding.

沈揚　沈揚's Kou Liancai is the most vivid. A naive, simple, ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth, and loyal and righteous character. He plays him so vividly that he wins the audience's applause, laughter, respect, and tears, and even more admiration for his acting skills.

翁同龢, the emperor's teacher, a learned, arrogant, and stubborn old man, 张雁 plays him very well, especially when he argues with Li Hongzhang until his face turns red and he makes a passionate speech in front of the Empress Dowager, with sound and color. In creating the appearance of the character, people will know at first glance that this is an old man with a strong sense of self-confidence and stubbornness.

Li Hongzhang, the representative of the emerging comprador class at that time, a speculator, a double-dealer, was eventually attacked in embarrassment and abandoned. This character is very difficult to play, but 温锡莹 handles it in an orderly manner, neither humble nor overbearing, which is indeed in line with his "Doctrine of the Mean" that he always advocates.

楊戳's Consort Zhen, 冀淑平's Consort Jin, 傅惠珍's Sister Li, and 莫愁's Empress all performed wonderfully, but the script gives them too little. For example, the playwright's handling of Consort Zhen is far inferior to that of Sister Li. Sometimes we really can't figure out how Consort Zhen would have gained the emperor's favor and her influence on the emperor. Of course, the actors have no way to give this character more content.

Lucky Mr.

Perhaps it is a kind of love style in the United States. "A Social Celebrity's Love Affairs", "New Life", "Albizia Flowers", and even this "Lucky Mr." all have the same center: a rich man's daughter falls in love with a poor man. The dreams of people living in a capitalist society, through the mouth of a gambler, the screenwriter happily rebukes the marriage of class. Golden branches and jade leaves have to submit. Tie my tie for me, she stood on the stairs and obeyed the orders of love. Aren't all those who walk alone with crooked ties hoping for this luck? The original intention of this film is not like "Three Musketeers", but it creates a lot of lighthearted jokes, natural, unexaggerated, and smooth. Waiting and talking at the blood transfusion place, lightly like a jumping curve. The scene of being forced to learn velvet thread is comical and abrupt, unconventional, and makes people can't help but smile. Director Bode is a newcomer, with a novel approach. The words at the beginning of the pier are old, and the story is opened with two doors, and the story is closed with the closing of two doors at the end. Some people don't like the happy ending and advocate letting it become a melancholy tragedy. However, I feel that the rich woman's tracking at the pier is a bit cruel. Therefore, the sweet kiss in the mist after suffering is exactly what we expect on behalf of her. The regret is that the gambler's nature of being a jerk has not been fully expressed, and he still retains the true character of a bad egg, not enough to be the rich lady's lover. Secondly, "Lucky Mr." has not developed into a pure comedy, losing more opportunities for satire.

卡萊憂倫 plays the gambler, naturally manipulating freely, but not as good as 嚴若遊龍 in "Crazy Family". "Crazy Family" is his highest peak in comedy. 拉琳黛風徽　however, is charming and elegant, showing the same level of skill in expressing shrewd and capable character and affectionate charm. I really like her bright smile, gaze, and stare, combining both Cute and Chie.

Daughter City

This is an exposure-based social film, not a comedy. What we see is the society of an American small town with the false skin peeled off. There are very potential themes, but unfortunately it lacks wonderful organization. Director Sidney Salkow should receive mixed reviews. His glory is his handling of the women's apartment. A group of women are working hard and patiently waiting for their relatives to be released from prison and return. The whistle is a sign of prisoners entering the meal, but the bell is a sign of the execution of their own flesh and blood. On a rainy day, faces with tear stains on the glass window, they are dreaming, expecting, and waiting in withering time. These depressing scenes are good enough, and everything else is superfluous. The actors each have their own merits and portray a kind of personality on their own. The heroine, 林達黛妮兒, is usually dazzling and charming, and her acting skills are slightly inferior in serious dramas compared to villainous dramas.

### 林黛達妮兒主演「女兒城」

Phantom of the Opera

Some say that the story of China's "Midnight Song" is derived from this. It tells the horror story of perverted artists, which is the same as Man's 奥白朗乔治山德士's "Broken Blossoms" and 林達黛妮兒's "Mad Artist". But the photographic atmosphere and director of photography are better in the latter two. 納爾遜埃第's singing voice is still strong, but unfortunately what he sings is not English opera, which is difficult to appreciate. It is better to pay attention to the installation and the mysterious masked ball at the end. After all, this is an award-winning film.

春秋

### 送友人留學英國序

— 徐仲年

On the morning of October 17th, in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Ms. Zhang Qianying, Mr. Zhang Anzhi, Mr. Chen Xiaonan, and Mr. Fei Chengwu will take a plane to study in England: this is a very gratifying thing! On the one hand, we congratulate the Ministry of Education for selecting talented people: they graduated from National Central University in their early years, and they are all proud students of Mr. Xu Beihong. Among them, the earliest graduated in June of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, and the latest was in January of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China: that is to say, it has been at least ten years and ten months since graduation! During this long period of time, their efforts have aroused social attention, stimulated sympathy in the art world, and laid the foundation for their own academic status. On the other hand, we cannot but admit that they are lucky: at this time when the country is in trouble and academics are declining, Chinese culture has reached the point of suffocation, they actually have the opportunity to study abroad, not only will the air they breathe be fresh and pure, without the stench of money, without the corrupt smell of negativity, but they will also be able to appreciate the works they love to appreciate and learn the art they love to learn. Compared with us, the so-called cultural people, staying in the motherland, wanting to make progress but the environment does not allow us to make progress, there is a real difference between heaven and earth!

Or someone said: modern China only needs science, not art. This view is no different from saying: the most important thing for a person is matter, and spirit is secondary. First of all, I doubt whether science can develop without spirit? Even if it is possible, is the abnormal progress of material civilization the happiness of mankind? In terms of skills, art is science; in terms of spirit, the object of art is the soul. Between materialism and idealism, art gives us a kind of adjustment: so art is positive, not negative; it is a necessity, not a luxury. Don't say: "Build the country with art": relying on art alone is not enough to build the country; however, building the country while ignoring art, or even kicking art away, the country built in this way only has a shell, not a soul! This means that your responsibilities are heavy, and it also means that your future is bright.

Since the object of art is the soul, it of course also refers to "people" and "me". Artists use their works to move people and beautify life. However, artists themselves must first cultivate an inner power of emotion, a magnetic force that cannot be seen with the naked eye. If you want to cultivate this magnetic force, this power of emotion, relying on superficial skills alone is not enough, you must enrich your own soul and elevate your own soul. Among the artists in contemporary China, - I am only referring to oil painters, because although the four of you paint both Chinese and Western, until now, the main thing is still Western painting, - there are many people with superb skills, but unfortunately there are more people with "empty bellies"! A belly full of poetry and books makes one's temperament naturally beautiful: does it only refer to writers? No! Artists are also like this. Enriching the soul and elevating the soul depends on reading widely. A person who is gorgeously dressed but speaks vulgarly: what do we call him? We call him a "nouveau riche"! A person who is skilled in technique, but when he paints, he lacks elegance and has no content: what do we call him? We call him a "craftsman"! If you only know how to paint, do not seek to broaden your knowledge, and do not use the excellent academic environment of foreign countries to dabble in literature, philosophy, or even music, to cultivate your character and cultivate your emotions, you will only have superficial achievements, and your works will have no soul. To put it bluntly: among your teachers and friends, there are too many good-for-nothings, and there is no need to add four more of you!

You are students of Beihong. From the perspective of Chinese critics (?) who like to give people "hats", you should be listed in the academic school. In their opinion, the academic school symbolizes backwardness. What they worship are the futurists, cubists, Dadaists, and fauvists. However, they do not know that long before World War II, these schools that appeared between 1910 and 1917 were already out of date. The academic school still exists prominently. For example, when practicing writing, you might as well start with "Jiucheng Palace", lay a good foundation, and then seek change: the academic school is the "Jiucheng Palace" of art. What's more, new masters like Picasso are thorough academics when they practice. Learning only asks for the orthodox, not for fashion: make up your own mind, stand firm; don't be a weathercock, turning with the wind in all directions!

Since I have mentioned the academic school, futurists, etc., I advise you: to learn art, France and Italy are not to be missed: these two countries are really superior to England in terms of art. Italy is the stronghold of the classical school and the birthplace of the futurists; and Paris, the capital of France, is inclusive and magnificent! However, I have to say again that it is not that you cannot learn anything in England. It is enough for you to learn! Enough! However, lay a good foundation in England, - no, strengthen your already good foundation, - and then go to France and Italy to broaden your horizons. What's more, in Paris, you can meet Ms. Pan Yuliang, your teacher and my friend, who has been abroad for more than twenty years!

You are preparing to stay in the UK for two years, even if it is a long term, it will only be four years: the time is too short, you must work harder to live up to the country, live up to Beihong, and live up to yourselves! However, when I said goodbye to you this afternoon, you were all rosy-cheeked and healthy. I hope you are like this when you go abroad, and like this when you return! Do I need to recite to you: "Work while you work, play while you play: this is the road to success and happiness"? Furthermore, I have a few words to especially exhort Anzhi, Xiaonan, and Chengwu: in London, Paris, Rome, and in other major cities in Europe, there are too many opportunities to play, especially in terms of female beauty. Among the students studying abroad, there are often people who spoil their bodies. Although I like to eat pig knuckles, I don't want to eat cold pig head meat with holes: so my exhortation is not about morality, - France said: "Why put morality so low?" - but based on my health-first doctrine! What is the use of good knowledge if a person is not healthy?

Back then, the emperor of the Tang Dynasty personally sent Sanzang abroad to seek scriptures, toasted the Dharma Master with a cup of wine, and suddenly grabbed a handful of yellow soil and put it in the wine, hoping that Sanzang would not forget his hometown after drinking it. Although this is the head of the history of the drama, it is very meaningful. You are Chinese: even if the current China is in great chaos, the motherland is still the motherland, the moon is good in England, but the moon in China is even better! You must not forget your motherland, forget your teacher, forget your relatives and friends, and... forget your mission!

Shanghai; October 16th, the thirty-fifth year, Wednesday, midnight.

The Greatest War Correspondent: Ernie Pyle
— Zhang Yinhuai

Thousands upon thousands of unnamed soldiers fall one after another on the battlefield, braving bullets and shedding hot blood, in exchange for victory after victory. Their war exploits, like the pyramids of Egypt, will forever be recorded in history, but their lives are like the rocks that make up the pyramids, or even like the grains of sand beside the pyramids, never to be mentioned by anyone.

Only Ernie Pyle, wearing a light brown war correspondent uniform full of wrinkles and oil stains, dragging his short and never-tiring body, followed the army from North Africa to Sicily, from Normandy to Okinawa, reporting to the whole world the joys and hardships of the daily lives of the small soldiers, and the bravery of killing enemies on the front line, in a cordial and moving way, so that they will always be imprinted in people's hearts.

Ernie Pyle and his dog

Ernie was a peace-loving man who hated war. But he also loved freedom more, and understood that this was a war that had to be fought hard for freedom. From this point of view, he was the person who understood the small soldiers the most. He ate the same rough and monotonous food as the soldiers, slept in the muddy trenches at night, and deeply experienced the joys and pains, bravery and cowardice of the small soldiers. With his sympathetic and moving tone, he wrote about the tense but ordinary combat life. Ernie was not a hero, so the protagonists in his writing were not legendary heroes, but ordinary people like you and me, with flesh and blood, with the desire to live and the fear of death - his sympathetic and compassionate tone finally shook the hearts of millions of people in the rear, and won the warm love of the nameless people who fought hard on the front line.

As for the generals' wars, Ernie left them to the reporters who wrote the number one headlines. Ernie's war was the kind of war that was different from the generals' war.

The famous American novelist John Steinbeck, author of "The Grapes of Wrath" and "The Moon Is Down", said: "There are two kinds of wars that do not interfere with each other. Terrain, strategy, firepower, rear service, troop movements, all that is the generals' war. Secondly, it is the war against homesickness, against fatigue, sarcasm, rudeness, and complaining about food - that is Ernie Pyle's war. He knew everything that people knew about these things, but he wrote better than anyone else."

Ernie was a humble, thrifty, and not very talkative person. His original name was Ernest Pyle. He was born in Indiana, USA, in 1900. He studied journalism at Indiana State University. After graduation, he worked in several newspapers. It was not until after the attack on Pearl Harbor that he leaped to become the most famous and most loved war correspondent in the United States. He often went in and out of the front lines. He traveled with the US military throughout North Africa, entered Sicily, crossed the sea and landed in Italy, and then returned to England to watch them bomb the Nazis and prepare to invade the mainland. In June 1944, he followed the army again, landed in Normandy, drove straight in, and marched into Paris.

In these three or four years, Ernie's daily war correspondence was opened as a special column for 366 newspapers in the United States, and 310 weekly magazines reprinted it. The total number of readers was more than 12,255,000. These correspondences were compiled and published into two collections: "Here Is Your War" and "Brave Men". The former sold 940,000 copies, and the latter sold 860,000 copies. Until now, these numbers are still increasing every moment.

In early 1945, he came to the Pacific with the Navy. He witnessed the capture of Okinawa Island on an aircraft carrier. He was always on the front lines. But misfortune began. On the morning of April 18, Ernie was hit by a Japanese machine gun bullet on the front line of Iwo Jima and was seriously injured. He died on the same day at 10:15 am.

Ernie died. He died on the front line, one mile away from the forward command post. Some unfinished drafts were still hidden in his baggage: "The Last Chapter". These chapters, sections, sentences, and words were all records exchanged for life, leaving a lasting and cordial statue for the tens of thousands of brave men who fought silently and died silently.

### Where is Youth?

— Xie Zi

Among the popular songs, there's one called "Where is Youth?" I have a fondness for this song. When listening to it, I can imagine the composer's state of mind. The lyrics are affirmative, but the melody is negative, and the singing even more so. The clumsy and forced lyrics are overshadowed by the melody and the voice, and what we hear is not an affirmative whole, but rather fragmented elegies of sorrow: the autumn wind, the autumn flowers, blowing gently, quietly withering, everything seems to be in autumn—a lingering and sorrowful autumn song! Youth has withered in the autumn wind and rain, leaving only a faint lingering fragrance in the damp, yellow-green fallen leaves.

I'm reminded of another picture I saw, an illustration for a short story titled "When Young." In the picture, there's a small tree, a tree of life, the sun shining on its leaves, shimmering with silver light. Next to the tree is a young girl,踮着脚, reaching forward, trying to reach the tree. She's wearing thin clothes, light and graceful. The dazzling sunlight and the morning mist intertwine—a symbol of youth full of hope. But when you read the story, the content is negating. After reading the story and looking at the illustration again, it feels like an elegy as well: a recollection of a lost youth.

So I think: a perfect youth is almost impossible to exist in the human heart. In any case, there's always some imperfection. If the waning moon and the fading flowers are a sorrowful thing, then a full moon and flourishing flowers can still be seen often. But a perfect and flawless youth is almost impossible to find, even with a lantern.

Perhaps, maybe it can be found in the hearts of those who are ignorant and carefree. However, without reflection and understanding, it can only be complete, not perfect. With reflection and understanding, even if it's still perfect, that perfection is just like the moon: in the moon, there are dark shadows called laurel trees.

These shadows sometimes obscure the radiance of youth, just like the sorrowful melody overshadows an affirmative lyrics, making it look a little confused.

Where is youth? Where is youth? It seems unnecessary to ask. We can see many twinkling and glittering stars of youth, but we will never see a perfect moon of youth without shadows.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 67

— Ye Jingfeng

"You two, are you students? Are you catching the train?" He pointed to the steamed buns on the table and said, "You're hungry. These buns aren't good to eat." He looked us up and down again and said, "Why don't you come inside? I'll make you something... It's really tough being away from home..."

She was looking us over, but we were looking her over too. I figured this woman loved to talk, so she couldn't be all that bad. I nodded and invited Brother Tiger to walk into the shop. The woman rushed forward to lift the curtain. Who knew there was no room inside, just a kitchen with a lot of clutter. After the woman let us into the room, she dropped the curtain, and the room suddenly darkened. She then walked in front of us and said, "This room doesn't have any daylight, so it's hard to see. Be careful not to bump into anything." We followed her around the big dirt stove, and suddenly our eyes lit up. It turned out she had opened the side door. This made me wonder how the house was built.

After exiting the side door, there was a small courtyard, and behind it were several bungalows. The woman let us into the bungalows, treating us like honored guests, greeting us warmly, her mouth full of polite words: "The house is small, not good enough to invite guests. It's narrow and poor here, not like the front." As she spoke, she called to the next room, "Sister Cui, we have guests! Come over and greet them."

"Is this a black inn?" I thought of the "Little Five Righteous Ones" and "Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes" stories I had read before.

After a while, Sister Cui came out, and I was shocked. Her face, demeanor, and dress were all like one of my classmates from Beijing.

"Eh!" I couldn't help but exclaim, "Did you study at ×× Middle School in Peiping?"

"Not ×× Middle School," Sister Cui smiled slightly, two red clouds rising on her face, "It's Chengxi Girls' Middle School, a missionary school."

"Oh!" I was reminiscing, "What's your name? Could it be..."

"My humble surname is Ji." She seemed a little dazed, as if she was also reminiscing, "I know... Mom..." She turned to the talkative mom and said, "Didn't our cousin study at ×× Middle School?"

"Look at this child," her mom said with a laugh, clapping her hands, "I haven't been to Beijing in years. Who remembers what middle school? You're talking about cousin, isn't that your third aunt's Xiaoyu?" She then said to me, "I'll go to the back for a while and come back later. Please talk." As she spoke, she walked into the back of the house.

"That's right," Sister Cui said to me again, "I have a cousin named Huang Yuhua, who is six or seven years older than me. She studied at ×× Middle School... She has the same face shape as me..." At this point, she glanced at Brother Tiger, and her face turned red again.

"That's right," I suddenly understood. Wasn't her cousin the classmate I was talking about? But I couldn't remember the three words Huang Yuhua. I only stayed there for more than half a year, and it's been three or four years since then, so of course I wouldn't remember. "Is she still studying?" I wanted to ask about her whereabouts.

"She hasn't been studying for a long time... Oh!" A look of misery and pity suddenly appeared on her face. "She's like us—poor now." She lowered her head and picked up a corner of her clothes.

### Panda

— Shaofu

"You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of a fish?"

"You are not me, how do you know I don't know the joy of a fish?"

I am certainly not you, and you are not me... thus arguing without conclusion. Today, the top animal in Shanghai is the panda. Everyone is keen to talk about it, but no matter what, even if we understand it to the fullest, we are still humans. Whether its death is tragic or not, it is all judged by human emotions or reason.

One fact is certain: its death was due to changes in its living environment. We already know that those in charge spared no expense for it, even airlifting wheat bran from Sichuan to make its feed.

It is certainly not an ordinary dog. People know too much about dogs (to the point where it is difficult to distinguish between humans and dogs), so people can play with dogs, or dogs can play with people, and both can live in peace and harmony. But it is a panda, a rare animal, difficult to serve, which is only natural.

No one knows how many pandas there are in Wenchuan, Sichuan, but everyone knows that there are so few that they are almost non-existent. So when one dies, there is naturally one less. It seems that this kind of animal does not appreciate favors. People are trying their best, even risking their lives, to go abroad for a "镀金", see the world, and then come back to praise from Truman's pants to the eyelashes of Hollywood actresses. But it either dies prematurely or is not blessed to live in peace (Miss United), is it not a lack of blessing?

### The Wise Man Dreams

— Binzhi

Although I am not a fool, I want to talk about dreams.

What is a dream? Most people are superstitious about dreams being omens. In ancient China, there was the saying "Bearing a bear or a羆, a sign of a son; bearing a viper or a snake, a sign of a daughter." But it always feels like far-fetched reasoning. Psychologist Freud wrote a book called "The Interpretation of Dreams," but his theory is also very strange, and many people always have doubts about his claims.

"You think by day, you dream by night" is indeed the cause of dreams. The flow of thoughts in the brain and the activity of nerve cells often cause dreams. For example, a student dreams of taking the exam in the examination hall a few days before the exam. Stimulation from the outside world during sleep can also cause dreams. Hearing the sound of an alarm clock can dream of hearing thunder, and touching something wet on the hand can dream of encountering rain. In psychology, the former is called "thought dream" and the latter is called "sense dream." Although sense dreams are caused by external stimuli, they are not unrelated to past experience, only less so than thought dreams.

The phenomena that occur in dreams are related to your past experiences to some extent. Sometimes the dreamscape feels very novel. This is not unrelated to your past experiences, only that the memory is insufficient. Or even if you have not personally experienced it, you at least have an imagination in your mind, and this imagination is also a kind of mental activity.

Random Thoughts

When you are awake during the day, you will not speak incoherently, nor will you act rashly, because of the constraints of the social environment, you will control yourself. Although you will sometimes have random thoughts, you will not reveal them to the outside world. This orderly rational behavior is called consciousness in psychology. When you sleep, everything in your body rests, but the activity of your brain nerves does not stop. Many thoughts and actions that are restricted during the day will then surge up layer by layer in your mind, because the activity of consciousness is stopped at this time, and nerve cells can move without restraint. Dreams are produced in this situation. Therefore, dreams can fully express each person's personality.

Why can dreams become omens? Someone dreams of being sick, and soon becomes sick. This is related to physiological changes in the body, because the occurrence of a disease often has a sign that is latent in the body beforehand. During the busy daytime, there is no time to carefully observe this latent symptom, but it will manifest itself during sleep. Many behaviors are also like this. There is a tendency for activity in the mind, but you have not felt it yourself, but it is activated during sleep.

Huangliang Dream Awakens

There is a legend called "Pillow in the Records," which tells the story of Lu Sheng meeting Lü Dongbin in an inn and borrowing Lü Xian's pillow to sleep. In his dream, he lived a life of half a lifetime of wealth and glory. When he woke up, Lü Xian's yellow millet rice was not yet cooked. The story says that the life of dozens of years in the dream did not even take the time to cook a meal. Is this not too unreasonable? No, the time in dreams is indeed very short. According to psychological research, a simple dream does not last more than a minute, and a complex dream only lasts two or three minutes. A five-minute dream is already very long. The time of dreaming is a few minutes before waking up from sleep.

When you wake up, can you completely remember the scenes in the dream? There is no such person in the world. Because the brain stops activity during sleep, it is not easy to firmly preserve the things encountered in the dream. In the early stages of waking up, you can remember a little, but it is only a very small part. Soon, what you remember will be quickly forgotten. Unless you are able to remember more clearly when you are in a hazy half-sleep state, but you will never remember everything.

### Pidgin Chinese

— Dinghao

A foreign gentleman lived in 毘明 and learned a few phrases of Pidgin Chinese, which he often showed off.

Once, one of his Chinese friends, who was a captain in the army, returned from the front line. The foreign gentleman held a banquet to welcome him.

When the wine was half-drunk, the foreign gentleman stood up and gave a speech in Chinese, saying: "Today, I am very happy, because my mistress, whom I haven't seen for a long time, has returned..." The guests burst into laughter, and the captain friend blushed. After inquiring, they learned that the foreign gentleman had translated Captain into "兵頭" (soldier head), and pronounced "兵頭" as "姘頭" (mistress), which made the captain friend feel embarrassed beyond words.

The foreign gentleman knew that drinking the wine dry was called "乾杯" (gan bei), and drinking at will was called "隨便" (suibian). So he picked up his wine glass and stood up, about to open his mouth, but he forgot the word "隨便", only remembering the character "便". After thinking hard for a moment, he suddenly remembered and loudly said to everyone: "Gentlemen, let us all excrete, excrete"!

After the wine was drunk and the meal was eaten, the foreign gentleman instructed the servant: "Bring me the pants I bought today." The servant brought a new pair of pants, and the foreign gentleman hurriedly waved his hand and said: "No, no! It's pants, to be put in a basin, it's pants"! After much insistence, they realized that the foreign gentleman wanted the fruit that was eaten after the meal!

### Eulogy for a Panda

— Suobei

On this, the eighteenth day of October, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, I respectfully offer three cups of American coffee to the soul of the late Miss Panda, saying:

Alas, poor Panda, just celebrating going abroad for "advanced studies," suddenly ascended to heaven due to a minor illness. When the news came, humans and beasts mourned together!

Is it because you would rather die for freedom than live without it? If it was because you were resentful and sick, and died to thank American goodwill, then from a human perspective, our Panda is a bit stubborn! Wealth and honor are like fleeting clouds, why sacrifice yourself for principle?

Alas, Panda, so sad, so painful. If you have a spirit in the afterlife, quickly borrow a corpse and return to life. Even if you don't answer the goodwill of the foreigners, you should think about the three unfilial acts! Soul, return quickly! Alas, the sound of mourning still echoes.

### Rickshaw Puller Appointed Senator

— Dunfu

The Senate is the only institution that represents public opinion, and senators represent the people of all walks of life. Just among the senators in this city: there are teachers, reporters, lawyers, accountants, doctors, and even female workers... It can be said to be "all-encompassing and all-inclusive." Recently, a friend came from Hangzhou and brought even more exciting news: one of the senators in Hangzhou is actually a "currently employed" rickshaw puller!

The name of the senator is Zhao Tingxiu, a native of Shaoxing, who makes a living by pulling a rickshaw. When he is wearing ragged clothes, pulling a rickshaw to solicit business on the street, who would have thought that he is actually a distinguished senator?

And this Mr. Zhao puts down the rickshaw handle and still wobbles to visit the governor and mayor, attends meetings, and is busy all the time. He is still wearing this set of dirty and old clothes, so he is always scolded by the gatekeepers when he visits dignitaries: "Get out!" When he slowly took out his business card, the gatekeeper saw the glaring title of "Hangzhou City Senator" and couldn't help but be stunned for a long time before letting him in.

An American reporter in Hangzhou discovered this matter and was overjoyed, hurrying to send a telegram back to his country to publicize it widely. The newspapers in Hangzhou also competed to publish photos of the senator.

My friend's words ended here. I deeply feel that this is not just a topic for after-dinner conversation, but indeed a good sign that China is implementing democracy. Because:

Senators are originally representatives of the people of all walks of life, and the working masses naturally also enjoy the same civil rights!

Auspicious Sign of Democracy

The man standing is a thirty-nine-year-old groom, Charles Bees. The old woman sitting on his left is a seventy-seven-year-old bride. She already has four children and twelve grandchildren (or granddaughters), but the old woman in her twilight years has remarried. It's really wonderful and interesting! According to herself, she met her husband two months ago. This is a "whirlwind" marriage.

### My Highest Goal in Life

Editor's Note: This journal published an article on August 22 entitled "Do you have the following desires?", which stated the highest goals in life: (1) Obtaining a huge amount of money; (2) Achieving fame in society and being respected by the masses; (3) Striving for the highest achievement in a certain career and becoming famous; (4) Hoping to live a simple, pure, pleasant and stable life, neither seeking fame nor fortune; (5) Serving society and enhancing the welfare of compatriots; (6) Don't know

Readers are deeply interested in this, and have expressed their thoughts on the above goals, mostly hoping to live a stable and simple life, while others say that the goal of life is simply unknown. Now, we will extract a part of the outlook on life of these people in turmoil:

### The Eternity of the Universe

— Du Qiuyuan

I think the highest goal in life is to live a simple, pleasant and stable life. Neither seeking fame nor fortune, quietly enjoying the reality of life, while appreciating the eternity of the universe.

From a biological point of view, humans are just one of the animals, like birds, beasts, insects and fish; they are just a kind of organism living on the earth's crust! They are neither born for fame and fortune, nor born for money, nor are they labeled as born for "work." To be honest, they are just seeking survival!

Exaggerated people forget the greatness of nature and the eternity of the universe; at the same time, they also forget their own insignificance.

### A Peaceful Country Life

— Shi Pei

Under the current circumstances, I am unwilling to step onto the political stage, because maybe I will be blinded by the temptation of money and become a corrupt official who is scolded and hated by the public. I am also unwilling to be in the forest of giant merchants, fearing that I may use clever means to take advantage of my superior position, secretly and unknowingly earn a large sum of money that violates my conscience, and then publicly donate a thousandth or a hundredth of it to exchange for a philanthropist's mask! I really hope to be a middle school or elementary school teacher in a small city or village, spending all day with those innocent and lovely children who have not yet experienced the world. I want to do my best to teach them, so that each of them will become good and useful citizens! I want to live in two neat rooms, taking a walk or fishing in the fields when I have free time, taking some money to maintain my life, reading my favorite books, writing what I want to say in my heart, not seeking fame or fortune, just living a simple, pure, happy and stable life peacefully!

### Simply Don't Know

— Jinghua

Which item is my highest goal in life? One, obtaining a huge amount of money:

I don't want to commit crimes for money, nor do I want others to commit crimes for my money, so I don't hope to obtain a huge amount of money!

Two, achieving fame in society and being respected by the masses:

I want to be a free person, so I don't hope to become famous in society either.

Three, striving for the highest achievement in a certain career and becoming famous:

A person who can achieve the highest achievement in a career and become famous is immortal, commendable, and enviable. However, for someone like me, who was not given any special talent at birth, and is in an environment where I "can't get enough to eat and can't starve to death," and wants to strive for the highest achievement in a career, this really makes me wonder where to start?

Four, hoping to live a simple, pure, pleasant and stable life, neither seeking fame nor fortune:

Regarding this item, a pleasant and stable life is what I need. Although fame and fortune are not what I seek, I am unwilling to give my entire life to simplicity and purity. I also believe that even if there is a series of simplicity and purity in my life, it will never produce happiness, so my goal is not this item either.

Five, serving society and enhancing the welfare of compatriots; when my conscience is discovered, I often think this way, and occasionally I will "become angry with righteousness" and do a few similar things. However, this conscience is momentary and will disappear in an instant, so I can only regard it as an episode in my life, not as my goal.

Six, don't know: Indeed, my answer can only be don't know. Times are changing, the environment is changing, who can grasp the future? It is so embarrassing to have hope and then turn into disappointment at that time. Then, it is better to just do it and see!

### The Only Ambition

— Gao Shuizhi

I am unwilling to belong to any faction, nor am I willing to belong to any party; I stand firmly on the position of "person" and seek peace and well-being for mankind!

I do not believe in any religion, nor do I worship any idols; based on the truth that "people should love people," I will devote this short life to it!

I have no ambition for power or desire for fame and fortune; "All people should obtain the peace and joy of life"

That is my only ambition—desire—belief!

### Four Objectives

— Because

What I hope for are four things: health, knowledge, art (music), and love. Other than that, I don't seek anything.
