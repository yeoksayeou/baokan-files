### Marshall and Others to Depart from Chongqing to Inspect the Ceasefire Situation; Communist Northeast Army Launches Another Offensive

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Sources recently arriving from the Northeast report: The Communist army within the Northeast actually numbers less than 20,000 men. They are mostly transferred from the Jehol and Chahar provinces. The so-called "local Eighth Route Army" is no more than 30,000 to 40,000 men, but the original puppet Manchukuo army, aided by foreign forces in joining the Communist army and calling themselves the "People's Army," numbers as many as 100,000. The "local Eighth Route Army" has inferior weapons, while more than half of the Communist army and the puppet army have acquired Japanese equipment. The puppet army under the command of the Communist army that first came into contact with the National Army's Du Yuming's forces, however, lacks fighting spirit. If there is no foreign support, they may disintegrate.

[United Press Chongqing, 24th] Marshall, Enlai, and Zhang Zhizhong, members of the Military Subcommittee of the Mediation Executive Headquarters, are scheduled to depart from Chongqing for the conflict zones in the next few days to conduct inspections, extending to various areas of North China. Accompanying them will be one Chinese special envoy and four American special envoys. Their first destination is Beiping.

[Associated Press Beiping, 24th] According to reliable sources here: U.S. Special Envoy Marshall plans to conduct large-scale inspections throughout China, and is scheduled to arrive here from Chongqing within a day or two. Marshall's trip will take him through Zhangjiakou, Yan'an, Shenyang, and various areas of North China to inspect the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. He will then proceed to Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, and return to Chongqing around March 9th. It is said that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai will accompany him.

[United Press Beiping, 24th] Local Chinese newspapers reported a Central News Agency dispatch stating that the Communist army in the Northeast has launched offensives "from all directions" with the aim of seizing Xinmin, 45 miles south of Shenyang, and severing the railway line connecting the National Army with that city. The dispatch stated that the Communist army simultaneously attacked six other cities in the Northeast. After two days and nights of attacking, the Communist army drove the National Army out of Xiushuihezi near Xinmin, but their offensive was repelled. The National Army then launched a counter-offensive, driving the Communist army back beyond Kangping and Faku. It is claimed that the Communist army deployed ten heavy artillery pieces and thirty field guns. It is also reported that the Communist army is attacking Panshan, Nanling, Tai'an, Liaozhong, Zhangwu, and other places, and is destroying transportation lines.

[Associated Press Chongqing, 24th] It is reported that the National Army in the Northeast is under attack by the Communist army in Zhangwu, 180 *li* northwest of Shenyang, and Faku, 150 *li* north of Shenyang. Minor conflicts are also reported north of Jin County.

[Reuters Chongqing, 24th] The Hebei Provincial Government received an urgent telegram from the Yongnian County government in southern Hebei Province stating: "We have been besieged by the Communist army for nearly six months. The entire city has become a city of hunger, with people dying of starvation every day. Residents are surviving only on grass roots and tree bark."

### Our Government Values Public Opinion; A Formal Statement Will Be Issued Regarding the Northeast Takeover; Supervisory Committee Proposes That We Not Be Bound by the Yalta Conference Decisions

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Chongqing News: The government is about to issue a formal statement regarding the Northeast takeover. It believes that the opinions expressed by people's organizations and public opinion organs in various places regarding the Northeast situation, as well as the marches and petitions organized by students in various places to express their views on national affairs, are a comprehensive test of the unified public opinion of the entire country after the victory, and cannot be ignored. The situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly clear.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] It is reported that Supervisory Committee members of the Control Yuan, Tian Mengjin, Wang Xianzhang, Ma Yaonan, Bai Rui, Li Zhengle, Jin Yufu, Wan Can, Yu Shude, etc., stated that the foreign ministers' meeting in Moscow last year by the US, UK and Soviet Union did not invite our country to participate, and after the meeting, a communique was issued involving our country's internal affairs. On the 11th of this month, Moscow, London, and Washington simultaneously announced the secret agreement signed by Luo, Qiu, and Shi at the Yalta Conference on February 11th last year. The stipulations made in its content cause our country's loss of territorial sovereignty to be even more significant than what Japan demanded during the "September 18th" Incident. This meeting did not invite our country to participate in advance, nor was our country informed in advance when the secret agreement was negotiated. Such measures are unacceptable to any independent country, and it is regrettable that they were imposed on an allied country. Although our countrymen should be sincerely grateful to all Allied nations for their assistance in resisting the enemy, no Allied nation has the right to use the fact that they helped us fight for independence and freedom as an excuse to deprive and infringe upon our country's independence and freedom. Looking at the current situation, we cannot afford to compromise or delay. Therefore, a proposal is submitted, requesting the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue a solemn statement immediately: "Our country will not be bound by any decisions made at any international conference in which our country did not participate, that may affect our country, and we will refuse to agree to and consider them, in order to correct public opinion and eliminate hidden dangers." After receiving the report, the Control Yuan has reviewed it and forwarded it to the Executive Yuan for implementation.

### Youth Party Opinions

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] The Chinese Youth Party issued an opinion on the Northeast issue, stating: The Northeast is Chinese territory, and all friendly nations must recognize this and respect China's territorial sovereignty and integrity in the Northeast. China's nationals absolutely do not recognize any agreements related to China that have not been agreed upon by China. China and the Soviet Union must strengthen mutual respect and understanding on the basis of the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. We should fully use diplomatic channels to resolve the outstanding issues between China and the Soviet Union in order to enhance the friendship between the two countries and ensure that peace in the Far East is effectively guaranteed. The internal affairs part of the Northeast issue must be separated from the diplomatic issues, and a reasonable solution should be sought in the spirit of coordination.

### Truth Revealed About the East Mongolia Issue; Requesting Autonomy from the Government; Delegation Arrives in Beiping to Meet Xiong Shihui for Discussions

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 23rd] After the Mongolian representatives arrived in Beiping, Xiong Shihui met with the seven members of the Mani Badala group at his private residence in the form of receiving an ordinary citizen, and hosted a banquet. According to well-informed sources, the authorities expressed suspicion about their ability to convene a people's congress with free will in the Soviet garrison area, and their ability to reach Changchun from Mongolia in a calm manner amidst the chaos. The authorities also stated that the implementation of autonomy is a unanimous demand of various regions in the country, and is clearly stated in the Prime Minister's legacy, but the degree should be consistent, and there is no distinction between high, medium, and low. As for supporting weak ethnic groups, none of our five ethnic groups is currently strong, and all are weak. We should unite closely and seek wealth and strength together. As for the autonomy demands made by the East Mongolia representatives, it is currently impossible to answer and resolve them, because the Soviet army has not yet withdrawn from these areas and allowed us to take over. The East Mongolia delegation originally planned to go to Chongqing, but whether they can make the trip depends on the situation in Beiping.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 23rd] The arrival of the East Mongolia representatives has confirmed that the East Mongolia issue is not as serious as previously reported, but the entire Inner Mongolia autonomy issue will be revived. The East Mongolia delegation, headed by Mani Badala, stated here that although the East Mongolia Autonomous Government has been established, the East Mongolia Autonomous Republic has not been established. Their purpose in coming south is to request autonomy from the government, and there is no intention to harm national unity. The East Mongolia Autonomous Government was organized to meet temporary needs. If the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue is resolved as a whole, the separate East Mongolia autonomous institutions can also be abolished. Their proposition has had a considerable impact on Mongolian people in the old capital. The Inner Mongolia autonomy, which was widely publicized in 1933, has almost become a topic of discussion among Mongolians again.

At 4:00 PM on the 23rd, more than 100 Mongolian expatriates in Beiping welcomed the East Mongolia delegation at the Lai Jin Yu Xuan in Central Park. Members of the Central Committee Bai Yunti, Member of the Legislative Yuan Wu Yunpeng, Director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's Beiping Office He Zhaolin, and Mongolian people in political circles also participated. The Chief Representative of the East Mongolia Delegation, Mani Badala, said in an impromptu speech that their autonomous institutions were established due to local needs in the midst of war and chaos. The Soviet side did not provide assistance or interfere. The Communist army is very close to the autonomous region, but did not enter the region or interfere in the affairs of the Mongolian banner. They support the Three People's Principles of supporting and assisting weak ethnic groups. Other doctrines are not followed by the Mongolian people. They hope that the central government will make a unified resolution on the Inner Mongolia issue based on the late Prime Minister's legacy of assisting weak ethnic groups. The reason why they established the East Mongolia Autonomous Government and represented East Mongolia's request for autonomy is not to split Inner Mongolia, but because they are eager to solve the problem that the Western Mongols are in deep water and have not been able to contact the Western Mongols due to traffic obstruction, and have not obtained the consent of the Western Mongols, so everything is only called East Mongolia. He described the birth of the East Mongolia autonomous institutions, saying that after August 15th, the army passed through, bandits rose up, and local order was not peaceful. The public security maintenance association was thus established. After the association was established, it immediately abolished all the harmful policies of the puppet Manchukuo, and suppressed bandits. Large numbers of bandits with more than 50 people can no longer gain a foothold. Soldiers and civil servants throughout the territory are working for the benefit and happiness of the whole, working diligently without pay and fulfilling their obligations. More than 10,000 students in secondary and higher schools are running in both areas, conveying news and assisting in the implementation of government orders, which is very meritorious. Speaking of the people's congress in the area, he said that many representatives of each banner came from remote areas and took more than a month to arrive. They often camped overnight in the wilderness of ice and snow. Mani Badala did not praise the discipline of the Soviet army, saying that there are nearly one million troops in the Soviet army, with few officers and many soldiers, making it difficult to restrain them, and military discipline is lax. As far as he knows, the property of the Mongolian people in Bintu Banner of Jerim League has been lost by a quarter. Later, when he arrived in Shenyang, he found that the losses in Bintu Banner were still minor. Therefore, the lives of Mongolian people today have become a big problem. Mani's Mongolian speech was elegant, meticulous, and inflammatory. In his closing remarks, he said that we in the remote East Mongolia miss you very much. Today, we can gather together with you and see so many pillars of outstanding youth. I am sincerely excited and sad, and I burst into tears at the end of my speech, and the whole audience was moved to tears. Before Mani's speech, Wang Ziyang, a representative of the Beiping Mongolian fellow villagers and a former member of the National Assembly, gave a welcome speech, also emphasizing autonomy as the unanimous demand of the Mongolian people.

### Using Radar to Explore Space; It Only Takes a Few Seconds to Travel Back and Forth Between Earth and Mars

[Associated Press Washington 23rd Dispatch] The Army Signal Corps engineers are now using radar to explore the solar system. They believe that controlling a space-free spacecraft with radar will allow them to fly in the space between planets and use electrons to explore the conditions on other planets. They first proved that ultra-high-frequency radio waves can pass through the ionosphere, which ordinary radio waves cannot pass through, by transmitting ultra-high-frequency radio waves to the moon. That is, the electrified area outside the Earth's atmosphere. They hope that the second experiment will use radar to contact one of the planets, possibly Mars. The speed of radar is 186,000 miles per second, and the round trip from Earth to Mars takes about six and a quarter minutes. The Signal Corps scientists first contacted the moon, which is 256,857 miles from Earth, on January 10 this year, and the round trip of radio waves took two and a half seconds.

Wang Jingwei's two daughters from his second wife took a night express train from Nanjing to Suzhou and rushed to the detention center on Sizhi Street at about 7:00 this morning to visit their mother, Chen Bi-jun. However, the head of the detention center refused their request on the grounds that he had been instructed that the three traitors Chen and others were not allowed to meet with anyone. Despite repeated pleading, it was not allowed. Helpless, the two daughters stood in front of the detention center, sobbing for a long time, and then turned back to the station to take the train away.

Nanchang

Expediting the Transportation of Jiangxi Grain to Supply Nanjing and Shanghai

This province was ordered by the Central Government in October of last year to purchase 2 million dan of rice and transport it to Nanjing and Shanghai. It is found that this province collects and purchases nearly 10 million shi dan every year. The actual physical objects left over from previous years amount to 3 million dan. However, the directors of the grain warehouses in various counties and the rice processing plants colluded with each other and embezzled everything. The 3 million zu numbers remaining in the provincial grain office have now been allocated to more than 20 counties such as Fengcheng in the lower reaches of the Gan River and Fu River. It was initially planned to deliver 1 million dan by the end of last year. However, due to soaring grain prices in various places, the number of purchases made by the people of each county on their own was less than 1% of what was expected. The Ministry of Food has specially dispatched Jianren Commissioner Li Jikua to the province to supervise and expedite the transportation, preparing to transport 200,000 zu of grain this month to supply Nanjing and Shanghai. In addition to establishing a transportation station in Jiujiang, 16 shallow-water boats have been allocated to Jiangxi to strengthen transportation work.

### An Ancient City Will Become the National Center; Lanzhou Greets Peace with Drumbeats

— This Newspaper's Flight Report, Chen Qian from Lanzhou

Youths Aspire to the Frontier, "China's Destiny"

If you say this is the frontier, then let me ask you: If Outer Mongolia had not become independent and Tibet had returned to our national territory, where would the center of the country be?

I can answer: Lanzhou. Of course, everyone knows that this place is different from the interior because of "inconvenient transportation and cultural isolation." This is an undeniable fact. However, during the War of Resistance, this small frontier town also did its best, not losing its local importance.

Speaking of which, it's a repetition of what was said before. It was the period when we fought alongside the Allies, especially in 1938 and 1939. Although the Soviet Union had not yet joined the holy war against aggression, it continued to supply us with weapons and dispatch military officers to China to assist us. So at this time, Lanzhou, the whole city, was also infected with the atmosphere of fire. To this day, the locals all say that on the second day of the first lunar month of 1939, our air force "gave the aggressors a beating" here and completed a glorious strategy. The enemy planes flew here from Yuncheng through the skies of Shaanxi, of course with their intentions, but we were also well prepared, giving them a head-on blow. Under the superb skills of our anti-aircraft gunners, nine planes were shot down in one day.

Pulling a Cartload of Banknotes, You Can Walk Slowly on the Street

Two days later, on the fifth day of the first lunar month, six more planes were shot down. Everyone said it was a joyful year. Perhaps it was a gift from the Japanese invaders. Now, some of the spoils of war are still on display in the National Defense Exhibition Room of the Public Education Center, stained with blood. When visitors see them, they all have a slight smile of victory on their faces.

General Zhu Yimin and Mr. Gu Zhenglun served here as the military and administrative chiefs respectively. General Zhu Yimin has been stationed here for many years. Under the combination of firmness and gentleness, he gets along well with the two chairmen of the neighboring provinces, Ma Hongda and Ma Bufang. Perhaps it is because there are so many Muslims with the surname Ma that they get along better with General Zhu. As for Mr. Gu, everyone knows that he was once the commander of the Military Police. Don't think he is already a little old. In fact, as chairman and commander of security, he is known as "the gate of the city of opium." Now, it is a place where the suppression of opium is very strict. Here, you can safely pull a cartload of banknotes and walk slowly on the street.

The Ice Season at the Bridge; Donkey Carts and Wheeltracks Never Cease

The Yellow River Iron Bridge is one of the three major iron bridges in the country. It is the essential road for highway traffic to Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia. Pedestrians on the bridge can see the scenery on the north and south banks, as if they have entered a strange realm. When the waves hit the bridge stones, there is a rustling sound, like being on a boat. But now you can't hear the sound of the water, and people can walk under the bridge, because the river has frozen. Every year at this time, the sounds of donkey carts and wheels never cease in the heart of the river. Not only do laborers get a convenient path, but fashionable young men and women also bring ice skates here to enjoy their youthful pleasure - a natural ice rink. However, after the beginning of spring, the river ice will soon melt. The security authorities have banned pedestrians, and the Yellow River will roar again. When the water flows, you can't see the shadows of boats, only those primitive sheep and cow skins split into rafts, flowing down the river, and the artistic conception of "Fisherman's Song" emerges more naturally.

Special Buildings; Called "Three Small and Three Big"

The architecture here is very special. There are city gates, and there is another pass, but the pass is bigger than the city, so Lanzhou is called the "Three Small and Three Big." That is, the city is small and the pass is big, the car is small and the wheel is big, the house is small and the pit is big. There is a Wowo Bridge in Xiguan, (握橋), which is a wooden bridge. It is truly an old building of "long bridge lying on the waves." The new-style buildings include the Martyrs' Shrine, (established with the support of Chairman Gu,) modeled after the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, and constructed very well. There is also the Northwest Building, (initiated by Director He of the former Northwest Highway Bureau,) for the purpose of entertaining Chinese and foreign dignitaries. The Nine-Room Building (Chairman's official residence), the Museum of Products (built by the city government), and the rest are mostly private villas, concentrated in Dashanlin New Village, which are relatively crude, but much better than the mountain cave dwellings (the homes of the poor). In terms of traces, most of them are administrative organs or military offices, which cannot be "looked at closely," so they cannot be "talked about in detail."

This is a summer resort, with good cantaloupe and a good climate. Fat people can sweat less here, and thin people can get stronger. When the autumn wind rises, eating a bowl of mutton soup steamed bun will definitely increase your heat. In winter, frozen soft pears and fresh lilies are fine snacks to enjoy around the stove. Speaking of spring, peaches bloom all over the land in March. There is the most spring scenery in the suburbs ten miles away, and going out to enjoy the flowers is all for the sake of the peach blossoms. This is as lively as the people of Shanghai vying to see the peach blossoms in Longhua.

Watching Peach Blossoms in the Spring Suburbs

Wildly Beating the Peace Drum on New Year's Day

Now spring has arrived again, and who are the peach blossoms blooming for? You take a car, I walk, you for the flowers, I also for the flowers.

During the Lunar New Year, this place is extremely "lively." The first thing that strongly expresses the local color is the "Shehuo," among which the "Taiping Drum" is the most brilliant. Each Shehuo has a dozen drummers, playing very loud drums, and everyone is moved by this Taiping Drum. For eight years of the War of Resistance, it has been playing every year, and this year it is still continuing to play. Play on! Play louder. - Hoping to beat out true peace.

If you say Shanghai is a "dynamic" city, then I say Lanzhou is a "quiet" city. She is as quiet as a virgin, standing gracefully, why doesn't everyone feel compassion for her "loyalty"? I call for her. I share Mr. Chiang's sentence in "China's Destiny" that "youths aspire to the frontier," especially since this frontier is also the center of the country? (In the sound of the Taiping Drum during the Lantern Festival).

### Our Protest Against the Yalta Secret Agreement

On February 11, 1946, Washington, London, and Moscow simultaneously announced the secret agreement reached on the same day of the previous year at the Yalta Conference by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. This included recognizing the independence of Outer Mongolia, joint Sino-Soviet management of the Middle Eastern and Southern Manchurian railways, and leasing the ports of Dalian and Lushun, as the price for the Soviet Union declaring war on Japan three months after Germany's surrender. China, in the war against aggression, had the longest period of resistance and suffered the most damage. Unexpectedly, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain concluded such a secret agreement, infringing upon the territorial sovereignty of their ally, China, and violating the solemn promise of respecting China's territorial sovereignty from the Washington Nine-Power Treaty to the Cairo Conference. This secret agreement violated the ideal and goal of the United Nations' joint combat, created a bad precedent for power politics and secret diplomacy in the future, and its impact was sufficient to undermine world peace in the future, repeating the sins of humanity. This secret agreement is truly the most unethical record in modern diplomatic history.

The Yalta Conference was convened after China's defeats in the Central Plains and Xiang-Gui campaigns, and before the success of the atomic bomb. Roosevelt, under the pressure of fighting on two fronts, was eager to ask the Soviet Union to declare war on Japan. We can understand his situation. However, disregarding morality and violating his conscience, he agreed to the Soviet Union's demands and infringed upon China's territorial sovereignty, which is absolutely unforgivable. Roosevelt and the United States he led originally occupied an extremely friendly position in the hearts of the Chinese people, but this position has been greatly damaged by the Yalta Secret Agreement. We absolutely cannot pardon his faults and responsibilities this time because of Roosevelt's contributions to the entire war and his past concern and assistance to China.

Since the September 18th Incident, Britain has always lacked fair and effective assistance to China's resistance against Japan, and even once blockaded China's only international transportation route in order to seek compromise with Japan. This attitude has long been unfair. Before the Yalta Conference, Churchill deliberately exaggerated Britain's aid to China. He despised China's contribution to this war and the position it should occupy. At the Yalta Conference, he clearly betrayed his ally China for Britain, which is a completely dishonorable act.

The Soviet Union's demands at the Yalta Conference completely violated the purpose of jointly fighting against aggressive fascist countries. It violated the new foundation of Sino-Soviet friendship jointly built by Mr. Lenin and Mr. Sun Yat-sen. It violated the Soviet Union's many foreign declarations, especially the declaration to China that it would abandon the unequal treaties of the Tsarist era. It violated the spirit of various important documents since the Atlantic Charter. What the Soviet Union advocates is to overthrow imperialism, so how can the Soviet Union's demand today to restore its "rights of the Russian Empire" explain itself? The Soviet Union took advantage of others' difficulties to make such demands, how is this different from Tsarist Russia's behavior towards China? This kind of behavior will inevitably create factors for future wars in the world. For China and for the world, we have to raise a severe protest.

We believe that this Yalta Secret Agreement is the most unethical and dishonorable document in this war; it nullifies the sanctity of the Allied countries' participation in the war against aggression. The United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain should, in accordance with the spirit of the Cairo Declaration and the Moscow Four-Power Declaration, bravely and frankly admit the mistakes the three countries have committed against China. The Soviet Union should especially voluntarily abandon its Tsarist-era policies in order to demonstrate the international justice it has always advocated. The Chinese government should make this issue and the recent shocking developments in the Northeast fully public; demand a United Nations investigation to prevent any similar secret diplomacy in the future, and to avoid the Northeast from becoming a factor in another world war. Regarding the current situation, the Chinese government, except under the condition that the Soviet Union equally fulfills its treaty obligations, shall not have any behavior that loses national sovereignty and interests in fulfilling its obligations under the Sino-Soviet Treaty it has signed. We hope that the whole country, regardless of party affiliation, will unite as one, supervise the government, urge the government to strive for China's equal status in the international community, and the integrity of its sovereignty, territory, and administration.

### My Humble Opinion on Salt Administration Reform (Continued)

— Xu Erxin

As the purchase, transportation, and sales are exclusively managed by the National Salt Corporation, the salt administration authorities naturally hold a position of supervision and guidance over all business activities of the company. However, the salt administration authorities also have their own responsible matters that urgently need to be addressed to facilitate the company's operations and achieve success. The important ones are as follows:

Organizing Field Production

The foundation of salt administration should be the organization of field production. Regardless of whether a field tax system or a monopoly system is adopted, effective, strict, and efficient management of the salt fields is necessary to prevent leakage of production from private fields. The items for organizing field production are: (1) Salt households and stoves must all be registered. All salt pans, wells, and production methods and tools must be clearly investigated. Production is only allowed after approval and permission. (2) Carry out road construction and river dredging projects in salt-producing areas to facilitate the transportation of salt to warehouses. (3) Register the boats and vehicles used to transport salt to the warehouses. (4) Seal off and abolish scattered fields with low salt production, weak brine, and high costs. (5) Appropriately merge field areas where the situation has changed or management is inconvenient. (6) Promote and improve production methods, and establish model salt production fields. (7) Keep detailed records of the weather in production areas. (8) Compile household registers and establish Baojia for salt households and stoves. (9) Inspect production. (10) Inspect salt quality.

Building Warehouses

Warehouses must be uniformly built in each salt field, and the amount and volume should be determined based on production volume and transportation conditions. Centralized construction should be the principle, but should be built in sections based on the field production situation (Fujian fields have no salt ditches and can only be built on mounds). This is to facilitate salt households to store the produced salt in warehouses. The original privately built warehouses should be purchased or leased by the government at a given price. Large-scale official warehouses should also be built in important transportation hubs and sales gathering places in various provinces, such as Hankou Xindi on the Hubei side, Yueyang Changsha Hengyang on the Hunan side, Jiujiang Hukou on the west bank, and Wuhu Datong on the Anhui side, which have already been planned for construction. If there was damage during the Anti-Japanese War, it should be repaired urgently. Other provinces should also select locations and build them as soon as possible. The salt stored in these salt warehouses is mostly transferred to various places for distribution and sale, such as the transfer warehouses in the Song Dynasty. At least one to several storage warehouses should be built in each county and city in the sales area, and the capacity should be sufficient to cover local sales for at least three to six months. A portion of it should also include the nature of the Ever-Normal Granary to be stored regularly for years of poor production, water shortages, temporary insufficient supply, or days of war and disaster, for preparation. (According to the Song Dynasty Yuanfeng era, remote areas had to prepare for two or three years, the next remote one to two years, and the nearest half a year and a year, called reserve salt. During the Shaosheng era, the old system was used, with extensive preparation, and the transportation envoy was responsible for transportation, even to the amount of the Yuanfeng preparation. It can be seen that the accumulation of warehouse salt in various places was already valued in the Song Dynasty.) When the construction of warehouses is complete, smuggling can be prevented in terms of field production, and supply and demand can be adjusted and prices balanced in the sales area. The wholesalers of the intermediary exploitation class will have no room for existence, and private hoarding will have nothing to sell. (To be continued)

1.  To submit a list of candidates for the positions of President, Vice President, and heads of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan to the National Assembly (Right of tentative selection).

However, in cases of declaration of war, peace negotiations, and martial law, or bills that the Legislative Yuan deems to be of an emergency nature, the President may also execute them directly after the deliberation of the Executive Council, or promulgate them directly after the deliberation of the Legislative Yuan, with the responsibility still to be resolved by the National Representatives Council by requesting the National Assembly to resolve it.

(23) When the National Representatives Council submits the proposals for appointment and dismissal in the first and second paragraphs of the preceding article, or the requests in paragraphs 6 to 8 of the first paragraph of the same article to the National Assembly, it shall attach a detailed statement of reasons and the relevant Yuan's defense statement.

The above proposals may also be submitted during the adjournment of the National Representatives Council; however, when the Legislative Yuan deems that it is a resolution of an emergency nature, the National Representatives Council shall immediately convene an extraordinary session to be reviewed.

Comparing the above design with the original text of the May 5th Draft Constitution, it has many characteristics, which are described separately below:

1.  The powers of the National Representatives Council and the National Assembly specified in this design are strictly limited to the scope of the four powers of government and have their own boundaries, so there is no abuse of confusion.
2.  The number of National Representatives specified in the draft constitution is at most about 3,000. In this design, the number of councilors in each county and city is calculated at 50 people per group, so there should be at least 100,000 people. It is more "democratic" for more than 100,000 people to decide on national policies than a gathering of 3,000 people.
3.  The councilors of each county and city already have a concrete collegiate organization, so although the number of voters is large, they will not be uncoordinated and overly scattered; and before each voting case, the council may conduct public discussions on the reasons for both sides, so the possibility of secret activities is less likely to occur.
4.  Tangible systems are easily manipulated and used by ambitious people. In this design, the various powers of approval are not in the tangible National Representatives Council, and even the right to elect is divided into two parts. Since the right to vote is dispersed throughout the country, such abuses will be greatly reduced.
5.  The number of National Representatives in the Council is suitable for gathering and discussion, so it is easier than the 3,000 people in the draft.
6.  National Representatives are temporarily elected by the councils of each county and city, which can avoid the trouble and expense of direct elections, and have the convenience of launching a recall of representatives at any time. The National Representatives each have a permanent agency to supervise them, so they will not act recklessly and unjustly.
7.  The National Representatives Council meets twice a year, and the session can be freely extended, and half of its members are re-elected each year, which is enough to establish a close supervisory relationship between the Council and the central government, so that they will not be isolated from each other.
8.  The National Representatives Council is an auxiliary body of the National Assembly, not a body that generally exercises administrative power. The final decision-making power for all major cases still rests with the Assembly itself; therefore, National Representatives cannot abuse their power and act arbitrarily, like members of ordinary representative bodies.
9.  Although the National Representatives Council has the power to supervise or control the central government, it has no power to directly command appointments and dismissals. Each Yuan may still express protests against the Council's deliberations. Therefore, it is fundamentally different from the existing National Defense Supreme Council and the past Central Political Council, and there is no danger of merging the five powers and forming a supreme government.
10. The National Representatives Council is also responsible to the National Assembly, and if its proposals are not accepted by the Assembly, it must be dissolved and reorganized; therefore, the Council must uphold justice and will not lightly initiate incidents that endanger itself.
11. Disputes between the five powers of government in their operation are difficult to avoid. The President specified in the draft may convene a meeting of the heads of the five Yuan for consultation (Article 45), which is not a fixed body with decision-making power; and the method of establishing a special permanent agency has the danger of forming a supreme government, so it is difficult to implement. The establishment of the National Representatives Council in this design has the advantages of a permanent agency, but without its shortcomings.

The principles for amending the draft constitution determined by the Political Consultative Conference, on the one hand, make the National Assembly an intangible organization, and on the other hand, make the Legislative and Control Yuan similar to a bicameral parliament, and order the Executive Yuan to be responsible to the Legislative Yuan. This is a contradiction with the theory of the five-power constitution. If the above design is adopted, the central political system should still be based on the draft constitution and be studied.

### Enemy and Puppet Regime Forcibly Seized Civilian Land; Citizens Can Request Return from Authorities

During the period when the enemy and puppet regime occupied this city, in order to construct airfields and other military facilities, the enemy forcibly seized over 100,000 acres of civilian land in the suburbs of this city, such as Jiangwan, Wusong, Hongqiao, and Dachang. Furthermore, all houses within the designated areas were required to be demolished without any compensation. The victimized farmers were forced to endure this under the tyrannical power at the time, with no avenue for appeal. It is now learned that the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, in order to protect the rights and interests of the people, has stipulated that all lands forcibly seized by the enemy should be returned if their actual usage value is not required.

As of yesterday, it was not yet completely certain whether the second round of subsidized cooking oil could be sold within the next few days. According to sources from the Grain, Oil, Bean, and Cake Trade Association, the repeated delays in the sale are due to various difficulties encountered during the collection of goods, which hindered the sales date. Currently, the collection procedures have been largely completed. If no further accidents occur in these procedures today, then sales may begin as soon as tomorrow. The total amount of cooking oil for this subsidized sale is 4,400 piculs (市担), distributed among 120 businesses, with the following prices: soybean oil at 330 yuan, raw oil at 310 yuan, rapeseed oil at 300 yuan, and sesame oil at 280 yuan.

### Blood Under the Wheels

Vehicle Accidents Occur in Nanshi and Hongkou

[Our Newspaper] Li Guoqiang, a merchant residing at No. 161 Shangwen Lane, Xiaoximen, Nanshi, was walking along Penglai Road at around 7 p.m. yesterday when he was suddenly struck by an American Jeep (license plate number 4126), crushing his eyes and face. He was subsequently taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment in an ambulance by American military police.

At the intersection of Broadway and Yuanfang Road in Hongkou, at 3:15 p.m. yesterday, an army truck carrying rice passed through the area when Tian Qin Haiyun was hit by Tram No. 99, causing severe chest injuries. Local police arrived and detained the person responsible for the accident for interrogation at the precinct station. The injured person was sent to the hospital.

### Nanshi Police Fight Against Robbers

[Our Newspaper] At around 10 p.m. last night, four robbers broke into the home of Liu Wenxue (brick and tile business), a local resident at No. 104 Fengji Wharf, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Three of the robbers were armed. They were about to steal a gold bracelet, a gold ring, a Parker fountain pen, and 25,000 yuan in legal currency when, fortunately, the nearby Dongjiadu Police Station had received a report and dispatched police to surround and arrest them. The robbers immediately fired three shots to resist arrest, and the police officers returned fire with four or five shots. As a result, one robber was shot in the leg and fell to the ground, while the remaining robbers managed to escape.

### Large Quantity of Railway Equipment Arrives in This City for Centralized Distribution; Two Thousand Passenger Cars En Route to China

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has already shipped more than 60 locomotives and 700 freight cars to our country. A portion has been unloaded in Kowloon, while the remainder is being concentrated in this city for centralized distribution by the Ministry of Communications. It is also learned that over 2,000 passenger cars are en route to China. In addition, a large quantity of steel rails and railway materials will also be successively shipped. Once this batch of materials arrives, the transportation situation and railway conditions in our country should be rapidly improved. According to estimates from relevant parties, 1.4 million metric tons of transportation equipment need to be imported from abroad to repair the major transportation lines within the country. However, based on the extent of the damage caused by the enemy, even this number cannot restore conditions to pre-war standards, which shows the severe damage suffered by China's transportation infrastructure during the war.

### Robbery at Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory; Stolen Goods Fenced in Hotel; Recognized and Large Quantity of Cloth Recovered; Multiple People Arrested

[Our Newspaper] At around 6:30 p.m. on the 13th of this month, four bandits, one armed, entered the warehouse of the Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 537 South Suzhou Road. They first tied up the warehouse guards, Xu Yuankui, Zhao Xiasheng, and Zhu Ruhuan, with hemp ropes, pushed them onto the bed in the bedroom, and locked the door. Then, they parked a previously hired rubber-wheeled cart at the entrance of the warehouse, looted 125 bolts of Chang Le brand An An blue cloth from the factory, loaded them onto the cart, and fled with the stolen goods towards Beijing Road and Shanxi Road. After Zhu Ruhuan and the others struggled free from their ropes, they reported the situation to the factory's distribution office at No. 10, Lane 284, Ningbo Road. The loss report was then filed, and the Municipal Police Bureau was notified, which ordered the Huangpu Branch to conduct a strict investigation and solve the case within ten days. After accepting the assignment, the Huangpu Branch Chief instructed the Judicial Section to handle the matter. A tip was received the day before yesterday that a large batch of cloth was being traded at No. 309, Andong Hotel, Daxin Street, Hubei Road. The head of the Judicial Section, Zhou Guanghui, led police officers to the scene and arrested a suspect, Chen Junfeng, a Shandong native, who admitted that his friend Sun Guangda (resident of No. 111, Xinmatou, Nanshi) had asked him to sell the cloth on his behalf. They then went to arrest Sun, who confessed that his younger brother, Si Lin, (resident of No. 72, Fuxin Lane, Fukang Road, Xinzha Road) had brought it to him and asked him to sell it. They then went to the address and arrested him as well. Under interrogation, they confessed that the cloth was stolen from the Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory. He said that he had initiated the plan and discussed it with accomplices Nie Renjie and others. They had opened a room at No. 58, Heming Hotel, Qinghe Lane, and some of the cloth was hidden at the home of Xia Jinlong at No. 137, Xinmatou. Several accomplices were hiding in shacks in the Yangjiadu area of Pudong. At 4:30 a.m. yesterday, patrol officers Yao Hongzhang, police chiefs Chuan Lianfeng, and police officers Shi Debiao and Dong Haishen went to the above-mentioned locations and arrested the bandits Zhu Changxing, Hao Zhuhai, Nie Renjie, and Li Buji, and found a pistol, three bullets, part of the stolen goods, and stolen money at the home of Mao A Jin. All were taken to the precinct for investigation and then transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution.

### Telecommunications Labor Strike Reaches Stalemate

Still Unresolved as of Last Night

The labor strike at the Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Bureau and International Radio Station continued until last night without any improvement. It is reported that the Bureau and Station sympathize greatly with the difficult living conditions of all employees. However, due to financial constraints, they were unable to fully meet the employees' demands. The employees, however, insisted on treatment equal to that of the Four Banks and One Bureau and were unwilling to return to work. Therefore, the measures previously drafted by the Bureau and Station authorities by the employee representatives were still not accepted. According to the latest news, Director Yu, Deputy Director Lu, and Chief Engineer Lu still convened the heads of various departments at the Bureau at 7:00 p.m. last night and sincerely tried to resolve the issue, persuading employees to consider the importance of telecommunications and not to persist in their demands in order to break the stalemate. Unfortunately, due to the economic constraints of the Bureau and the persistence of the employees' demands, little progress was made.

Eleven Western-style restaurants and cafes went on strike last Saturday afternoon, presenting six demands, and the two sides have been unable to reach an agreement. This morning, the Guangming Cafe, Shanghai Western Restaurant, and Sevina also joined the strike.

The employees of the Great New Company also made demands because their adjusted wages were still insufficient to support their families, demanding a minimum salary of 116,000 yuan, and setting a deadline for the company to respond today.

Over two thousand stevedores loading and unloading cargo from Hongkou Shuntai Wharf to Yangshupu previously went on strike. The foremen have now agreed to adjust the monthly salary to 1,800 yuan, so they have returned to work. Unresolved matters will be discussed again next month.

Knitting Mill Female Workers' Strike

However, democratic autonomy cannot forget the people's lives. Democracy must begin at the local level. The establishment of our Local Autonomy Advancement Association is to engage in local autonomy in a down-to-earth manner in order to realize autonomy and improve the lives of the people. Subsequently, the initiators reported on the association's initiation process, and stated that the foundation of Shanghai's local autonomy work has been destroyed by the enemy, and today it is still at the beginning.

### Overseas Prices Increase - Imbalance in Supply and Demand of Metals - New and Old Steel Mills Have Not Yet Quoted Prices

[Report from our newspaper] In recent days, overseas metal prices have increased by 10-20% compared to last week. However, the official products from new and old steel mills have not yet received permission from the authorities, so no market prices have been reported. It is said that goods related to military supplies are still under control and cannot be shipped to China without a permit. Due to increased overseas prices and rampant black market exchange rates, the prices in this port have soared uncontrollably. Coupled with the small number of overseas arrivals, the imbalance between supply and demand makes it difficult to expect prices to fall in the short term. The latest overseas metal prices are listed below:

### Grain Administration Authorities to Conduct Grain Merchant Registration Starting Tomorrow

In order to understand the various grain industries, the Grain Administration Special Envoy's Office has specifically decided to conduct grain merchant registration from tomorrow until the 10th of next month.

### World's Four Major Grain-Producing Countries - This Year's Reserves Decreased

[Reuters, Washington, February 24] The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that the world's largest grain exporting countries have the lowest reserves this year since 1940. Wheat reserves are 25% lower than at the beginning of last year. The total wheat supply of the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Australia is only 1,392,000,000 bushels, while at the beginning of 1945, it was 1,868,000,000 bushels. The surplus available for export is approximately between 475,000,000 and 500,000,000 bushels, which is far less than the import needs of various countries around the world. This year's rye supply in the four countries is also 15,000,000 bushels less than last year. Argentina may have a small surplus for export, but the other three countries have no hope of exporting. This year's barley supply is approximately 352,000,000 bushels, while at the beginning of last year, it was 394,000,000 bushels. This year's oat production is higher, but the amount available for export is also extremely small. Rice production totaled 202,000,000 bushels, while last year it was 2,311,000,000 bushels, with the largest decrease in production coming from the United States.

### Speculators Use Rumors - Silk Prices Soared Last Week

Last week, the silk market saw speculative traders exploiting unfounded rumors, leading retail investors to blindly follow suit, resulting in new record high prices. Artificial silk initially showed a downward trend at the beginning of the week, with the price of "Ying San Zhi Yi Er Ling" (迎三止一二〇) spot goods falling by 200,000 yuan in three days. Unexpectedly, starting on Thursday, stimulated by some kind of news, it suddenly rebounded, rising by a staggering 500,000 yuan in one day. Until Saturday, when trading in warehouse receipts was prohibited, causing panic, the market price began to stabilize. As a result, it rose by 400,000 yuan in one week. Warehouse receipts traded until Friday, with a total increase of over 400,000 yuan in five days. Last week, there was not much trading by factory owners and foreign firms. Factory sales had slightly improved. Prices for various grades increased by approximately 120,000 to 250,000 yuan. Heavy silks were initially weak but became active again starting on Thursday. Compared to Monday, Mei Ya bedding was 200,000 yuan higher, Da Cheng checkered crepe was 630 yuan higher, Minsheng brocade was 1,000 yuan higher, and Lin Ji waxed gauze was 250 yuan higher. Yesterday, Mei Ya bedding was trading at 1,320,000 yuan, and Da Cheng checkered crepe was trading at 4,700 yuan, both approximately 5% lower than on Saturday. Hong Kang black and white crepe was trading at 6,000 yuan per yard, and Minsheng brocade was trading at 18,000 yuan.

### Prices of All Grades of Cotton Yarn Reached New Highs Last Week

Spot yarn prices increased last week due to the surging black market price of gold and reports of some yarn mills reducing production. Furthermore, customer demand for fine yarn was strong, leading to a severe shortage of supply in the market, with demand exceeding supply. The price increase was particularly intense on Friday, with all grades of yarn reaching unprecedented highs. On Saturday, due to the excessively large increase in prices over the previous days, some bulls took profits, causing the market to slightly retreat. The week ultimately closed higher, with the highest price being 3,500,000 yuan for 60-count Sunlight yarn on Friday and the lowest being 550,000 yuan for 10-count Tongxin yarn on Monday, a difference of 2,950,000 yuan. In terms of smaller count yarns, 60-count Sunlight fine yarn increased by 50,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend, while 42-count and 32-count Blue Phoenix each surged by 450,000 yuan, 40-count Blue Phoenix increased by 350,000 yuan, 20-count Special Double Horse increased by 240,000 yuan, 16-count Guangming increased by 190,000 yuan, and 10-count Tongxin increased by 70,000 yuan. The cloth market also thrived, with chick Shilin and Four Gentlemen drill each increasing by 6,000 yuan, Yi Ding Ruyi bleached cloth increasing by 3,000 yuan, An An blue cloth increasing by 5,000 yuan, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth increasing by 2,000 yuan, and 16-pound coarse cloth increasing by approximately 3-4,000 yuan. The Hua Shi cotton market was most active with purchases from the Fang Jian Company. In addition, the demand from private yarn mills was ordinary. Charter mills were up 12,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday, Da Zhongji was up 5,000 yuan, Sanyu Town was up 8,000 yuan, Taicang cotton was up 5,000 yuan, Huoji cotton was up 5,000 yuan, and Zhoupu seed cotton was up 5,500 yuan.

### Reason for Delayed Check Clearing House Hours

According to Mr. Qi of the Shanghai Check Clearing House, the check clearing time for banks and money shops was 3:30 PM before the war. The time was moved earlier several times after Shanghai fell into enemy hands. The Check Clearing House recently delayed the clearing time to 3:30 PM purely because, after the liberation of Shanghai, financial operations have gradually returned to normal. The pre-war clearing time was restored to allow banks and money shops to clear all receipts and payments on the same day. Some people believe that this is to promote the use of checks, hoping to reduce issuance, and others say that delaying clearing can promote speculation, but this is not the case.

### Number of Spindles Operating in Recovered Yarn Factories

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, February 24] According to announcements, the China Textile Construction Corporation has taken over yarn factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places. The number of spindles in operation is as follows: 19 factories in Shanghai, 900,000 spindles; 7 factories in Tianjin, 400,000 spindles; 9 factories in Qingdao, 370,000 spindles; 3 factories in Jinan, over 10,000 spindles; 1 factory in Shijiazhuang, 50,000 spindles. In addition, it is estimated that there are approximately 400,000 spindles in the Northeast.

### Prices Rise in All Regions

[Central News Agency, Hankou, February 23] Prices in this area have recently fluctuated dramatically. In the past five days, the price of gold has risen from 140,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan per tael, and the price of rice has risen from 20,000 yuan to 36,000 yuan per shi, with a continued upward trend.

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, February 23] Prices in Hangzhou have risen sharply, with white rice costing 28,000 yuan per dan and gold costing 208,000 yuan per tael. The prices of other daily necessities have also doubled, putting public servants and ordinary people in extreme hardship.

[Tianjin News] Due to the long-term uncertainty of exchange rates, international traders are hesitant to observe. Although navigation between Tianjin and Shanghai is open, cargo space for transporting goods from north to south is congested, and it is difficult to secure space without special connections. Therefore, idle funds are flowing into speculation, and the prices of gold, U.S. dollars, and securities are rising, similar to the situation in Shanghai. Foreign merchants in Tianjin hope to load Tianjin bristles and transport them to Shanghai to await shipment. The sale of hides is smooth. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has taken over the North China Electric Power Company. Following an order from the Executive Yuan, electricity prices will be increased by a factor of five starting on the 15th of this month, effectively quintupling the original price.

Attendees enthusiastically supported this suggestion.

### Existing Elementary School in Changqiao Town

Local Residents Request Protection

[Report from our newspaper in this city] There was originally a public full elementary school in Changqiao Town, Longhua District. After the victory, as the area belonged to the urban area, the Municipal Education Bureau sent personnel to take over and resume classes. With the cooperation of the administrative authorities and local residents, the school achieved remarkable results, with enrollment reaching more than 400 students. Recently, it was heard that someone had suggested to the Education Bureau that the school be converted into a girls' middle school. Local residents Pei Yongchao, Pan Xiaoxin, and more than 50 others believe that the establishment of a girls' middle school in that area is not urgently needed, while a complete national elementary school is necessary. They sincerely hope that the authorities will discern the priorities and protect the existing elementary school.

### Tonight's Basketball League - Exciting Program - Shantou Team vs. Giants

Green Forest vs. Renyu Has Championship Implications - Sacco and Jiangwan Both No-Shows Yesterday

Starting at 5:30 PM today at the City Stadium gymnasium, there will be three intense basketball league matches. In the first match, the Green Team vs. the V Team in the women's division, the former is heavily favored to win the championship due to their solid strength, but the V Team will certainly try their best to resist. In Division II, Green Forest vs. Renyu has championship implications, as Renyu has maintained an undefeated record since the start of the season, while Green Forest has only unfortunately lost one game to the Red Team. Today's game should not be taken lightly. Weighing the two teams' skills and experience, Renyu has the edge, while Green Forest has better teamwork, so it can be said that each team has its own strengths. In Division I, the Shantou Team will face the Giants. The Shantou Team does not seem to be a match for the Giants, but in the league, the Shantou Team has been a consistent winner so far, while the Giants have suffered defeats at the hands of Encars and Jiangwan. Based on recent performance, the Shantou Team may win. It is reported that some of the Shantou Team's top players have left Shanghai, resulting in a loss for the team, which would be a different story.

Also, in yesterday's three matches, both the Sacco and Jiangwan teams did not show up for the final match due to reasons. It remains to be decided by the committee whether this will be considered a double forfeit. In the women's division, Xuebai vs. Xueqing Sisters Circle saw a result as expected, with the score at 33-15 in the first half and 55-37 in the end. In another match in Division II, Desheng defeated the Sixth Regiment. Desheng performed extremely well in the first half, leading with a score of 27-17. The Sixth Regiment tried to counterattack in the second half, even showing signs of catching up in the last five minutes, but due to the limited time and the large deficit from the first half, the result was 52-44, with Desheng defeating the Sixth Regiment. Today's schedule is as follows:

Green Team vs. V Team (Women's) 5:30 PM

Green Forest vs. Renyu (Division II) 6:15 PM

Shantou Team vs. Giants (Division I) 7:15 PM

Special Edition on Production and Construction

### Tea Farmers' Production and Agricultural Loans

— Wang Naiyi

Our nation is founded on agriculture, and the rural economy occupies an extremely important position in the national economy as a whole. Therefore, the evolution of the rural economy has a significant and far-reaching impact on the entire economic function of the nation and the lives of people from all walks of life. After the war, the most important national policy is to stabilize people's livelihoods. To stabilize people's livelihoods, we must develop agricultural production, as this is the fundamental and urgent task. Therefore, I would like to provide a brief introduction to the connection between tea farmers and agricultural loans, which are important sectors of agricultural production, in the hope of promoting attention and guidance from the authorities.

Looking back at the period of the War of Resistance, tea farmers in various regions fled to other places due to the ravages of war; or they changed from farming to business due to high living costs; or they abandoned tea cultivation due to the favorable returns of other agricultural products, cutting down tea trees and planting other crops instead. Over the years, observers in the industry have noted that the destruction of tea trees has been quite alarming, which is deeply regrettable when we think about it today. According to reports, after tea trees are destroyed, it takes four to five years before they can be harvested again if they are replanted. During the period of suspension of harvesting, it is still necessary to loosen the soil on time and carefully during the Yellow Plum, Beginning of Autumn, and White Dew seasons, and to remove weeds to help the tea trees grow. It is also necessary to apply fertilizers such as human manure and oil cakes to nourish the roots. During this replanting period, not only is there no profit to be made each year, but it is even necessary to add capital for cultivation. Therefore, the magnitude of the harm suffered by tea farmers during the War of Resistance can be imagined.

After victory, the lost territories were recovered, and tea farmers in various regions gradually had local security and protection. Foreign trade could gradually be restored in order. At this moment, tea leaves should have been produced in large quantities to earn foreign exchange for the country. Unfortunately, the reserves of aged tea were not abundant, and the harvesting of new tea was extremely difficult to resume production on a large scale in a short time due to the excessive felling of tea trees—the problem of funds was also an important factor. Over the years, they have suffered so much exploitation that they are already impoverished beyond description. How can they have the surplus capital to revitalize agricultural production? Moreover, the long-term investment required for the harvesting, processing, transportation, and sale of tea leaves is not sufficient without a huge amount of funds. However, many commercial banks are unwilling to invest in agricultural production, because the capital needed for agricultural products does not have the flexibility of lending to industry and commerce, the term is long, and the interest rate is low. Therefore, only national banks can handle this type of loan business.

Regarding the ways to obtain funds, one is to hope for government planning and subsidies; the other is to obtain low-interest loans from state-owned banks. As for how tea farmers can receive this assistance and loan funds, the method seems to require discussion. Generally speaking, tea farmers are scattered everywhere, lack knowledge, and have little contact with the outside world. Even if they sincerely want to apply for a loan, they suffer from not knowing where to apply. Some farmers who can ask others to help them often lack sufficient property and solid businesses to provide guarantees. If loans are made based on the personal credit of farmers, they are often rejected by banks. Therefore, if tea farmers want to obtain funds, they must first form a group and organize a tea farmers' cooperative. Reputable tea farmers from various regions are responsible for the preparation and establishment, and they register with the government in accordance with the law to obtain legal person status, so as to engage in collective joint action. At the same time, the government should seek universality in agricultural loans and determine the amount of loans that the tea farmer sector should enjoy, so that tea loan production can be started and promoted as soon as possible. On the other hand, if it is not easy to lend directly to tea farmers, it is possible to lend to reputable tea merchants for re-lending, because the connection between them is very close, and the effect is not different from direct lending, and it can also increase agricultural and commercial cooperation and promote sales effects. I hope that the government will earnestly and quickly adopt the recommended principles and implement them quickly.

In recent months, the number of new tea companies and firms in this city that have invested in tea has increased, like mushrooms after rain, with a vigorous atmosphere! The domestic sales routes have gradually expanded due to the settlement of the war and convenient transportation; and foreign export trade has also begun. In the future, when overseas shipping is smooth, the prospects will be limitless. A batch of green tea has already been exported to the United States for sale by well-known tea merchants in this city, such as Wang Yutai Tea Firm and China Tea Company. Western-style tea, which has been discontinued by tea merchants in this city for the past few years, has now been revived and is being rushed to meet the needs of the times. For example, Wang Yutai Tea Firm's special mechanical tea making tools have also begun to be rushed. Other companies, such as Zhenxing Tea Company's tea factory, are also starting to add mechanical equipment to rush to make Western-style tea for export. Therefore, the recent prosperity of the tea industry has created the highest record in several years, and the price of tea has also increased several times due to the high demand. The recent rate of increase is greater than that of any other commodity, so those who operate tea have recently made several times the profit. However, because the price of tea chips has risen, the operation funds have also become more difficult. If financial institutions do not provide appropriate financial accommodation, even though tea merchants are currently making huge profits, they will still feel that it is difficult to expand their operations. I, therefore, think of the importance of the responsibilities of tea farmers and tea merchants in the future. I, therefore, present this article, describing the general situation of their industry's difficulties, hoping that the government authorities and state-owned financial institutions will pay close attention and find ways to assist in the promotion.

I heard earlier that the Executive Yuan had allocated funds to the recovered areas for emergency agricultural loans, and that the 324th meeting of the Agricultural Bank of China had allocated agricultural loans of more than two hundred million yuan, which is a considerable amount. However, it has been a long time since it was implemented. Wu Juenong has written articles in various magazines about the needs of tea farmers and tea merchants, but there has been no practical manifestation of the financial authorities. I sincerely hope that the government and financial institutions will announce the exact figures for the allocation of loans to tea farmers as soon as possible. In addition to the funds that have already been lent out in recent months, the remaining loan funds for tea farmers and tea merchants should be cooperated with the tea trade associations in various places and distributed as soon as possible to solve the urgent needs. The tea picking season in the spring is already approaching, and we must not miss the opportunity. If we can rescue them in time, not only will tea farmers be able to seize the opportunity to revive, but the recovery and improvement of the national economy and people's livelihood will also be expected to a great extent.

### Japanese Industry Under Allied Supervision

— Qinghe

Since Japan announced its surrender, Japanese industrial production has almost completely stopped. Workers have left the industrial areas. Although the production of daily necessities is under the management of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the resumption of work in various factories is still very slow.

There are several reasons why Japan's industry has not been able to quickly recover to meet the urgent demand for daily necessities. The work of converting wartime factories to peacetime production has been hesitant due to fear of conflicting with the Allied directive prohibiting the production of military supplies. The government's failure to take steps to step up the production of daily necessities is another reason. Japanese industry is under the strict control of the government, so it does not dare to resume work without instructions. These are the reasons why the awakening of Japanese industry has been slow. The Allied forces have prohibited Japanese factories from producing special military supplies and have ordered them to maintain their wartime production capacity, and have also ordered them to provide detailed reports.

The initial task of the Allied forces is to stimulate the production of daily necessities to meet the urgent needs. Factories under the control of the Japanese government have been ordered to produce as much non-military materials as possible. As a result, most factories have resumed work.

As for Japan's foreign trade policy, it has also been determined that all imports and exports should be approved by the Allied Headquarters. Imports are limited to the minimum necessities of the people, and exports are limited to the minimum domestic needs. Barter and commercial import and export trade with other countries have now begun. Parts and other equipment in factories are not allowed to be exported, even for reparations. Japanese gold, silver, and foreign currencies that have been sealed are not allowed to be used to pay for imported goods.

Surplus materials include: 40,000 bales of raw silk, 5 million yards of silk, 30 tons of ivory, and 400 tons of cigarette paper. Goods that are not surplus but are suitable for export due to the needs of other countries include: 10,000 tons of raw hides, 4,200 tons of tin, and 10,000 tons of rubber.

### Production News

— Guodong

Recently, there has been a record-breaking advancement in the American textile industry. At the Jecoby Textile Mill in Milton, the latest type of machine is installed. Cotton is fed into one end of the machine, and cotton cloth is woven out at the other end. There is no weaving work involved. That factory and several related factories can produce 2 million yards of such cotton cloth each year.

There are a total of 26.5 million spindles in the United States, but since this method was invented, it has not been eclipsed. At the Jecoby factory, after the cotton is fed into the machine, it can be pressed into something that is half an inch thick and 40 inches wide. Then, it is pressed into various thicknesses as needed. Then, the pattern is printed with liquid gypsum to make the woven material stick together and not separate. It can be printed in color or plain color without color, as desired.

The biggest use of that product is as dental towels, diapers, milk filters, and padding. Most of them are prepared to be discarded after use. If the scope of use is expanded in the future, they can also be made into tablecloths, table runners, and curtains. The water absorption is greatly increased, and after use, they can be discarded without washing.

### The World Bank Is Underway

— Li

The World Bank, which was established based on the Bretton Woods Agreement, has a far-sighted vision. It aims to guarantee loans and provide direct loans for the reconstruction or development of resources in a country. Most of its initial activities will focus on repairing the damage suffered by Europe, and then on developing the world's natural resources and industry.

As of December 21, 1945, U.S. Treasury Secretary Vinson announced that the amount of shares that various countries have agreed to accept is as follows:

United States $2.75 billion

China $550 million

Yugoslavia $60 million

Cuba $50 million

Philippines $15 million

Venezuela $15 million

Abyssinia $6 million

Ecuador $5 million

Guatemala $5 million

Total $3.456 billion.

In addition, the British Parliament has approved the payment of $1.03 billion by the United Kingdom, Canada is preparing to pay $300 million, Belgium $225 million, Mexico $90 million, and Colombia $50 million. The total is $5.421 billion, only $299 million short of the $5.72 billion required for the World Bank's operations. Once the Soviet Union, France, India, or other small countries participate in the payment, it will undoubtedly exceed the required amount.

### The Work-Study System for American High School Students

— Wen

In the states of America, there are a lot of laws concerning education, mandating that all children under the age of eighteen must be in school. There are also a lot of areas that forbid children under the age of sixteen from working. However, in large cities in America, a lot of families are too poor to allow their children to keep going to school until they're eighteen. Some children drop out halfway, lie about their age in order to find a job, and evade the law concerning schooling.

Thus the school board decided that it would be better not to establish this law than to establish it and not abide by it. And so they initiated a work-study education system to resolve this problem. Students who need to work in order to support their families, or who would prefer to work and feel that studying does not fulfill their needs, can all participate in work-study. In some cities, the work-study students are set to study for four hours and to work at a specified factory for four hours. This education system is called the "Four-Four System". In San Francisco, it is most common and also very effective.

In New York City, the work-study education system is called "Cooperative Education". Two thousand high school students have joined. These students go to class for one week, and then work for one week. Two students handle one job, so for employers, this is like having one full-time employee. There are 165 big factories that are enacting this method.

This method can, on one hand, resolve the labor shortage, and, on the other hand, create an avenue for students. At the same time, it can train the average worker to be able to endure hardships and hard work, and it can economically assist the average poor family. It is indeed worth following suit.

### Overview of Tianlong Dyeing and Weaving

— Shi Zhiwei

Tianlong Dyeing and Weaving Factory was initially established as a partnership. On February 1, 1932, it was organized as a joint-stock limited company with a capital of 1 million yuan. In September of the same year, the capital was increased to 5 million yuan. In August 1933, the capital was increased to 15 million yuan. In November 1934, it was changed to 20 million national currency. On January 18 of this year, it was approved to change the capital to 100 million yuan. The factory was initially established on Fahuazhen Road. In February 1932, the second factory of Hongmian Factory on Xiaoshadu Road was taken over, producing more than 4,000 bed sheets per day.

In terms of products, in addition to various colored bed sheets, there are also woolen cloth, striped cloth, cashmere and other fabrics. By-products include woven floral cloth and woven floral tea towels. In addition to being sold in major department stores in this city, they are also purchased in Wenzhou, Chongqing, Hong Kong and other places.

### Catching Up

— Ying

No one can deny that China is an industrially backward country, and compared with advanced countries, the distance is really too far. This time, due to the war and the production situation in other countries, it is even more isolated. You can see some of the progress in foreign production in current foreign magazines. However, China's industrial sector must never stop moving forward because the distance is too far. We must use double the effort to catch up. Then, even if we cannot compete with the foreign industrial sector in a day, at least we will not be eliminated.

### Current Problems in China's Industrial Sector

— Xu Baiyi

Mr. Li Zufan Discusses the Future of Industry

The China Chemical Industry Society was founded in October of the first year of the Republic of China and has a long history, occupying a glorious page in China's chemical industry. Initially, it was established solely by Mr. Fang Yexian, and in January of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into a joint-stock company. During the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Yexian Guangsheng unfortunately went missing, and Mr. Li Zufan took responsibility for presiding over the business, coping with this unprecedented period of hardship. Mr. Zufan has unique insights into industrial construction. He studied factory management in the United States in his early years. I made a special visit to him, and we spoke at length about everything from the situation during the period of the Japanese occupation to the prospects for the industrial sector in the future.

The Bitter Struggle During the Occupation

The China Chemical Industry Society developed year by year because of its very good foundation. In addition to building factory buildings, it also proceeded to research and manufacture various other chemical industrial products besides cosmetics. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, a second factory was built to specialize in condiments, and in the seventeenth year, a third factory was built to manufacture Samsung mosquito coils. On the eve of the August 13th Incident, it reached a very prosperous period. However, the Japanese authorities investigated China's various businesses very carefully, especially factories related to military preparations. The China Chemical Industry Society had an oil and fat factory, which in addition to manufacturing soap, also produced large amounts of glycerol. Glycerol is an important raw material for manufacturing explosives, so after the start of the Pacific War, it was immediately supervised by the Japan Oil and Fat Co., Ltd. Beforehand, Mr. Zufan knew very well that the large amount of raw materials stored was quite dangerous, so before it was taken over by them, he turned most of the raw materials into finished products, which greatly disappointed the Japanese. After the supervision began, Mr. Zufan adopted an absolutely uncooperative attitude. They wanted to buy, rent, or act as agents, but he did not consider any of these options, answering them directly and frankly. As a result, the Japan Oil and Fat Co., Ltd. made a secret report requesting that the military department severely punish him. Mr. Zufan was also summoned to the military department many times. The era of Japanese supervision was truly a painful period. Later, the Japanese authorities really felt that it could not be utilized, so in early March of the thirty-fourth year, it was handed over to the Enemy Property Management Committee of the puppet government, which returned it for free operation. However, production was reduced as much as possible, simply to overcome difficulties and wait for the arrival of victory.

Construction in the Interior

After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the China Chemical Industry Society went to Lijiatuo, an industrial area in Chongqing, and established the Yu Factory to manufacture various daily necessities, which was presided over by Mr. Li Zuqian. By the twenty-eighth and ninth years of the Republic of China, it had already taken rough shape, and after the thirtieth year, it had achieved very good results. Since the victory, work has continued. Currently, factories have been shut down one after another, and in the Lijiatuo area, only three or four factories remain, and the Yu Factory of the China Chemical Industry Society is one of them. During the Anti-Japanese War, the society also established a branch factory in Guilin, but in the second half of the thirty-third year, the war situation changed, and it was completely destroyed, resulting in extremely heavy losses, and the employees were displaced, which was an unprecedented disaster.

Future Prospects

As for the prospects for the industrial sector in the future, it is certainly impossible to generalize, but most of the problems encountered by the industrial sector are roughly the same. In general, since the Anti-Japanese War, materials have been used more and more, and have reached the point of exhaustion. The period from the August 13th Incident to the eve of the Pacific War can be said to be the golden age of the industrial sector. Many materials were stored, and there were large sales outlets in Nanyang and other places, so the future looked infinitely bright. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, materials have become increasingly depleted, and prices have continued to rise, but the factory's reserves have become increasingly weak, and it is just a kind of paper wealth. Since the victory, because transportation has not been restored, domestic materials cannot be transported, and foreign materials cannot come to China, so it is really not easy to expand production. Regarding business operations, the following issues are causing considerable anxiety in the current industrial sector:

(1) The Foreign Goods Issue: Because imported goods are mass-produced, their prices are very cheap, so general domestic manufacturers have a sense of impending danger. But in fact, as long as transportation can be smooth and the raw material costs of Chinese manufacturers are reduced, the selling price will naturally be reduced. Therefore, to compete with imported goods, importing raw materials is an unavoidable fact. If raw materials cannot be imported and only finished products are imported as much as possible, then Chinese manufacturers will encounter a double blow of having no raw materials, being unable to reduce costs, and being dumped by cheap imported goods. The key to this issue lies in the foreign exchange problem. Although the foreign exchange rate cannot be announced temporarily before the currency system has stabilized, the recent suspension of bank foreign exchange transactions does not seem to be a thorough solution. Since we cannot avoid it, and we will eventually have a face-to-face confrontation with imported goods one day, then why not reach that point as soon as possible, and then gradually adjust. As long as we work hard and bury ourselves in hard work, the future will still be bright.

(2) Labor Issues: Labor issues are quite serious at present. In addition to the rising cost of living, which requires wages to be adjusted at any time, there is also an additional problem, which is the reinstatement of workers who were laid off before the Anti-Japanese War. The municipal government has issued a clear order that it is not necessary to accept the reinstatement requests of those workers, which is indeed a wise measure that takes into account the difficulties of the industrial sector. It is hoped that the authorities responsible for mediation can implement it in accordance with the clear order, because there were already appropriate measures in place when they were laid off before, and it is really unreasonable to demand reinstatement now. At the same time, technically speaking, workers laid off by Factory A may go to Factory B, and workers laid off by Factory B may go to Factory A, which can be a win-win situation. If they insist on returning to the original factory, it will cause great difficulties.

(3) Government Policy: The current industrial sector feels at a loss because the government's policy has not been clearly announced. For example, the issue of state-owned and private enterprises, and the entire financial issue, are all things that the industrial sector hopes to have clear regulations on as soon as possible. Moreover, after the regulations are made, they must be carried out in accordance with the original intention, without any changes, so that China's industrial sector can cooperate with the environment and move forward.

(4) Trade Associations: The organization of trade associations should normally be a sound group. In terms of work, it should be able to solve all the problems of the industry, protect the welfare of the industry, and improve the standards of the industry's products. However, the current trade associations cannot achieve these points. The reason is nothing more than mutual suspicion between the various factories, and unwillingness to be open and honest for the sake of the future of the entire industry. Another reason is that the types of trade associations are too numerous and complex. For example, the China Chemical Industry Society must join five associations at the same time. However, most people join associations only to pay membership fees, and do not ask about other affairs. Also, because there are too many categories, each association does not have the power to hire full-time staff with the ability to handle all affairs. Therefore, it is difficult for trade associations to reach the ideal state. In fact, it may be possible to reduce the number of categories as much as possible and concentrate them, so that experts can be hired and ideas can be pooled to study and discuss. On the one hand, various suggestions can be contributed to the government, and on the other hand, efforts can be made to improve technology.

Before the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Zufan tried to improve the technology of the condiment industry association, established a chemical laboratory, and held random inspection methods. All qualified products were given a prescribed seal. This move could avoid the industry from using inferior goods for mixed sales and causing unnecessary competition between the industries, and could further enhance the reputation of the entire industry in society, and later achieved great results. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, only Fuzhou was accessible, and the customs there specified that only flavored powders with seals could be imported. From this example, it can be seen that trade associations are indeed a matter of human effort.

In summary, the future of the industrial sector completely depends on whether transportation can be restored as soon as possible, whether the government's policy can be comprehensively regulated, and whether colleagues in the industrial sector can continue to work hard and catch up. Then China's industrial sector can reach a prosperous era.
