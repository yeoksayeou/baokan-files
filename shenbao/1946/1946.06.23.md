### Marshal Ma Visited the Chairman Yesterday for a Long Talk; The Three-Person Conference Officially Begins; Agreement Likely on Restoring Transportation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Special Envoy Marshall paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at nine o'clock this morning and returned to his residence after an hour and a half of discussion. He then attended the Military Three-Person Group Meeting.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Military Three-Person Group Meeting, which will determine the final fate of the goddess of peace and the fierce god of war in the next eight days, was solemnly held at Marshall's residence, No. 5 Ninghai Road, at eleven o'clock this morning. The government representatives were Xu Yongchang, Yu Dawei, and Guo Rugui. The CCP representatives were Zhou Enlai, Teng Daiyuan, Huang Yifeng, and Tong Nusheng. The U.S. representatives were General Marshall, Colonel Koyi, and others. Marshall chaired the meeting, which lasted for two hours and adjourned at one o'clock. The content of the meeting was agreed upon not to be disclosed to the public. However, according to relevant sources, the government and the CCP have reached an agreement on the issues of ceasefire and restoration of transportation due to repeated concessions by the government. However, no agreement has been reached on the troop reduction ratio in the troop reorganization plan and the issue of the Communist army's stationed areas. Therefore, the signing is still pending.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] It is reported that in today's Military Three-Person Group Meeting, both sides have agreed on the restoration of transportation, the priority repair of the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan Railways, and the partial demolition of blockhouses along the railway lines. According to sources here, this is a good demonstration of mutual concession and a prelude to the Military Three-Person Group Meeting achieving good results.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Regarding the final decision-making power, the CCP insists on giving the U.S. representative greater mediation and execution power, that is, disagreeing with the government's proposed majority decision-making power.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] From 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM this afternoon, Zhou Enlai met with Marshall and extensively exchanged views on general issues beyond the scheduled discussion topics. At 6:00 PM, Zhou returned to Meiyuan New Village. At 6:30 PM, Shao Lizi drove over and talked with Zhou Enlai for half an hour, leaving at 7:00 PM. According to Shao, he represented the government in making an oral reply to a letter from the CCP representatives to the government representatives yesterday. Shao and others initially believed that this letter from the CCP was decided before the Chairman issued the decree extending the ceasefire. Now, the CCP side claims that it was indeed decided in advance. According to Shao, the first three of the four items mentioned in the letter are expected to be resolved within these eight days, and the fourth point need not be discussed further, as the Political Consultative Conference has already made a decision, and only implementation is pending.

[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Zhou Enlai met with Special Envoy Marshall for two and a half hours this afternoon, and the issues discussed were not on the agenda of the Military Three-Person Committee. Marshall visited Chairman Chiang several hours after today's Three-Person Group Meeting. Observers here believe that Marshall's repeated meetings with the Chairman without going through government representatives may lead to a quicker solution. The Three-Person Group will hold its first meeting at 10:00 AM tomorrow. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the CCP office said that the CCP agrees with the Democratic League's proposal that soldiers should not participate in politics.

### CCP's Topics Are Increasingly Out of Touch and Empty; Obviously Employing Delaying Tactics Again; Minister Peng Discusses the CCP's Proposals

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department, when meeting with reporters at 6:00 PM this afternoon, criticized the four points in the letter from the CCP delegation to the Chairman yesterday, especially the fourth point, which was too vague, regarding "reorganizing the government, protecting human rights, relieving people's livelihoods, and completing unification." Minister Peng said: If the CCP brings out Marx's Das Kapital to discuss the relief of people's livelihoods, it may take ten years and still not produce results. The CCP's topics are increasingly out of touch and empty, and they are obviously employing delaying tactics again. The most important thing at present is the troop reorganization issue. Once a troop reorganization agreement is reached, other issues will be easily resolved. Otherwise, any agreement that has been signed will be difficult to implement. For example, regarding the restoration of transportation, based on past experience, even if the railways are repaired, they will still be damaged by the Communist army occupying the railway lines. If the troop reorganization issue is resolved and the Communist army's stationed areas are determined, conflicts can naturally be avoided. Now, the CCP is demanding a long-term ceasefire first and then further negotiations, which would lead to indefinite negotiations. Therefore, the government cannot agree. If the CCP is sincere in negotiations, then eight days is not a short time and is sufficient for negotiations. Looking back at the negotiations in the past five months, the Communist army has taken advantage of the ceasefire to continuously attack Chahar, seize Changchun, and seize Harbin. The previous example is a chilling reminder. To avoid the CCP's delaying tactics, the government must set a deadline to quickly obtain concrete measures for permanent peace.

### Representatives of the Third Force Negotiated with the CCP Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Representatives of the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and prominent figures from various circles, including Fu Sinian, Mo Dehui, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Shen Junru, and Zhang Shenfu, invited CCP representatives to discuss at the Academia Sinica at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, and Li Weihan attended to report on the progress of the recent negotiations and explain the CCP's position. The representatives of the three parties did not express their specific opinions, but all hoped that the future of the negotiations would be fruitful and decided to invite government representatives again at 4:00 PM on the 24th at the National Assembly Hall to report on the progress of the negotiations.

### Ceasefire Extension Order Issued; People in Peiping and Tianjin Feel Relieved

Newspaper editorials all hope for mutual concession.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 22nd] In the afternoon of the 22nd, Peiping had abundant rainfall. In the evening, after the rain, the sky cleared, making the ancient capital different from the usual summer heat. Along with the issuance of the ceasefire extension order, the anxious mood of the people over the past half month was greatly relieved and refreshed. Two days ago, Peiping held an important military meeting, and Zhou Zhirou, Sun Yingzhong, Liu Duoquan, and Zhao Jiaxiang all seemed to have participated, but their heavy feeling was diluted by the ceasefire extension order. The price of gold, which had been stimulated by the current situation, had risen to 209,000 yuan on the evening of the 20th. After the news of the ceasefire extension order came out last night, it plummeted to 203,000 yuan. Today, the lowest price of gold has reached 202,000 yuan, while the depressed stock market has been striving to move upward. Generally, people hope that the peace talks can achieve results within two days. Today, the North China Daily published an editorial entitled "Another Eight Days After Fifteen Days," agreeing to continue peace negotiations, but not to postpone them indefinitely. It also pointed out that negotiations should not be empty talk and must solve problems. The World Daily published an editorial entitled "Let's See These Eight Days Again," calling on people not to let these eight days pass lightly like the past and believing that even if there is still a considerable distance between the two sides on various issues, if there is sincerity and the ability to concede, the dispute can be resolved with a single change of thought. The Yishi Daily published an editorial entitled "Happy to Hear That the Ceasefire Order Has Been Extended by Eight Days," also believing that the basis of negotiations lies in sincerity. Whether the judgment is fair or not is irrelevant. With sincerity, there is no need for Marshall's judgment. Without sincerity or with insufficient sincerity, Marshall's judgment may also be in a difficult situation. Finally, it called on "Do not close the door to peace, even if the negotiations do not go well within eight days." The Xinmin Daily published an editorial entitled "Extend Negotiations First to Improve Psychology," mainly saying: (1) It is hoped that the Communist army will end its offensive in Shandong and Shanxi; (2) It is hoped that if the central government believes that the Communist Party can be resolved by force, then it should simply let go and do it. If the government does not have the possibility of eliminating the Communist army, it is better not to fight. Another newspaper wrote a short commentary entitled "The Final Moment," calling on all parties to prioritize the country and the nation and not to let the hard-won victory be wasted, so that future generations will be eternally grateful for the kindness of the public. The Tianjin Republic Daily published an editorial entitled "Do Not Miss the Opportunity," hoping to quickly break the deadlock with the assistance of international friends. There have long been precedents in international law for the authority of third parties, which is only to solve problems and does not harm the independence of independent countries. The Tianjin Yishi Daily published an editorial entitled "A View on the Overall Situation," pointing out that the international environment, economic bankruptcy, political relaxation, and public opinion are no longer suitable for civil war, and finally proposed that war is useless and peace is precious.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 22nd] Officials of the Military Mediation Department stated that the effective period of the mediation work of the executive groups during the ceasefire in Northeast China, as decided in Nanjing, has been extended along with the extension of the ceasefire period.

A colored archway with the words "Welcome General Barr" was erected in front of the door. In the afternoon, Steagall had a long meeting with Lin Biao. This morning, when reporters asked Steagall at the airport about the details of yesterday's meeting, he refused to disclose the content, but judging from his expression, it seemed that he had gained something. This morning, those who saw him off at Harbin Airport included Lin Biao, Lü Zhengcao, Peng Zhen, and TASS reporter Petrov.

### "No More Than Three" This Extension of the Ceasefire Order Should Be the Last Time

By Fang Canglang

Special Correspondent Stationed in Nanjing by Our Newspaper

At two o'clock in the afternoon on June 21, 1946, when the sun was shining brightly and the heat was dizzying, Minister Peng Xuepei of the Central Propaganda Department announced the good news that the ceasefire period would be extended to 12:00 noon on June 30. At the same time, he also read out the order from the Chairman of the National Government to the front-line troops to continue to cease advancing and pursuit. After this news was announced, dozens of Chinese and foreign reporters at the scene could not help but feel mixed emotions and breathe a sigh of relief. The good thing is that the ceasefire period has been extended, and there is still a glimmer of hope for peace. We do not have to immediately report the heartbreaking news again; the sad thing is that experience has told us that the style of fighting while negotiating will not produce any good news if it is not changed. The facts have also told us that the poor people can no longer bear it, and the Chinese idiom "no more than three" is also worth being more cautious and more fearful. Because in the past, ceasefire orders have been issued twice on January 10 and June 6. This time is the third time, and it should be the last time. Everyone must remember that this time the expiration is at the end of June, which is the day when banks close accounts and businesses settle accounts. Please calculate how much money, energy, and the blood and sweat of the people have been wasted in the past six months due to unsuccessful negotiations? The people have paid a huge price for peace and cannot waste any more.

Troop Reorganization Comes First, The Nation Comes First, The Suspension of Hostilities is Extended by Only Eight Days. At present, the Three Major Problems that Urgently Need to be Resolved in the Peace Talks Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are: The Suspension of Hostilities in the Northeast, the Restoration of Transportation, and the Reorganization and Unification of the Army. Unless these problems are resolved reasonably and legally, The measures that have already been negotiated, such as the establishment of the Forward Division in Changchun, the strengthening of the authority of the Executive Group, the demolition of blockhouses, and the unification of road administration, road camps, and management rights, etc., will be obstructed and damaged at any time by the military forces entrenched and lurking in various strategic areas and on the land and sea transportation lines. This is not the concern and obstacle that should exist under a democratic government, nor is it something that the people who hope for lasting peace are willing to agree to. Therefore, the government advocates giving priority to troop reorganization in the military three-person conference, which is warmly supported by the people. At present, the CCP representatives are unwilling to withdraw from Harbin and Andong in the Northeast, and they are unwilling to withdraw from the provinces of Jehol and Chahar, as well as Yantai and Weihaiwei, and the places occupied after June 7, on the grounds that they are deeply afraid that the government will drive the Communist army to remote areas and eliminate them. After the CCP representatives publicly released this news yesterday, people felt very strange, because when the troop reorganization is implemented, the CCP will join the government's command of the national defense army, so why should they make such a dangerous plan, why do they still have such an outdated view! What the Chinese people are now asking of all parties is that the nation comes first, not military affairs. The CCP should reflect, and people outside the CCP should also work hard to find better ways and statements to help the CCP eliminate this kind of unfounded fear that does not meet democratic requirements in order to complete the work of troop reorganization.

If China cannot quickly reorganize and disarm its troops, every day it drags on, according to unofficial statistics, every citizen will have to bear at least 500 yuan of military expenses and other losses every day. This is an unparalleled loss, a shocking loss on the verge of destruction. The entire Subei has a population of only a few million, but more than three million have fled one after another because they could not bear the chaos and education of the CCP. Recently, even self-cultivating farmers, tenants, and small shop assistants have fled. Sadly, most of those who fled are honest, poor, and have low abilities, so they fled hell and became hungry ghosts. Not long ago, several foreign reporters who did not believe in it personally ran to Zhenjiang to conduct on-site investigations. As a result, not only did they do good deeds by opening their wallets, but they also conducted a real democratic test, because they understood that there is absolutely no opposition in the "democratic areas" occupied by the CCP. Is this democracy? Amen! (Sent from Nanjing on June 22)

### Powell Proposes Restoring Coal Mine Production in Northeast China to MacArthur; Diverting Part of Japan's Power Generation Equipment

[Gazebo Tokyo, 22nd] Special U.S. Compensation Envoy Powell told reporters yesterday: I have left half of the survey committee in the Northeast to survey the factories in the areas occupied by the Chinese National Army and the Communist Army. They are led by Mr. Handler and are expected to enter the above two areas soon. Handler also reported that he had agreed to meet with CCP representatives in Changchun. I met with MacArthur's staff on the 22nd and had lunch with MacArthur. I suggested that some power generation equipment be transferred to the Northeast as soon as possible. Dong and I believe that this move is necessary to prevent important coal mines such as Fushun and Xinqiu from falling into an unmanageable state. In the current situation of the world coal shortage affecting the United States and the Far East, if we do not find a way to replenish the power equipment removed from the above important coal mine areas, the restoration of war damage will inevitably be delayed for many years. Even if it is possible to immediately transfer the various equipment from Japan to the Northeast, it may not be enough to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and the development of economic collapse. We are scheduled to leave Tokyo on the 22nd for Taiwan, then from Taiwan to the Philippines, and then to Paris and Berlin. In Paris, I will give a preliminary report to Secretary of State Burns, at which time I will consider my observations and "contribute my opinions to the overall compensation plan for the Far East and Europe."

### Reorganization of Central Auxiliary Organs: The Authorities Instruct the Executive Yuan to Expedite Measures; Ministries and Commissions Rush to Compile and Submit Rosters

After being submitted to Chairman Chiang of the Supreme National Defense Council for approval, the Executive Yuan was instructed to expedite the matter. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has notified the various Yuan by telegram on the 20th, and separately ordered the ministries and commissions to submit the following information: (1) the number of personnel stipulated in the organizational law of the said organ and its affiliated organs; (2) a comparative table of the names of the units under its jurisdiction before and after the war; (3) a comparative table of the number of personnel in each unit before and after the war; (4) the number of affiliated units that can be reorganized and merged, and the number of personnel that can be reduced in each unit, along with explanations, all to be submitted to the Yuan by June 25th of this year for compilation and handling of the reorganization and merger matters. It is reported that various central organs received this telegram on the 21st and are rushing to compile and submit the rosters overnight. According to a certain important official who spoke to a reporter: Due to this measure by the government, coinciding with the Chairman's announcement on the 21st of extending the ceasefire period, it can further reflect the government's determination to build the country in peace and strive for good governance.

### Situation in Cirebon, Indonesia is Precarious; Overseas Chinese Receive Evacuation Advice; Xin Bao Calls for Government to Explore a Strong Policy

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 21st] A telegram from Cirebon indicates that the general situation there has deteriorated further. The Indonesian authorities have notified the local overseas Chinese that if the situation becomes urgent, they should evacuate to the northern villages. Their response was that they were unwilling to stay in the neutral zone in the city, and that it was impossible to evacuate such a large number of overseas Chinese. This problem has not yet been resolved. Cirebon is located on the north coast of Java, about 160 miles east of Batavia, and has long been a center of activity for powerful leftist elements.

During the Japanese occupation and after "surrender", Indonesians continued their anti-Chinese activities in Java due to being heavily influenced by Japanese propaganda and intimidation tactics. Xin Bao wrote an editorial on this open letter, stating: The Chinese government should no longer adopt a covert policy. The Indonesian government should also prove to the world that it not only desires but is also able to exercise its power in any region within Indonesia.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 22nd] The traitor Zhang Beisheng, former Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the puppet Jiangsu Province and Commissioner of Qingxiang in northern Jiangsu, was sentenced to death in the first instance by the Jiangsu High Court. He appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled for a retrial. The Jiangsu High Court opened the debate court on the 22nd.

Chuansha: Puppet Secret Agents Have All Surrendered Their Weapons

Recently, a unit claiming to be the Chuansha Station of the Southeast Region Special Commissioner's Office of the National Government Military Commission, led by Wang Baoming, the station chief and deputy station chief from Zhoupu Town, and Zhang Jinkang, who served as the president of the puppet Chamber of Commerce of Zhoupu Town and the puppet town mayor, brought more than a hundred staff members to reside in the county and established groups in various townships. They carried weapons in plain clothes, arbitrarily arrested people, used torture, extorted money, and did everything possible. In the past week, those illegally arrested include Ding Huishan, Wu Shumei, Zhu Zhang, etc., all of whom were extorted large sums of money. According to reports, the people's self-defense teams in various townships of the county, at the request of the people and out of righteous indignation, joined forces with the county security brigade a few days ago to disarm all members of the secret agent team, send them to the county government, and request that they be brought to justice.

Suzhou: Strict Prohibition of Opium, Heavy Penalties Applied. Since the victory of the war of resistance, this county has strictly enforced the prohibition of opium and arrested opium offenders on a large scale. Previously, the Patrol Bureau arrested four opium addicts, namely Wen Yupo, Mi Jinjin, Xu Ada, and Zhang Rong, and referred them to the local prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution. The Criminal Court pronounced its verdict on the 20th. The main text: Wen Yupo, Mi Jinjin, and Xu Ada are each sentenced to death for drug use and deprived of their civil rights for life. Zhang Rong is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for opium use and deprived of his civil rights for one year. Zhang Rong is sent to the drug rehabilitation department for a limited period of two months to quit. A small bag of heroin, including the paper, and three opium pipes, and one heroin shovel were all confiscated.

Jurong: Locust Extermination Leads to Tragic Drowning. The Fifth District Office of this county, ordered to requisition over one thousand eight hundred civilian laborers from various townships at 7:00 AM on the 19th of this month, sent personnel led by Li to the Yonglongzhou area of Fuchang Township, the seventh district of Jiangning nearby, to exterminate locusts. After the work was completed, at about 1:00 PM, the civilian laborers returned to Xiaduanshi Street and crossed the river by ferry. Due to the rapid tide and waves, the ferry, carrying about ten or more people, suddenly capsized. After all efforts were made to rescue them, five or six people were rescued. By evening, seven male and female corpses had been recovered. The families of the deceased carried the corpses to the district office for placement, which was a terrible sight. Chief Gu, who returned from Jurong County Government on the morning of the 20th, is preparing for the aftermath.

Taixian: Minister and Chairman Inspect Refugees

According to reliable information, Minister Gu Zhenggang and Chairman Wang Maogong will jointly inspect the situation of the displaced refugees here on the 20th to prepare for effective relief. The county government is currently preparing to receive them, and displaced people from various places have elected representatives to make urgent appeals when Wang and Gu arrive.

Hangzhou: Flood Affects Transportation on All Routes

Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's Hangzhou-Zhuji section, due to recent mountain floods, the roadbeds and tracks from Zhuji to Zhibu were flooded, and transportation was blocked. Now that the weather has cleared and the water level has gradually receded, the early express train arriving at 11:00 AM on the 20th can arrive at Zhuji as usual, and transportation has resumed. As for highway transportation, due to bridges being washed away, the connecting direct buses from Zhuji to Jiangshan are still suspended.

Zhuji: Torrential Floods, Joint Efforts to Rescue

This county has recently experienced torrential rains, resulting in mountain floods in the upper reaches of the Puyang River, creating a vast expanse of water. There are many breaches in the embankments along the river, and the low-lying areas have become a country of marshes, with crops submerged and the autumn harvest hopeless. Moreover, the urban area is over a foot deep in water, and the flood is still rushing in through the three city gates along the river. Small boats have entered the city to replace rickshaws as a means of transportation. Many bridges have been washed away, and the Dian埂 outside the South Gate is in imminent danger. County Chief Zhu is personally supervising the police, civilian laborers, and some officers and soldiers of the 187th Division stationed there to jointly rescue. It is also reported that in the area east of Nansha in Xiaoshan, tens of thousands of acres have been washed away by the river water since last year. The Sancha and Xiaosibu areas have all been successively submerged. Recently, due to the rising water in the upper reaches of the river, the riverbank collapse has become even more intense, with an average of over a hundred steps collapsing daily. Most of the houses of local farmers have been washed away because they could not be relocated in time, and the scene is extremely tragic.

### Editorial: Peace Should Begin with Eliminating Suspicion!

Peace! Peace! All mankind is yearning for peace, but the whole world is worried that peace cannot be guaranteed. This is not only true for China, but the Chinese people hope for peace most earnestly and seek peace most forcefully. If the Chinese people did not sincerely and genuinely pray for peace, why would they, at the moment of victory, accept the advice of the United States and conclude the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Friendship with the Soviet Union? On this basis alone, it can be judged that the Chinese government and people, from top to bottom, are willing to make any sacrifice to strive for Sino-Soviet friendship and eliminate the potential sources of suspicion between China and the Soviet Union, or even between the United States and the Soviet Union, in the Far East, simply to lay a good foundation for peace in the Far East and even world peace. The National Government of China is willing to use this spirit of self-sacrifice to lay the foundation for peace in the Far East. Is there any reason why it would not be willing to seek domestic peace through extreme tolerance? Therefore, in today's China, calling for peace does not need to be addressed to the National Government. The authorities' hope for peace is more urgent than ours. Pushing representatives and boycotting classes are unnecessary and superfluous actions. If we truly want peace to be realized and even ensured, we must first earnestly implore the Chinese Communist Party to eliminate their preconceived suspicions!

The Communist Party is a revolutionary party, not a democratic party. Therefore, it was trained from suspicion during its growth period. It guards against people dealing with it everywhere and constantly guards against people plotting against it. Therefore, its members often refuse to trust people easily. Because of this, they can often be untrustworthy. In the minds of Communist Party members, it seems that they have never believed that there can be mutual trust between people. As for trust between countries, they believe that "trust" is even less certain. "Speaking of trust and cultivating harmony" are originally related; because they are not accustomed to "speaking of trust," it is also very difficult to "cultivate harmony." This is not only true for the Chinese Communist Party, but all Communist parties in the world inevitably have some habits of suspicion. Today, if we want world peace and Chinese peace, the most fundamental way to start is probably to find a way to restore the faith of Communist Party "comrades" in humanity and eliminate their ingrained habits of suspicion. On this point, all parties or countries that stand in a position relative to the Communist Party should make an effort. Mencius said: "If loving people does not bring them close, reflect on your sincerity." We still need to find out why we cannot eliminate the suspicions of the Communist Party.

For example, in terms of international issues, the "atomic bomb" is one of the reasons that has caused the Soviet Union to be particularly suspicious. The U.S. authorities are well aware of this. Therefore, after the opening of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, its representative, Baruch, proposed a very important suggestion, advocating that atomic energy be handed over to international institutions for control and declaring that if an international atomic energy agency can be established, it is willing to hand over all atomic bombs for destruction and cease production. At the same time, the United States has successively suggested that the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France conclude a 25-year defense alliance against Germany, and that the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain conclude a 25-year defense alliance against Japan. In the United States, this can be considered to have exhausted its intelligence to provide the Soviet Union with collective security guarantees and eliminate the Soviet Union's suspicion of other powerful countries in the world. The international gloom should be expected to dissipate. But Soviet representative Gromyko has other suggestions, advocating the use of international agreements to prohibit the manufacture and use of atomic weapons and demanding that the United States destroy all existing stockpiles of atomic weapons within three months after the establishment of the international atomic energy control agency. It can be seen that the Soviet authorities' suspicion has not been eliminated. This is really a pity! U.S. representative Baruch once said a moving and shocking sentence: "World peace or world destruction will depend on the outcome of this meeting." The issue of atomic energy, which is related to world security, still remains a core issue of Soviet suspicion.

In fact, in today's world situation, the reason why the Soviet Union is uneasy and insists on expanding its "security zone" is that it cannot be said that it is psychologically threatened by atomic energy. Conversely, the reason why Britain and the United States are firmly opposed to the Soviet Union retaining veto power over international management of atomic energy and are unwilling to suddenly disclose atomic energy secrets is that the Soviet Union has repeatedly adopted uncompromising attitudes in diplomacy, which has led to this. The Soviet Union is uncompromising everywhere at the London United Nations General Assembly, the New York Security Council, and the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference. In the Soviet Union, it may think that it is not convenient to easily trust Britain and the United States; but in the eyes of Britain and the United States, this is just enough to show that the Soviet Union is difficult to trust. With such mutual suspicion, cooperation is naturally full of thorns. Therefore, how to eliminate the suspicions between powerful countries is a prerequisite for world peace. Because if there is mutual trust between powerful countries and there is no war, there is no reason why small and weak countries would want to provoke war.

Looking at the overall situation in China, we also require both parties in the negotiations to dispel suspicion, and especially hope that the government will do its best to eliminate the Communist Party's suspicious psychology. We believe that the government is moving in that direction, but we hope that the Communist Party will also move in that direction.

In order to negotiate with the Communist Party, the National Government, because it is not easy to believe, invited other parties and non-partisan "third parties" to negotiate together. Should the Communist Party be able to trust it? However, no! Then the government has no choice but to disregard the dignity of the country and has to ask American friends to mediate and has the Communist Party's agreement. The arrival of Special Envoy Marshall in China and President Truman's statement should convince the CCP that its American allies can speak a fair word, right? However, today it seems that another "no" has been answered! The purpose of the United States is only to hope that China can succeed in becoming a democratic, unified, and strong China. It does not favor any party in China. Special Envoy Marshall's plan is just to ensure that the Communist army is also incorporated into the national army and that Communist Party members and members of other parties can sincerely participate in the government and jointly govern. These are the wishes that the Communist Party should have. Even if the Kuomintang may want to deceive the Communist Party, and the National Government may want to suppress the Communist army, now that the government is emphasizing that it is willing to respect Special Envoy Marshall's fair judgment and is willing to obey "majority rule" during negotiations, then as long as Marshall agrees with the Communist Party's proposal, the government will not avoid any sacrifice. The government is seeking peace in this way, which should be considered sincere, but why can't it get the Communist Party's understanding and accept Marshall and its American allies' fair judgment? If the "comrades" of the CCP, even today, cannot eliminate suspicion and are unwilling to exchange ideas with each other and negotiate openly, then even if we shout for peace, "peace" will be very vague in China. For the country, for the people, for our ancestors, and for our descendants, we earnestly implore the CCP not to be suspicious anymore, so that the flower of "peace" can blossom brilliantly in China.

### Four-Nation Co-Management of Japan Proposal: China and Britain Accept, Soviet Union Has Not Replied. Thorough Supervision of Japanese Demilitarization, Mutual Assistance Treaty for a Term of 25 Years

[United States News Service, Washington, 21st] The U.S. State Department has recently released a proposed treaty between China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union for the demilitarization of Japan for 25 years, similar in nature to the treaty for the demilitarization of Germany announced by Secretary of State Byrnes at the first foreign ministers' conference on April 29th. The draft has been sent to the governments of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. According to a State Department spokesperson, China and Britain have responded with satisfaction, but the Soviet Union has not yet replied.

The draft states that if the world needs peace and security, it must completely demilitarize Japan. This has not yet been guaranteed, but only with such guarantees can the nations of Asia and the world be assured of returning to peaceful habits. The draft stipulates the complete elimination of Japanese military organizations, military equipment, and tools for manufacturing armaments, and proposes the establishment of a four-nation management committee to conduct inspections throughout Japan to ensure the strict implementation of the treaty. Each of the enemy nations must formulate detailed measures regarding this mutual assistance within six months of signing the treaty.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The United States has proposed to China and the Soviet Union the establishment of a four-nation commission to oversee Japan, taking over the supervision of Japanese affairs. Secretary of State Byrnes previously suggested to the Soviet Union, Britain, and France that they conclude a 25-year mutual assistance treaty to jointly monitor Germany's disarmament. This measure concerning Japan is a related part of that. In practice, this measure will only be implemented after the current military occupation ends. However, if a co-management treaty can be signed and established early, the large-scale military occupation can also end earlier. Currently, the handling of Japanese affairs is almost entirely managed by the United States. Once the treaty takes effect, this monopolistic situation will cease. According to the State Department, General MacArthur is fully aware of the content of this treaty, but whether he approves of it is still unknown.

[Reuters, London, 21st] A Foreign Office spokesperson said that Britain welcomes in principle the American proposal to conclude a four-nation treaty to monitor Japan for 25 years. Britain received the draft treaty at the same time as it received the draft treaty on the four-nation control of Germany. British officials, from Foreign Secretary Bevin down, have expressed their support. Britain has some opinions on the details of the treaty, which have reportedly been telegraphed to Washington. Negotiations on this matter have made little progress, so Washington's announcement yesterday caused surprise in Britain.

### Our Military Police Team to Japan Next Month: Provisional Garrison Area is Nagoya. Withdrawal Plan for Japanese Troops and Civilians Within Our Borders to be Completed Next Month.

[This City News] Our government, in order to participate in the Allied co-management of Japan, has had Generals Zhu Shimin and Dai Jian negotiate with General MacArthur's headquarters to handle the procedures for our troops to be stationed in Japan. The first group of officers and soldiers to go to Japan is the Chinese Military Police Team stationed in Japan, totaling 200 people, led by Chen Yuliang as the team leader. The officers and soldiers of this team went to the U.S. military headquarters yesterday for vaccinations and are expected to leave the country next month. This military police team will be the vanguard of the 67th Division, led by General Dai Jian, to be stationed in Japan, arriving in Japan to do preliminary work, with the provisional garrison area being Nagoya. At the same time as this military police team, the Rear Echelon Command, the 1st Branch, the 11th Motor Vehicle Battalion, and the Tank Company will also go to Japan, totaling four units. The second group to go to Japan is the 67th Division under the command of General Dai Jian. Previously, our side had decided to send the 3rd Independent Military Police Battalion to Japan to take on military police work, but now this military police team is being sent instead, because of its larger scale. The officers and soldiers of this military police team are selected from the Youth Army and the India-Burma Expeditionary Force, and most have a high school education. Many are also able to speak English and Japanese. Most of the team members are from Sichuan and Anhui provinces. According to team leader Chen Yuliang, the military police have received special training, and the equipment is relatively complete. They are currently undergoing centralized training and will undergo a major inspection before leaving the country. The supplies for this team after going to Japan will be transported from China, because the cost of living in Japan is currently too high, and the American troops in Japan are also self-sufficient. Therefore, the Chinese troops stationed in Japan will also transport their own supplies from China.

[Another News] As our country's military police team stationed in Japan is about to leave the country, the Military Friends Society of this city held a farewell party at the society at 4:00 PM yesterday.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] General MacArthur's headquarters announced today that the large-scale withdrawal plan for 1,452,741 Japanese troops and civilians within China will be completed on July 4th of this year. The biggest task will be repatriating 116,743 Japanese residents still remaining in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tanggu. If cholera had not occurred, hindering transportation, the scheduled plan could have been completed on July 4th of this year.

[United Press, Beiping, 22nd] A spokesperson for the 11th War Zone Commander's Headquarters stated that Chinese military governments, commercial organizations, and private families are still privately hiding Japanese women to prevent them from being repatriated. He did not specify in what capacity these Japanese women are unwilling to be repatriated and remain here. According to speculation, they are willing to stay here as concubines or servants. The spokesperson said that Japan had employed women to engage in espionage work, and the remaining Japanese women will pose a potential threat to security. Therefore, the Chinese authorities have ordered public security bureaus and military organizations to start investigating.

### Walt Disney New Cartoon Production, Difficult to Distinguish Between Real and Animated Actors

[Associated Press, Hollywood, 21st] Walt Disney is now employing real actors in his cartoons. Perhaps one day, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and other characters will all be played by real people. Previously, Walt Disney's cartoons also featured real and animated characters appearing together on the screen, but now he is using real actors entirely or mostly to make cartoons. Ye Shi's first new work after the war is called "Song of the South," which, in addition to animated characters, also features three living characters, one named Tescal, with a slightly crooked face, a seven-year-old girl named Luna Barton, and another named Jack Chance Basket, a black man. Seventy percent of this film will be performed by real actors. According to people in the studio, they guarantee that you will not be able to distinguish between real and animated characters when you watch the movie.

Walt's other film, called "Heartstrings," will also feature Bila Ying Futi and Bell Ayers to assist in the performance, in addition to the two children mentioned above. Eighty percent of the scenes in this film are done by real actors. However, 100% animated films are unlikely to become a reality at present.

### Atom Bomb Test Well-Arranged in All Respects

[Central News Agency, Honolulu, 21st United Press] Sixty minutes before the atomic bomb explodes over Bikini, the U.S. Navy will conduct the most careful population survey in history. One hour before the drop, 46 people will be stationed in the Bikini circular coral island, and 54 people will be stationed on the 32 target ships. Personnel on the islands of Amen, Bikini, Eric, and Eseef will be responsible for the final installation of scientific equipment and cameras. Other personnel on some target ships will bear this responsibility. Several people are responsible for maintaining boiler pressure until the last minute. There are only two people on one island, and there is only one person on each of 23 ships. The loneliest of them is likely the person alone in a small boat at the end of the buoy, half an hour before the evacuation, as the Super Fortress carrying the bomb practices overhead.

[Associated Press, Bikini Coral Island, 21st] The Army, Navy, and Air Force atomic bomb testing units conducted their second large-scale exercise yesterday, preparing for the final joint exercise by the sea and air forces on the 23rd of this month.

### Socio-Economic Council Approves Establishment of New International Refugee Organization That Will Take Over Most of UNRRA's Functions by the End of the Year

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] The United Nations Economic and Social Council held a plenary meeting today and passed a resolution to establish a new global refugee agency by a vote of thirteen to four. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia voted against the resolution. The draft charter of the organization stipulates (1) the establishment of a governing council, to which each member state may send a representative to set policies; (2) the establishment of an executive committee; and (3) the appointment of a director-general. However, the charter does not mention the location of the headquarters of the International Refugee Organization. The International Refugee Organization will be a special agency that will take over most of the functions of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration when it closes at the end of the year.

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] The United Nations Economic and Social Council today passed nine reports and motions, which will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly to be convened in September for review. The second session of the Council was then adjourned late at night.

### French Political Consultations Focus on Salary and Wage Issues

Bidault Calls it Preparation for Cabinet Formation

[French News Agency, Paris, 21st] President Bidault, before attending the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting this afternoon, stated that the purpose of his political consultations was to form a new cabinet. Political observers here commented that today's political consultations focused on salary and wage issues. The French Labor Federation, controlled by the Communist Party, is currently demanding a general wage increase of 25 percent. The French Catholic Workers' Federation has a more moderate attitude. Representatives of capital have pointed out that any method of increasing wages would be dangerous and advocate temporarily suspending certain taxes to reduce the cost of living. It is widely believed that Bidault's policy on this issue will be based on the report drafted by former Finance Minister Philip.

### Calling for Peaceful Completion of Unification: Shanghai's 800,000 Workers' Organizations Form "Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance"

Launching Citywide Expanded Propaganda Starting This Morning; Industrial and Educational Circles Deny Sending Lin Handa and Others to Beijing

The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, at 3:00 PM yesterday, convened a meeting of directors and supervisors of various industry trade unions at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association, and immediately resolved to organize the "Shanghai Municipal Workers' Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance," calling for an end to civil war, demanding peace, and completing unification. It also passed telegrams to Chairman Chiang, letters to fellow workers, and several temporary motions.

More than 300 people from 180 units, including the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Shanghai Postal and Telephone, Water Supply, Water and Electricity, Cotton Spinning, Sanitation, Shipbuilding, and Machinery, attended the meeting yesterday. Pan Gongzhan, member of the Central Standing Committee, Director Lu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs were present to provide guidance. Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xiangkui, Fan CaiKui, Shui Xiangyun, and Fang Rusheng served as the presidium. Chairman Zhou Xuexiang first reported that the Federation of Trade Unions had convened the fifth symposium of fellow trade union members to discuss the central issue, which was due to the seriousness of recent national affairs. Yesterday, students throughout the city held demonstrations against the civil war. To live and work in peace and to achieve unity and peace, we must take consistent steps. The 800,000 workers throughout the city must be organized and on the right track, striving for the anti-civil war effort that is the unanimous desire of the 400 million compatriots throughout the country. As for the occurrence of this civil war, many fellow workers in the industrial sector do not understand the process, so we have asked Director Wu, Director Lu, and others to provide us with guidance.

Preventing All Illegal Activities

Director Lu Jingshi of the Ministry of Social Affairs stated: Recently, everyone has felt uneasy, and this unease is caused by political factors. The eight-year War of Resistance has exhausted the people and drained the country's wealth, and the subsequent Communist Party's separatist rule has plunged the people into misery. Chairman Chiang has given the Communist Party a final opportunity, extending the ceasefire order to the end of the month, hoping that the Communist Party will take the overall situation into account and achieve a peaceful resolution before the deadline, accepting the agreement. I recently returned to Shanghai from Zhenjiang and witnessed and heard the suffering of refugees fleeing from northern Jiangsu, described the deception of the Communist Party's slogans. Trade union leaders should be vigilant and not be deceived. We must stabilize social order and calmly prevent all illegal activities.

Studying the Factors of Non-Peace

Pan Gongzhan said: Everyone wants to strive for peace. All mankind in the country and the world hope for peace. Peace is the normal state, and civil war is a pathological state. When there is a disease, it must be cured. The method of medicine, how to heal, depends on the doctor and the prescription. The Chinese government authorities sincerely want peace. After the victory last year, in order to seek friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and at the same time make the United States friendly to the Soviet Union, it signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, recognizing the independent vote in Inner Mongolia, and jointly managing the China Changchun Railway, painstakingly seeking world peace. The National Government must be responsible for the country, the nation, and all mankind, so is it not sincere in seeking peace internally? We must have confidence in the government and give it full authority to handle this matter. We must study where the factors of non-peace lie, and it is clearly in the Communist Party, so we must call for peace, demanding peace, and demand it from the Communist Party. Furthermore, the Communist Party is an international party, and the decision-making power of the CCP is not in the hands of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, and it is not in the hands of the Chinese people at all. Whether we are the party in power or the party out of power, we must be a truly Chinese party. We must express the people's desire for peace and shout out to the non-peaceful side. Looking at Jiangsu Province across the Yangtze River, it has become two worlds, and the people of northern Jiangsu are fleeing to southern Jiangsu day by day. Is northern Jiangsu democratic? The eight-year War of Resistance relied on Chairman Chiang's leadership and did not go the wrong way, and with national unity, we were able to win the battle. At this once-in-a-millennium opportunity for national revival, some people have forgotten the Chinese people, are not led, and are dividing the land, destroying this once-in-a-millennium good opportunity, "Opposing the civil war is the key to curing this disease. We must believe in the doctor, and the Sino-Japanese War that could have led China to its death was brought back to life because the prescription of the Chairman was correct; the purpose of peace is permanent peace, the disease must be cured, and after taking medicine and injections, it can reduce fever and relieve inflammation, which is the blessing of Heaven. If the fever does not subside and the inflammation does not go away, surgery must be performed. In short, opposing the civil war is everyone's common demand, how to stop it, we cannot make a decision, but we cannot delay it, otherwise everyone will be dragged to their deaths.

Don't Be Fooled By Them

Wu Kaixian said: The Communist Party wants to lead our workers to the wrong path. What people in the industrial sector hope for is to have a job and be able to live. Our responsibility is also to enable every worker to have a life, but the Communist Party is the opposite. Please tell every worker not to be fooled by them and let themselves be used by them.

Unanimously Organize a Grand Alliance

Following Zhao, a postal worker who fled to Shanghai from Qidong, northern Jiangsu, reporting on the Communist Party's deceptive behavior towards fellow workers in northern Jiangsu, the following was unanimously resolved: to organize the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance, to pass the constitution of the Grand Alliance Council, and to elect Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, Ye Xianggao, Yuan Zhaozhang, Fan CaiKui, Lu Keming, Fang Rusheng, Song Peiyao, Yao Zhizheng, Chen Shunxing, Tang Zhenbao, Hu Menglin, Zhang Zhusan, Qiu Changjiang, Zhou Fujiang, Shao Ziying, Liang Yongzhang, Zhou Yunjiang, Zhang Ziheng and other forty-five people as directors, seventeen people as alternate directors, and immediately pass a letter to fellow workers, a telegram to Chairman Chiang to stop the source of the chaos, and twenty-one slogans of the Grand Alliance. Starting this morning, workers throughout the city will be mobilized to post slogans and expand propaganda to stop the civil war. It was also decided to convene the first council meeting of the Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance at the Federation of Trade Unions at 3:00 PM today. Finally, a temporary motion was passed (1) The representatives of the Valley Trade Union do not recognize the dispatch of Lin Handa, Ma Xulun, Kui Yanfang, and Bao Dasan as representatives to Beijing to petition, and send a telegram to the chairman to clarify. (2) Deny the reactionary slogans posted in the name of various trade unions.

Passed Telegram to Chairman Chiang

(3) Send a telegram to Chairman Chiang, the original text of the telegram passed by the conference yesterday is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, After the victory of the War of Resistance, the people of the country hoped that they could work together to build the country, but the Communist Party, on the pretext of democracy, actually implemented separatist rule, attacked cities and seized land, massacred compatriots, destroyed transportation, and disrupted production, causing the people of the country to suffer the pain of displacement after suffering from war. The government, taking the overall situation into account, has repeatedly compromised and made concessions, negotiating with each other in order to achieve peaceful unification as soon as possible. However, the Communist Party has always been obsessed and inconsistent in words and deeds, and has no credibility. Now that the ceasefire deadline has arrived, its military disturbances are still pressing ahead, and its conspiracies and tricks are endless, and it actually wants to put the country and the nation in a state of eternal doom. The fellow workers are heartbroken to see this and cannot remain silent. I hope that the Chairman will uphold the established policy, make a decisive decision, and take severe measures to stop the source of the chaos. All the fellow workers in Shanghai pledge to be the rearguard. This is a telegram to Chairman Chiang. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Workers' Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance.

Solemnly Deny "Representatives"

[Another News] The Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance of Workers in this city and various colleges and universities above specialized schools, because someone has borrowed the name of Ma Xulun, Lin Handa, Bao Dasan, Huang Yanfang, etc., who claim to be representatives to petition in Beijing, unanimously solemnly denied it, and separately telegraphed the Chairman and Dean Zhu to clarify. At the same time, the Student Federation of this city also telegraphed the National Government yesterday, and separately telegraphed the student community and the press in Nanjing, denying that Ma Xulun, Lin Handa, Huang Yanfang, etc. were ever elected as representatives for peaceful petition, urging them to pay attention.

### Increase in Real Estate Tax to Begin in Autumn

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Finance Bureau's collection of the spring real estate donation has reached more than 170 million yuan so far, excluding the clothing expenses of the security corps, and the amount to be collected is more than 330 million yuan. In addition, the Finance Bureau believes that the city's tax revenue is not enough to cover expenses, and the revenue is heavily focused on entertainment banquet donations, which seems unfair, so the real estate donation will be appropriately increased starting in the autumn.

Among them, the fourth batch of more than 200 people will arrive in Shanghai from Beijing on the 24th and will be transferred to Fujian, Hebei, Shandong, and the Northeast to continue their studies and resume their businesses locally.

### Crack Down on Vendors Selling Smuggled Goods; Confiscated Goods to Be Auctioned for Charity

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the fact that there are numerous vendors in the market selling smuggled goods from the US military, such as, army rations, not only obstructing traffic and affecting the appearance of the city, but also engaging in illegal business, affecting tariffs and the business of legitimate stores, according to the Bureau's investigation, the source of these goods is mostly from individual US military sales, and some are stolen by vendors from importers when unloading goods at the docks, the so-called scalpers reselling supplies. The police bureau has now stepped up its crackdown efforts, in addition to ordering the maritime sub-bureau to pay close attention, and has proposed to the municipal government that in the future, all such vendors who are found will have their goods immediately confiscated, and the income from public auctions by the municipal government will be used for charitable relief.

### Ye Jiqing Constantly Thinks of Family Matters; High Court Summons Two "Demon Wives"; Meets with Children After Adjournment; Talks About Marriage Only with Second Daughter

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the High Court summoned the widows of two pseudo-agent demons, one was Ye Jiqing, the wife of rebel Li Shiqun, and the other was Yu Aizhen, the wife of rebel Wu Shibao. Li's wife is over forty years old, slender, still wearing a black-based white floral cheongsam, barefoot in high-heeled leather shoes, with a still charming demeanor. Ye is a native of Suian, Zhejiang, forty-four years old, living at No. 68, Lane 749, Yuyuan Road. When her husband, Li Shiqun, served as the director of the Political Security Bureau of the Pseudo-Agent Headquarters, he was a henchman of the tiger and participated in his affairs. In September of the 28th year, he took the position of accountant of the department, managing food, wages, and miscellaneous expenses, as if he were the hostess of "No. 76." In March of the 32nd year, he was again introduced by rebel Zhou Fohai to serve as a member of the Pseudo-Economic Committee, and did not leave office until September of the following year. During the interrogation, Ye was calm, answering questions while trying to avoid being photographed by photographers. When answering questions about property, she said that there were four houses, plus gold and silver jewelry, all of which had been seized by the Military Intelligence Bureau. Asked why she wanted to enter No. 76, she replied that because she and Li Shiqun were married, and the department stipulated that non-employees were not allowed to stay, she had to hang the name of "accountant," as for participating in political affairs, she said that women could not engage in secret political work. When talking about killing people, not only did she completely deny it, but she also asked the judge if he could cite the year and month of her killing people. As for the membership of the Pseudo-Economic Committee, she did not deny it, only saying that the purpose was to facilitate car travel, so as not to have her cheeks be pulled by Japanese soldiers like Chen Qun's wife. After the adjournment, she met with her children and discussed marriage issues with her second daughter. She still constantly thinks about family matters, but after saying a few words, she was escorted back by the bailiffs.

### She Aizhen

Continues to Support Wu Shibao to Save Face

Another [person] — Wang Zhi's [insect] She Aizhen, through the investigation by Prosecutor Yang Ding and Secretary Li Zhang, was interrogated in court in the afternoon. She was also barefoot, wearing leather shoes, and a light purple fine checkered cheongsam, with a large hair bun on the back of her head. When the photographer aimed the camera at her to take a picture, she reversed her previous shy appearance and faced it calmly. First, Prosecutor Yang asked her when she entered No. 76. She cleverly raised her hand, covered her mouth with a handkerchief, thought for a moment, and then replied: "It was in August of the 28th year [of the Republic: 1939]." [Prosecutor] asked: "When did you come out?" She replied: "In the 29th year [of the Republic: 1940], I contracted typhoid fever, so I moved out in September." [Prosecutor] asked: "Until what year did you work as an accountant for the pseudo-police guard team?" She replied: "I stopped working after leaving No. 76 in the 29th year [of the Republic: 1940]." [Prosecutor] asked: "Why did you stop working?" She then deliberately raised her voice and replied: "I was only nominally in the position." When asked about the internal situation of the Special Service Headquarters, she hesitated and did not give a detailed answer. Therefore, she was ordered to temporarily withdraw.

Witness Testimony Incomprehensible

Another witness, Xia Zhongming, was summoned. Xia was a translator at No. 76 and also served as the director of the pseudo-Investigation and Statistics Department. According to his testimony: He joined the pseudo-government in July of the 28th year [of the Republic: 1939] and knew that Wu Shibao died in Suzhou in the 31st year [of the Republic: 1942]. The actual person in charge of No. 76 was Li Shiqun. He did not understand the internal affairs of the guard team, and he did not know about She Aizhen's evil deeds. Subsequently, Li Zulai, the deputy manager of the pseudo-Bank of China, was interrogated. When asked about his relationship with Yu Aizhen, he replied that he had only met her a few times and was not familiar with her. All the rumors circulating outside were false. As for She Aizhen's crimes, he had no evidence and could not make blind statements, so he did not know what her behavior was like. However, what he had previously provided regarding She's property was true. Shen Fenggang also testified: He originally worked for the central government. After being arrested twice in the 28th year [of the Republic: 1939], he joined the guard team of the Special Service Headquarters at No. 76. Wu Shibao was the captain of the team at that time, and She Aizhen did not hold any position. He also did not know about the arrest of Fang Yexian.

Still Trying to Cover Up Her Husband's Crimes

At this point, Prosecutor Yang summoned She Aizhen to the court again. She admitted that she had served as an accountant for the pseudo-police guard team, but she still tried to cover up her husband's crimes in every way. She even tried to save face for her deceased husband, saying: "Gambling tables in western Shanghai existed before the war and did not become prosperous due to Wu Shibao's influence. There was no opium smoking. As for the so-called table money, it was not that Shibao wanted it, but those old gamblers themselves offered it to him as a sign of respect." After Secretary Li recorded everything in the file, he announced the adjournment of the court and rescheduled the interrogation.

### City Shelters Ordered to be Demolished — The Public Works Bureau Decides to Implement Next Week

[Report from our newspaper] Recently, the trend of building shelters has been very rampant. Some citizens are unwilling to respect the property rights of owners, regardless of the area, and arbitrarily choose other people's land to build houses on a large scale. Although the Public Works Bureau has issued a notice to demolish them, many still ignore it. Even the Public Works Bureau and the Police Bureau sent personnel to a certain place the other day to intervene and were beaten. The Public Works Bureau had previously announced that all shelters within the city were not allowed to be built, and building houses in the suburbs was only allowed more than 15 feet away from the highway. Now that the deadline for demolishing houses has arrived, the Public Works Bureau has decided to cooperate with the Police Bureau starting next week to forcibly order the demolition. In addition, for those who forcibly occupy other people's land, the owners can also appeal to the Public Works Bureau to request demolition. At the same time, the bureau will soon announce regulations to resolve the current illegal construction of houses.

### Chen Yuansheng Defeated by a Young Girl — The Main Culprit in the Gold Bar Case Captured in Shangyu and Escorted to Shanghai — Sick and Weary in the Depths of a Secluded Bamboo Grove, Holding a Pot and a Scroll

Suddenly Raises His Head as if Waking from a Dream — Do You Remember the Time When We Picked Up Gold Together by the Water?

[Report from our newspaper] These days, every Shanghai resident, when opening the newspaper, cannot help but take a look at that long advertisement: "The Central Bank offers a reward for the arrest of fugitive Chen Yuansheng..." Gradually, everyone seems to become familiar with this young man who is only thirty years old.

Chen Yuansheng stole gold bars and US dollar bills and fled on May 23rd. Yesterday, June 22nd, he was escorted to Shanghai by the police. The value of gold bars, US dollars, and a lifetime of reputation is not small, but what Chen Yuansheng got was only thirty days of joy!

When the theft was discovered at the Central Bank of Shanghai, a young traveler who had just arrived from Shanghai came to the Huaxing Apartment in Hangzhou. He was wearing a beige youth suit, yellow leather shoes, a white straw hat, and black glasses, and opened a room at number 69. On the registration book, he wrote: "Chen Junshi, age 30."

This Chen Junshi was very generous, spending three to four hundred thousand every day, as if it were nothing. He played in Hangzhou for a week, living a life of pleasure every day. On June 1st, he went to Suzhou and Jiaxing to play again, and returned to Hangzhou after another six or seven days.

At that time, Hangzhou had just started banning dancing. Chen Junshi became a generous Meng Changjun in front of those Yingying and Yanyan.

However, when he returned to the apartment, he had already bought all the newspapers and carefully read them with a little panic.

On June 12th, he suddenly asked the tea boy: "How do you get to number 37 Yangfang Bridge, Baochu Pagoda?"

Number 37 Yangfang Bridge is a delicate villa. Chen Junbao found it that day and stayed there until June 17th. He told the old woman at the door that he was going out to a wedding and would probably be back in a day or two.

But he was too flustered and left a note in the room with a simple map and the words "Shangyu, Zhejiang" written on it.

Chen Junshi disappeared on June 18th. But at 1:00 PM that day, the Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau received a top-secret phone call. Someone secretly reported that Chen Yuansheng had been discovered in Hangzhou!

At 4:00 PM that day, Zhou Guanghui, the judicial section chief of the Huangpu Branch, patrol officer Yao Hongzhang, and battalion commander Han Zuchen, boarded a special express train to Hangzhou. At 9:00 PM, they arrived in Hangzhou and immediately joined forces with the Provincial Police Bureau to launch a very strict search. A waiter at the Xiyuan Cafe said that he had seen such a person, who was always accompanied by beautiful dancers and singers and often ate at Guanshengyuan... That person lived in the Huaxing Apartment... and went to Baochu Pagoda Yangfang Bridge!

It was already 1:00 AM, and it was pouring rain. Section Chief Zhou and his party rushed to the villa and found the note with the words "Shangyu, Zhejiang"!

The next day, they set off for Shangyu. After crossing the Qiantang River and arriving at Xixing, a ticket seller at the Hangzhou-Cao'e Highway bus station had seen such a person who chartered a car to the Cao'e River. The police officers chased after them, passing through Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. At 3:00 PM, they crossed the Cao'e River and chased to Baiguan.

During the inspection in Baiguan, a tea boy at a small inn told them that two days ago, a 30-year-old Ningbo youth named Chen Long had stayed overnight but had already taken a boat to Shangyu.

The detectives walked over a high mountain, reached Lianghu, fifteen miles away, hired a foot-rowed boat, and after a thirty-five-mile water journey, chased to Shangyu at 7:30 PM!

This "Chen Long" had a haircut in Shangyu and asked a sedan chair carrier how to get to Dingjiazhai Taochangwan. The sedan chair carrier asked for 35,000 yuan. He said he didn't have enough money. A charcoal seller volunteered to show him the way, and he left Shangyu.

The police officers found the charcoal seller. There was no boat in the small river, so they waded across. Ahead was a thirty-mile rugged mountain road!

At the end of the road was a cliff. The police officers climbed up through the thorns. This was Taochangwan!

All around were bamboo forests. In the depths of the secluded bamboo grove, in front of a thatched cottage, an old woman was weaving bamboo ware.

Chen Yuansheng was sitting next to the thatched cottage!

He held a wine pot in his right hand and a book in his left hand. When he saw the police officers, he said very politely: "You've worked hard!"

He said: He reads the newspapers every day and doesn't want so many relatives and friends to be involved in lawsuits because of him alone. He hasn't slept well for three nights, and the barking of dogs in the deep night has deepened his unforgettable worries! He has had chills and fever for several days.

He said, "I am very ashamed to have troubled you so much--but if you had come a day later, I'm afraid I wouldn't be here."

Chen Yuansheng was really sick and couldn't walk, so the police officers helped him down the mountain. They rushed back to Baiguan that night. When they arrived in Xixing, the river was closed. The small boat rushed through the wind and waves in the dark night. At 10:30 PM, they arrived in Hangzhou. Chen Yuansheng tasted the taste of iron bars for the first time at the Provincial Police Bureau.

At 6:10 PM yesterday afternoon, the excited police officers excitedly brought Chen Yuansheng to the Huangpu Branch.

In this month, Chen Yuansheng finally lived a few days in "paradise." He went to Suzhou, Hangzhou, and swam in West Lake with beautiful young girls. He visited Lingdui Temple. In front of Lingyin Temple, a gold bar suddenly fell out of his pocket and fell into the gutter. The young girl bent down to pick it up, but Chen Yuansheng said, "Why bother? Life is important!"

It is said that the one who called the Huangpu Branch was this young girl!

When Chen Yuansheng left Shanghai, he took three gold bars and 260,000 yuan in cash. One bar fell in Hangzhou, and one bar had already been exchanged for thirty days of enjoyment. The Central Bank can only get back one gold bar. The 2 million yuan reward to catch Chen Yuansheng is probably about the same.

### The Issue of the Time When the Grain Case Occurred — Whether to Convict According to the Interim Regulations on Grain Management — The Garrison Headquarters is Seeking Instructions from the Highest Authorities

[Report from our newspaper] The Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters was still sorting out the results of the interrogation of the defendants in the grain loan case yesterday. The presiding judge's desk was piled high with documents. According to his statement to reporters, this work may take two or three days. The Military Law Department's review of the grain case is divided into three parts: one is the collusion and embezzlement of grain officials and rice merchants who obtained grain loans, one is the suspicion of hoarding rice by Wu Rongsheng of the San Tai Company and Wang Xunzhi of the Yangtze River Company; and the other is the suspicion of Rong Yongming raising prices. Also, because the "Interim Regulations on Grain Management During Extraordinary Times" were initially promulgated in Shanghai in June and listed as a pilot area, and the occurrence of each grain case was before June, it is still under instructions from the highest authorities whether to convict the defendants based on these regulations. According to a reporter's investigation, Rong Yongming will be interrogated again tomorrow, Monday, and several witnesses will be summoned at that time. A verdict can be made after the interrogation.

### The Grain Loan Embezzlement Case — Senators Will Express Their Views

[Report from our newspaper] The grain loan embezzlement case reported by Inspector Cheng involves the so-called collusion between officials and merchants and several points of joint embezzlement.

### Zhu Shunlin, the Boss of the Gambling Tables During the Enemy and Puppet Period, Puts on a Pitiful Appearance — The High Court Concludes that He is Not a Traitor — Transferred to the District Court, Which Held a Trial Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] Zhu Shunlin, the chief inspector of gambling tables such as "Hollywood," "Hui Le Palace," and "Six Nations Hotel" in the western Shanghai area of ​​criminal soil during the enemy and puppet era, and the owner of the "Dasheng" gambling house in the southern city, was previously prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being a traitor. After interrogation, it was determined that he was not a traitor and was transferred to the District Court for handling. The case was tried by Prosecutor Ye Guiling in the Third Criminal Court at 3:30 PM yesterday. Zhu hired Lawyer Ma Zhenzong to defend him. Although Zhu Shunlin had been detained for a long time, he was still full of energy and physically strong. He was still very energetic when answering questions, but when asked about his property, he put on a very pitiful appearance. He claimed: "I initially opened a leather shoe store and later did real estate business. As for the Shun Yuan Tea House, it has been open for more than ten years and only sells tea, not gambling. After the war broke out, I couldn't afford to go inland, and my life in Shanghai was poor. The bosses of 'Hollywood' and 'Six Nations Hotel' pitied my poverty and asked me to watch the door and prevent petty thieves." At this point, Zhu rolled up the sleeves of his gray Paris long gown and wiped his mouth, shamelessly saying: "I have always been afraid of the pseudo-police bureau and No. 76. How could I be qualified to contact them and open a gambling house?" When talking about property, he said that he only had a few pieces of land, which had already been submitted to the authorities, and that his son owned the other properties.

### Roundtable Discussion on Relieving the Housing Shortage: Emphasis on Taxing Unrented Vacant Properties and Encouraging Landlords to Rent by Appropriately Increasing Rents

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Social Service Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, in response to the increasingly severe housing shortage in the city, held a roundtable discussion at its office at 2:00 PM yesterday. It invited representatives from the media and relevant government leaders, including Wang Guanqing, representing Mayor Wu, Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan, and over thirty reporters from various newspapers. Xiang Xueru, the director of the preparatory office, presided over the meeting, stating that to solve the housing shortage problem in the city, he would like to ask all present to base their concrete suggestions on the principles for relieving the housing shortage laid down by Chairman Chiang, so as to provide a reference for the authorities to resolve the housing crisis. He also stated that if vacant houses are found not to be rented in the future, the authorities should impose heavy taxes on them, and the tax revenue collected could be used as funds for building affordable housing. Wang, representing Mayor Wu, spoke, saying that the housing shortage is not only a social problem but also a political one, and therefore he hoped that citizens would embrace a spirit of service and cooperate fully. According to the principles for relieving the housing shortage stipulated by Chairman Chiang, the area of housing per person should not exceed 100 square feet. If it does, the competent authority may impose a housing excess tax, with a progressive tax rate. That is, for every 100 square feet exceeding the limit, 40,000 yuan will be charged per day, and it is stipulated that the maximum should not exceed three times the original amount; otherwise, the authorities will force the property to be rented out. Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan then provided three concrete measures: (1) To eliminate the bad practice of topping housing prices with gold bars in the city, the advertisements for house rentals in newspapers should be strictly prohibited in the future, or the Housing Management Committee could be responsible for renting out properties at reasonable rents for civilian use. (2) Appropriately increase housing rents in the city to encourage landlords to rent out their properties. Finally, Chairman Xiang made a conclusion, briefly stating that the agencies responsible for housing management are still not unified. The office will suggest that this work be generally under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, and that fairness should be strived for, especially in the allocation of housing. The roundtable discussion ended at around 5:00 PM.

### Shanghai and Qingdao Promote Electro-Education by Utilizing Enemy and Puppet Movie Theaters

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] In order to promote electro-education, the Ministry of Education has formulated and implemented plans in the past two years, and has repeatedly notified all provinces and cities to comply. Among them, the establishment of electro-education centers and educational radio stations is a matter of urgency in the plan. Guangxi took the lead in establishing a provincial educational radio station on May 15th, broadcasting educational news exclusively. Qingdao took the lead in establishing an electro-education center, and the scale is quite grand. Ningxia, Fujian, Shandong, Hubei, Shanghai, Qingdao, Peiping, and other provinces and cities all have plans and have reported them to the Ministry of Education. It is recently learned that the former Victory, Haiguang, Minyuan, and Three Movie Theaters, which were taken over in Shanghai, are now jointly managed by the Shanghai Municipal Social and Educational Bureaus and have been converted into public theaters. Currently, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, considering them enemy properties, intends to auction them. The Ministry of Education believes that the establishment of an electro-education center should be included in the electro-education promotion plan, and that movie theaters can be utilized. If an auction is necessary, the Municipal Education Bureau can acquire them at a relatively low estimated price, which would save public funds and achieve the practical benefits of promoting electro-education. It has been reported to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Education, ordering the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau not to auction them directly, but to transfer them to the Municipal Education Bureau for the purpose of establishing an electro-education center, in order to facilitate the implementation of the plan. In addition, the Qingdao Municipal Government has taken over three movie theaters of Japanese and German origin and has converted one into a well-equipped electro-education center, one for the use of the Qingnian Tuan Municipal Party Headquarters, and one leased to a commercial enterprise. After consultation between the Ministry of Education and the Central Propaganda Department, it has been decided that one will be used by the Central Propaganda Department, and two will be used by the Municipal Education Bureau to operate electro-education centers and educational movie theaters. In addition, there are similar situations in Jinan and other places. The Ministry of Education has reported the situation to the relevant departments and ministries, hoping that all provinces and cities will implement the electro-education plan as soon as possible.

### Feature Article: India's Only School of Journalism

— Zhou Xiangguang

Punjab University

The newspaper industry in India can be considered quite developed. Every city and town has its own local newspaper, in addition to English, there are also newspapers in local languages. For example, in Calcutta, in addition to English, there are newspapers in Bengali and Urdu; in Lahore, there are newspapers in Punjabi, which is an exception. Although the Indian newspaper industry is developing rapidly, the only educational institution in India that trains newspaper professionals is the Department of Journalism at Punjab University. This spring, at the invitation of Professors Nath and Bandhu of Punjab University, the author took the Indian Northwest Railway train from Hardwar in the Himalayas to Lahore. This is the capital of Punjab Province, called the Five Rivers in Chinese Buddhist scriptures, and is one of India's ancient cities. Before British rule in India, it was the former capital of the Muhammadan and Sikh Empires. The tall, red-turbaned policemen who serve in the Shanghai Police Department today are Sikhs. Today, it is an important center for Northwest India's border defense, education, industry, and commerce. Regarding education, there are thirteen colleges and countless primary and secondary schools in Lahore. In order to thoroughly understand the teaching situation of the Department of Journalism at Punjab University, the author was accompanied by an Indian friend, Professor Nath, to visit the university. According to the records, the Department of Journalism at Punjab University was established on October 1, 1941. Although its history is not long, the department has developed rapidly. All the graduates work in major newspapers across India. The current Deputy Director of the Information Bureau of Punjab Province is a graduate of the department. There are six full-time professors in the department, and the lecturers are all concurrently held by presidents and editors-in-chief of local newspapers, who come to the school to teach classes on time. The chairman of the department is Mr. Singh (Prof. P.P. Singh), who graduated from the Missouri School of Journalism in the United States and the Department of Journalism at the University of London in the United Kingdom, and is a pioneer in the Indian press. The admission level for students is that they must have a bachelor's degree. The study period is set for one year. The class time for the department is set from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day, so some graduate students of the school can not only take their regular courses every morning, but also take new courses in the afternoon, which is more convenient for professional youth who are interested in the newspaper industry to have the opportunity to pursue further studies. Often, when graduate students graduate, they receive two diplomas, one for their undergraduate major and one for the certificate from the Department of Journalism. The tuition fee for students is 15 shields per month, and the food cost is 25 shields. Including other certificate fees, registration fees, library borrowing deposits, and membership fees for the Journalism Society, the total cost is only about 50 shields per month. The savings in cost can be imagined. There are three examination papers for student graduation: (1) Theory of Journalism, (2) English News Writing, (3) Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi News Writing. As for the daily courses of the department, they can be roughly divided into five categories: (1) News Interviewing, (2) News Layout, (3) News Writing, (4) Galley Proofreading, (5) Book Discussion. In addition to these, there are auxiliary courses such as business management, advertising, history of journalism, comparative journalism, and journalistic ethics, which are quite complete. At the same time, in addition to textbook teaching, the school authorities arrange for students of the department to practice in various newspaper offices from time to time, so as to verify theory and work with each other, and achieve the effect of knowing and acting as one. There are many newspapers in Lahore, the most famous of which is the Civil & Military Gazette, which has the widest circulation. The issuance of Indian newspapers mostly has its background. Some are British official newspapers, such as the Statesman, and some are propaganda for various parties, such as the Amrita Bazar Patrika (Congress Party), the Morning News (affiliated to the Muslim League), and the Nationalist Newspaper (affiliated to the Hindu Mahasabha). The author has consulted with graduates of the department, and they know little about the Chinese newspaper industry. When I mentioned that there are two newspapers in Calcutta, one is the China Daily (its remarks are closer to democracy) and the other is the Indian Daily (the Kuomintang's official newspaper), they admired them even more. People in our country who are engaged in cultural undertakings, because they are separated by foreign languages, have not been able to spread the culture of their motherland to foreign lands. In the future, the world will realize press freedom, and press freedom will be used as a means to establish lasting international peace. We hope that our colleagues in the newspaper industry should cooperate and connect with foreign newspaper organizations to achieve the effect of mutual understanding. This is the author's hope.

### Hong Kong-Shanghai Football United Team Competes Today, Xingdong vs. Hualian, 4:30 PM at Yiyuan

Tickets for Maintaining Order are 10,000 Yuan Each

The Hong Kong Xingdong United Football Team will make its sixth appearance in Shanghai at Yiyuan at 4:30 PM this afternoon, against the Hualian Team of Qingbai and Donghua United. The players of the Hualian Team are all famous football stars in Shanghai, and their strength is unparalleled. Since the Hong Kong army was defeated by Qingbai last time, the addition of Donghua's strong players will make the battle even more intense. According to the notice from the Football Committee yesterday, in order to limit the audience in order to maintain order in the stadium, the ticket prices have been readjusted, and all seats are priced at 10,000 yuan. Military police must also enter the venue with tickets. In addition to 30% of the ticket revenue being used as travel expenses and necessary expenses for the Xingdong Team, the rest will be allocated to various charitable organizations in the city for relief and charitable causes. Tickets will be sold at the Municipal Gymnasium starting at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The referee is He Chunhui, and the linesmen are Wu Shouheng and Huang Renyi. The full lineup of 17 players for the Hualian Team will be decided before the game. The Xingdong lineup was decided last night by team leader Hu Hao and captain Xu Jingcheng after careful discussion and is recorded as follows:

Hualian

Zhang Banglun

Li Ning, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang

Zhai Yongfu, Song Lingsheng, Xin Fuzhen, Meng Yangliang, Gao Baozheng

Cao Qiuting, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Han Longhai, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang, Fei Chunhua

(Management) Wang Xinheng, E Sen

The Hualian Lineup Will Be Decided Temporarily

The Hualian Team will face Xingdong today. A total of seven generals have been carefully selected and decided by the Football Committee. Looking at the list above, it is known that it will not be difficult to line up a strong lineup at that time. Although the official battle money is yet to be decided on the spot, it is generally speculated that Banglun will be the goalkeeper, the defense will be shared by Yan Shixin and Wu Qixiang, and the center back will belong to Xin Fuzhen. The most ideal forwards are Zhai Yongfu and Gao Baozheng. Cao Qiuting could have played as the five forwards, but in order to retreat and make way for the capable, Li Yao will be sent. Li Yao and A Sun have a tacit understanding. Li Yichen is recommended as the center forward. If A Kui and Chunhua cooperate, they will definitely be able to perform their duties happily. It is not yet known how the authorities will decide.

Xingdong

Zhu Zhaoheng

Xu Jingcheng, Huo Yaohua

Luo Quan, Guo Yingqi, Liu Songsheng

Li Shuoyou, Li Zhaorong, Zhang Jinhai, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen

(New Recruits) Hou Rongsheng, Feng Kunsheng

Xingdong Changes the Center Back Lineup

The Xingdong guest army, in view of the lessons learned from the battle with Qingbai, yesterday decided after careful discussion by team leader Hu Hao and captain Xu Jingcheng. Goalkeeper Zhu Zhaoheng, although slightly flustered in previous battles, has recently made progress. The defense is shared by the left-footed king and Huo Yaohua, with Guo Yingqi as the center back and Luo Weiquan and Liu Songsheng assisting on the left and right. In terms of forwards, Li Shuoyou and Li Zhaorong each take their positions. Zhang Jinhai is in charge of the central army. Feng Jingxiang and Deng Guangsen have also found their places. Such an arrangement can be called quite considerable. Today, there is no problem with Xingdong's forwards and defenders. Whether Jingcheng can hold the middle line after being transferred will be the key to today's victory or defeat.

### Government Bond Black Market Collapses, Unsecured C Bond Drops Another 600 Yuan, Operators Gather to Discuss Cessation of Trading

The government bond market collapsed yesterday, with the black market in utter disarray. Prices varied wildly, with trading resembling a "bargaining" session. Many parties were preparing to take delivery, while short sellers had no bonds to deliver. Holders were also unwilling to easily sell off their physical bonds, creating a stalemate. Although the low price was reduced by 200 yuan, the value was too small. Apart from direct offsets, the actual volume of physical bonds traded was minimal. Trading in Unsecured C bonds only started sporadically after 9:30 AM, starting with a buy price of 200 yuan. Ultimately, short sellers covered some positions, with buys around 800 yuan, a further drop of 600 yuan compared to the previous close. Operators gathered to discuss suspending trading until after July, and there was also talk of requesting preferential treatment from the authorities. With no official trading, miscellaneous bonds remained quiet.

### Gold Price Drops, Down 65,000 Compared to Previous Day

Yesterday, the extension of the ceasefire order to the end of the month had already shifted sentiment. The central government further exerted pressure in the market. Under this double whammy, the gold price fell significantly yesterday. After opening at 1,975,000 in the early morning, it gradually declined. Bulls frantically sold off their positions, and the central government supplied the market, creating an oversupply. After 10:00 AM, it retreated below 1,930,000. The central government allocated 77 bars at a price of 1,920,000, with the low price falling to 1,915,000. It rebounded slightly at noon, and the afternoon was extremely quiet. As a result, it closed down 65,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were at 200,040, silver bullion was flat, and the secret discount rate remained at 1.2 to 1.5 cents.

### U.S. Dollar Recedes, Hong Kong Dollar Continues to Rise

The U.S. dollar also receded slightly, but remained stable after the initial dip. It opened at 2710 yuan in the morning and gradually declined after the opening. The gold market was weak and bearish, and there was active selling of stocks. It retreated to a low of 2630 yuan before stabilizing slightly. At noon, it rebounded to around 2660 yuan. The afternoon was quiet. As a result, it closed down 70 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar continued to rise, peaking and then slightly declining. As a result, it closed up 15 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to climb, but trading was not as brisk as the previous day. The high price was 540 yuan, and then it receded slightly. The Robbie exchange rate was passively driven up to 650 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 8,000 yuan. All lacked matching transactions due to procedural issues. The official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar remained flat.

### Yarn and Cotton are Flat and Weak, Cloth Market Gradually Improves

The yarn market turned mediocre yesterday. The Cantonese-produced "Double Horse" yarn's appetite had waned, and its price fell by 30,000 to 40,000. Small and medium-sized yarns were considered stable, but transactions were few. Only the Nanjing merchants handled a few dozen pieces of low-end 20-count yarn. There was considerable trading of 42-count yarn among peers, but the needs of practical manufacturers remained unmet.

Yesterday, the New York cotton telegram reported prices rising by 10 to 18 points. The near-term price was US$29.39, the forward price was US$29.54, and the spot price for middling cotton was US$30.01. The local spot cotton market was stable, but due to the weakness in the bond and gold markets, coupled with Saturday, manufacturers and cotton firms were mostly watching, resulting in very little trading. The cloth market improved slightly because the Cantonese merchants had a stronger appetite for bleached cloth and shirting. The Sichuan and Henan merchants searched for Serge cloth, further boosting confidence and improving the situation. However, other merchants were not very active. Cloth prices rose by 200, 250 to 50 yuan. At noon, the China Textile Corporation opened sales of various cloths at seemingly flat prices, and there was no supply of Serge, so the market became more expensive in the afternoon.

### Artificial Silk Suddenly Declines

Down over 100,000 yuan from the previous day

The artificial silk market, which is fluctuating and unpredictable, advanced sharply the day before yesterday, but declined rapidly yesterday. No. 120 Tianqiao Youshi silk opened at 1,820,000 yuan, with the lowest asking price briefly exceeding 780,000 yuan. It ultimately traded at 820,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it traded at 800,000 yuan, a decrease of 130,000 to 140,000 yuan from the previous day. Miscellaneous brands traded at 650,000 yuan and 600,000 yuan. No. 75 Jinyi Niuguang silk returned to the original price of 1,580,000 yuan from Wednesday. The factory trade was quiet, and trading was scarce. Asking prices remained unchanged. Dachang checkered crepe fell further. It traded at 5,350 yuan in the morning and 220 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of over 200 yuan from the previous day. Trade in Mayer bedsheets was minimal, and asking prices remained between 1,520,000 and 1,530,000 yuan.

### U.S. Platinum Price Increases, Near-Term Price at US$82.50

[Reuters, New York, 22nd] While the current list prices of major U.S. platinum manufacturers remain between US$53 and US$56 per ounce, the Commercial Daily reported today that some brokers have raised prices to US$80. Major Wall Street firms have also raised the price of platinum for near-term delivery to US$82.50 and the price for forward delivery to US$80.

### Refined White Sugar Reaches New High Price

Industry Demands Improvement in Opening Sales Methods

The sugar market was initially flat yesterday, then strengthened. Refined white sugar, due to its scarcity, became even more sought after, reaching a new high price. The association set the price for medium-grain white sugar for the 20th at 110,000 yuan in the morning, then slightly lowered it to 107,000 to 8,000 yuan. It closed at 8,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it tightened again to 110,000 to 112,000 yuan. The warehouse receipt price for the 20th was 108,000 yuan, and for the 22nd was 110,000 yuan. Three-Ox refined white sugar was set at 150,000 yuan, a rise of over 10,000 yuan. Raw sugar was also set at a high price of 103,000 to 4,000 yuan. The association opened quotations for Xinghua white sugar at 115,000 yuan to 119,000 yuan, Xinghua brown sugar at 105,000 to 6,000 yuan, totaling over 100 pieces, and Diaojing at over 20 pieces at 96,000 yuan, a rise of 4,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the industry held a meeting at the association and decided to request the Taiwan Sugar Company to improve its opening sales methods. The best approach would be to follow the methods used in the first period, which were fairer and more appropriate. The company, which operates Taiwan Sugar, has an absolute advantage and convenience in terms of procurement and transportation. It also has full initiative in terms of opening sales. Therefore, it seems appropriate to provide some convenience to the industry in order to achieve mutual assistance and avoid causing resentment.

According to a person in charge of the Taiwan Sugar Company, publicly dumping sugar is not a definitive solution. The company has nearly 200,000 tons of sugar in stock in Taiwan. Next week, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chen and the Maersk Taipei will transport a total of about 10,000 tons to Shanghai. At that time, it will try its best to supply the market in order to effectively suppress prices. He continued, the reasons for this sugar price fluctuation are nothing more than: (1) increased consumption due to summer cold drinks, (2) sugar prices in Tianjin and Hankou being almost 50% higher than in Shanghai, and (3) merchants hoarding, with some even reselling warehouse receipts at high prices in the market.

### More U.S. Cotton Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Reporter] The American President Lines' Dr. Lykes, carrying over 26,770 bales of cotton from Seattle, arrived yesterday morning and is currently unloading at the Gonglixiang Wharf in Hongkou. In addition, the company's George Peake Lykes is also carrying cotton and is expected to arrive in port today.

### Caustic Soda Is Confirmed to Be Distributed, More Goods Are Expected to Arrive Next Week

According to a Japanese firm in Shanghai that deals in caustic soda, rumors that a certain foreign firm will soon begin distributing caustic soda are not entirely unfounded. This is because the foreign firm currently has a large quantity of caustic soda in storage and must calculate the amount to be distributed based on pre-war consumption. It is said that the previous distribution was divided into four categories, A, B, C, and D, and the quantity distributed in each category will be more generous than before. However, it is still difficult to predict whether the price will remain the same as the previous distribution, which was 160,000 yuan per unit. However, it is generally believed that foreign firms will not change their consistent dumping policy due to market price fluctuations.

According to a local merchant in this city, a large batch of caustic soda is expected to arrive in Shanghai next week. The volume of transactions inside and outside the market was quite small yesterday, with only small, urgent users buying. Because foreign goods are pouring in, people are bearish, and holders are finding it difficult to sell. Most users are also taking a wait-and-see attitude.

### Longkou Vermicelli Prices Continue to Rise

Longkou vermicelli continues to rise in price due to continuous sales in Guangdong and Hong Kong. The market hit new highs again yesterday. Upstream merchants opened at 165,000 yuan, a rise of over 10,000 yuan. Trade prices were 170,000 yuan, and the outlook remains tight because inventory is low and there is little sign of easing.

Asia Faces 40 Billion Pound Rice Shortage, Comparison of World Rice Production Before and After the War [Reuters, New York, 2nd] World rice production for the 1945-46 season has fallen to 6,200,000,000 U.S. bushels, compared to 6,800,000,000 U.S. bushels in the previous year. The pre-war average was 7,400,000,000 U.S. bushels. According to trade sources, domestic production in the United States may increase in the 1946-47 season. The area most affected by the shortage this season is Asia, where the decline in production is unprecedented. The amount of rice available for export from various countries in the world in 1946 is estimated to be about 2 billion to 4 billion pounds, while the rice shortage in Asia is estimated to reach 40 billion pounds. Food shortages in China, India, Japan, and the Philippine Islands are extremely serious this year.

### Tung Oil and Hog Bristles Exported in Large Quantities

Recent export trade has gradually picked up. Tung oil and hog bristles accounted for the largest share of transactions in a week. The reason for this is that the British exchange rate is gradually returning to normal and the overseas market is expanding. As a result, not only can foreign exchange be increased, but domestic products can also gradually tend to balance with global prices. Since the opening of foreign exchange in our country, although it has absorbed a large amount of materials, the "materials" side has been abundant for a while, and prices have been flat. However, the "labor" side is still rising sharply, so the general price level has not been able to return to normal as expected, and the Chinese people have no way to make an accurate judgment. Now, relying on the overseas sales of export goods, a reasonable adjustment can be made with reference to world prices.

### Hong Kong Stipulates Profits on Imported Goods

[Hong Kong News] The authorities in this city previously strengthened price controls. In addition to continuing to set official prices for daily necessities such as firewood, rice, and certain grains, official prices were also set for all goods sold freely by merchants to show restrictions. Recently, the prices set by stores were still higher than official prices, so it was also stipulated that a fixed profit should be universally added to imported goods. The profit margin must not exceed 20%. Recently, because it has been easier to purchase U.S. dollars than before, the number of goods coming to Hong Kong has been increasing daily, and new U.S. goods have also been arriving one after another. There are especially many Australian goods in the market.

### China Silk Corporation Purchases Chinese Silk from China Trust Bureau

The total amount of loans for spring cocoons this year was originally set at 20 billion, and the actual loan amount was 16.88477 billion as of June 18. The banking syndicate has decided to stop issuing the remaining loans from now on in order to close the account.

The China Silk Corporation approved the first batch of 21 factories exchanging cocoons for silk in March this year. As of the 20th of this month, the factories had paid more than 1,200 bundles of raw silk. The company currently has a large amount of silk in stock and has sent personnel to negotiate a contract with the barter department of the China Trust Bureau. It is heard that the contract stipulates that all raw silk of the company will be purchased by the China Trust Bureau for export.

### Chinese Stocks Affected by Government Bonds, No Formal Trading in the Market Yesterday, Asking Prices Continued to Fall Compared to Previous Close, Another Three Firms Bankrupt

Several large accounts in Chinese stocks were also affected and ran into problems. Operators who were themselves experiencing difficulty all announced the suspension of business. There was no formal trading in the market yesterday. Sporadic trading only started after 10:00 AM. At the lowest point, Yongsha was at 470 yuan, Mayer was below 2700 yuan, Jingfu was at 190 yuan, Xinguang was at 195 yuan, and Qinxing was at 160 yuan. Afterwards, they gradually rebounded. Bulls and bears mutually offset positions. Although trading was quiet, high prices were seen at noon. Only small and medium-sized unpopular stocks with relatively solid fundamentals saw some trading, and asking prices were also slightly affected. Blue-chip stocks were not quoted. As a result, calculating according to the asking prices compared to the previous close, all stocks fell by about half a percent, except for Qinxing, which was flat. The future situation is extremely uncertain. As for foreign stocks, trading was still normal, and various stocks were passively affected downwards. Yisha reached a low price of 8200 yuan and then rebounded slightly. Except for Jardine, British American Tobacco, and Wheelock Marden, there was little activity in other stocks, and they continued to trend downwards. At noon, they turned sideways. As a result, calculating the previous close, Jardine, BAT, and Wheelock Marden were flat, while Yisha, Yipi, Paper, and Steel all experienced slight declines.

Furthermore, the problems of bankruptcies and liquidations of Tianyi and Feida have not yet been resolved. It was reported yesterday that Renchang, Tongsheng on the seventh floor of the Securities Building and Damai on the eighth floor of the Overseas Chinese Building on Central Road, three securities firms, also announced bankruptcy and liquidation.

### Qihong Production Prices Are High, Difficult to Reach Agreement in Negotiations

According to news from the tea producing area in Qimen, Anhui, the new tea has already been released on the market this year and has now arrived in Hangzhou. However, due to the unusually high cost of harvesting, processing, and all payments, the cost is alarmingly high. Although buyers have recently approached the owners to negotiate, the two sides have quoted their own prices, so no satisfactory solution has been reached so far. Other varieties that arrived in Shanghai were still in continuous supply, but holders are maintaining firm prices because they know that tea prices in the producing area have not decreased slightly. As a result, shops and merchants in this street and Suzhou and other places have been affected by their inability to trade as they wish, and their attitude is to wait and see. Transactions have decreased significantly, and the market is unusually quiet. Prices are generally stable. As for the foreign tea market, even Japanese tea merchants are actively seeking solutions. Several firms, including Changxin, Anhui Xinhua, and Zhenhe, are continuing to work overtime and are planning to declare exports within days.

### Woolen Fabrics Idle

In the woolen fabric market, because the summer sales season has passed and the autumn sales season has yet to arrive, and South American woolen fabrics continue to arrive in port, the discount rate remains at two cents. There are few who pre-order or buy, resulting in a decline in both wholesale and retail transactions. There is no proper demand from merchants in various places. General brokers who are running the streets gathering business in clothing stores and tea houses on Changle Road and Qipan Street are also gradually decreasing. As a result, the prices of various goods are mostly flat and weak. Actual Sales of Miscellaneous Grains are Lively, Very Little Trading in Rice Market

### Actual Sales of Miscellaneous Grains are Lively, Very Little Trading in Rice Market

There was still little trading in the rice market yesterday. The goods of each rice shop are allocated by the designated rice firm in the market according to the market price. People's minds are still considered stable. The original prices of each grade of goods have not changed. However, there is little trading in inferior goods. Generally, inferior goods have been traded as high-grade goods. The number of guest goods registered yesterday did not increase. The total number was only 1,699 stone, including 809 stone of white japonica, 50 stone of light and thin slightly, 190 stone of sheep indica, 75 stone of Du indica, 150 stone of non-indica, 224 stone of white, and 201 stone of milled indica.

The trend of miscellaneous grains is strong and stable. Wheat export merchants are actively collecting and transporting goods to Qingdao and other places. Recent arrivals are still strong. Supply and demand in the market is active. Prices continue to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Actual sales of soybeans and broad beans are lively. Transactions are active, and prices are advancing upwards. Today, they rose another 1,000 yuan or so. Because flour rose sharply yesterday, there is fear that it will rise again, which will affect the market for various goods, so there are no transactions for the time being. The oil market is considered stable. Trading is normal, and prices are hovering. Soybean cake rose 200 to 300 yuan along with soybeans.

### A New Feat by Our Air Force's 8th Group: First Flight to Japan

— Zhu Minwei

Taking Off from Datong Airport, Heading Towards Tokyo

On the morning of May 27th, a silver-white, four-engine aircraft with twin rudders took off from Shanghai's Datong Airport. Zhou Zhirou, Director of the Aeronautical Affairs Commission, silently watched as the aircraft, whose takeoff he had ordered, now took off perfectly. This aircraft was fully fueled and equipped with sound machinery and skilled pilots. Although it was the first flight to Tokyo, Japan, General Zhou was confident that it would arrive safely without any problems. After the aircraft's shadow had become small and distant, Group Leader Wang Shi accompanied General Zhou back to the barracks by car.

This aircraft flying to Japan was a B-24 model number 42461, piloted by Qian Zuren, Captain of the 33rd Squadron of the Air Force's 8th Group. Staff Officer Liu Shanben was in the co-pilot's seat, rotating piloting duties with Captain Qian every fifteen minutes. Navigator Yin Shiyue constantly calculated the heading and distance. Communicator Lin Daoyu, wearing headphones in front of the radio, attentively listened for radio signals. Mechanic Wang Jicheng was responsible for the aircraft's overall mechanical condition, assisted by Mechanic Xiong Daomei. Wang Kun, Communication Chief of the Air Transport Group, would sometimes even sit in the pilot's seat, taking the place of the co-pilot, allowing one of the pilots the leisure to have a cup of tea to quench their thirst.

Ten minutes after flying out of Datong, the Yellow Sea replaced the green lands of the Yangtze River Delta below the aircraft. According to the heading of 82 degrees, the flight from Shanghai to mainland Japan was gradually heading northeast. Because the aircraft was encountering a southwest monsoon blowing towards the northeast, with a boost of 20 knots per hour, it was advancing at an airspeed of 168 knots per hour.

Captain Qian Zuren's air operations group was one of the famous thirty groups in the Chinese Air Force. (The first group of personnel sent to the United States to learn to fly B-24 aircraft in 1943 were known as the "Thirty Groups.") This group, like others, hastily flew east across the Atlantic from the United States before the end of the war in 1945, fully expecting to fight the Japanese upon their return. However, during their frozen years in India, they watched the cherry blossoms suddenly wither. The heroes held a newspaper reporting Japan's surrender, regretting that they had not achieved their real mission. After that, they had no choice but to spend their time aging in Shanghai's garrison barracks. Fortunately, the restored land was so vast that the B-24's long-range flight could be like a whale in the ocean, allowing it to fly and swim freely. When the task of flying to Japan fell on them, it was, of course, even more exciting. After going out to sea, the flight altitude gradually increased, stabilizing at 9,000 feet. The Yellow Sea separated the fragmented Japanese islands from China by 450 nautical miles. Since last August, this sea was no longer Japan's inner lake; Japanese aircraft no longer flew over it, and even if ships sailed, it was not of Japan's own volition. The B-24 spent two hours and forty minutes at sea, almost like traveling in a dreamlike state. Not a single ship was seen, nor a single aircraft encountered. The green seawater reflected the unshielded, intense sunlight. Qian Zuren and Liu Shanben put on their flying goggles to look at the wind and waves outside the glass windows. They thought, "If we were bombing Japan, the journey would certainly not be so lonely, and the mood would not be as calm as when flying an air transport mission." They thought, "This is really a bit like taking a car to a desolate forest during a vacation in America, escaping the bustling human world to listen to the flowing springs."

Landing at Atsugi Airport, Welcomed by American Instructors

That morning, Liu Shanben drove a jeep to the American military base in Jiangwan to get the weather forecast, which turned out to be completely accurate. The forecast stated that there were no clouds at sea, which was now confirmed. The forecast stated that the wind speed was 15 to 20 knots, and now they were indeed getting a boost from the wind god, making the airspeed much faster than it would have been without wind. The forecast stated that the clouds over mainland Japan were initially below 5,000 feet. Near Mount Fuji, the endpoint of the journey, there were altocumulus clouds around 14,000 feet. Because Mount Fuji is 12,385 feet high, the flight altitude should be around 13,000 feet. All of this had to be confirmed after entering mainland Japan.

After noon, the aircraft entered the airspace over the Goto Islands, northwest of Kyushu, Japan's island group. Soon, Sasebo passed under the wing. The B-24 drew a line across the northern corner of Kyushu, entering the Iyo Nada Sea. Over Shikoku, the aircraft was still flying at 9,000 feet. Because there were no mountains higher than 9,000 feet in Japan before reaching Kyushu, there were clouds over Shikoku, and the aircraft flew above the clouds, constantly communicating with American radio stations on the ground. Leaving Shikoku's land, it crossed the sea over the Kii Channel, entering the Kii Mountains of Honshu south of Wakayama, and entering the Enshu Nada Sea. It should have proceeded straight ahead on a heading of 82 degrees to the island of Oshima in the Sagami Nada Sea outside Tokyo Bay, and then turned north on a heading of 10 degrees to Atsugi Airport. The route set by the Americans could be said to be very thorough and safe, but the pilots always wished they could arrive a minute earlier. Outside Enshu Nada, they made a turn and entered the airspace over Matsuham. From Matsuham, they brushed past the foot of Mount Fuji on the left. Mount Fuji was indeed majestic, over 12,000 feet high, with unmelted snow accumulating on its peak. The volcanic crater on the summit had wisps of black smoke. This mountain gave the Japanese some exaggerated arrogance, coupled with the delicate and easily withering cherry blossoms, combined with the Japanese virtues of gentleness, forming the Japanese warrior spirit. This crystallization, like the seismic force of the Japanese land strata, played out a tragedy for Japan. The aircraft landed on the 8,000-foot-long runway at Atsugi Airport. A group of American soldiers and personnel from the Chinese mission to Japan were waiting at the airport. Mission Head Zhu Shimin and Division Commander Dai Jian came forward first. Captain Qian shook hands with an instructor from the United States who was now serving at the American headquarters in Tokyo. The American instructor was quite proud that his student was able to fly an aircraft to Japan, introducing his star pupil to everyone, seemingly showing off even more than the Chinese.

Flying All Over Japan, Detouring to the Capital

On June 6th, the B-24 took off from Atsugi Airport, with Mission Head Zhu Shimin and Division Commander Dai Jian still as passengers. This time, they wanted to see the major cities scattered like stars on the entire map of Japan (more on what they saw in Tokyo in another report – Editor). They looked at the Imperial Palace from the air, flew south to Yokohama, circled over the Yokosuka naval port, then turned towards Shizuoka, passing over Matsuham again, and flew northwest to the old city of Nagoya. They circled over Nagoya, allowing Zhu Shimin and Dai Jian to observe from the air the future landing docks and camp locations for the Chinese occupation forces. Zhu and Dai also pointed out the camp sites to the pilots. Passing over Lake Biwa from Nagoya was Kyoto. Kyoto was the only city in mainland Japan that was intact, without any signs of bombing. Red tiles and white walls, the scenery was beautiful.

After the aircraft passed through Osaka and Kobe, it reached Hiroshima Bay on the southwest coast of Honshu to see Hiroshima. We all know that the atomic bomb struck Japan, and the first atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima.

Staff Officer Liu Shanben said, "Over Hiroshima, we saw four rivers flowing close together into Hiroshima Bay. We couldn't determine whether the Hiroshima city area was at the river's estuary. As we were searching, Mission Head Zhu pointed to a large, square, reddish-yellow field and said, 'This is Hiroshima, with a population of 110,000.' Our spirits were as if pricked by a needle, and we quickly focused our eyes on this world-shaking hundred-li yellow field. It was truly leveled. When buildings are destroyed, you can tell if it was an earthquake rather than a bombing by seeing the direction in which the remaining walls are leaning. There was not much debris in the bombed area. When it was bombed, people and houses were shaken into dust, scattered and falling, so there were no heavy remnants left. Strangely, there were three intact pure white buildings in the yellow field of Hiroshima. The only explanation is that the white color can resist the shock of the atomic bomb? We are not sure.

"At the triangular tip of the square, there were three clusters of houses. This was the area that the atomic bomb did not reach. At first glance, I thought that one of these three clusters of houses was Hiroshima, but Mission Head Zhu pointed it out, and we realized that Hiroshima had been completely wiped out, leaving only these three small tails of suburbs!"

The tall and slender Staff Officer Liu Shanben finished speaking, stood up, and said, "I didn't pay attention as we passed Nagasaki, the captain saw it."

I turned to look at Qian Zuren, who was smoking his pipe, blowing out a puff of smoke, and said, "Nagasaki was also bombed into a square fire field, ash-red in color."

"Just like the stove in our kitchen," Yin Shiyue added with a descriptive explanation. Qian emphasized and agreed with this explanation.

"I saw Nagasaki sandwiched between the mountains and the sea. The mountains are on the southeast side of the city, acting as a barrier to the shock of the atomic bomb. Because the houses outside the mountains were intact, the city of Nagasaki was a Y-shaped area, and the houses on the dike island extending into the sea were still intact. The square was surrounded by green trees and grass. Where the power did not reach, red-tiled foreign houses still stood, surviving the calamity," said Yin Shiyue.

They fully viewed the two atomic squares and then flew south from Nagasaki out to sea. On the way back, they encountered headwinds, plus they wandered east and west, detouring a lot, so they took off at 8:05 AM and didn't fly to the capital until 4:12 PM, flying for a total of 8 hours and 8 minutes before landing at the Datong airfield base outside Nanjing.

### The Largest Corruption Case in Hunan Province in Ten Years: The Investigation of Hu Mai's Charges

Our Newspaper's Changsha Dispatch, 10th [of Month]: Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli

The corruption case of Hu Mai, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Finance, was handed over by the Supreme Court for handling last September. After a detailed investigation by the Changsha District Court's prosecutors, he was indicted for hoarding grain and misappropriating public funds for personal gain. The indictment lists the amount of corruption as over 80 million [currency not specified]. On the 12th of this month, the Criminal Court interrogated him again, but Hu has claimed to be severely ill in custody, and the trial has not yet concluded. The details of the Hu case, before and after, are reported as follows: (Editor)

This case is the largest corruption case in Hunan Province in ten years, and it caused a sensation at the time. The prosecutor's indictment stated that the amount of grain that Hu purchased under false pretenses reached over 27,000 *shi* [unit of dry volume], which is shocking.

Hu Mai Served as Director of the Department of Finance During Xue Bailing's Tenure in Hunan

Hu Mai, courtesy name Yan Yuan, is a native of Xiangtan, Hunan. He is 54 years old and the son of the famous Hunan educator Mr. Hu Zijing. Mr. Hu Zijing founded the Mingde Middle School, which was renowned both in the north and south of China, and was on par with Nankai Middle School in Tianjin, known as "Southern Mingde and Northern Nankai." After Mr. Zijing passed away, Hu inherited his father's position and presided over the school's affairs. Hu originally served in the Executive Yuan. When Xue Bailing took office in Hunan, Hu returned to Hunan to serve as Director of the Department of Finance and concurrently as the Director of the Field Tax and Grain Management Office, serving for eight years before resigning this February.

Rumors Said He Broke Away from the Provincial Government, but the Situation Was Very Complex

After the great fire in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province was moved to Yuanling in western Hunan in 1938. In 1939, when Xue Yue took office in Hunan, he ordered it to be moved to Leiyang in southern Hunan, in order to coordinate with military operations. Hu always presided over affairs in Leiyang. In the spring of 1944, when the Changsha battle occurred, Leiyang was threatened, and there were proposals to relocate. At that time, opinions were divided, with some advocating moving to western Hunan to maintain contact with the rear, and others advocating moving to southern Hunan to support military operations. There was a heated debate in the Provincial Government Committee when discussing this matter. Later, after Chairman Xue decided to move the provincial capital to the Jiahe and Lanshan mountain areas, Hu led a portion of the Department of Finance staff and the entire staff of the Field Tax Office to western Hunan. It is said that this was due to the need to supply military grain, so the Field Tax Office had to go to western Hunan. They first worked in Hongjiang and then moved to Yuanling, until the end of the war. At that time, there were rumors that Hu had broken away from the provincial government and was independent. In fact, it was indeed neither fish nor fowl, and the situation was extremely complicated. The fact that the Department of Finance left the provincial government naturally aroused dissatisfaction. At the end of the war, Hu returned to Changsha with Wu Wusheng, and various departments and offices also returned successively, and the provincial government structure was gradually improved. Hu resigned this February and was succeeded by Mr. Yang Ruiling.

Accused of Embezzling Welfare Funds Soon After Resigning

Not long after Hu resigned, some staff members of the Field Tax Office accused Hu of embezzling public funds from the employee welfare society of the office. Hu was summoned. Dozens of Field Tax Office employees were also summoned to testify. After two months of investigation, he was prosecuted for violating grain management regulations and corruption, and Hu and Wen Mingding, the accounting director during his tenure, were detained by the District Court for trial.

The Indictment Lists the Facts: Hoarding Grain for Profit

The indictment lists the criminal facts of Hu and others in three sections:

(1) Hoarding Grain for Profit — In September 1944, Hu established a Supervision and徵收 Office in Changde to purchase and transport military grain and collect old debts, appointing Dai Zhongheng to be in charge. Hu Mai took advantage of the purchase and transportation of military grain to purchase 27,086 *shi* of grain, ostensibly for the food needs of the staff within the purchasing office. He colluded with Dai Zhongheng. The procurement method was either to purchase from large households, purchase county-level public grain, or allocate purchases locally. Most of it was converted into Changde and Taoyuan by allocating it as military grain. Except for about 13,000 *shi*, which was requisitioned for civilian ships to transport to Yuanling, and about 6,000 *shi*, which was sold in Changde, as of the end of December 1945, there were still more than 6,800 *shi* of grain stored in Taoyuan. The grain transported to Yuanling was sold in Yuanling one after another. According to Hu Mai and Dai Zhongheng, this was ostensibly to meet the needs of the 34 staff members of the office for one year, and to regulate the people's food supply. However, the staff's rice was originally issued in kind. In 1945, it was changed to cash allowance, and the Food Department did not announce it until the end of 1944. Why did the office purchase grain beforehand knowing that there would be a cash allowance? Hu Mai claimed: he personally did not buy grain in Binhu Road, but the Welfare Society bought it. In fact, the Welfare Society had been dissolved after losing Leiyang and had not been legally established since then. When the defendants purchased this batch of grain, the price was from 400 to 860 [currency not specified] per *shi*. When sold, the price was from 2,750 to 6,000 [currency not specified] per *shi*. The profit was huge, but because there is still a surplus that has not been sold, the overall profit cannot be calculated.

Second Criminal Fact: Misappropriating Public Funds for Personal Gain

(2) Embezzling and Misappropriating Public Funds for Personal Gain — (A) The Hunan Provincial Field Tax Office pre-sold the local tax assessments for 1943 and 1944. Hu Mai misappropriated 10 million [currency not specified] of the funds collected that should have been turned over to the Hunan Finance Department. According to his claim: it was transferred to Mingde Middle School for construction fees. After inquiring with Xie Zuyou, the acting principal of Mingde Middle School, and the school's director of affairs, they both said that the school had not borrowed money from the Provincial Department of Finance or the Field Tax Office. (B) The expenses of Hu Mai's private residence were listed in the accounts managed by the Provincial Field Tax Office, totaling more than 4.3 million [currency not specified], and even an electric iron was paid for in the public account. (C) Defendant Xiao Zhuxin received 3 million [currency not specified] in public funds from the Food Department in Chongqing in August 1945, and immediately bought American currency at a price of 1,650 [currency not specified] to make a profit. Unexpectedly, the value of American currency later fell, resulting in a significant loss. Hu Mai approved that this loss should be borne by the Welfare Society.

Third Criminal Fact: Using the Welfare Society as a Cover

(3) Various Criminal Acts Under the Guise of the Welfare Society —— (A) Buying and Selling Processing Surplus for Profit. (B) Using the Name of the Welfare Society to Misappropriate Public Funds to Engage in Commerce, Buying Cotton and Monopoly of Salt. (C) Private Appropriation of Grain. Based on the above accusations, Hu's hoarding of grain for profit is a violation of Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Crimes Against Grain Management in Extraordinary Times. He used the name of Mingde Middle School to misappropriate public funds, violating Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the two regulations for punishing corruption. He continuously misappropriated 4 million [currency not specified] of public funds within the managed funds, violating Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations for Punishing Corruption. He spent public funds three times on two banquets, used official vehicles for private use, and used public funds to make up for other people's illegal losses, violating Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the six Regulations for Punishing Corruption. He bought and sold grain processing surpluses for profit, violating Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations for Punishing Corruption. He continuously embezzled more than 1 million [currency not specified] of public funds under the name of "Tian Special Account," violating Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations for Punishing Corruption. Other defendants, Xiao Zhuxin, Dai Zhongheng, and Wen Mingding, will all be punished in accordance with the Regulations for Punishing Corruption.

### Social Services: Answering Readers

Medical and Health

Lu Binshi from Liuzhou, Guangxi, asks: I serve on the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway. Last September, I accidentally stepped on a poisonous snake in my residence in Duyun, and my right ankle was bitten and injured. It quickly festered and developed cellulitis. After injecting glucose, bainongqing, silver colloidal, and other injections, and applying anti-inflammatory powder, it finally closed in December. However, after being bitten, my leg became red, swollen, and bent, and even after the wound healed, I still cannot straighten it (only the toes can touch the ground). I was treated by Dr. × of our railway who straightened it surgically and bound it with plaster. Unexpectedly, on the fourth day, the part of the foot not covered by the plaster became swollen, so the plaster was removed, and it had swollen to the knee. The muscles on the back of the foot and heel died, the dead flesh festered again, one tendon of the big toe was broken, and the nerves from the ankle bone down were completely paralyzed and numb. The entire foot cannot move at all. Now it is April again. Although the wound has healed, I still have no sensation, cannot move, and it is often swollen, obviously because the blood vessels are not smooth. I am currently using electric massage (for three months), warm water soaking, sunlight, and other methods, but they have not been effective. I ask, is there any remedy for plaster binding injury?

[Answer from Medical Doctor Yu Xin'en] Because the muscles and nerves have all died, resulting in numbness and inability to move, continued massage is needed, which may lead to progress.

(2) Pang Chaojian has two medical questions and requests your column to answer: (1) When I am sound asleep at night, I often grind my teeth, and the sound is very loud. What is the symptom? What is the treatment? (2) I had sores on my head when I was young, resulting in scars. Can they be surgically repaired to perfection? Are there any hospitals in this city that offer surgical repair? Please answer.

[Answer from Medical Doctor Yu Xin'en] (1) Test the stool for worms. (2) It is necessary to cut off the scars and then perform skin grafting or suturing. All hospital surgical departments can perform this.

(3) Yunzhu asks Editor, I am one of the readers who support your newspaper because your newspaper has accurate and fair news, and is also able to solve difficult problems for readers. Thank you very much. I got married at the age of 23. I don't know why, but on my wedding night, my hymen had no blood. My husband suspects that I am unfaithful. I know that I am absolutely wronged. I don't know when my hymen ruptured? It has been six years, and the suspicion has not been resolved. I ask the doctor, what method can be used to make my husband trust me? Can a blood test prove it?

[Answer from Medical Doctor Yu Xin'en] The hymen can rupture due to exercise or accidental injury, so the absence of blood cannot be immediately concluded as infidelity. A blood test is ineffective.

### Sunday Forum: Overseas Chinese Education Needs to Accelerate Uphill

— Zhou Shang

In the past, overseas Chinese education can be described as fraught with difficulties, causing shame and anxiety to the point of tears. The most mistakes and the most disturbing issues in overseas Chinese education were due to unclear responsibilities, where everyone could manage it, yet no one did; and when no one managed it, everyone fought to manage it. Administrative bodies were sometimes established and sometimes not, sometimes established but ineffective, and sometimes had a head but no brains. The people lacked awareness of overseas Chinese education, the organizations could not find specialized talent, and the funding was so little that it was unbelievable. Those sent abroad for inspection were neither officials nor civilians, those sent to teach were not focused, and those receiving training had ulterior motives. Textbooks were compiled for decades, but not a single one was shipped overseas, and they are still stored in wooden boxes in some museum. As a result: native-born children scold their motherland and look down on it; Chaozhou people became cabinet ministers and oppressed Chaozhou people; Quanzhou people became presidents and expelled Quanzhou people!

Looking back on the past is extremely embarrassing. Now that the country has been restored and the land rebuilt, the nation is eagerly hoping to remove the heavy and tattered old clothes from overseas Chinese and replace them with new and fitting garments of the era. If everyone directly or indirectly involved in overseas Chinese education truly awakens from the bottom of their hearts, emerges from a long dream, repents for the past, strives for the future, establishes ambition, and dedicates strength, then overseas Chinese education has reached an absolutely critical juncture that needs to be developed urgently. In the past, people needed overseas Chinese, but now people are excluding them! Without sound education, how can we cultivate their knowledge, morality, intelligence, and skills to survive and develop? Inequality of knowledge is one of the main sources of conflict. Equality of knowledge can promote mutual understanding and unity among nations and can achieve true peace. Buddhism says, "All sentient beings can become Buddhas." Christ said, "All people are children of God, brothers and sisters." The key lies in education. The soul of overseas Chinese reflects the reflection of overseas Chinese education, and overseas Chinese education is the foundation for building and protecting overseas Chinese. Today, the motherland absolutely requires the large group of overseas Chinese youth to become the developers who will bear the fate of overseas Chinese in the future, and at the same time, absolutely requires the large group of overseas Chinese adults to become the maintainers who will bear the current fate of overseas Chinese. Therefore, overseas Chinese education absolutely needs to accelerate its progress. The ills of the old era must be eliminated, and the style of the new era must be adopted. Qu Yuan said, "Those who have just bathed must shake their hats, and those who have just washed must shake their clothes." Taking advantage of this time of returning to the capital, I will discuss some reforms in overseas Chinese education administration in the future.

(1) Unify Authority: Today's world is a unified world; philosophy advocates monism, and science proves monism. The overseas Chinese education administrative body is an organism, and its authority cannot be fragmented and must be unified. The benefits of unified authority in overseas Chinese education administration are endless, like the benefit of having five senses and four limbs on one person. Education and cultural undertakings overseas should be managed by overseas Chinese affairs agencies, and domestic affairs should be managed by education agencies. Diplomatic agencies act as liaison between domestic and foreign affairs, and consulates are responsible for being the eyes and ears. Party departments handle party affairs and can inform the competent authorities of any views they have on culture and education. The management of cultural and educational groups and social organizations must also be clearly divided between domestic and overseas Chinese affairs agencies. Fortunately, this administrative issue has been resolved and passed by the Sixth National Congress and recently approved and implemented by the 734th Executive Yuan meeting. This is a new era-making epoch in the history of overseas Chinese education. Now we need to see what kind of work will be done. But Rome was not built in a day, and now is just the hard time of going uphill.

(2) Harmonious Personnel: Now that authority has been divided, the personnel of each agency must strive for harmony and avoid friction. Do not let a small matter form a very obvious barrier and draw an indelible gap. Friction and infighting stem from having an "egoistic view" in one's heart. An "egoistic view" leads to an unhealthy mentality, which leads to more misunderstandings. If we remove the "egoistic view" and act impartially, treat the people of other agencies as friends, and gain a thorough understanding, the estrangement will naturally disappear. Acknowledge one's own shortcomings and acknowledge that others may have a moment of wisdom. More importantly, put yourself in their shoes, and you will see that there is no resentment in your heart. Everyone should strive to do their best in their position, ensuring that all activities are for overseas Chinese education and that all benefits go to overseas Chinese education first. Those who run the administration must be exemplary and earn respect. In other words, from now on, everyone should improve themselves, and everything should progress, and the country's status will increase invisibly, and overseas Chinese education will have a bright future.

(3) Strengthen Organizations: The organizations responsible for domestic and foreign overseas Chinese education must be strengthened. A snake cannot move without a head, and it cannot move if the head is broken. People are flying in the sky, why must we always crawl on the ground? Some say that overseas Chinese education organizations are like an old ox dragging a broken cart. How can this phenomenon manage the cultural and educational undertakings of overseas Chinese in 61 countries around the world? Education agencies should have a solid organization to handle domestic overseas Chinese education, and it should be headed by a dedicated person. Domestic education is important, border education is important, and the education of returning overseas Chinese students is also important! The Overseas Chinese Affairs Agency already has an Overseas Chinese Education Department, which should expand its organization in accordance with the overseas Chinese education program passed by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Fifth Executive Committee. The current Education Guidance Section and Cultural Affairs Section are still not strong enough. Overseas secondary education, national education, higher education, social education, supervision, and even investigation, research, and editing should all be established.

(4) Increase Funding: We only know how to ask overseas Chinese for money, but we do not know how to use money for overseas Chinese. Some even say that the money used to subsidize overseas Chinese education is called "reverse flow." Little do they know that when we use money for overseas Chinese, we are actually asking overseas Chinese for money, and we will be able to ask for more money in the future. There is no investment in the world that is more worthwhile than this. The reasoning is very clear. When a person receives an education, their production capacity increases, and their wealth naturally increases. The money spent on one education earns back far more than a thousand times! The more popular and advanced overseas Chinese education becomes, the more wealth overseas Chinese will have, and the more remittances the motherland will receive. The principle of the amount of overseas Chinese education funding should be proportional to the domestic population and administrative expenditures. The percentage of administrative expenditures for each province's population should also be applied to overseas Chinese, with at least 25% used for overseas Chinese education. Although overseas Chinese do not directly pay taxes, their families can pay taxes, and the country can also collect taxes on overseas Chinese import and export trade. Moreover, hundreds of millions of foreign exchange pour into the motherland every year. To make overseas Chinese education sound and vibrant: First, cultural stations must be established in various overseas locations, good model schools must be added, and a world overseas Chinese "cultural and educational network" must be formed to promote it universally from this center. Second, there must be an overseas Chinese education fund. This fund should be contributed in equal amounts by domestic and foreign sources, completed in stages and regions, once and for all, so that overseas Chinese education can stand firm. Other things that need to be done are just beginning, and they all require funding; otherwise, everything will be in vain.

(5) Use Talent Prudently: Now that authority has been clarified, funding has been secured, and work can be done freely, it is like having handcuffs removed, but the shackles are still on your feet, making it difficult to take big steps. What are these shackles? They are the mediocrity and incompetence of those who handle affairs. It is extremely difficult to find a good staff member who handles overseas Chinese education administration. They should understand education, be familiar with official matters, be rich in ideas, have methods, and, more importantly, understand the actual lives of overseas Chinese. At a minimum, they should be of average talent, be trained in education, have good character, and be willing to learn calmly. Overseas Chinese education is truly a virgin land, and anyone who goes to cultivate it has the opportunity to become an expert in overseas Chinese education as long as they do not give up on themselves. Those in charge should not harbor malice towards their colleagues but should focus on benevolent feelings, distinguish right from wrong, and differentiate good from bad, and those below will also be happy to exert their strength. People are the center of the cause, and people are the foundation of construction. Zeng Guofan, who knew people and made a name for himself in the world, once said that there are only four things to get people: wide recruitment, prudent use, diligent teaching, and strict discipline. The scope of overseas Chinese education is not yet large enough to warrant wide recruitment, but the section on prudent use must be done. If we can use talent as the foundation and know people well and assign them appropriately, a large China will not be afraid of not having good people to use.

(6) Regional Supervision: The administrative agencies are domestic, while the education endeavors are overseas. Overseas, the country is "far away from the emperor," and calls for help go unanswered. Domestically, overseas is vague, irrelevant, and unclear about right and wrong. The estrangement between them is like the disharmony of the human body's blood vessels, how dangerous! In my opinion, the world may as well be divided into fifteen to twenty regions, and each region should gradually establish overseas Chinese education supervisors who are stationed abroad on a permanent basis to manage various overseas Chinese education endeavors. Their main duty is to supervise, promote education, and cooperate with overseas Chinese, schools, and local governments to avoid political activities and avoid all activities that irritate foreigners. To be honest, we are still in the dark domestically. Even if the colonies were offered to us with both hands, we would still be helpless. It is better to focus on doing education well first; otherwise, we will overreach ourselves and be at a loss. Choosing education officials for overseas Chinese is certainly a solemn issue, so they must be chosen well; not just anyone can be appointed. Otherwise, if it is not the right person for the job, what is the point of having this system? These education officials must be first-class talents who study education, have professor qualifications, and not only be able to lead academically, but also be role models for overseas Chinese in terms of moral character. At the same time, they must understand, be enthusiastic about, and have ambitions for the country's construction and the future of overseas Chinese. His place of origin does not necessarily have to be limited to Guangdong and Fujian. Sometimes, sending people from Guangdong and Fujian causes more disputes, so it is better to send people from other provinces.

(7) Teacher Training: The Chairman said, "Officials are the craftsmen of nation-building; teachers should even more so" fill the nation-building with outstanding talent." The philosophical foundation of the special status of modern teachers can be seen in Alfred Victor Oven's "The Educational Wheel." He compares the people's representatives to the rim of the educational wheel, the students to the axle, and the teachers to the hub. Because teachers are the direct environment that controls students and are also the link between the people and the administrative agencies. This explanation is especially meaningful in overseas Chinese education. Moreover, overseas teachers are more important than domestic teachers. Today's teachers are inferior to domestic teachers in both quantity and quality, so it is urgent to train them in large numbers. The best place to train them is abroad, taking materials locally, and the teaching methods can be different, and can be carried out openly or secretly, depending on the environment. If it is handled domestically, there are many problems: (1) Most people's motivation for enrolling is not to teach, but to travel abroad for sightseeing, further education, etc. (2) It is not easy to sign passports, it is not easy to import, and even it is not allowed to land due to discrimination from the government of the place of residence. (3) Travel expenses are huge, and overseas procedures are troublesome. A delay of a year and a half is not uncommon. (4) Schools refuse to use them, and even collude with the local government to deport them. (5) Some do not speak the language and cannot teach young children. (6) Their knowledge and ability are not as good as local teachers, and they become embarrassed after going abroad. (7) They think that they were sent by the central government and occupy a special position in the school, which causes endless trouble for the school. (8) They often seek to transfer to other regions and schools and cannot handle matters. (9) Disputes often arise, and it is inconvenient to handle them. (10) There is no opportunity for regular normal schools, normal classes, night or summer teacher training classes, short-term teacher training institutes, and even correspondence teacher schools to be carried out after training. I advocate that most teachers should be trained overseas, and a small number should be trained domestically when necessary. Foreigners are not used to "training," so we may as well use "lecture" to reduce irritation.

(8) Textbook Compilation and Printing: Teaching materials are the experience of the nation, including textbooks and supplementary materials, which are especially important overseas compared to domestic. We must have the right to education, but we cannot infringe on other people's right to education because of our education standards. All countries and their territories must protect their right to education. Therefore, treaties have beautiful words such as "freedom of education," but in essence, there are many tricks, and there are still endless laws and regulations in local areas that bind us hand and foot. If the power is in the hands of others, then the hands can be loose or tight; and since there is no absolute standard for the law, then the scale will also be stretched and relaxed. There may be affection outside the law, but affection is even more fickle, and the scope of a lack can affect unexpected places. Some countries and some places openly stipulate by law that foreigners are not allowed to establish schools, so they can only open classes at night, as supplementary in nature. Because the environment varies from place to place, teaching materials must be different. Therefore, we cannot simply compile a set of textbooks, but should adapt to local conditions, with variations in location and content, while Chinese, Chinese history, Chinese geography, and civics are absolutely indispensable. Recently, the Elementary School Curriculum Standards Committee resolved to include civics, history, and geography in society. For the sake of emphasis overseas, each subject must still be set up separately. When it is unavoidable, they should be included in common sense, but the teaching time should still be maintained at the amount when they were separate subjects. Writing teaching materials should be based on curriculum standards; the curriculum is the mother, and the teaching materials are the son. At present, we are doing things backwards, having the son first and the mother later. In the future, overseas curriculum should also be started as soon as possible.

(9) Filing Guidance: Filing is getting on track. Overseas Chinese school filing is not only getting on track, but also adding centripetal force to the motherland. Today, only 15% of overseas Chinese schools are filed. We must guide them well, telling them the advantages of filing and the disadvantages of not filing, without using bureaucratic jargon or making trouble for schools. At this National Congress, a representative from a certain overseas location said that they had been running a school for 35 years with 400-500 students. They had been running it for 10 years, and the filing had not yet been completed because it did not conform to official standards. In the future, the filing procedures and forms must be simplified, and the standards must be lowered. The previously stipulated fund was originally a scam domestically. The school temporarily borrowed a sum of money and deposited it in the bank to cover up the eyes and ears of the investigators. The investigators knew it was a scam and turned a blind eye and perfunctorily passed it. I think it is better not to do it than to do it if it cannot be done. We only need a sound board of directors, a principal who is willing to give up everything in their life and devote themselves to overseas Chinese education, and be responsible for the fate of overseas Chinese for generations to come, and they are qualified to file—those who handle affairs should keep in mind that the greatest purpose of filing is only to win their hearts.

(10) Overseas Chinese Students Returning to China: Encouraging students to return to China for further education originally hoped that they would be immersed in the environment of the motherland, live with domestic youth, be baptized by the culture of the motherland, and become the motherland. In the future, when they return to their original place of residence, they will be based in the motherland, thereby improving the lives of overseas Chinese, raising the status of overseas Chinese, and communicating the emotions between domestic and foreign countries. When they return to China, there must be strong guidance; otherwise, a bad impression will be worse than not returning. In the past, the system of reception stations was such that overseas Chinese students only had food, clothing, sleep, and nothing to do, which cultivated idleness and was definitely not a good policy. In the future, "Overseas Chinese Student Guidance Centers" should be established in various commercial ports, especially Shanghai, to provide them with various guidance on further education, employment, and life, providing accommodation and remedial classes. Spiritual training, moral cultivation, nurturing of patriotic attitudes, and explanation of local customs must not be ignored. Domestically, there is no need to set up overseas Chinese middle schools to cultivate their special psychology, and they cannot share joys and sorrows with domestic students. Overseas Chinese middle schools during the war were run in a mess, expelling principals, beating directors, and being indecent. In the future, it is absolutely not allowed to continue like this. Overseas Chinese students returning to China to study at universities should be dispersed to various universities, and it is absolutely forbidden to concentrate them in one school. If some of their subjects cannot keep up with the domestic ones, they can take remedial classes at the Overseas Chinese Student Guidance Center or designate several universities to set up classes to teach, and they will be distributed immediately after passing. If the preparatory class system continues, it can also take on this remedial responsibility.

The above points are just the major points, and personnel is the most urgent, and one person should always be used for one person. Now is an era of doing things, an era of democracy, and an era of clear responsibilities. If you do not do well, the responsibilities are clear, and you cannot shirk responsibility as before. Newspapers can speak, parliamentary organs can speak, and everyone can speak. For the construction of the motherland, overseas Chinese, and the people, education must accelerate uphill!

### Shanghai Defense Corps Issues

To the Editor: The dissolution of the Shanghai Defense Corps has progressed from rumor to fact. I, having served as the head of the Shanghai West District Corps since its reestablishment, have now held the position for six months. As many concerned individuals have inquired, I wish to briefly outline the situation in the West District Corps for the information of those interested. The West District borders Qingpu and Songjiang to the southwest, and Jiading and Baoshan to the northwest, marking the outermost line of Shanghai. The area is vast, forty *li* from north to south and thirty *li* from east to west. The population is scattered, making control extremely difficult. The strength of the West District Corps, with its nine detachments, is considered insufficient. Observing the police force's deployment, Longhua and Xinjing each have a branch bureau, but the number of police officers is only thirty to forty. Even the police stations in Hongqiao have only eleven officers, Chengjiaqiao has eleven, and Zhudi, Zhenru, and Zhoujiaqiao each have only ten or more. Although Huacao has a police brigade, the number is less than thirty. Furthermore, Qibao, Xinzhuang, Jiangqiao, Wujiaxiang, and Changqiao all lack any police presence. As a result, bandits gather, and robberies occur frequently. Even the police stations in these areas, to avoid the threat of bandits seizing weapons, dare not keep weapons, seeking only temporary peace. If the Defense Corps is dissolved, how will local defense be handled? This is a crucial point that deserves attention. The West District Defense Corps was established last winter. After work began, existing members were registered, and outstanding local youths were recruited as new members, issued firearms, and given training. At the end of the year, they were ordered to assist in winter defense, and detachments of corps members were regularly deployed to assist the military and police. Around the Lunar New Year, to prevent disturbances by criminals and bandits, patrol and standby sentry duties were divided into three groups from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning, carrying out defense tasks day and night. As a result, bandits disappeared, and residents could live in peace. These are the real facts of the past, without any exaggeration or embellishment. In May of this year, to prevent trouble makers, the West Shanghai area, being at the forefront of the city, the corps was ordered to assist the military in defense, gathering in Qibao, Hongqiao, Zhenru, and Beixinjing. Most members sacrificed their occupations and energy to undertake guard duty. Although the period lasted only one month, this spirit of service is admirable and memorable. As for the past salary and supply issues of the Defense Corps, according to the organization, there was a district corps under the overall corps, a brigade under the district corps, and a company under the brigade, with each company directly commanding several detachments. Each detachment had a small number of members—about forty-five—and a company had a large number—about one hundred and forty-four. Only the district corps and brigade had paid officers and soldiers (less than ten per unit). Each company had only one deputy company commander, one special affairs officer, and six or seven corps soldiers. Furthermore, the company and detachment commanders and all corps members were volunteers. Not only did they not receive salaries, but they sometimes had to advance expenses. Even the officers' and soldiers' staple and non-staple foods, which were supposed to be 5,000 yuan per person in March of this year, and later increased to 11,000 yuan in March, April, and May, were far from sufficient given the current prices. The shortfall was made up by volunteer company and detachment commanders, enthusiastic locals, and volunteer corps members, who found ways to compensate or donate the entire amount. This special situation is unseen in ordinary military or police organizations. It is worthy of memory and admiration. In fact, the reorganization of the Defense Corps, which began with the reorganization of the standing brigade of the former Defense Corps into a security police force by the Municipal Police Bureau, can be said to have come to an end. Because the current Defense Corps is purely voluntary, and the members are all local, law-abiding citizens who are either farmers or merchants, each with a proper occupation, living and working locally. Their spirit of service and purpose are completely consistent: to protect the local area is to protect themselves. Obeying the law and following orders is now on the right track. Whether local armed forces should be preserved is a matter worth considering. The Shanghai Defense Corps has a long history and a pure organization. Its sole task is to assist the military and police in protecting the local area. During the January 28th and August 13th battles against the enemy, it made significant contributions, which Mr. Jiang Huaisu had already reported to the Military Affairs Commission for inclusion in the war history. There is no need for further elaboration. After the nation's victory and the restoration of Shanghai, the Shanghai gentry and business community jointly reestablished the Defense Corps and formed the Defense Committee, which was directly under the municipal government. The Defense Corps was established with an unified command and administration. By having the civilians run the program under the government, the system was standardized, and the scope expanded. Strengthening training to make it a powerful force is an important part of the defense of the area. Although the unfortunate dissolution is happening now, I sincerely hope that all former members will maintain their past spirit, continue to assist the local area, and work together to stabilize Shanghai and our homeland. Chen Boliang, June 18th.

### Praising Tang Enbo

— Shaofu

There are many things worthy of praising Tang Enbo for. During the War of Resistance, from Gubeikou to Guiyang, he fought hundreds of tough battles, earning great military merits; after the victory, he was ordered to garrison the Shanghai area, arriving in this most complex environment, accepting surrenders and handling POWs, a heavy responsibility and busy work, worthy of praise; his kindness and amiability, worthy of praise; his political acumen and willingness to humbly study, worthy of praise. But I want to especially praise him for one thing: his recent dispatch of dozens of officers to Shanghai to investigate soldiers illegally occupying houses.

The chaotic days of the initial takeover in Shanghai after the victory are something we no longer have the courage to discuss. Taking housing as an example, many bizarre methods were used that are unimaginable to law-abiding citizens like us. Even now, this confused account cannot be cleared.

Among these things, it is undeniable that many unscrupulous soldiers acted improperly. Although Tang Enbo has left Shanghai and the Third Front Army designation has been abolished, he has not ignored these matters or turned a deaf ear. This is worthy of our support and our praise.

It is said that after the officers arrived in Shanghai, they notified their subordinates that, apart from the forty-four houses of residents and Japanese nationals that had been previously approved for continued occupancy, the remaining seventy-plus occupied houses should be immediately vacated. Anyone who forcibly occupies civilian houses will be severely punished.

Tang Enbo's military discipline is strict, and he is known as the "star of slaughter," so I believe no one will joke with their own head. It is a pity that, until now, only General Tang has taken such action personally. Therefore, I especially want to praise him here!

### Recollections from the India-Burma Front

— Juying

1.  "God's Creation is Difficult"

In the year before victory, under the close cooperation of the British, American, and Allied forces, we headed towards the primitive area of northern Burma—the Savage Mountains. It was May, and flowers were blooming everywhere in the wilderness. At the Ledo airfield in India, tens of thousands of Chinese troops stationed in India were gathered, lightly dressed, crouching in a corner of the airfield all day, hiding under tents made of raincoats. Like players waiting for the referee's whistle, they waited for orders from their superiors. They had been living like this for more than a week.

One day, a senior American general from the India Headquarters suddenly descended upon us bored soldiers to lecture these Chinese brothers, who had been eager for a mission for so long:

"Dear Chinese heroes, the ground forces are already near the outskirts of Myitkyina. You will soon be airlifted there and forced to land, to cooperate with friendly ground forces to capture the city. What a sacred mission! It has been gloriously placed on your shoulders. In addition to congratulating you, I have a sincere piece of advice that I must tell you: Do not waste weapons, and absolutely respect life. Because it only takes a few seconds to make a rifle, only a few seconds to make a cannon, and no more than half a minute to make an airplane. But it takes God at least twenty years to create a person!" At this point, the roar of the engines at the airfield was drowned out by the shouts of thousands of mouths.

2.  Indian Doggerel

The Chinese army stationed in India grew up in a remote foreign country. Not only did they change their habits of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but also their interests shifted with the lively Americans.

One day at dusk, I was walking beside a military camp and happened to pick up a piece of doggerel written by a soldier. The words said:

"Dear mother and father, your son is doing great here, beef jerky, 'A Jiao Hai', big feet, small head."

"Hua Da Ma Da" is Hindi for parents, and "A Jiao Hai" is Hindi for "very good." The fourth sentence needs explanation. British uniforms were not suitable for Chinese people. There were many Sichuanese in the expeditionary force, and the Sichuanese were especially short. The issued leather shoes were all large. The hats were boat-shaped, and most people found them too small.

This kind of doggerel may be comparable to the *yangjingbang* rhymes of Shanghai.

3.  The Origin of "Ding Hao"

Everyone who has been to the rear knows that the Allied forces call Chinese people "Ding Hao". There are different versions of its origin. The version I heard is as follows:

After the Japanese launched the Pacific Offensive, the Japanese army on the Indochina Peninsula advanced rapidly north, quickly capturing Mandalay, the capital of Burma. At that time, in addition to the British and Indian forces, there was also the once-famous Chinese Fifth Army in Burma. They set up a bag-shaped formation there, preparing to open the bag to catch the mice. However, things did not go as planned. Instead of running into the bag, the enemy inserted itself into the bottom of the bag, cutting off the Chinese army's transport line to Yunnan, forcing them to retreat to India.

At this time, a British elite armored regiment was surrounded by a small number of lightly armed advancing Japanese troops in a place called Yannan (transliteration). They waited tremblingly for God's judgment in the encirclement. As a result, after more than ten days of living in terror, a Chinese army relieved them. This was an infantry battalion of the New Thirty-Eighth Division. Because there were so few Japanese, the mission was accomplished under a few scattered bullets.

However, those poor British soldiers who had been trapped for so long were overjoyed to be reborn. They abandoned everything and only knew to run towards India. When they bumped into Chinese brothers on the road, they raised their thumbs and shouted "Ding Hao." From then on, "Ding Hao" became a common phrase among the Allied forces.

The answer to the sentry at night was "OK" for the Chinese, and "Ding Hao" for the British and Americans. "Ding Hao Ding Ding Hao" "Ding Ding Ding Ding Hao". This depends on the American's happiness to increase the comparative degree of this "good". But now the people who call "Ding Hao" may rarely know that it is a sound of gratitude!

### Father-in-Law's Obligation

— Chuanqiu

A Scotsman asked a doctor to remove his wife's tonsils. After the doctor finished the operation, he asked him for the operation fee. He said that the tonsils should be removed in childhood, and asked the doctor to send the bill to his father-in-law!

### Hong Kong Hand

— Fang Jun

Hong Kong foot is a skin disease that grows in the cracks of the toes, causing unbearable itching and being difficult to cure. In Hong Kong, it is called "Hong Kong foot," which comes from the English "Hong Kong foot." In fact, this disease is not unique to Hong Kong. In China, the area south of the Yangtze River is prevalent among people in cities, and it is generally called dampness. It is said that drinking too much alcohol can cause it, but many people who do not drink also suffer from this disease, so it is not limited to drinkers.

Hong Kong foot is also known as athlete's foot. The origin of the disease comes from the Americas. It is said that many college students and people who love sports in the Americas used to suffer from this disease. This disease only causes itching, just like the Chinese call it "癣疥之疾", meaning a minor ailment that is not fatal, but when it itches, it can be enough for you to suffer. However, some people get a kind of sexual intoxication from this. Originally, there were two kinds of techniques in bathhouses: "scraping feet" and "kneading feet." People with this disease enjoy this "scraping" and "kneading," and the pleasure is indescribable! However, this kind of "scraping" and "kneading" also has its disadvantages. That is, after this disease has been "scraped" or "kneaded," its momentum will expand, and it may expand to the point where it makes it difficult for you to walk and causes pain and itching.

Since I left school, this disease has been with me. But I like having it, because having it makes it difficult to get other diseases. If I get other diseases, it will no longer linger with me and disappear until the other diseases are over, then it will come out again. From this, we can know the length of its temperament, and we can also imagine that this disease is not easy to cure.

However, this disease has been attached to my body for many years and has only occupied a few toe cracks. Later, when I arrived in Nanjing, it spread to the palms of both hands. All the commonly used medicines lost their effect, and the more I applied the commonly used medicines, the more it spread and intensified. I was treated in Gulou Hospital for more than ten weeks, but it was still wet and dripping with water, itchy and painful (when it itches, you can't help but scratch, and scratching hurts to the heart and lungs). Every day, the surgeons in Gulou Hospital wrapped both hands with layers of bandages, losing their function. At that time, a friend said that I was a real martial artist, preparing for a duel every day. In fact, I was almost unable to bear the mental pain at that time. With great difficulty, I made it through the winter, and both hands began to recover, but in fact, they only returned to the toe cracks.

Unexpectedly, when I moved to Hong Kong, because of the unsuitable water and soil, it even broke out on my hands and feet together. Not only was it painful and itchy, but also every blister was filled with pus. I had to prop up my hands and feet high to slightly reduce the pain. After three months of treatment, I was able to take the first step, but I also had to walk with a limp and could not walk fast. In an unfamiliar place, suffering from this disease was really extremely painful. When I went to Pokfulam Road to see Zhang Guangyu at the Scholar's Terrace, I found that he was also in the same boat as me, and even the back of his foot was swollen, but he was able to go to Sing Tao Daily to work every day, so he was not as bad as me.

For the past eight or nine years, it has been much more stable, lurking between the toes, but other diseases have followed one after another. People are always immersed in medicine, and no matter how they toss and turn, they cannot escape the word "disease." But fortunately, I know medicine because of a long illness, and I can prolong my life myself, until the victory of the long-term resistance. This is not in vain for this life. Unexpectedly, because I know medicine from a long illness, Hong Kong foot has become Hong Kong hand these days. At first, there were a few itchy blisters on the palms. Then there was a string of beads, and then a cluster like grapes. This depression, this pain and itching, is hard for anyone to bear. In the end, all the blisters burst, and the water, yellow and clear, gushed out like a spring, endless to wipe away, and the itching became even more intense, like snakes crawling and ants swarming. If I had a real sword in my hand, it would not be difficult to wave it! Unfortunately, I don't have the courage of a "hero to cut off his arm."

This day may have been a day of amnesty, and Mr. Yu Qijiang, whom I had not seen for a long time, came to my humble residence. He originally had the name of "Huang Lu," but he had the experience of Hong Jie in treating this kind of disease. He examined my affected areas on both palms, and silently went out to prepare a large bottle of medicine water and several "ounces" of ointment for me. When he came back, he hurriedly ordered the servant to bring a plate of boiling water, poured a quarter of the medicine water into it, picked up pliers, clamped some medicine water cotton, and frequently wiped the affected areas on my palms. Strangely, as soon as I dipped it on, the unbearable itching stopped immediately; after many minutes, as soon as the heat of the boiling water dropped, he immersed both of my palms in it together, and the affected area became more comfortable, and there was no feeling of dampness. He also used scissors to cut off the skin of the newly grown, unbroken blisters on my palms, told me to soak them in the water again, until the water temperature was completely cold, and then put the ointment on me, without bandaging, and I no longer frowned.

I learned from the box lid of the ointment that it was "toad ointment", but the medicine water was unknown. When I asked Yu Qijiang, he smiled and did not answer, only saying, "I guarantee that you will be completely cured in four days." Sure enough, after four days, the rotten skin was completely removed, and new skin came out; if it does not recur, my "Hong Kong hand," which I have been "living with", may be cut off from me from now on!

America feels food shortages, as do other places. Many butchers in New York close shop because they can't get goods. The group shows many housewives lining up in front of a butcher shop to shop. They are still lucky!

### American Second Landlords

— Dongfang Jing

Rental Conditions:

Obligated to take care of his children

There are black markets all over the world, and there is a housing shortage all over the world, even in the United States. The government's "Price Administration" has racked its brains, but businessmen and landlords have their own gimmicks.

For example, the government has set a limit on apartment rents, but some landlords insist on selling you old furniture. Three sets of old furniture actually sell for $1,200 USD.

One three-room apartment rents for $65 a month, which is fair and reasonable, but the landlord wants you to pay first and then live there. In addition, you have to pay a garden maintenance fee of $15 a month.

The so-called garden is a small patch of grass twenty miles outside the city, which he rents for one dollar a year. This landlord has a total of ten tenants, and he illegally collects $1,800 a year in "garden maintenance fees."

In some places, apartment rental managers want tenants to send gifts worth $100 to get a house, and some landlords want tenants to exchange a car.

The strangest thing is that a landlord in one place wants tenants to take care of his children for six days a week, because his wife is a working woman.

### Bandit News

— Feizhong

"Bandits also have principles," as the ancient saying goes. Although "On Bandits" cannot be written into a good article, it should not violate any prohibitions. Moreover, I have seen three news stories that I cannot help but pick up my pen to write down my feelings.

The first is a local dispatch from a month ago: Bandits robbed a ship and greeted three passengers wearing civil servant badges, "Friends! Don't panic, we are all poor, and we will not disturb you." Even if these bandits were not born as civil servants, they deeply understand the suffering of civil servants. Those who mistreat civil servants are not even as good as bandits!

The second is that a certain big boss returned home after being kidnapped and talked about his adventure, saying: "Among the kidnappers, there was a guard with a junior high school education who could read *The Nineteen Heroes of Qingcheng*. Although he has become a bandit, his will has not been completely extinguished. If he can work for me, I am very willing to promote him." This is enough to show a certain big boss's "magnanimity"; however, there are many junior high school students who have no way out. The kidnapper who read *The Nineteen Heroes of Qingcheng* is only one in ten million. A certain big boss uniquely favors him, but how much can it benefit society? However, after escaping the danger, he can donate money to help refugees and never forget to promote the younger generation (although only limited to guards in the bandit's den). A certain big boss made up his mind to save people from this unfortunate incident, which is also very valuable.

The third is that the fish market manager's house robbery case was solved, and the leader of the gang was a former teacher. It is not surprising that teachers become robbers. You must know that there is a theorem to be followed when teachers become robbers. How can you not know that the motto "Misleading children leads to male bandits and female prostitutes" has long been circulating? The current teachers who are forced to live a hard life are unintentionally misleading their students. Why not directly become robbers? Otherwise, do you have to wait and think of ways to make money from your wife and daughters?

Looking at the three news stories, the conclusion is another ancient motto: "Only when food and clothing are sufficient can one know honor and disgrace."

### Miss Morgenstierna, daughter of the Norwegian Ambassador to the United States and Miss Norway, has been selected as Miss United Nations 1946. Forty-one beautiful girls from different countries participated in the competition. The grand dance party during the election was attended by 1,500 guests, causing a sensation in the diplomatic and social circles of Washington.

A Collection of Brief Remarks

### Investigation and Hidden Inquiries: Speculation Turns into Fact?

— Wu Ling Ren

The housing allocation committee for various government departments is facing a difficult situation because many empty houses left behind by Japanese residents have been occupied by military personnel, making it impossible to allocate them. It is said that telegrams were sent to the highest authorities of the army, navy, and air force in the capital, as well as to the Third War Area, hoping for a swift investigation and an order for the occupants to vacate the premises. Commander Tang has now dispatched personnel to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation and enforce the order. However, the military authorities in the capital seem to have taken no action yet, which is generally considered strange. Some speculate that alongside the "open investigation," there must be a "hidden inquiry" already underway. Once the truth is uncovered, a swift and decisive action will be taken, catching the occupants off guard. Wouldn't that be even better? This is mere speculation, but one hopes it will become a reality.

The registration of dance hostesses reached over 1,500 by the 20th of this month. According to surveys and statistics, "these dance hostesses all cite financial difficulties as their reason for dancing. Most of them are illiterate, with less than one in ten having attended primary school, and those with a secondary education are rare." Perhaps a small note should be added below: "But most can speak a few phrases of pidgin English."

Following in the footsteps of the Hong Kong government, the Macau government is adopting an evasive attitude in our negotiations to extradite Chinese traitors. We offer a word of congratulations to the "Shehe" Shipping Company, as its business will surely flourish from now on.

Reports indicate that the Jianghai Customs is ordering dozens of large anti-smuggling vessels from the United States to intensify its efforts to resume anti-smuggling operations. This news is by no means the death knell for tax-evading and smuggling merchants. Moreover, it is unknown when these dozens of large vessels will actually arrive.

Since Mayor Wu implemented strict controls on food supplies, the market prices for rice and grain have indeed been very stable for the past half month. The common people are celebrating with joy. It is hoped that the authorities will remain vigilant and maintain strict oversight, ensuring that the "tiger" cannot escape again.

The ceasefire has been extended by eight days, and another special edition of the newspaper has been issued.

### Overseas Shortwave Broadcasts

— Dongfang Jing

Semyon Konstantinovich Timoshenko used to be a prominent Red Army general in the Soviet Union, but later became a "forgotten man," rarely mentioned in newspapers. Recently, he has been appointed as the Soviet ambassador to Abyssinia. Timoshenko is a renowned defensive strategist, but not an outstanding political figure. This appointment has attracted attention in British and American political circles.

Marshal Georgy Zhukov, a famous Soviet general, has a close personal relationship with General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff. The two often exchange letters.

American propaganda experts are planning to screen "The Great Dictator" in Berlin on a trial basis. They will first select a group of viewers to test whether German audiences will find this comedian's masterpiece hilarious.

After the war, strikes have repeatedly broken out in the United States. The large-scale strikes in the automobile, steel, coal, and railway industries have shocked the world. The losses are incalculable. According to the June 10th issue of "Newsweek," strikes in the first four months of 1946 resulted in the loss of 70.2 million working days.

The loss of production is unprecedented: 1.06 million automobiles were not produced, 9 million tons of coal were not mined, 1.3 million tons of steel were not smelted, lead production decreased by 60%, and steel production fell by 75%.

The losses from the strikes have directly affected foreign countries. For example, Italy relies entirely on the United States for its coal imports, so its reconstruction plan has been greatly hampered. Famine-stricken Europe has lost millions of tons of food.

The U.S. government is considering implementing daylight saving time nationwide to reduce coal consumption. In addition, the United States may have to adopt a coal rationing system this winter.

Bernardes believes that the massive occupation force is an obstacle to economic recovery and, therefore, an obstacle to peace. He believes that it is unnecessary. He says that a million eighteen-year-old American soldiers walking around the streets cannot guarantee that Germany will be completely disarmed. Instead, outstanding scientists and engineers must be employed to monitor Germany's disarmament from beginning to end and report to the capitals of the Allied powers at any time. He believes that small, mobile units that can be dispatched to trouble spots at any time are more appropriate. Air power and air transport units can also be utilized.

Film and Drama

### A General Review of Shanghai Spoken Drama (Part 3)

— Guan Yu

7.  "Dream of the Red Chamber"

The original name of this play was "Yu Lei" (Oppressed Thunder). The playwright's theme in the play is: like oppressed thunder in autumn, although it is rumbling, there will be no rain or lightning. It is also said to be like a person who has many words to say but cannot say them, forever stuck in their throat. This time, "Yu Lei" was performed in Shanghai under the name "Dream of the Red Chamber" because "Yu Lei" is an adaptation of a section from the old novel "Dream of the Red Chamber." Therefore, using "Dream of the Red Chamber" to replace "Yu Lei" is not entirely unacceptable!

In the adaptation of the play, many aspects rely on the novel for help. If someone who has never read the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" watches the play here first, they will be confused. Someone who has already read the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" will not pay attention to the many loopholes in the play and will be satisfied with the play. In the play, the emotions of Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu can be seen in several incidents involving sachets. However, Jia Baoyu's forgetting his sister when he sees his cousin, and his love for combing girls' hair, are not expressed in the play. Similarly, Lin Daiyu's narrow-mindedness, represented solely by her sadness caused by Xue Baochai's sending a small gift, is unreasonable. Using the sachet incidents to express it is also insufficient. Xue Baochai's generosity is not evident in the play, which is not to say that the actress is to blame, but rather the play itself. At the same time, her scenes with Jia Baoyu only begin at the wedding; before that, she hardly speaks a word to him. Therefore, we cannot see Xue Baochai's character and her feelings for Baoyu. It would not be an exaggeration to say that she is a complete stranger. However, in the wedding scene, Baochai clearly calls out "Baoyu." From this, we can see that they are not strangers.

The character who is written about the most in the entire play is Zijuan. The playwright writes her very well, appropriately, movingly, and fittingly. She almost runs through the entire play. She serves Daiyu, deceives Baoyu, and accompanies Baochai as a dowry maid. From beginning to end, only Zijuan can represent everything because she understands the emotions of both sides and witnesses the transformations of both sides. Other characters, such as Baoyu, only know one side; Daiyu disappears in the second half of the play, and Baochai is sporadic. Therefore, I say that the most important character in this play is Zijuan, not Baoyu, Daiyu, and certainly not Baochai. It is only a pity that when Baoyu is about to leave, Zijuan is present but cannot express the words that the audience wants to hear, giving the audience's sorrowful feelings an opportunity to disperse.

Apart from the old-fashioned marriage poisoning children and grandchildren and advocating for freedom of marriage, it is difficult to find any other theme in this play. For example, the corruption in the Rongning Mansion, as depicted in "Dream of the Red Chamber," cannot be found at all in this play. This is excusable for the adapter of the play, because his title "Yu Lei" is his best explanation.

The playwright explains in writing that this is not entirely "Dream of the Red Chamber." The purpose of writing this play is to write about the liberation of human nature. Apart from Baoyu becoming a monk, there is no other proof of this. Moreover, this point still comes from "Dream of the Red Chamber." I think the playwright said this to cover up the inadequacies in the adaptation of the play.

The play's music uses Chinese music. Whether it is properly matched and appropriate can be left to the experts to criticize, but I think this music is very consistent in tone with the stage set and the ancient-looking costumes of the actors.

In the entire play, I personally like the atmosphere of the last scene the most. It gives people a sense of melancholy. The loud and monotonous chimes can be said to be a force, but it does not rely entirely on it. The strength of the play, director, and actors are certainly not wasted here.

8. "The Cock Crows Early, Look at the Sky"

"The Cock Crows Early, Look at the Sky" is a recent script written by Mr. Hong Shen. This script is more complete than some of his previous works. However, in this play, we can see that the playwright only uses political democracy as a slogan and does not integrate it into the plot. Therefore, it becomes an outer garment rather than the backbone of the play. The entire plot is only a series of scattered stories intertwined. Because of this, the play's depth is lost, making it seem superficial.

In the rear area, the drivers on several highways, later uniformly called "drivers," are a very complex group of people. Some may be university students with a higher level of knowledge; others may be illiterate with a lower level. There is also a big difference in the level of technical skill. Some are veteran drivers who are fast and stable in their cars and never have problems. Some just learned to drive and are prone to accidents. Some drivers only drink some wine and go to bed at dinner time whenever they stop to rest. Some must have a girl to accompany them. Some are even more extraordinary, having four or five homes along a highway, so no matter where the car stops, he can go home to enjoy himself. This kind of thing was not a big deal when "the motor roars and gold piles up." All the characters in "The Cock Crows Early, Look at the Sky" are brought by the driver Yang Shixing, so there is this story. This driver is neither the best nor the worst person in his class. He plays with prostitutes, but he is not harsh to them. He carries contraband, but does not excessively exceed the quota. Drivers like this should be considered good!

The next character is the prostitute Wang Guifang. This is a pitiful creature. We can easily see this type in small county towns, a type of weak-willed and unconscious degenerate. Most of them are forced by life! The so-called willing to degenerate only exists for the young mistresses and young ladies in wealthy families who live in a paper-drunk and gold-obsessed environment. She, Wang Guifang, a lower-class prostitute who has already degenerated, only makes me feel sorry for her and does not make us dislike her. She only makes us feel that she is poor, and does not make us feel that she is vulgar. These two characters - Yang Shixing and Wang Guifang - are played by Xie Guan and Ba Ling. The characters they portray are precisely the characters carved out in the play. The most cunning character in the entire play is Mr. Lin. Because he wanted to seize other people's wives and daughters, he exposed other people's mistakes and accused the other party of being a traitor. Unexpectedly, he himself was detained for treason. As a result, he had a conflict with the owner of Xing Inn and was injured. This character should be so changeable. But the actor is just flat and faint, burying this character in this low-energy performance, which is such a pity!

9. "Wuthering Heights"

It is said to be an adaptation. The original work is a successful work by the sisters Emily Brontë and Charlotte Brontë in the 19th century. There is a Chinese translation by Liang Shiqiu. Later, the film "Wuthering Heights" co-starred by Florence Eldridge and Merle Oberon was based on this novel. This time, the script is probably based on the film adaptation.

Standing in the position of an adapter, most people adapt other people's works because they are particularly satisfied with them or because there are special stage effects that can be achieved. They will never say, "This thing is written too badly, let me adapt it into a masterpiece." Because of this, we always take masterpieces as the blueprint for adaptation. After the adaptation, whether the value still maintains its original standard is very questionable. It would be even more amazing if it could be surpassed. It is extremely rare for someone like Shakespeare to turn other people's poor works into immortal masterpieces. The adaptation of this play cannot escape this fate either.

The most reprehensible point in the adaptation is making Salingzi pregnant with He Gang's child. Because of this, noble feelings become inferior carnal desires. What is even more ugly is getting married after being three months pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage that kills the child. Perhaps the playwright did not think of this at the time, and only thought about how to strengthen the feelings between Salingzi and He Gang, so this consequence was produced.

In the performance, although the atmosphere is not unified throughout, it can be clearly seen that the actress who played Salingzi gave it a lot of help, making the atmosphere thicker and more of a tragedy. At the same time, what we can feel is that the inner sadness becomes an external sadness.

If we put the atmosphere aside and don't talk about it, then we can draw a line with Salingzi's marriage. We can see how happy and lively she was before her marriage, and how painful and depressed she was after her marriage. These can make us know why she is like this.

Among the actors, Shangguan Yunzhu, who played Salingzi, is the best. At least she did not let this character fall into mediocrity. What we fear most in any performance is the mediocrity and lack of ups and downs in the actors' acting skills. They should use their acting skills to make a character come alive on stage! Otherwise, these so-called male and female actors should be driven off the stage!

The above three plays were all performed by the New Art Troupe at the China Theatre. If we talk about the performance level of the three plays, it should undoubtedly be "Dream of the Red Chamber."

### New Film Criticism: Battlefield Lovers

— Yu Fu

This is not a nonsensical American film, but a more meaningful one. It depicts an American musician who is hired by the Soviet Arts Committee to perform everywhere in the Soviet Union and is very popular with the Soviet people. At this time, he meets a Soviet girl, and they fall in love during a night of wandering in Moscow and eventually get married. After marriage, they both perform everywhere. Unexpectedly, the German army attacks the Soviet Union, driving straight in. Because the woman misses her family, she leaves her husband and returns to her hometown. Because the war is unfavorable, it will affect the woman's hometown. Seeing that his wife has gone and not returned, the American musician obtains a pass and goes to look for his wife. On the way, he encounters enemy planes bombing, and after many difficulties, he arrives at the woman's home and sees that the house has been bombed and his father-in-law has been killed. He then sees enemy planes strafing and shooting dead a Soviet child. At this time, the enemy troops are about to arrive, and all the villagers burn all the rice in the fields and organize a guerrilla team to prepare to fight the enemy. The musician John Meredith and his wife Nadien also want to join the guerrillas. But they hope that the couple can return to the United States and tell the Americans about this situation so that the Americans can help them. So they return to the United States to put on a grand musical concert for the Soviet Union.

This is starred by Robert Taylor and Susan Peters, and it cannot be said to be too bad. However, the Soviet flavor in this film is not strong. Only the scene where John and Nadien get married and the villagers dance makes people feel like this place is in the Soviet Union and people are dancing. Other than that, there are only some Soviet street scenes. However, this is not an easy task, because he has moved far away from those nonsensical things.

The mistake lies with the producer and director. They should have been very clear about Cary's personality and acting skills beforehand, whether he is the most suitable for this play. If not and he must be used to star in it, then the simplest thing is to add more "his type" of scenes so that he can show his genius and make the play greatly excel. Or even ask the screenwriter to revise the play for Cary. Otherwise, they should not have hired Cary! Having used Cary, then the child's acting is not bad, but the director still lacks research; because Cary is suitable for exaggerated comedy, for Cary, the child should be replaced with a shorter one. If the little fat boy in the young village can come over, there will definitely be better results.

I quite agree with the play's writing and intention, but I do not agree with the person in charge's random selection of people and random shooting of the play.

Actor-wise, Cary is still competent, the child is not bad, and Jeanne Crain is still a young actress who has just emerged here, with no good or bad to say.

### Charlie Chaplin's New Work Comes Out

— Xin Fang

The generation's comedian Charlie Chaplin has been away from the silver screen for a long time. According to recent telegraphs: Chaplin has begun filming another new work since June 1 this year. The new work was originally named "Bluebeard", but has recently been renamed "Comedy Murders". It is still directed and starred by Mr. Zhuo, and is scheduled to be completed within ten months. Zhuo's production is known for its prudence. The filming time of this film has not exceeded one year. In terms of his personal history in the film industry, it can also be said to be the first time ever! I think that when all the flowers are in full bloom next year, movie fans all over the world will be able to see this generation's comedian on the screen again.

"The Great Dictator" was a work by Mr. Zhuo before the outbreak of the Japanese-American War (this film has not yet been shown in Shanghai, and the Shanghai audience unanimously thinks it is a pity). Since "The Great Dictator" and the start of filming of this new work, Mr. Zhuo has been out of the film industry for six years. During these six years, there have been many changes in Mr. Zhuo's private life. Although Mr. Zhuo is getting older, he is still as romantic as ever in Hollywood!

### The Story of "Distant Love"

— Ling

In the winter of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, Professor Xiao gave a speech at the Youth Hall, which aroused the dissatisfaction of his lover Zhu Manli, so she left without saying goodbye. Seeing this, Chang quickly ended his speech and chased after her, and Zhu then proposed a marriage condition to Chang. Without any choice, Hui resolutely came.

Professor Xiao's housekeeper Auntie Zhen was washing and drying clothes, and the rickshaw puller came forward to tease her. She resisted, so the two fought. Upon hearing this, came out and reprimanded him. The rickshaw puller falsely accused Auntie Zhen of stealing rice. After Wu Yanan interceded, the suspicion was dispelled.

On the day of Xiao and Zhu's engagement, the bride did not arrive, so Xiao announced that he and Zhu had broken up again and that he would create an ideal wife. That night, Xiao discovered that Auntie Zhen was secretly reading a book. So he took Auntie Zhen as the object of creation. Gai Professor taught Auntie Zhen every day, and also received social training and etiquette.

Once Auntie Zhen went upstairs to ask Wu for advice, and it happened that a seminar was being held in Wu's room. Auntie Zhen heard a man calling for oppressed women, and Wu also talked about Auntie Zhen's experience, and Auntie Zhen was greatly moved.

The old father came to tell that Auntie Zhen's brother had been arrested. Auntie Zhen was greatly grieved and fell into her old father's arms, crying bitterly. A few days later, his brother came to say goodbye, saying that he did not want to be a beast and was determined to join the army to fight against Japan!

The January 28th Incident occurred, and Auntie Zhen's father and brother sacrificed because of it. She had been transformed and was no longer what she used to be. Now she is busy participating in nursing classes, serving injured anti-Japanese soldiers.

On the way, he saw Auntie Zhen and Li Qun together, and he became jealous and followed them. Suddenly, he was scattered by the crowd parade, so he went home alone.

He found Auntie Zhen back in the hospital, and Li came to visit, but he refused. Wu therefore quarreled with Xiao, and Zhen came to send them out, crying bitterly because she was disappointed with his attitude.

On the eve of the July 7th Incident, the Japanese army was conducting exercises in Pingjin, and the war began. Xiao did not want Auntie Zhen to participate in any anti-Japanese work. Wu came to visit, and Auntie Zhen complained to him and inquired about the current situation. Unexpectedly, the August 13th Incident occurred, and Auntie Zhen resolutely went out to participate in the work.

Xiao was invited to leave Shanghai for Hankou, and entrusted his wife to Wu. The National Army withdrew from Nanjing, and Xiao sent a telegram urging Auntie Zhen to leave Shanghai for Hankou. Auntie Zhen then left Shanghai with the refugee ship, leaving the older children with Wu, and taking the younger children with her. She was bombed on the way, and her young son died tragically.

Received a call knowing that Auntie Zhen had arrived in Hankou, although three or five young people came to ask for work, he refused to pay the tax and went straight to pick up his wife. At the pier, she found out that Zhen was a soldier. After returning home, was dissatisfied with Auntie Zhen's military uniform and rudeness, and Auntie Zhen was also tired of the decadent life of. Just when female soldier A Tang came to visit, she went to work in the area with her. He was shocked and chased to the work team, begging Auntie Zhen to return, but Zhen did not allow it, so he broke up.

When Wuhan was withdrawn, Xiao Yuanxi went to Guilin to visit Wu Yanan. Wu told her that Auntie Zhen had joined the service group led by Li Qun.

When Guilin was withdrawn, Xiao walked on foot. He met Wu on the way and went to the service group to find Zhen together. Xiao Xiqiu wanted to restore their relationship, and Zhen replied that they would talk about it after the victory.

The Soviet Union joined the war and Japan surrendered on its knees. Xiao arrived in Shanghai and returned to his old house. The eldest son asked his father about the situation on the battlefield, but Xiao could not answer.

Shocked to return from the welcome banquet, he saw that the eldest son and Auntie Zhen were together. Gai Sui sought to reunite, and Zhen had the intention to agree. Because she occasionally saw Xiao's erroneous views, she became furious and debated with Gai. Xiao insisted on his own opinions, so Auntie Zhen left. Together with Li Lianqun, she ran to the future. Pursuing distant love.

Professor Xiao then announced his marriage to Zhu Manli during his birthday celebration, and said that Auntie Zhen had exceeded himself after the transformation.

### Longing for the Fantastic

— Zhu Xi

Cary Grant's previous films always gave the impression of a "comedic figure," like "Bringing Up Baby," which was recently shown at the Cathay. However, this "Longing for the Fantastic" is completely different.

The play stars Cary and a child. The story is about a little caterpillar. The news reporter's cleverness and the scientist's singularity, as well as the selfishness of mankind, are all deeply satirized. There is no love story, so the style of the play is quite high.

Cary plays one of the selfish humans. His personality seems ill-suited to the role. Only the scene where the child follows behind him playing the harmonica and the part where he peeks through the peephole of a shoebox show Cary's acting style. In other parts, he doesn't seem very satisfying. It's as if he shouldn't act this way. Is it a lack of acting ability? No, in other areas, like "Bringing Up Baby" and "My Favorite Wife," his acting skills are exceptionally high, like a pointed mountain. Therefore, the fact that he can use such a large name on advertisements is the best evidence. Now, this "Longing for the Fantastic" is outside of his peak performance, so his performance seems somewhat incompatible and cannot fully satisfy people. An actor doesn't necessarily have to have many-sided personality. Not having many-sided personality is not necessarily a failure. As long as he has superhuman acting skills in one area, he will still be admired and praised by most people. Cary is that kind of person.

### Film and Theater News

Tang Huang, designer and director of China Electric Company's First Factory, is actively completing a short film titled "Agriculture as the Foundation of the Nation," starring Lian Dian's Shi Lin. Chen Baicheng is currently residing quietly in Guling, living a peaceful life, and is immersed in writing a historical drama, "Yuan Shikai, the National Thief," which is expected to be completed within a month.

On the 19th, the First Factory of China Electric Company informally screened excerpts of "Family of Loyalty and Righteousness" that had not yet been edited and dubbed. In addition to the director and actors, only a few staff members attended. It is said that once the editing and dubbing work is completed, all comrades in the cultural, news, and film and theater circles will be invited.

(4) Persistence of Vision

When the human retina receives a stimulus from the optic nerve, visual perception does not occur until the excitation is transmitted to the brain center. This transmission time is called the visual latency period. The length of this latency period varies depending on the observed object and individual eyesight. For example, when red light enters the eye, it is perceived as gray for only one-tenth of a second. As time passes, it is perceived as yellow and then orange. Only between one hundredth and two- or three-tenths of a second does the true color become visible.

Since vision requires a latency period to begin, it also does not disappear immediately after the sensation. Examples include seeing a flame as a wheel or legs as lines. These are all phenomena of persistence of vision. In terms of color, rotating red and black blends to become [omitted], and black and white mixes to become gray. The stronger the light intensity, the shorter the latency period. The colder the color, the longer the persistence. Typically, the persistence of white is about 0.7-0.8 seconds, yellow is 0.083 seconds, red is 0.096 seconds, and blue is the longest at 0.122 seconds. Furthermore, when the human eye suddenly receives strong light and then closes, it transitions from positive afterimages of blue, purple, green, and red to a negative black image. This also illustrates that the persistence phenomenon varies in length depending on the wavelength of each color of light.

The color image caused by persistence of vision is called a complementary color. For example, staring at red and then shifting the gaze to another place will result in a complementary green-blue color being seen. Scholars explain the complementary color afterimage by suggesting that during the sensation, the part of the retina sensing red undergoes a chemical decomposition process. This process gradually strengthens and then weakens. When the gaze shifts to a grayish-white object, all types of optic nerves responsible for red, blue, and green should be activated. However, the optic nerve responsible for red is already weakened, so the remaining green-blue sensation is dominant, resulting in the perception of a green-blue afterimage.

The influence of complementary color afterimages on subsequent color perception varies in strength. The inductive force of red and green is stronger, while blue, yellow, and purple are weaker. Furthermore, saturated colors have the strongest force, while unsaturated and dark colors are weaker. Designers of stage sets and cinematographers of color films must pay attention to the effect that complementary color afterimages give to a subsequent shot. Only in this way can the complementary color afterimage of the previous shot, plus the actual color used, equal the correct color intended.

At the same time, complementary color afterimages can also affect the change in color at the point where two colors meet when they are placed next to each other. For example, when red and purple are placed side by side, red appears slightly orange, and purple appears slightly blue. Designers who want to make the division between colors clear should ideally use complementary color lines in between. The use of gold thread in ancient Chinese costume design also aims to make the two colors absolutely distinct. To harmonize colors, intermediate colors should be used in between, or the same color should be used with varying degrees of saturation.

Complementary color afterimages can be used in projection. Bertolt Brecht once conducted an experiment: he used an ordinary flat mirror and, slightly distanced from the mirror surface, covered it with a piece of colored glass that was not too dense. He then projected strong floodlights onto it and placed a pencil diagonally in front of the mirror. Two projections could be seen: one was the complementary color, and the other was the color of the glass. These two colors were visible separately. If this kind of setup were used to project various scenes onto a cyclorama, then the decoration of beautiful double images would have unlimited potential for development.

(5) Color Contrast

Understanding the phenomenon of persistence of vision makes it easy to understand the reason for color contrast.

Color contrast not only carries special value in design, but also wields deadly power in painting, stage makeup, clothing, and stage set design. This will be discussed separately.

(1) Luminance Contrast: When black and white are placed side by side, white appears whiter, and black appears blacker. When gray is compared to white, it appears darker. When compared to black, it appears lighter. If color is compared to black and white, the luminance will also change significantly. For example, saturated yellow is most prominent against a black background, followed by orange, green, and red. Blue and purple, on the other hand, are黯然失色 ("become overshadowed," "lose their luster"). This follows the order of luminance from highest to lowest when each color is saturated. The opposite is true against a white background: blue and purple are most prominent, while yellow is faintest. Against a gray background, the phenomenon of contrast of each color is determined by whether the shade is closer to white or black.

(2) Saturation Contrast: Saturation cannot be separated from luminance and hue. For example, when indigo pigment is applied to paper, it has its own saturation. However, when compared to yellow, its saturation appears very high. When compared to azure, its saturation decreases and it seems black. The same is true for emerald green compared to grass green, and vermillion compared to bright red. As described above, comparing two different colors has the effect previously described. Comparing the saturation of the same color with a color that has been diluted with powder and water also has the same effect. Therefore, it is known that the saturation of color perceived by the human eye also has a variable standard due to persistence of vision.

(3) Hue Contrast: As in the previous example of red and purple being placed side by side, red appears slightly orange, and purple appears slightly blue. This proves that when two different colors are placed next to each other, not only do the hues change, but the saturation also changes. However, when two complementary colors are placed next to each other, the saturation increases without changing the hue. Designers who are skilled at using lines base their skill on this principle.

(4) The sensation of protrusion and recession caused by contrasting colors: This is essential knowledge for face makeup and scene painting.

Protrusion - Recession

White - All colors

All colors - Black

Yellow - All colors except white

Red - All colors except yellow and white

All colors painted black - Brown, purple

Blue gray - Blue, green

### Conservatism and Progress

— Tradition First

General traditionalist conservatives these days often lament, "People's hearts are not as they used to be; the morals of society are declining." They feel that the world is degenerating, and that the Golden Age was before the Three Dynasties. At least the Duke of Zhou, King Wen, King Wu, and Confucius could still be considered a bit orthodox, but later on, morality simply declined and people's hearts became treacherous. But our "high opinion" is exactly the opposite of these traditionalists. We believe that society is constantly progressing. People today are stronger than the ancients in terms of adapting to the environment, the efficiency of their work, and their moral understanding. Although Confucius was able to assist Duke Ding in meeting with the Marquis of Qi in Jiagu, if he were to attend the current Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference with just that bit of his ability, I think the old master would have difficulty coping. Furthermore, in terms of morality, we acknowledge that women are the same as men. We don't have many extravagant and fabricated rituals. We advocate for freedom and equality. In many of these areas, we are more advanced than the ancients. "People's hearts are not as they used to be" is a fact, but we would say "the morals of society are ascending!" The evolution of society must be forward!

What force drives the evolution of society? We can say that it is produced by the opposing yet complementary forces of movement and stillness. Movement is a driving force. Human beings have needs that can never be satisfied, and they cannot but explore forward. Movement is a process of destroying the old and creating the new. Stillness is a force of preservation. When people seek out a new technology to satisfy a new need, they cherish and preserve that technology. Stillness is a conservative state. In terms of the process of social activity, stillness refers to existing social systems, while movement refers to social creation and revolution. Zhou Lianxi said: "The Non-Ultimate is the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates Yang. When movement reaches its extreme, it becomes still, and stillness generates Yin. When stillness reaches its extreme, it moves again. Movement and stillness alternate and are the root of each other… All things are born and transform endlessly." This principle can still be applied to the development of society. These two opposing forces should be complementary. If there is only stillness and no movement, then everything will be solidified and unchanging, and there will be no progress. If new creations do not continue to advance, old experiences will be unable to cope with the environment and unable to maintain survival. Therefore, on the one hand, we must preserve new creations, and on the other hand, when the preserved new creations are insufficient to adapt to newer needs, we must break down old barriers and find new paths.

Based on the above principles, we can further analyze the process of social evolution into five stages. (1) The old social system is not enough to maintain people's hearts and is not enough to satisfy the needs of the masses. At this time, everyone feels the pain in their lives caused by the existing social order. (2) A few visionaries and pioneers begin to want to overthrow the old order and yearn for a new ideal. At this time, only thought is advancing, while behavior remains in the old society. (3) The visionaries and pioneers feel that the time is ripe and lead the masses to take action and fight to achieve the new ideal. This transformation is first in politics, second in economics, and third in social customs and habits. In other words, first there is political revolution or reform, followed by industrial revolution, and then reform of social customs and habits. (4) The new ideal is realized, and the new social system is established. This new order is comparatively able to satisfy the needs of the masses, thus stabilizing people's hearts. People's behavior then begins to be regulated by this new system. (5) Human desires will never be satisfied. The satisfaction of needs creates new needs. These new needs cannot be satisfied by the established social system, and coupled with the rigidity and corruption of the original social system, various new dissatisfactions are produced. The evolution of society climbs upwards layer by layer in this way.

Let's cite two examples to illustrate the above five stages of social evolution. By the middle of the fifteenth century, the theocratic politics of Europe were shaken. Theocratic rule made people feel pain. The Black Death and the corruption of the Church gradually made the masses have to find another way out. The Renaissance was to make people return to human life. However, this ideal only succeeded in the form of a narrow-minded humanistic education, and there was no essential change in life. Later, after the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, the Western social order of modern culture emerged. After two world wars, this new order is once again causing people living under it to feel fear and anxiety. European society is now in this stage.

The despotic patriarchal society that maintained Chinese society for more than two thousand years was no longer able to satisfy the people by the end of the Qing Dynasty. Some of them wanted "reform" and "restoration," while others yearned for a new ideal society. Next was the political revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Although the form of the political system has changed and the political ideology system has been established, the living habits of the general public and even political activities still remain within the system of the old feudal society. Chinese society is now in this stage. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's words, "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard," are still relevant. The subsequent transformation of Chinese society will have to wait for the political revolution to be completed, so that China reaches a modern and unified state in the experimentation of political systems, followed by economic reform and construction, and then social culture will be transformed, and the new social system will be completed.

Society is evolving, but in which direction is it evolving? I believe that the evolution of society is gradually increasing public welfare. The old social system was able to be established in the first place because, given the intelligence, experience, and existing circumstances of the people at the time, this system was the most able to satisfy common needs. However, the circumstances and experience at the time limited people's vision. Later, when someone recognized the shortcomings of this system, coupled with the emergence of new needs, people rose up to seek a newer system. Why? Because they want to further increase everyone's welfare. When this is achieved, it also means that society has taken a step further. Therefore, in the process of social evolution, only a social order that can better satisfy the needs of the masses and increase public welfare has a greater possibility of success. If there is a force that wants to maintain an unreasonable order and hinder public welfare, then it is a countercurrent. Although it can be sustained for a while, it will eventually fail, because society is always moving forward.

In the current situation of Chinese society, we can see two opposing forces. One is to maintain the original state; the other is to completely change it. Although these two forces are now having opposite effects, unfortunately, they cannot yet be complementary. The movement side is doing its best to destroy the work of the stillness side, while the stillness side is desperately clinging to the existing state of stillness and not allowing it to be destroyed. The existing state of affairs is not adapting to the needs of the masses, and everyone is complaining. This is a fact. Therefore, someone who is working to break the existing state of affairs will be welcomed. However, this creates a misconception that as long as the current situation is broken, it will be considered a success. They do not know that everyone's approval of changing the current situation is not for destruction, but for construction. Everyone hopes that a more reasonable order will appear. Therefore, just destroying is not enough, and maintaining the status quo is also not enough. Society must always move forward. If you don't improve society, someone will come up with ways to improve it. Therefore, we hope that the movement side will recognize the constructive and stabilizing nature of social evolution. On the stillness side, we must also be determined to reform the existing state of affairs and cooperate with the needs of everyone. We hope that these two forces will be opposite yet complementary, so as to promote social development and increase common happiness.

### Transformation (Fiction)

— Luo Hong

Lu Shiping has recently acquired two new habits: First, he likes to put his right hand to the bridge of his nose to push up his glasses; second, he loves to say "No can do." These words, dropping from his mouth, are both crisp and resounding, almost carrying a hint of authority. His colleagues can't help but look at him askance—why is Lu Shiping putting on this kind of show? He has always been the most stingy and small-minded among his colleagues, never willing to spend a single penny on friends; but look at his recent demeanor, it is indeed somewhat different: his attitude, his speech, have all changed. Although his clothes and socks are not necessarily more elaborate than before, they seem to be cleaner.

"What's with Old Lu?" colleagues whispered behind his back.

Some believe that he is extremely bored and deliberately pretending to be something he is not, to dispel his feelings of ridicule. In these times, the treatment of public school teachers is so meager, far inferior to that of workers and clerks, and no matter how frugal you are, you cannot make ends meet. His attitude of trying to dispel his feelings of ridicule is not without reason; otherwise, one might indeed starve to death, and one would certainly feel suffocated.

But after careful observation, it can be seen that Lu Shiping's new attitude is definitely not for the sake of dispelling ridicule. No matter what he talks to people about, he always has to say a few "No can do" remarks with emotion, reminding people to look at reality: everyone is selfish, unwilling to work, and sometimes he even cites one or two examples. When speaking, he extends the two fingers of his right hand to the bridge of his nose and pushes his glasses up.

Towards students, his posture is even more imposing, often pushing up his glasses with his head held high, shouting loudly "No can do."

Today, for some unknown reason, he is in a bad mood; after the bell rang for the end of class, several students stood up and asked him:

"Mr. Lu, we don't have enough time to write, can we hand in the essay papers after class!"

He said very sternly, "No can do." Pushing up his glasses, he added:

"How can there be any exceptions? Didn't I say that they would be invalid if submitted late?"

"This topic is not easy, there are many possible interpretations."

"Alright, then, I'll make an exception this time."

But many voices immediately rushed over: "You said it yourself, Mr. Lu, papers submitted after the time limit will be invalid."

This is a bit difficult for him, and he pushes up his glasses. However, from the densely packed seats, voices continue to rush over: "In the end, how can we make exceptions, and how can we not be allowed to make exceptions?"

He got angry, his eyeballs bulged out, as if he wanted to bite someone. Usually, even when he is angry, he only frowns and glares at the students. Now, with a psychological backing, his voice is also much louder, and he says loudly:

"Who's making noise? This kind of behavior is not allowed!"

He casually pushed his glasses up, straightened his body, and walked out of the classroom amidst the noise, thinking angrily in his heart: "It's really meaningless to be a poor teacher, not to mention anything else, it's troublesome to be bullied by these little brats. What hope is there for China's future—with students like these naughty ones!"

He became sentimental. Back in the lounge, his colleagues saw his angry face, and someone deliberately provoked him, saying:

"Shiping, why are you angry?"

He first hesitated and denied that he was angry, then shook his head and said that the students were really "no good," and he was pessimistic about the future of Chinese education.

"You are truly far-sighted, thinking so comprehensively!" The colleague said with a smile. "I only feel that life is difficult, and one must solve the problem of living before one has the leisure to think about one's personal future, the future of education, and the future of the country! If one has food but no clothes, how can one have the means to think about these things!"

Several people listening nearby exchanged glances and laughed, hoping to find an explanation for Lu Shiping's new attitude. Of course, everyone knew that Lu Shiping's sudden change to arrogance must have some new development. But why was he so secretive, not revealing any information to others? Being a teacher, getting along with young students, has its own kind of harmonious and joyful meaning, and the interactions between colleagues are also simpler than in other professions. If you meet a few who you can talk to, you can establish pure friendships with each other. But these days, everything is so turbulent and unstable, and the treatment of teachers and civil servants is so unreasonable that life forces everyone to put on a sullen face, and there is no longer any leisurely mood. Those who can find other ways out have gradually turned to other professions, so if Lu Shiping wants to find another career and abandon this teaching job, everyone would not find it strange, but what makes them interested now is why Lu Shiping is so secretive?

Lu Shiping pushed the students' papers onto the corner of his desk in annoyance, shaking his head and humming several "No can do" remarks from his nostrils!

Next to him was the desk of Xu Weixin, the chemistry teacher. Seeing Lu Shiping's attitude, he wanted to make a few jokes to relax everyone's dull mood, but Cheng Junyi walked in the door and said as soon as he stepped in:

"Do you all know what new development Shiping has had?"

Everyone focused their attention at the same time, wanting to know what Lu Shiping was up to, so they were particularly interested in Cheng Junyi's words. Everyone asked him what was going on.

Cheng Junyi had a half-smiling expression, indicating that he was knowledgeable and well-informed. Everyone pressed him to speak, but he insisted on apologizing to Lu Shiping first, asking if Lu Shiping could announce it himself.

Lu Shiping, who was angry, immediately changed to a gentle and cheerful expression. He told Cheng Junyi not to talk nonsense.

"What nonsense?" Junyi said. "Listen everyone, Shiping has written a script and sent it to Mr. Morley. As long as Mr. Morley introduces it, he can choose a famous theater troupe to stage the play. If it sells well, the performance tax will be at least one or two million!"

Everyone congratulated Lu Shiping on his success. Everyone knew that he had some connections with Mr. Morley, who was quite capable in the theater world, and Lu Shiping had always been very fond of theater.

"After all, it's Shiping—I wish you success in advance! If you can simply drop this poor teacher's job, then I will be even happier for you," said Xu Weixin.

"Don't listen to him, this is all Cheng Junyi's unfounded rumors," Lu Shiping defended. "How could I have the ability to write a script, and how could the first script sell well and earn one or two million in taxes?"

"In that case, Junyi must have deliberately spread rumors!"

"I never spread rumors in my life!" Cheng Junyi said firmly.

Several impatient people couldn't stand this roundabout approach, so they simply asked Lu Shiping what new opportunities he had. Everyone was overwhelmed by the pressure of life and was willing to see a colleague escape this difficult life.

However, the old gentleman who taught history by the window did not think so. He could not stand Lu Shiping's arrogant expression—changing jobs is just earning a few more dollars, what is there to be so pretentious and smug about!

Xu Weixin and the others were still joking with Lu Shiping, who only admitted that he was collaborating with a well-known person in the theater world to adapt a script.

"Don't count me in, just because the original work is famous, and the co-author is also quite famous, he can always borrow some light. As long as it can be staged, the box office should be good."

Several listeners envied Lu Shiping greatly. Having such a hobby in one's spare time would be a significant supplement to one's life! Moreover, playing with theater is indeed very interesting.

At this intriguing moment, it was time for everyone to go to class. Each person carried lecture notes or books, resenting that they could not find a side job. The anger that Lu Shiping had just felt towards the students had long subsided. He had originally planned not to let everyone know, and when the play was staged, he would invite all his colleagues to see it, giving them a surprise, letting them know that Lu Shiping also had this skill! But now that Cheng Junyi had revealed it first, that was fine too. He went to teach a class arrogantly, often reaching out to push his glasses, but he no longer put on a sullen face and said "No can do"; although he still said it, his expression was much milder.

Lu Shiping was immersed in fantasy, dreaming of how the audience would be captivated by this play. He looked at his colleagues arrogantly, looked at his students with disgust, and sometimes even glared at them as they came and went.

This attitude lasted for more than two weeks, and then Lu Shiping's attitude suddenly changed again. He became silent, and he often pushed his glasses, but as if he was angry with them, so coldly, with a strong hint of unwillingness.

So, his colleagues whispered privately: What's wrong with Lu Shiping? People can deliberately joke about and expose someone's successful things, but now that kind of unsuccessful expression makes it inconvenient for colleagues to ask him about it, lest they upset him. But everyone said at every opportunity: "What is Shiping up to, why has he changed his mind again?"

After several days passed so boringly, the nosy Cheng Junyi secretly reported to everyone again, this time not in front of Lu Shiping.

"Shiping's script is a bust—there is no way to stage it recently," he said.

As if confirming an interesting piece of news, everyone was disappointed for Lu Shiping, and also breathed a sigh of relief for Lu Shiping. It turned out that he was silent and unhappy because he could not stage the play. That history professor was almost gloating—he thought it was better that there was no way to stage it, otherwise, Lu Shiping's arrogant expression would not know how high it would rise!

"Why is that?"

Junyi shook his head, closing his eyes for three to five seconds, indicating that this matter was very difficult to explain.

"I messed up last time, Shiping did not ask Mr. Morley to criticize and introduce it. He and the co-author asked someone else to introduce it, so Mr. Morley was a little unhappy, and this plan is difficult to succeed," Junyi said, and then expressed his regret for Shiping, saying that if it was put on hold like this, it was uncertain when there would be another opportunity.

"Then why didn't you ask Mr. Morley to introduce it?"

"That was probably the co-author's idea," Junyi said. "It turns out that there are factions in everything in the world. I hate this kind of thing the most. It's meaningless!"

Just as he was saying this, Lu Shiping came in. Everyone pretended that they had not talked about this matter.

After Lu Shiping greeted them, he secretly sized them up a few times, somewhat suspecting that they were talking about him, but he could not see anything, so he sat silently at his desk, not saying a word or laughing with others.

Liao Dong responded and left. At this time, he felt very confused in his heart!

He also felt that the scene he had just witnessed was very tragic, but he felt even more terrified! Today, he saw Xiao Hong clearly for the first time, and this first impression was such a bloody, tearful, and fragmented impression! He was almost afraid to look at her again! If their relationship was not linked together, perhaps his feelings would be much better than now, at least he would sympathize with her and help her like Baoling. But as soon as their relationship was linked together, she was his future wife; he would live with her permanently; this made him worry! He had already conceived the idea of leaving this family in the future, but thinking that he would be restrained by this future wife, he was not only worried, but also resentful! Because of these complex feelings, he was troubled! He could not bring himself to approach Xiao Hong happily, so he went to the store to weigh two taels of rice ginseng, and took "Yunnan Baiyao," asking Master Li to send it to Boss Liao.

The proprietress was unhappy seeing Boss Liao so concerned about Xiao Hong, and she could not say anything with her eyes covered. She perfunctorily helped Baoling carry Xiao Hong to the bed in the room. Taking the opportunity, she vented her anger on Baoling, saying:

"Alright, you can go to the store now. It's all because you helped her in the kitchen that you helped cause this disaster!"

Baoling, hindered by the fact that Boss Liao was present, did not speak. She silently cursed,

"Heartless shrew! Executioner!"

Boss Liao first applied "Yunnan Baiyao" to Xiao Hong's two feet, which were covered in blood, and then wrapped them in cloth for her. Then he asked the proprietress to boil some ginseng soup and fed her a bowl, and only felt relieved after seeing Xiao Hong calm down a little.

After a few days, Xiao Hong's injuries were still serious, festering, and she remained unconscious. It was thanks to Boss Liao going to ask a doctor to treat her, and constantly letting her drink some ginseng soup to invigorate her and replenish her blood. According to the doctor, Xiao Hong's feet would definitely not be healed in a short period of time, and she would be disabled even after they were healed.

The proprietress was completely frustrated! She thought: It's only been a month or two since she married into the family, and such a big mess has happened. The medical expenses will cost a lot, which is really a loss. If she is disabled in the future, she will not only be unable to help herself, but she will also have to support her for the rest of her life, wouldn't it be a waste of my efforts? She did not dare to complain to Boss Liao about these things, because she had caused them herself. The boss was still complaining about herself. Moreover, this misfortune was also caused by herself. (Naturally, she dared not tell Boss Liao about this.)

### Last Night's Moon

— Zhongyuan

Last night's moon was truly beautiful, like a silver-white plate, hanging high in the center of the blue sky. I opened the window and let a piece of clear brilliance shine in, so I stood quietly by the window, thinking of a friend far away.

It seemed to be such a beautiful moonlit night, that friend, had stared at me with a pair of calm eyes, told me:

"You are building jade towers in the moon palace, you are salvaging pearls in the clouds."

Not understanding her meaning, I stared blankly at her, she smiled, stretched out a slender white hand, pointed to the bright moon and white clouds in the sky, and asked me softly:

"Do you love these?"

"Yes!" I replied quietly.

"But do you know that this is wind, this is shadow, this is illusion, this is ethereal, this is not life!"

I understood a little, and immediately lowered my head. For a long time, I told her painfully:

"I know, but I love these!"

She smiled again and patted my shoulder:

"It doesn't matter if you love them, what matters is: don't be serious!"

After saying this, she left, to a distant place.

Since then, whenever a beautiful moonlit night comes, I will always think of that friend, and I will always feel confused and lost.

### Paradise Lost

— Yang Mou

——Occasionally, on a night street, I stumbled upon a small Western-style envelope covered in mud in the corner of the sidewalk. Perhaps it was trampled by people's shoes! However, I could still faintly recognize that there were no words on the envelope. Opening it, there were two sheets of paper filled with messy strokes, and in the lower left corner was the bright red name of the organization. The owner of this letter, judging from the handwriting, seemed to be a woman, but also seemed to be a man. The age seemed to be very young, and the letter was full of young people's feelings. There was no signature, nor was there a recipient. After reading it from beginning to end, it added to the burden in my heart. I thought, it would be better to make it public and return it to the writer and the recipient. Some places inside were also vague, and I could only make up for them based on speculation.

Why haven't you written for several days? I hope to see more information, just like searching for a source in the desert wilderness. But, I am also afraid of reading the letters, because I don't know if you are intentional or unintentional, you always like to prick my soul, yes, my soul. I still have it, and I think that is not very good.

The situation of life is always bad, and the thoughts in my mind have become more divergent these days.

Going to the office is really annoying. Signing in, sitting, talking and laughing, budgeting, submitting reports...stirring it up, it's simply playing with life. A boring day passed by day by day, and I couldn't think of a reason for myself. I write a diary at night, and I stare at the book blankly for a long time. As a result, I still go out to the street and squeeze into a large circle in the crowd.

My director is really not good, he is the young guy in a suit, but he has a big head. It is said that he is the nephew of X, who squints his eyes when he talks and smiles. When I tell him some good ideas, he always pushes and delays. It's so annoying. Fortunately, there is nothing to do, so I just read the newspaper in the office. A newspaper can now be read for four or five hours. Look at how good a skill this is.

I have no interest in reading at all, and I have sent all my old books away. These things are a waste to read. Lying on my desk looking at the office, it's okay not to use these things. My family doesn't have people who steal national disasters and victories like bandits. I can go to foreign countries to gild myself. I knew this a long time ago, and I would not have suffered so much for nothing.

Are crows all black under the sky? K.S.P. also always tells me about these receipts, reimbursements, and false accounts in letters. …Alas, a mess, a mess. Can these things ultimately be done? Can’t they be done? In the current disordered environment, it simply fills people with doubt and hesitation. Coercion, enticement, no human sympathy, no interest in life, external attacks plus internal weakness, I myself doubt how long I can respect myself. A dirty environment is of course an ugly model. Can't I escape the norms of this model? Sadness comes from my heart, but I can't deceive myself.

Tell me, will you also stare blankly at the bright moon? Tell me, will you also shower in the roar of the storm?

Memories cannot quench the thirst in my heart, and the future is even darker. All that exists is a faint fluorescent light, but even with hard work, it cannot illuminate the trajectory of the road. –Are you also like this, why can't our lives break free from this rut?

Write back to me quickly, it's terribly lonely around here. How much will a person who has lost happiness cherish the distant friendship?
