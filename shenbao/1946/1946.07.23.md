### Marshal Ma Returns to the Capital from Kuling, Bringing Back Government Opinion; Yu Ta-wei Visited Last Night

[Special Dispatch from Kuling, This Newspaper, 22nd] Special Envoy Marshall descended the mountain from Kuling at 7:30 this morning. Chairman Chiang specially sent Director-General Huang Jen-lin to see him off. The reporter also accompanied him to the riverside. Marshal Ma and his entourage then crossed the river and boarded the plane at 9:30. According to Marshal Ma's aides, Marshal Ma stayed in Kuling for 85 hours. His residence was close to Chairman Chiang's headquarters, and he maintained contact with Chairman Chiang almost every day. He has gained a deep and new understanding of the government's attitude. When he left the mountain, he was smiling, symbolizing that the trip had yielded significant results. It is said that Marshal Ma had more confidence in the future of peace in China when he descended the mountain than when he ascended it. Marshal Ma's wife remains in Kuling.

[Special Dispatch from Nanking, This Newspaper, 22nd] Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Nanking from Kuling at 10:30 this morning, landing at the Waijiao Airport. Among those arriving in Nanking were Military Secretary Pi Tsan-chun Tsung-kan, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Smerth, and two of Marshal Ma's adjutants. After getting off the plane, Marshal Ma was eager to return to his residence by car to avoid contact with the press and being surrounded by reporters. However, Marshal Ma did not answer any of the questions raised by the reporters. As for whether Marshal Ma brought any new opinion from this trip, Marshal Ma also refused to comment. However, according to reporter investigations, Marshal Ma did indeed bring a government opinion from Kuling to Nanking. Marshal Ma returned to his residence to rest immediately after arriving in Nanking. In the afternoon at 4:00, Ambassador Stuart visited Marshal Ma at his residence. Around 5:00, Yu Ta-wei made an appointment to visit. Yu refused to answer questions about the content of the discussion and whether any negotiations took place, only stating that Shao Lizi or General Xu Shuichang, one of the two, would definitely meet with Marshal Ma within a day or two. According to general observations, this symbolizes that the Three-Man Committee will be reconvened. It is heard that General Xu Shuichang will return to Nanking in the next few days.

[Special Dispatch from Kuling, Central News Agency, 22nd] The local area is placing its hopes for important developments in the current situation on Marshal Ma's trip to Nanking, as Marshal Ma has taken the government's opinion to Nanking today. It is heard that the government's opinion is still based on the consistent policy of political resolution.

[Special Dispatch from Washington, United Press, 22nd] News from various sources proves that Special Envoy Marshall's great efforts to promote internal peace in China are failing. If the Special Envoy cannot achieve his goal and returns home, it will only prove that he undertook an almost impossible task from the beginning, which will not affect his great abilities. The conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China has long been considered by well-informed sources to be unlikely to be resolved. President Truman's request for the Special Envoy to try to reconcile proves that the President refuses to admit its impossibility without first making a direct and great effort to resolve it. It is highly likely that the Special Envoy will return home for a rest immediately. However, even if the Special Envoy leaves without an agreement, it does not mean that the United States will stop its efforts to promote peace and security in China, both domestically and internationally. President Truman has appointed Stuart as the U.S. Ambassador to China. Ambassador Stuart is welcomed by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and he will continue to promote the work initiated by Special Envoy Marshall.

[Special Dispatch from Washington, Associated Press, 21st] According to well-informed official sources, the achievements made by Marshall in promoting peace in China are currently unchanged compared to the previous months. Another report said that diplomatic and other qualified people in Nanking all believe that Marshall's efforts are doomed to failure, and he is scheduled to return to the United States in mid-August. However, according to the same source, this news has not yet been confirmed by people close to General Marshall here. Also, according to well-informed U.S. official sources, the rumors that Marshall and other U.S. officials have changed their original intentions are absolutely untrue.

### Before the Door of Negotiation is Completely Closed, It is Still Appropriate to Adopt a Political Approach; Minister Chen Corrects the United Press Report

[News from This City] Yesterday, a reporter visited Minister Chen Lifu of the Central Organization Department to inquire whether he had replied to Mr. Zhou Enlai's letter requesting correction. Minister Chen said that he had not received a reply. The reporter further asked whether Mr. Zhou had said in Shanghai that Minister Chen had jointly instigated the Kunming assassination case, as reported by the United Press in its translation of Minister Chen's conversation with a reporter from the Nanking Central Daily News. Chen replied: "I have never mentioned this sentence to the Nanking Central Daily News. The news published by the Nanking Central Daily News on the 21st also does not contain this sentence. And as far as I know, Mr. Zhou only said in Shanghai that I strengthened the secret service organization in Shanghai and arranged new assassinations. I have already sent a letter of protest against this. It can be seen from the last sentence of the United Press's telegram, 'I requested Zhou Enlai to withdraw his statement in Shanghai that I was related to the Kunming political assassination, but I did not receive a reply,' that the United Press actually confused these two matters." Minister Chen also said: "I did not receive any reporters from the Central Daily News in Nanking a few days ago. I only briefly discussed the Communist Party issue with a friend from the newspaper. The content of the conversation published by the newspaper was probably obtained indirectly by the reporter, so it differs greatly from the original meaning. After being transmitted by the United Press's telegram, it is even more inconsistent. I said at the time that dealing with political issues is like treating illnesses. We must adopt the kingly way and not use hegemonic medicine. Therefore, if internal medicine can still cure the disease, we will definitely not resort to surgery. Based on this understanding, I have always advocated a political solution to the Communist Party issue. Recalling 1937, I was ordered to conduct political negotiations with the Communist Party. The Communist Party then issued a declaration of jointly facing the national crisis in September. In that declaration, they provided four promises, such as believing in the Three Principles of the People, obeying Chairman Chiang's command, abolishing the Red Army, and abolishing the Soviet regime. This was the first time since 1927 that our party and the Communist Party resolved issues through political negotiations. I consider the success of this negotiation to be a major accomplishment in my life. I still believe that unless the door of negotiation is completely closed, our party should still adopt a political solution." At that time, a friend from the newspaper asked: "If the facts prove that internal medicine cannot cure the disease and surgery is still promising, then would a good doctor also perform surgery?" I replied, "Yes. For example, with appendicitis, a good doctor will first use internal medicine. If it is proven that it will endanger life, surgery should be performed to remove it. This is truly a last resort and should be avoided as much as possible. Before performing surgery, the opinions of the patient's family must be sought, and it must never be done hastily." My opinion on resolving the Communist Party issue is nothing more than this. However, coming from my mouth, through the newspaper's pen, written indirectly, and then translated into English by the United Press, and then translated back into Chinese, it has gone through three procedures, so it is inevitable that it will differ greatly from the original meaning.

### Marshal Ma's Wife Learns Chinese

While saying this, he repeatedly said that the situation in Kunming was complicated and more than just this.

The atmosphere of the two cities, separated by a river, is completely different. Zhenjiang is affected by the intensified harassment of the Communist Army in northern Kiangsu. The market is depressed and the city is under curfew from 9:00 p.m. The sandbag bunkers and the heavy footsteps of armed soldiers create a very gloomy atmosphere. Although Yangzhou is heavily guarded with dense sentry posts and strict inspections, the people are used to the tension as usual. With the elite National Army stationed there, everything is stable. The scattered Communist forces outside fifteen members have not dared to cross the line.

### The National Army Fought for Four Days and Nights; The City of Nantong Turned from Danger to Safety; The Communist Army Reinforced, and the Yangtai Line Became Tense Again

[Special Dispatch from Wusih, Central News Agency, 22nd] The Communist Army used Jufou as a base to gather troops. Since the 13th of this month, they have been advancing on Nantong, but were stopped by the National Army in the southwestern Dingyenzhen and northwestern Paipuzhen areas. Until the 17th, they failed to succeed. On the 18th, they mobilized more than 30,000 people to encircle and attack the flanks of the National Army defending the area with all their strength, and used several groups to raid the National Army's rear transportation lines, attempting to eliminate the National Army in the area in one fell swoop and seize Nantong to control the Yangtze River. By the 21st, the National Army's positions had been breached many times. The National Army fought bravely for four days and nights with a ratio of one to six, and finally repelled the Communist Army. Division Commander Wang Tieh-han called the military here from his station at 8:00 p.m. on the 22nd, saying that the National Army on the front line of Nantong continued to repel the Communist Army's fierce attacks on the night of the 21st. The incessant charges were repelled. By the morning of the 22nd, the offensive had been thwarted, and all the Communist troops harassing our rear had been driven out. Currently, transportation between Nantong and the garrison troops in the front line is unimpeded. (Note: The spokesman for the Communist Party delegation announced on the morning of the 22nd that Wang Tieh-han was captured by the New Fourth Army southeast of Jufou on the 19th, which is absurd and unfounded.)

### Song Qingling Expresses Opinions on the Current Situation: Only Correct Implementation of the Three People's Principles Can Solve It

Madam Song Qingling, the widow of Sun Yat-sen, yesterday issued a statement of opinion on the current situation, the main points of which are roughly as follows: "The current crisis is not a question of who wins or loses between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It is a question of the Chinese people, as well as their unity, liberation, and livelihood. What should be weighed is not the rights of parties, but the rights of people. The people are eagerly hoping that the continuous negotiations can have some results, but every time a ceasefire agreement is barely reached, new conflicts arise. Negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot make a final decision; the final decision must belong to the people of China. The solution, although difficult, is very clear, that is, to correctly understand Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles—nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood—and their correct implementation today." In her statement, she continued to explain the current significance of the Three People's Principles. She believes that: "The meaning of nationalism today is that China does not belong to the Kuomintang, nor does it belong to the Communist Party. China is a country, a nation. We must have a government that encompasses all the opinions contributed by all the people. The meaning of democracy today is that the Kuomintang's period of tutelage has passed, and the constitutional period must begin. The people of our country have endured hardship to reach this stage, and they have proven that they should have the right to self-government. Therefore, a 'coalition government' must be established immediately. Each party must elect its own representatives. The Kuomintang representatives must also be elected by party members. There are many capable and progressive party members within the Kuomintang who have never had the opportunity to speak. Now is the time to practice democracy in order to establish democracy. Once representatives are elected in a democratic manner, they can proceed to draft a constitution that will be recognized and approved by the people. The representatives must write into the constitution that the Chinese people should have their indispensable fundamental freedoms. People's livelihood today means that the people can no longer suffer from hunger, on the one hand allowing corrupt officials to accumulate wealth, and on the other hand causing loyal and upright officials to complain. The land issue must be resolved reasonably. This is not the agitation of the Communist Party or external forces, but the inevitable result of the logical development of our own history. A hundred years ago, peasant unrest led to the Taiping Rebellion. The people have the right to rise up against hunger. Feudalism and colonialism are undeniable facts. 'The tiller should have his own land' is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition. This was passed in the First National Congress of the Kuomintang. This is the basic plan to cure China's famine. Distributing land to the tillers, this plan for the people's livelihood should be considered throughout the country." After explaining the Three People's Principles, she pointed out that "the Kuomintang must carry out its historical mission, leading the people from democratic politics and land reform to complete liberation. If this mission can be accomplished, the Kuomintang will undoubtedly be the leading party in any 'coalition government.' It will be supported by many people belonging to other parties, including those parties that have no army and are therefore unable to speak in negotiations." In this statement, she finally put forward her two demands: "(1) Demanding that the leaders of the two major parties of China, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as other parties and factions, immediately form a coalition government. (2) Asking American friends to promote this action by stopping all arms supplies and only allowing aid to be given to a government belonging to the Chinese people."

### Chiang Ting-fu and Zhou Enlai Continued Negotiations Yesterday: Agreement Reached on Blocking the Yellow River Mouth; Agreed to Todd's Proposal to Maintain Existing Engineering; There is Talk of Large-Scale Layoffs at UNRRA

[Report from this newspaper] Zhou Enlai, accompanied by his member Zhang Wenjin, CCP representatives Cheng Run, Wu Yunfu, etc., went to UNRRA yesterday morning at about 9 o'clock to continue negotiations on the Yellow River project issue. Those present on the UNRRA side included Chiang Ting-fu, Lai, the acting director of the UNRRA office in China, Vice-Director Persis, agricultural engineering expert Glenn, etc. The atmosphere of the meeting was extremely harmonious, and it concluded satisfactorily at around 11 o'clock. Regarding the blocking project, all parties agreed to adopt the suggestion of American Chief Engineer Todd.

Todd believes that at this time of rising water, efforts should be made to maintain the existing engineering to avoid losing previous efforts. The breach must be built with stone barriers to prevent the water power from completely rushing into the current channel. Although these stone barriers will cause the Yellow River water to flow separately into the new and old channels, it will definitely not endanger the residents along the old channel. At present, the blocking project cannot be carried out due to rising water. Work can only be resumed after the autumn floods in mid-September of the solar calendar. We should now prepare for all the materials and equipment needed for the resumption of work so that the blocking project can be completed by the end of this year. As for the residents who have moved into the old river channel in the past eight years, Director Chiang promised to jointly petition the central government with Chairman Xue of the Water Conservancy Committee to allocate at least 15 billion yuan within four months (August to November) to handle relief. This relief fund is specifically used for the procurement and transportation of materials needed in the CCP-controlled areas of the old Yellow River channel and will be managed by the CCP in conjunction with UNRRA. After the meeting, when the two Mr. Zhou discussed the relief issues in the CCP-controlled areas in the future, Director Chiang expressed that UNRRA is willing to set up more offices in the CCP-controlled areas to facilitate work. (Note that there are already two offices, one in Yantai and one in Heze). He is also willing to organize a survey committee, composed of representatives from UNRRA, UNRRA, and the CCP, to conduct a survey of the actual needs of the people in the CCP-controlled areas. This meeting has reached a concrete agreement. Regarding the exchange of routine official matters in the future, Mr. Zhou appointed Mr. Wu Yunfu as the CCP representative to be responsible for the liaison work between the CCP and UNRRA's UNRRA. Director Chiang promised to provide Mr. Wu with convenience in the above work.

[Another report] It is reported that Director Chiang Ting-fu is scheduled to go to Nanjing in the coming days to report to President Song on the situation of the UNRRA Far East Conference and the progress of the negotiations with Zhou Enlai on the Yellow River project, relief in the CCP area, and other issues.

[Another report] It is reliably learned that UNRRA is now preparing for large-scale layoffs. The original quota of staff in the department was only 600 people, but the total number of layoffs in the two head offices in Nanjing and Shanghai has reached about 1,300 people. Among them are some "appointed commissioners" who are hired and whose salaries are paid from business expenses. In order to vigorously reduce business expenses, they will be the first to be laid off. The personnel department of UNRRA is currently compiling the list, and it is reported that the first batch is mostly personnel from the general affairs department.

### Rumor has it that UNRRA Plans to Reduce the Amount of Funds Allocated to Us

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st Reuters] According to reliable UNRRA sources familiar with UNRRA's Far East affairs, the subcommittee decided on the 19th to reduce China's allocation by US$27 million for the remaining months of this year. This is because other places urgently need cash.

### Inspector Cheng Investigates the Truth of UNRRA's Work

[Report from this city] Since the Control Yuan has been critical of UNRRA's accusations against the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration and its various branches, it has ordered local inspectors to jointly investigate the truth with the audit office at UNRRA and its branches in various places. Cheng Zhonghang, the Jiangsu Inspector here, has also received this order and has joined Yang, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Audit Office, and Li, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Audit Office, to start investigating the facts at UNRRA and the Shanghai Branch yesterday.

### Senior US Officials Considering Banning Arms Shipments to China, Hoping to Promote China's Unification

[United Press, Washington, 21st] United Press learned today that senior US officials are considering a complete ban on arms and weapons shipments to China, hoping to use this to promote US assistance in unifying China. According to those who know Marshal Marshall and his mission in China, Marshal Marshall will stay in China as long as he feels he can still help promote government policy, hoping to realize the final hope of China's unity. If all efforts to mediate peace fail, Marshal Marshall will turn to assisting in redefining US policy toward China. Washington officials are largely considering the issue of banning arms and weapons shipments to China in a mood of despair. This material under the Lend-Lease Act has been supplied to the National Government throughout the war and continued to be supplied even after the victory over Japan, so that the National Army could assist in disarming the defeated Japanese soldiers in China and dare to regain lost ground. More recently, the purpose of this supply was to strengthen China and make it a force in Asia. The value of this material received by China, including weapons, is more than US$1.5 billion. This material is all owned by the Nationalist Army, but the Communist Army has acquired a lot of Japanese equipment left behind by the Nationalist Army in the Northeast. Some Washington authorities deeply fear that if the Nationalist Army is not so well-equipped, it might cooperate with the Communist Party or be more obedient to American orders. However, the CCP's attitude is also tough, and some extremists in the party have reportedly advocated a military solution. According to foreign policy officials here, the United States cannot afford to withdraw from China and let it find its own way out. This is a real dilemma. China's civil war will raise some extremely difficult questions for US foreign policy: If the United States helps the National Government, will the Soviet Union help the Communists? If the United States does not interfere, will the Soviet Union and other countries do the same? Can the United States not take sides between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to prevent the great powers from being drawn into the vortex? Can the United Nations do anything about a civil war in one of the five great powers?

### If the CCP's Actions are Consistent with the Rhythm, They are All Based on Secret Resolutions, Which Can Be Proven by the Facts of the Past Two Months

[Report from Nanjing] According to the Democratic Society, when the National Army entered Changchun, it seized a secret resolution document of the CCP Central Political Bureau. Although the CCP has denied it, the spokesman of the Northeast Security Headquarters has refuted it item by item based on the facts, proving that the CCP's military and political actions are consistent with the secret resolution. When the reporter inquired about the opinions of the government officials in charge on this matter again, it was said that the CCP's various actions in the past two months can further prove that they are based on the first item of the secret resolution, which is to launch a partial military offensive, and the area is in the Northeast. Since the Northeast ceasefire order was issued on June 7, the CCP has continued to attack the National Army in the Lafa area, and the offensive of the Communist Army in other parts of the Northeast has not stopped. The movement of the Communist Army north of Harbin is frequent, and large-scale military operations are actively being prepared. Recently, the military offensive has been extended to Guan Nei, such as Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Shanxi, and Hebei, all of which have launched offensives. The second item in the secret resolution is to absolutely not resolve issues with the Chinese Kuomintang in consultation, and to use delaying tactics. This can be proved by the fact that in the past month or so, the CCP representatives have been unwilling to resolve issues when negotiating with the government, and have been delaying in every possible way, and have even hindered the progress of negotiations with actual military actions. The third item in the secret resolution is to provoke Sino-American relations. The CCP's July 7 declaration publicly launched anti-American propaganda, and recently kidnapped seven American soldiers near Qinhuangdao, all of which are provocative actions by the CCP against the United States. Other actions, such as the CCP strongly pointing out who in the Kuomintang is a hardliner and who is a moderate, intending to divide them, as well as using sob stories, creating bloody incidents, blaming the government, and inciting public unrest, are all in line with the secret resolutions of the CCP Central Political Bureau.

The Zhejiang Provincial Government Allocates Huge Funds to Conduct Land Reform in Various Counties

[Quick report from this newspaper, Hangzhou] Robbery cases have occurred frequently in various counties in Zhejiang Province. In order to carry out thorough suppression, the provincial authorities have allocated 30 million yuan as funds for supervising suppression in various districts, ordering teams to be dispatched separately for searching and encirclement and suppression. The situation is progressing smoothly. According to the reports of the commissioners of various districts to the Provincial Security Command, most of the bandits in various places are scattered soldiers and ruffians. As a result of the suppression, they have been disintegrated and scattered, with each group being less than 50 people, taking advantage of the gaps in the defenses of various counties to launch attacks here and hide there, forming a situation where the bandits leave when the soldiers come and the bandits return when the soldiers leave. This is especially true in the Siming Mountains between Ningbo and Shaoxing, the Yandang Mountains between Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Chuzhou, and the vast mountains on the border between Zhejiang and Fujian, which cover hundreds of miles and are the border areas between the two provinces and between counties. At present, land reform is being carried out to eliminate the source of bandits. The provincial government believes that ensuring local security is essential for promoting various restoration works, and has decided to allocate 10 million yuan to fund land reform in various counties. The county magistrates are responsible for presiding over the work, in order to completely eradicate the banditry.

An Explosion Occurred in a Hangzhou Cinema

The Meiqi Grand Theater in Hangzhou City, which had not been open for long, is located on the Lakeside of West Lake, renting part of the buildings of the Civil Education Center as its site. Unfortunately, an explosion occurred at about 10 pm on the 20th. The neighbors heard the sound and were very panicked. When the reporter learned of the incident, he rushed to the scene to investigate and recorded that inside the low wall on the right side of the theater, thugs had placed two packages of explosives in advance, which exploded one after another, causing a loud noise. At that time, five road maintenance workers, including Lu Yongtang, who were sitting on the low wall watching movies from the window, were injured and fell to the ground. In addition, Ma Lai, an employee of the First Section of the Transportation Department, also had his right calf injured by the explosion. The theater was showing a film, and the audience was shocked and scattered in all directions, and the order was chaotic. Fortunately, the military and police arrived at the scene immediately to maintain order, and no other tragedies occurred.

Suzhou

Dispatching Warships to Patrol Taihu Lake Regularly

The county government believes that the third, fifth, twelfth, and thirteenth districts of the county are all located along Taihu Lake, and lake bandits have been rampant in the past, and public security is worrying. In order to thoroughly eliminate them, it has promoted all local teams to cooperate with the National Army to form elite troops to implement suppression. After several rounds of encirclement and suppression, there are no traces of bandits in the districts along the lake. However, in order to eliminate the remnants of bandits, the naval force has dispatched warships to patrol the lake regularly to maintain water traffic. At the same time, the Civil Affairs Section of the county government has also dispatched personnel to various districts to conduct surprise household registration checks in order to eliminate the source of bandits.

Kunshan

Illegally Selling Materials and Requesting Impeachment by Telegram

The County Provisional Council believes that Zhu Ruqiu, the former director of the liquidation office of the pseudo-cooperative society, has illegally sold sealed materials and taken away all the more than 18 million yuan stored in the bank. Although the county government and others sent a telegram to the provincial government requesting an investigation, no results have been achieved so far. Therefore, on the 19th, a telegram was sent to Cheng, the Jiangsu District Inspector, requesting impeachment and investigation, in order to appease public opinion.

Changshu

The Need for Grain is Urgent, and Personnel are Dispatched to Guard and Deliver it

The county owes 18,000 market stones of military grain, and the County Council has been informed by telegram from the provincial capital to stop purchasing due to the difficulties of the people of Jiangsu. However, the county government has received urgent telegrams from the provincial office and the 103rd warehouse, stating that the war in northern Jiangsu is intensifying, the troops are in urgent need of grain, and the purchase and dispatch must be limited and cannot be delayed. All the suspension of purchase will still be handled in accordance with the previous order until a clear order is issued. Personnel are dispatched to the districts to guard and deliver the grain, and they will deliver it to the city day and night.

Editorial

### Opening the Military and Political Impasse

In recent days, the evolution of the Chinese situation seems to have reached the stage of "when things reach an extreme, they change; when they change, they become fluid"! On the one hand, the restless activities of the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu threaten the security of the Nanjing-Shanghai line, provoking the National Army to adopt a strategy of self-defense and counterattack. The government is also considering taking appropriate steps to restore order in many traffic lines and economically vital areas so that the people can live in peace and contentment. On the other hand, Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart Leighton went to Kuling to have candid discussions with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and they have returned to Nanjing one after the other yesterday and today. It is rumored that the government's policy of political settlement remains unchanged and will be actively implemented. The Chairman's proclamation reiterating his position may be issued in the coming days, and Ambassador Stuart Leighton also said that if everyone works together, the situation will definitely improve in the short term. It is likely that the opening of the political stalemate is imminent. Therefore, despite the Chinese Communists' efforts to exaggerate the severity of the Chinese civil war to domestic and foreign audiences, to the point where some nervous Americans are even considering banning arms shipments to China, we believe that, whether viewed militarily or politically, the situation in recent days seems to have shifted from a direction of "dragging on" to one of potential resolution. We earnestly hope for the maturity of this trend, and especially pray that the military and political impasse will be broken as soon as possible.

This newspaper has long argued that the overall national situation today can no longer be "dragged on." Dragging on is detrimental to the country and harmful to the people. The common goal of the people is simple: only peace. And the fundamental way to achieve peace is only ten words: "nationalization of the military" and "democratization of politics." Everything else is secondary.

First, let's talk about "nationalization of the military." We ask the government and the Communist Party, especially the Communist Party, to recognize the principle of national supremacy. Respect Marshal Ma's impartial opinions, and earnestly implement the troop reduction plan based on the reorganization and unification scheme. The first step is to immediately cease all-out military operations and promptly relocate the Communist troops to designated areas, awaiting reorganization and unification by the military three-person group. Since the government has abolished the Kuomintang party branches within the National Army, if the Communist Party can have a great awakening and abandon the idea of using force, and become an ordinary political party like other parties, and integrate the troops into the National Army, in other words, "return the military to the nation," it would be a great blessing for both the Communist Party and the country. Mr. Hu Shih's telegram to Mr. Mao Zedong last year, earnestly advising the Communist Party, is exactly what those who advocate democracy and freedom want to say. He believed that as long as the Communist Party abandons military struggle and engages in political struggle, it may one day be able to come to power, just like the Democratic Party in the early days of the United States or the Labour Party in Britain after World War I. But if it does not change its old tune of using force, it will be tantamount to destroying the Communist Party's own future. Therefore, how to untie the "knot" of the military stalemate today depends entirely on a change of heart among the Communist Party's leaders. As long as they are willing to untie this "knot," the military can truly be nationalized, and everything can be easily solved. It can be said that one action solves everything.

The Communist Party may say: "(1) We hand over our troops, why doesn't the Kuomintang hand over its troops? (2) If we hand over our troops, will the Kuomintang 'slaughter' us?" In fact, these are all caused by unconscious suspicion. First, the Kuomintang no longer has a "party army" today. The troops commanded by our government today are all national troops, and the Kuomintang party branches within the National Army have already been abolished last year, as everyone has seen. Moreover, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, countless soldiers shed blood. Do we want to favor the Kuomintang and insist on considering these national troops who defended the country and resisted the enemy as the Kuomintang's "party army"? Therefore, to be honest, the only troops that do not obey the orders of the National Government today are the Communist troops. And only the Communist Party should immediately "return the military to the nation." Second, if the Communist troops are incorporated into the National Army, the Kuomintang can "slaughter" the Communist Party, which is even more absurd. If the government really had this idea, why would it first reorganize the Communist troops into the National Army? Moreover, such a practice would not be tolerated by the people of the country. Therefore, as long as the Communist troops can be sincere and consistent, stop fighting, wait quietly for unification, and be reorganized into the National Army, the military stalemate will definitely be broken.

Next, let's talk about "democratization of politics." We certainly know that there is no democracy or freedom in the Communist Party's "liberated areas" either. But in any case, we must first ask the National Government to take the initiative as soon as possible within its authority to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Since the Political Consultative Conference was held in January and passed five major proposals, these should be the general guidelines for the government to solve political problems in the future. The government only needs to strive for the implementation of these proposals, without wasting words on further consultations.

First, regarding the expansion of the government organization, the government can take the initiative to invite people from outside the Kuomintang to participate in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan to show the government's openness and transparency. As for how many parties and non-partisan individuals can participate, it depends on their sincerity. We believe that as long as the government has this sincerity, there will always be patriotic parties and people of insight willing to participate in the government and jointly take responsibility for handling national affairs. Second, regarding the National Assembly, since the government has decided to convene it on November 12 this year and will not postpone it again and lose credibility, it should actively prepare everything to avoid being caught off guard at the last minute. At the same time, it must consult with various parties separately to ensure that they meet each other with sincerity, disclose the list of representatives, and widely recruit people of insight from society, or even allow the members of the Fourth National Political Council to participate in the constitutional National Assembly, thereby demonstrating the government's spirit of seeking advice widely. As long as the government sincerely respects this National Assembly, we believe that patriotic people will also be willing to participate in drafting the constitution. Third, the Outline of Governance; Fourth, Military Issues. There is nothing more to say about these two proposals. The government is already gradually implementing them. It only needs to work harder in the future to achieve them one by one as soon as possible. But at the same time, we hope that other parties (especially the Communist Party) will also show sincerity and work together to achieve them. Fifth, regarding the revision of the draft constitution, we hope that the Constitution Drafting Committee will promptly base it on the consultation.

The modification principles of the Consultative Conference and the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Kuomintang Congress, both parties should refer to each other; aiming at the current national situation, propose a proper plan for the National Assembly to adopt. But in this regard, we should have a common understanding, that is, the National Assembly itself has the supreme power to draft the constitution, and no party, no individual, or any conference can have the power to bind the National Assembly.

We believe that the biggest mistake of the government today is that it has neglected the responsibility that the government should bear for solving the current political problems. A government is not like a party in opposition, which can only sing high-sounding slogans without implementing them. The government must be responsible to the country and the people. The so-called "political solution" should not only refer to a "negotiated solution," but rather refer to the government solving the problem with practical political methods. As long as the National Government substantially and quickly expands the democratic foundation of the government, sincerely convenes a national rather than a partisan National Assembly, truly implements the governance program agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference, truly implements the troop reorganization plan, and truly carefully consults and revises the draft constitution, then we expect that unbiased citizens will definitely support the government, and well-intentioned parties will also participate in the government and jointly assume the responsibility of governing the country. The key to breaking the political deadlock lies in whether the government has the determination to take the initiative. And we predict that the government authorities are now facing the stage where they must make a decision.

"When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, one doubts there is no road; The willows are dark, the flowers are bright, and there is another village." We hope that the current political situation in China is also like this: the deadlock is broken, and everything becomes clear!

### International Tribunal Reopened Yesterday General Qin Dechun Attended Court to Testify Recounted Japanese Crimes Against China Doihara Kenji and Others Were the Masterminds of the Conspiracy

[Special Telegram from the Reconstruction Society in Tokyo on the 22nd] The Far East International Tribunal has resumed its sessions as the air conditioning equipment has been completed. General Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of National Defense of China, attended court to testify today. Qin wore a light yellow military uniform with medals on his chest. He first read his statement in Mandarin, which was then translated into English, and then from English into Japanese. The secretary of Judge Mei was designated by the presiding judge to serve as the translator. It is noted that Qin served as the acting chairman of Chahar Province, the mayor of Peiping, and a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee before the incident, and is well aware of the Japanese invasion of North China. Therefore, his statement is highly valued by all parties. Qin's testimony was presented both in writing and orally.

[United Press Tokyo on the 22nd] Deputy Minister of National Defense Qin Dechun today denounced Doihara Kenji as the chief culprit of Japan's invasion of China. It is noted that Doihara once served as a secretary in the Japanese Embassy in North China. The International Tribunal reopened today in an air-conditioned courtroom after a twenty-day recess. Qin stated in his sworn statement that Doihara should not only be held responsible for the invasion of North China, but also for the Mukden Incident of 1931. Qin was an arch-enemy of Doihara when he served as the Mayor of Peiping and Deputy Commander of the 29th Army. He pointed out four other Japanese officers as the culprits of the "July 7th" Incident. The Japanese had hoped to obtain special interests in Hebei and Chahar through negotiations. The culprits of the "July 7th" Incident were Commander Kashii Kiyoshi of the Tianjin Garrison Army, Brigade Commander Kawabe, Regimental Commander Mutaguchi, and Chief of Staff Sakai.

### Declaration on Policy towards Japan The Far East Commission Passed It Prohibiting Japan from Taxing the United Nations Stipulating that Looted Items Should Be Returned to Their Original Owners as Soon as Possible

[Special Telegram from the US News Agency in Washington on the 21st] Regarding the issues of Japan taxing foreign nationals, the return of items looted by Japan to their original owners, and strengthening the liaison between the Far East Commission and the Allied Supreme Commander stationed in Japan, a policy declaration has been issued, which has now been unanimously adopted by the Commission. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, presided over the meeting. In terms of taxation, the declaration stipulates: (1) All Japanese tax regulations shall not discriminate against foreigners. (2) The Japanese authorities shall not levy major taxes on the property of United Nations nationals inside and outside Japan. (3) Even if the Supreme Commander believes that there is indeed a reason for taxation, he must first submit it to the Far East Commission for consideration. Regarding the return of looted items to their original owners, the declaration stipulates that direct steps should be taken, but industrial and transportation equipment required for the security of the occupying forces will not be returned for the time being. As for gold, silver, and jewelry, they shall not be included in the category of "postponed return." As for Allied ships found within Japan, all those registered with any Allied country at the time of bombing or sinking must be returned by the end of this year.

### He Yingqin Goes to New York

[United Press Washington on the 22nd] General He Yingqin left here today for New York to take office as the Chinese representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee.

### Investigation Results of the Pearl Harbor Incident Roosevelt Had No Responsibility

[Special Telegram from the US News Agency in Washington on the 21st] The Joint Congressional Committee investigating the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, released its final report yesterday, exonerating the late President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull from responsibility for the attack on the US naval base in Hawaii, which led to the United States' entry into the war. The report attributed the disaster at the time to the failure of the commander of the Hawaiian Army to fulfill his responsibilities after receiving warnings from Washington. The report is the crystallization of 15,000 pages of documents, totaling tens of millions of words. From last November to this May, it underwent seventy days of public hearings, during which the committee investigated forty-three witnesses and considered one hundred and eighty-three pieces of physical evidence.

### The Philippine Government Considers Making a Chinese Envoy Araneta is Likely

[Central News Agency Manila on the 22nd, United Press] Philippine Vice President Quirino, in his capacity as Foreign Minister, announced that he is currently considering appointing envoys to China, Britain, and Spain. Araneta may be the envoy to China, Moran the envoy to Britain, and Leocadio the envoy to Spain.

[Reuters London on the 21st] Britain has appointed Acting Counselor of the Foreign Office, Erdahl, as the envoy to the Republic of the Philippines.

### Britain Helps Overseas Chinese in Malaya Restore Tin Production

[Special Telegram from the Central News Agency in London on the 19th] London announced yesterday that the British government plans to provide financial assistance to the overseas Chinese tin industry in Malaya to help them restore production. The Undersecretary of the Colonial Office, in reply to a question in the House of Commons, said that the Malayan Federal Government is prepared to grant rehabilitation loans to overseas Chinese to help them implement their repair plans.

### Prospects for the European Peace Conference The Four Powers Decide the Fate of Small Countries

[United Press Paris on the 21st] The European Peace Conference is scheduled to be held here on the 29th of this month. Although it is recorded as a "peace" conference, this is only a political term and not a fact. This conference is like visiting a new house. The architects of the new house will guide those who will live in this house in the future to visit for a week. The architects themselves are not very satisfied with the structure of the house. As for the future tenants, whether they agree or not, they are generally not allowed to改造it. They can complain, but they cannot effectively order any changes. The so-called architects are the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. They have been drafting peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland for several months. The draft treaties have been completed, and representatives from seventeen other countries have been invited to send representatives to Paris to review them. They may not agree with these treaties (none of the four foreign ministers fully agree), but they cannot reduce them, and can only suggest some modifications. In the future, the four powers may consider the points that should be modified, but they do not need to redraft the treaties to include them. The Paris Conference is not a reproduction of the Versailles Conference and the Vienna Conference. Its essence is the compromise between the ideas of Britain and the United States and the ideas of the Soviet Union. Once the peace conference is over, the four foreign ministers will重come to work in Paris. At that time, the opinions of the seventeen countries have been heard, and the final decision will be made by the four powers. The opinions of the small countries will be classified separately, and it is unlikely to make people very satisfied. But politically, there is also a shortage of houses, just like anywhere else.

### Part of the Rhineland Land Merged into the Saar Region

[Reuters London on the 21st] Berlin Radio reported that General Koenig, commander of the French occupation forces in Germany, has ordered seventy-nine districts of the Rhineland to be merged into the Saar region due to administrative and economic relations.

### Key Points of Qin Dechun's Testimony

The Zhangbei Incident

In June of the 24th year of the Republic [1935], two Japanese military officers and two corporals went from Dolon to Zhangjiakou. When passing through Zhangbei County, they were not checked by the garrison at the north gate of the county and did not carry passes, which led to a dispute. At that time, the garrison in the county town took the four hundred people to the headquarters of Commander Tang Dengyu of the 132nd Division. Commander Zhao immediately asked General Song Zheyuan, commander of the 29th Army, for instructions, and allowed the Japanese soldiers to go to Zhangjiakou via Zhangbei, but stated that they must carry passports in the future. The Japanese and others then went to Peiping via Zhangjiakou. After the Japanese passed, Hashimoto, the Japanese Consul in Zhangjiakou, suddenly protested, saying that "Japanese military officers were checked by the garrison at the north gate of Zhangbei County and taken to the division headquarters for detention, which insulted the Japanese military and demanded punishment, apologies, and guarantees that the same incident would not happen in the future," and then said that "the consul has no right to negotiate, and this matter has been transferred to the Tianjin Garrison Army for handling, please negotiate with Major General Doihara Kenji, the representative of the Garrison Army." As a result of the negotiations: the regimental commander of the Zhangbei County garrison was dismissed as a disciplinary measure, and the chief of the military law department of the 132nd Division headquarters, who detained the Japanese military officers, was also dismissed as a disciplinary measure. China was not allowed to engage in activities in Chabei in the future, and anti-Japanese organizations and anti-Japanese activities in Chahar Province were banned. In order to seek peace, the Chinese government repeatedly made concessions, but the aggression of the Japanese warlords was endless. Although Takahashi Tan, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, participated in the above-mentioned negotiations, the actual person handling the matter was Doihara Kenji.

Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee

The bribery and coercion before and after the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. In September of the 24th year of the Republic [1935], when General Song Zheyuan was the commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison, Doihara was planning in Peiping to establish a North China government to separate North China from the central government. His methods of temptation were (1) to make Song Zheyuan the chairman of the North China autonomous government. (2) The Japanese side would do its best to assist in the military and economic affairs of North China. (The above two points were proposed by Doihara to Shen Zhen , the mayor of Peiping and Tianjin, but were rejected by our side.) Later, the central government appointed General Song Zheyuan as the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, and he handled matters in accordance with the instructions of the central government. At that time, the Japanese side expressed dissatisfaction with the election of the National Assembly and the collective military training of university students. After learning that the temptation had failed, the Japanese turned to coercion. (A) Political relations: 1. Demanding that General Song Zheyuan issue a telegram announcing the establishment of the North China autonomous government. 2. Withdraw the central intelligence personnel in Peiping. 3. Control the speech in Peiping and Tianjin, and not oppose autonomy. (B) Economic relations: 1. Build the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway. 2. Revise the Tianjin tariff to increase the tax rate on European and American goods and reduce the tax rate on Japanese goods. (The above two items were rejected by our side.) (C) Military relations: The Fengtai Incident in September of the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. The incident was caused by a company of Japanese troops wanting to pass through our army's defense line during an exercise in Fengtai. Our defenders tried to stop them, and a conflict occurred. Although the incident was quickly resolved, the Japanese military took the opportunity to increase the strength of the garrison army to six battalions. The second incident was that retired General Matsui Iwane promoted the establishment of a branch of the Greater East Asia Association in Peiping in the autumn of the 24th year of the Republic [1935] and met with General Song and me. General Song and I expressed our disapproval of this. Matsui advocated that Asia should be Asia for Asians, and European and American forces should be excluded. I smiled and said that Asia for Asians may become Asia for the Japanese. If we really seek equality and mutual benefit, we should talk about other issues first.

The Lugouqiao Incident

Qin's second statement described the July 7th Incident in detail, stating that the organ responsible for the political affairs of Chahar Province in North China before the incident was the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, and the chairman was General Song Zheyuan. After the Japanese enemy invaded our three northeastern provinces on September 18, they continued to covet Rehe and seized various places in North China, and the railway between Peiping and Tianjin became the front line. Our army was mainly the 29th Army, fighting in various places in Chahar in North China and Peiping and Tianjin. The location where the July 7th Incident occurred was Lugouqiao, which is twenty li southwest of Peiping and is a strategic location in western Peiping. This was the second stage of the Japanese invasion of China. At that time, from the summer of the 24th year of the Republic [1935] to the spring of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the enemy, seeing that its political offensive and economic monopoly had failed, decided to use force to coerce. At 12:10 p.m. on July 7th of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], I received a report from the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee, relaying a telephone call from Matsui, the head of the Japanese special service agency, that a company of the Japanese army was firing at the troops of the 37th Division near Lugouqiao. The training troops were in chaos for a while, and the roll call resulted in one soldier missing. Therefore, the Japanese army will enter the city tonight for inspection. I asked for instructions on how to deal with this by phone. I replied that the Japanese army's arbitrary exercise in our territory violated international law. Since there was no prior notice and I did not give any permission, I am not responsible for the missing soldier. If the soldier is indeed missing, immediately order the garrison at Lugouqiao to search with the local police. The Japanese army still strongly demanded to enter the city and decided to use force to surround the city if permission was not granted. Later, I asked if the Japanese army had any exercises last night, and the answer was that there were no exercises. At this time, the Japanese army surrounded Wanping City from three sides. At about 6:00 a.m., the enemy fired machine guns into the city, gradually approaching, and the Sino-Japanese war began. The fighting was fierce on the 8th and 9th, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Seeing that the battle situation was unfavorable, the enemy sent Matsui and others to negotiate on the 9th, saying that the missing soldier had been found and could be resolved peacefully. Therefore, negotiations began immediately, and the following three items were decided: (1) Both sides immediately cease fighting. (2) The troops of both sides are transferred to their original defense areas. (3) The garrison of Lugouqiao and Wanping City will be replaced by other troops, and an attached agreement will be added, so that the same incident will not occur in the future. However, the Japanese army regarded this clause as a delaying tactic and took the opportunity to transfer troops from Kwantung to Peiping and Tianjin to fight. On the 14th, the two sides fought again, and the fighting became increasingly fierce. This is the process and fighting situation of the Lugouqiao Incident. The main military officers of the enemy army who launched the incident were Kashii Kiyoshi, commander of the Tianjin Garrison Army, Kawabe, brigade commander, Mutaguchi Renya, regimental commander, and Sakai Takashi, chief of staff of the garrison army. Also, the chief of staff at the time of the incident was Hashimoto, but the first person to lead the occupation of North China was Doihara Kenji, who launched the September 18th Incident. After the statement was read, the defense lawyer questioned Qin.

### South American Bolivia: President Brutally Murdered, Successful Violent Revolution

[United Press International, Bolivian Capital, 21st] A popular revolution took place in Bolivia today, overthrowing the current government and establishing a revolutionary government of three members. President Villarroel has been assassinated.

[Agence France-Presse, Argentinian Capital, 21st] According to a radio broadcast from the Bolivian capital, a violent revolution has succeeded in Bolivia. Following the assassination of former President Villarroel, Colonel Chavantzi has assumed the office of President. According to other sources, the revolution was led by the People's Party, and Villarroel was assassinated by students. President Villarroel was first advising the crowds protesting against the government when he was suddenly shot and seriously wounded. He was immediately moved to the Presidential Palace by his guards, but the mob soon attacked the Presidential Palace, disarming the guards at the entrance and smashing the doors and windows. At that time, the President was lying in the hall, groaning. The mob carried the wounded President to a window and threw him into the street, literally tearing him apart. The body was then loaded into a truck and driven through the streets of the capital to the central square, where it was tied to a lamppost, and the crowd cheered. Villarroel came to power after the revolution on December 20, 1943. He led a movement of young military officers in cooperation with the National Revolutionary Movement. Six months later, his organized government was recognized by the United States and nineteen Latin American countries, but these countries all considered the government to have fascist tendencies. Villarroel tried to show his sincere participation in the United Nations' war effort and opposed the leftist parties in politics, which were excluded from the Congress, and their members were often subjected to brutal oppression.

It is not yet possible to determine whether they intend to counterattack the Bolivian capital.

### Maintaining Sovereignty Regardless of Loss: The Relief Transport Group is Formally Established, Eight Ships Head to North and South Ocean Lines Exclusively Transporting Relief Supplies, Meeting Again Today to Discuss Various Issues in Detail

The Shanghai Shipowners' Association Relief Transport Group, in order to actively promote the transportation of relief supplies, various specific measures, held its first Relief Transport Committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at 20 Guangdong Road. All committee members Li Zhenguang, Xue Baokang, Li Yunliang, Hu Shizhou, Chu Yuyang, Dong Haoyun, Yu Shunwei, Cheng Yuqi, etc. attended. Hu Shizhou was elected as the chairman, Shen Qi as the director-general, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will designate four N3 seagoing vessels, and private companies will designate four seagoing vessels to replace the ships withdrawn by Taikoo and Jardine due to the termination of the charter agreement by the head office. China Xingyi Xiang, China Shipping, Shanghai Industrial and other companies are willing to dispatch one ship each to undertake the aforementioned task. However, because all colleagues are willing to fulfill their obligations to maintain the navigation marks, the names of all designated ships will be jointly decided at the plenary meeting convened on the 25th of this month. The remaining ships will still fully transport relief supplies, and the losses incurred from undertaking this task will be shared by the colleagues according to the tonnage of all ships on the respective shipping lines. Shen Qi, the director-general, will be responsible for presiding over various affairs of the Relief Transport Group. Important matters will be decided by the Relief Transport Committee. Currently, Shanghai Industrial Company's Da Shanghai vessel has been allocated to load 6,000 tons of relief supplies to North China. Shou Kang Shipping Company's Qingyun vessel has loaded 4,000 tons of relief supplies to Hankou. Yi Xiang Shipping Bureau's Limin vessel and China Xing Shipping Company's Qixing vessel have loaded relief supplies and sailed to Fuzhou and Xiamen. The number of Chinese merchant ships is increasing day by day. All shipping companies are extremely vigilant about the attempts of British merchants Taikoo and Jardine to infringe on navigation rights and are making concerted efforts to salvage the current serious crisis in the shipping industry with practical actions.

Another report: According to the person in charge of the Relief Transport Group, the group's business is solely responsible for the transportation of relief supplies, and the freight is calculated at 75% of the rate stipulated by the Maritime Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, in reality, shipping companies have no profit to make from this initiative. There are a total of eight ships, with a total of more than 20,000 tons. Four ships have been designated to operate on the North Ocean Line and four ships on the South Ocean Line. In fact, in addition to these designated eight ships, all ships of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies have the obligation to be dispatched by the Relief Transport Group. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has even repeatedly stated that the company's ten ships operating on the North and South Ocean Lines and Fuzhou and other places are willing to be dispatched by the Relief Transport Group at any time. Therefore, there are no difficulties in the future development of the group's business. In order to discuss in detail the various organizational and dispatching technical issues of the Relief Transport Group, the group is scheduled to hold another meeting this afternoon to discuss collectively.

### Taikoo Ship Infringes on Our Navigation Rights: Shipping Industry Sends Urgent Appeals

The Shanghai Shipowners' Association sent urgent appeals to the Superintendent of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, the Minister of Communications, and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau to prevent the Taikoo shipping company's Nanchang vessel from clearing customs. The original text is recorded as follows: "Reported that Taikoo shipping company's British merchant vessel Nanchang is scheduled to load cargo and passengers from Shanghai and sail to Wenzhou on the 25th of this month, which violates the treaty and maritime regulations. Please prevent customs clearance to maintain sovereignty and prevent covetousness. Still awaiting instructions, Du Yong, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipowners' Association, respectfully kowtows, midday support."

According to Li Yunliang, secretary-general of the Shipowners' Association, this is a factual manifestation of the British merchants' declaration. Its purpose is to test whether the Chinese government and people are determined to maintain navigation rights. Currently, the French vessel Yi Xing has also made the same attempt. The Ministry of Communications ordered the Shanghai Maritime Bureau to prevent it, but it failed to achieve the purpose of soliciting merchant cargo and engaging in economic aggression. Currently, there are several ships, such as Xin Rui An, Zhoushan, Chuanshan, and Dahua, operating on the Shanghai to Wenzhou route on a regular schedule. If the British re-enter the competition, the original national ships will inevitably be squeezed out. In addition to submitting the matter to the maritime authorities and customs for attention, the shipping industry is closely monitoring this attempt to infringe on navigation rights and will do its utmost to prevent it.

According to Group Leader Zhang, the investigation steps will be carried out in accordance with the methods established by the Central Government. These methods will be publicly announced when the work begins, and all complaint cases will be studied and discussed by the group members at that time and handled separately.

### Tan Zhuang and Chen Lingfeng Went Out to Visit Friends: Deng Yingchao Misreported Their Disappearance, They Returned Safely the Next Day and it was Discovered There Was No Other Reason, A Moment of Nervousness Troubled the Police Officers

[Report from this newspaper] Zhou Enlai's wife, Deng Yingchao, because Communist Party members Tan Zhuang and Chen Lingfeng went out on the afternoon of the 20th and did not return home at night, suspected that something had happened and telephoned Mayor Wu at 11:00 AM the previous morning, stating that Tan and Chen had suddenly disappeared and were afraid that they had been arrested by the government, and requested a speedy investigation and release. Mayor Wu immediately told her that the arrest by the government was definitely not true, but promised to conduct a thorough investigation and search. He immediately ordered the Police Bureau to carry out a search. By about 4:00 PM that day (21st), the Police Bureau had learned that Tan and Chen had returned safely, and reported this to Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu then telephoned Deng to inquire, but Deng did not confirm it. To be cautious, the Police Bureau first inquired by telephone and confirmed that Tan and Chen had indeed returned home, and then the Police Bureau sent personnel to inquire about the course of events. It was stated that they had purely gone out to visit friends and there was no other reason. They stayed overnight at a friend's house that day, which led to this misunderstanding. Tan Zhuang is from Guangdong, 34 years old, and is the chief surgeon of the Yan'an Peace Hospital. Chen Lingfeng is from Changsha, Hunan, 30 years old, and is the director of the Yan'an Experimental Farm. They departed from Yan'an in early June and arrived in Shanghai on June 29, and both will go abroad to the United States for observation. Tan and Chen have been in Shanghai for many days but have not registered their household registration. Because the Shanghai area is vast and the political parties and groups are complicated, making protection difficult, the Police Bureau has informed the Communist Party to register their household registration in accordance with the regulations.

### Police Bureau's Investigation Process

The police bureau's investigation of the matter is summarized as follows: After receiving the mayor's notification, the bureau immediately dispatched a section chief and Zhao, the chief of the Lujiawan Branch Bureau, to Zhou Enlai's residence at 107 Rue Massenet to request an inspection of his residence, but the request was denied. When asked about the relatives and friends they had contact with, they only replied that there were few relatives and friends in Shanghai, and as a result, nothing was gained and they returned in vain. Later, it was learned that two men and women had visited Tan and Chen's house in a Jeep No. 13465 on the afternoon of the 20th. It was later learned that the vehicle belonged to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. They searched everywhere, but to no avail. At about 4:45 PM that afternoon, the Municipal Police Bureau received a secret report stating that someone had witnessed Tan waiting for a tram at the Sichuan North Road and Haining Road tram station at about 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th. Based on this report, it was determined that they were in the area north of the Suzhou River. At about 50 minutes past the hour, a phone call came again stating that Tan had inspected a hospital in Jiangwan, and personnel were immediately dispatched to investigate various hospitals. Later, it was learned at the Army Hospital that Tan had indeed stayed in the hospital last night, but had left the hospital at 4:30 PM this afternoon (21st). The police officers received this good news and returned to Shanghai and drove to Zhou's residence on Rue Massenet. At this time, Tan and Chen were already there. According to Chen, at about 11:00 AM that morning, he went to UNRRA with Ellers, a consultant, to discuss his passport for going abroad. After leaving, they parted ways. He went to Fuzhou Road to shop and met a friend, Chen Guang, who invited him to his home. He stayed overnight and did not return until 5:00 PM today (21st). He did not meet anyone along the way. According to Tan, after leaving UNRRA that day, he returned to his residence once at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Fearing that he would not be able to return to Shanghai that night when he went to Jiangwan, he left a note under Chen's pillow. There were no unexpected events during the night in Jiangwan.

### Mixing Kerosene and Gasoline for Sale: Many Fires Are Caused by This, Fire Department Samples Retailers

Many fires in this city are caused by the use of impure kerosene. Because kerosene is more expensive than gasoline, unscrupulous merchants often mix gasoline into kerosene without authorization to make huge profits. However, gasoline is extremely flammable, and a slight carelessness can easily cause disaster, which is extremely dangerous. The police bureau's fire department began dispatching personnel yesterday to sample retail stores to prevent abuses. At the same time, a simple identification method was announced for citizens' reference. (A) Color Identification: Pure gasoline should normally be a slightly bluish-white liquid, but gasoline on the market is generally red. If 10% of gasoline is mixed into kerosene, there will be a light red phenomenon. (B) Combustion Identification: Pour a very small amount of kerosene into a small iron can or ceramic dish and ignite it with a match. If it is pure kerosene, it will not ignite. If all the matchsticks are immersed in the kerosene, the flame will be extinguished again. Then ignite it with another match, and the surface of the kerosene will begin to burn. If the kerosene contains 5% gasoline, the entire surface of the kerosene will begin to burn after about three seconds when ignited with a match. If the kerosene contains 10% gasoline, the entire surface will burn immediately after a spark passes.

After reading the main text of the judgment, the presiding judge explained to the defendant, "Your crimes are significant; we initially intended to sentence you to fifteen years. However, because you left the puppet secret service headquarters on June 1, 1944, your sentence has been reduced by half. If you disagree, you may appeal for a retrial within ten days of receiving the judgment." She Ai-zhen was still dressed in a black Xiangyun shirt and pants, with her hair in a bun. Upon hearing the verdict, she looked tearful and sorrowful. This former "wealthy woman" declared to the court, "My children currently have no place to live; what should I do?" The presiding judge waved his hand and replied, "Discuss it with your family." She then conferred with her children in court for several minutes before being escorted away by bailiffs.

[Our Dispatch] The actual date of the 80th birthday of Madam Lu, the mother of President Sun Fo, is on the 27th of this month. President Sun could not be present on that day because he had important official business to attend to in Nanjing. Therefore, he took advantage of his presence in Shanghai, attending to his mother yesterday, to offer her congratulations and celebrate her birthday. At the same time, this day happened to be the 34th wedding anniversary of President Sun and his wife, Madam Chen Shu-ying. Therefore, yesterday was a day of double celebration at the Sun residence.

It is now learned that after the High Prosecutor's Office filed the public prosecution, the High Court originally scheduled the trial for yesterday, but when the summons to appear in court was delivered to the prison, he never signed it. He resolutely stated that he did not want to appear in court and said, "Please ask President Song to come to the court; then I will appear." On the 20th, his defense lawyer, Zhu Fu-jiu, also submitted a statement to the High Court, requesting a postponement on the grounds that the evidence collection was not complete. Therefore, the trial was not held yesterday.

Yesterday, a reporter specially visited Xu, the warden of the Shanghai Prison, who said that Wen currently refuses to appear in court for trial.

### Street Vendors Complain About Police Crackdown, Hope for Reasonable Solution

[Our Dispatch] Anyone who reads and writes has the habit of reading newspapers and magazines, but most people's "spiritual food" comes from the newsstands all over the streets.

However, recently, these newsstands will no longer appear on the roads because the police are trying to improve the appearance of the city and improve traffic, and have decided to ban them. Yesterday afternoon, the Newspaper Supply Industry Association hosted a press conference to report their personal pain and hoped that the publishing and media circles would appeal to the authorities on their behalf.

### Civilian Jeeps, No Official Documents Received in This City

[Our Dispatch] The ordinance on civilian jeeps was announced by the Ministry of National Defense on the 16th. Yesterday, a reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Vehicle Affairs Department of the Public Works Bureau to inquire about the procedures for civilian jeeps to obtain licenses in this city. According to the discussion, the department had requested instructions from the Ministry of National Defense a month ago, but has not yet received official documents. If the ordinance on civilian jeeps is as announced in the newspapers, its regulations seem ambiguous. For example, Article 2 stipulates that transfers should be registered with the Ministry of National Defense, but most civilian jeeps are currently purchased from the Relief Administration or the US military. Should they also be registered? Also, Article 3 stipulates that they should be painted in dark colors to distinguish them. What dark color does this refer to, and is the currently popular khaki color in compliance with the regulations? The legislators may not have considered all of these factors, but the executive agencies find it difficult. Therefore, when civilian jeeps can start obtaining licenses depends on the situation after the department receives official documents.

### Purchase of Jeeps, Inspecting the Goods First Today

### Railroad Bureau Plans to Rebuild Major Stations on the Beijing-Shanghai Line

[Our Dispatch] A reporter learned from transportation circles yesterday that the major stations on the Beijing-Shanghai Line will be rebuilt. That is, Shanghai North Station, Nanjing Station, Wuxi Station, Zhenjiang Station, etc., will all be planned for reconstruction. After the war, the transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has become increasingly busy, and passenger and freight transportation has become more and more crowded. In addition to preparing to purchase vehicles for use, the Transportation Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration is currently drafting plans to improve the above-mentioned stations. It is reported that the freight and passenger transportation at Shanghai North Station is becoming increasingly inconvenient. The Railroad Bureau intends to convert the Fanhuangdu West Station into a passenger terminal, and the freight terminal is planned to be located in Wusong to meet transportation needs and facilitate the flow of goods. However, the above plan has not been completely decided, and after the decision is made, it may be difficult to realize this year due to limited funds. However, the Railroad Bureau is actively working on various improvements to the North Station.

### One of the Three Small Popular Stocks, A Visit to the Jingfu Factory

[Our Dispatch] When the Jingfu Shirt and Sock Factory was established in 1937 in Dapu Bridge, Xujiahui, it was just a partnership organization with only a few people. The capital was small and the scope was narrow. After years of hard work by Director Xu Wen-zhao, it gradually moved forward, from a partnership to a limited company, from a capital of 15 million puppet Central Reserve Bank notes to the current capital of 200 million legal tender. Jingfu's stock is one of the three small popular stocks on the stock market today!

Yesterday, a reporter was invited by the Jingfu Shirt and Sock Factory to observe one of their crystallizations, the No. 2 Factory. The No. 2 Factory is a brand-new building, covering an area of about ten mu. There are more than 300 male and female workers in total, and there are also 50 or so technical workers. Stepping into the factory building, the ears were enveloped by the rumbling of the locomotives! It is said that the equipment in the knitting department includes a total of 39 Tomkins cotton undershirt and health undershirt knitting machines. There are 80 various sewing machines. There are 12 ribbing machines. The equipment for woven fabrics includes 40 Toyota looms. The dyeing and finishing department has all the bleaching and dyeing machines and baking rooms. The finishing department has two raising machines and two calendering machines. In order to supplement the lack of power, they are also equipped with diesel engine generating equipment.

Jingfu's main products are currently Feima brand undershirts, cotton undershirts, health undershirts, knitted underwear, and woolen and fine cloths. It is said that the monthly output of knitted products is more than 10,000 dozens, and woolen and fine cloths are about 3,000 pieces. Seventy percent of the products are sold in this city, and the remaining thirty percent are distributed to Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and other places.

The workers in the factory have a stable life. On average, a technical worker can earn about 300,000 yuan per month in addition to food and lodging. The average wage for ordinary workers is about 200,000 yuan per month.

At this time, when domestic manufacturers are struggling to move forward, and manufacturers are often lamenting pessimistic statements that they cannot continue to operate, in the process of visiting yesterday, I did not hear the Jingfu authorities shout the same pessimistic statement to reporters. On the contrary, Jingfu expressed that they would speed up production and strive to win over the Southeast Asian market. The reporter is willing to promote this display of perseverance to those pessimistic domestic manufacturers.

### The Arrest of a Gang of Notorious Bandits Who Robbed a Fashion Company

[Report from Our Newspaper] Prefect Chao Shen, the head of the Shen Camp Bureau of the city, previously received a secret report stating that a gang of hardened criminals were plotting with notorious bandits from Suzhou to rob a wealthy merchant within the city. To prevent this from happening, the bureau ordered a strict investigation. Subsequently, Section Chief Guo Jitian and officers Fan Boxun and others conducted inquiries in various directions. They discovered that a notorious bandit named Yu Zisong was hiding at No. 107, Yalu River Road, Hongkou. They assigned police officers Cui Jinchuan, Gu Zhicheng, and Zhang Shikang, disguised as rickshaw pullers and vendors, to keep watch in the area. On the morning of the 19th, at 7:00 AM, Yu and Zhu Jiajun were seen going out for breakfast, and the two were immediately apprehended. A six-and-a-half-inch pistol with seven bullets was found on Yu. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, Yu confessed that in November of last year, he had conspired with Duanmu Licheng, Xu Wenhua, Xiao Bao, and others to rob many overcoats from the Hongfa Fashion Company on Hart Road. He also admitted that on May 10th of this year, he had conspired with Zhang Yunpeng, Xi Zhanru, Yu Zhiliang, and Xiao Yang to rob the property of Lu Ronggen at No. 21, Lane 136, Xiamen Road. Zhu Jiajun, he claimed, was just a neighbor and not involved in the robberies. Subsequently, Director Shen of the branch bureau dispatched officers to No. 1 Xijiawan to arrest Xi Zhanru. Then, Officer Fan led the original investigators to Suzhou, where they, together with the local authorities, apprehended Zhang Yunpeng and Yu Zhiliang at No. 40, Sizhang Lane. A six-inch pistol with three bullets was also found under Zhang's bed. Witnesses and evidence were transferred to Shanghai for a joint trial. One gold watch and one gold bracelet were also retrieved.

### Zhejiang Province Seeks Local Education Development Through Increased Donations and School Sports; Provincial Government Approves Regulations for Implementation in Various Counties

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou] The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously approved a letter from the Provisional Consultative Assembly regarding raising funds for education in various counties to promote local education development. It has been decided to implement the plan in accordance with the original proposal and attached measures, and has issued orders to all cities and counties to comply. The key points of the plan are as follows: (1) The expenditure budget for each county for the 35th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1946) will not have a fixed percentage, but emphasis should be placed on educational facilities. Expenditure on county education funds should be fully allocated based on actual income. (2) The original education funds and properties of each county should be separated from local public funds and properties, and a management committee should be organized to manage them. A thorough inventory should be conducted, and any assets that have been encroached upon or lost during the war should be investigated and recovered. (3) Each county's education funds should be established as a special education fund in accordance with regulations. If such a fund has already been established, it must be implemented according to the plan. If not, the plan should be established according to the instructions and forms issued by the Provincial Government in the preceding year, as well as the annual instructions and attached regulations, and the establishment should be completed as soon as possible. (4) Fundraising activities for education and raising funds for schools at all levels should be conducted by the county governments, and the campaign to donate to schools should be expanded. To respect the intention of the people's donations, starting from the 34th year, donations designated for specific purposes may be stored and used exclusively for those purposes. (5) The original school properties of each county should be allocated to schools at all levels as school assets, and teachers and students should be encouraged to cultivate the land themselves. The Provincial Government has already distributed the implementation measures for allocating school fields to schools in each province, county, and city in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan. If there are any difficulties, they should be reported promptly for verification. (6) School properties in each county, including those accumulated by landlords, and all private middle schools, should be exempt from rent and all levies, preferential treatment fees for soldiers, and all apportionments. However, each school should provide free education to the children of soldiers. In addition, the financial department will not charge transfer fees when school properties are transferred. (7) Counterfeit assets in each county, after being confiscated by judicial organs, should be allocated to educational institutions or schools as education funds and properties. The Provincial Government has decided to instruct the Zhejiang office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to reply that counterfeit assets should still be received and managed by that office or its branches. The matter has been submitted to the head office for approval and will be subject to further regulations. (Butterfly)

### Fujian Provincial Department of Education Holds Summer Class to Train Mandarin Education Personnel

[Report from Our Newspaper, Fuzhou] The Fujian Provincial Department of Education believes that language is one of the elements that constitute a nation. When people cannot easily understand each other's language, it is difficult to achieve effective unity. The complexity of dialects in Fujian Province is greater than in any other province. Often, languages vary greatly even within tens of miles, making it impossible to communicate. This greatly affects cultural communication and national unity. Therefore, in order to cultivate Mandarin education teachers in the province and strengthen the promotion of phonetic symbols to popularize Mandarin teaching, the department is taking advantage of this year's summer vacation to hold a training class for Mandarin education personnel. It is stipulated that each county and city should select one Chinese teacher from junior high school or simplified normal school to attend the class. The main subjects of the training include phonetic symbols, Mandarin pronunciation, Mandarin practice, Mandarin teaching methods, Mandarin grammar, and a brief history of the Mandarin movement. Experts are invited to serve as professors. The training period is set for one month. Registration begins on the 5th of next month, training begins on the 16th, and the class concludes on September 15th. After graduation, they will be assigned back to their respective counties and cities to teach and promote Mandarin.

### Interior Decoration Extremely Complete, Stock Exchange Is Advancing at Full Speed, Over One Hundred Companies Have Applied to List Securities

The internal equipment and layout of the stock exchange market are being actively promoted. All unsuitable equipment in the old stock exchange market has now been completely dismantled. The mezzanine floor has also been started, torn down and relaid. The more than twenty tenants in the mezzanine will also move into the building within one or two days. The original third-floor office of the stock exchange is also being actively arranged. The preparatory work for internal affairs of the stock exchange, such as various account books, formats, and printed matter such as receipts, is also being expedited. It is said that in the future, the market will be equipped with loudspeakers to report market prices, and each broker will have loudspeakers directly connected to the market, so various market prices can be reported to each broker at any time. Each broker will also be allocated a telephone line directly connected to the market to facilitate transactions. It is reported that the laying of cables by the Shanghai Telephone Company on Jiangxi Road has reached the intersection of Hankou Road and Henan Road.

Preliminary Review of Broker Qualifications

The three members of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee's Broker Qualification Review Subcommittee began to open the more than 600 broker applications one by one yesterday morning at 9:00 AM for preliminary review. The work continued throughout the day, and by 6:00 PM, only one-sixth of the total number had been opened. The opening will continue from 2:30 PM this afternoon. It is estimated that the preliminary review can be completed in about three or four days. Then it will be submitted to the entire preparatory committee for review. It is estimated that the entire review of broker qualifications will take three weeks.

Both Types of Qualifications Have Advantages

It is reported that among the more than 600 broker applications received by the stock exchange, banks and trust companies account for more than 100. According to regulations, banks, trust companies,, etc. that apply to be brokers must have been operating in Shanghai for at least five years. Therefore, there are restrictions on newly established banks. The reporter then inquired about the fact that the financial strength and reputation of banks and trust companies applying to be brokers must be better than those of individuals, which may affect the business of individuals in the future. It is acknowledged that this may not be entirely true. Customers often have to fill out a power of attorney to entrust banks and trust companies to buy and sell securities, and all procedures are carried out step by step, which is more complicated. Individual brokers are more accommodating. Therefore, the business of the two has its own merits, and it cannot be generalized.

Not Many Applications from Foreign Merchants and Foreign Shares

Most of the 42 Chinese members of the old Public Brokerage Association have applied to be brokers of the stock exchange. However, among the 58 foreign members, only a few have applied to be brokers. Few foreign stocks have come to request listing applications. It is said that most foreign stocks have recently started to register in order to be reorganized. It is estimated that the reorganization will take at least six months. As of now, 106 listing applications have been sent out. However, because the information to be filled in is quite complicated, none have been filled in and returned.

Original Stock Exchange May Be Renamed

It is reported that the original Chinese Stock Exchange plans to convene a joint meeting of all directors and supervisors in the near future to discuss reorganization and convene a shareholders' meeting. It is said that its name will be changed to Huashang Investment Company, because the new stock exchange has a capital of 100 million yuan, and the old stock exchange will join in a group posture, accounting for about 60% of the total capital.

### Grain Review Committee Reduces Negotiated Prices, Rice Shops Selling Coarse Rice Must Complete Joint Guarantee Procedures Within the Deadline, Licenses Will Be Revoked If They Do Not Comply With the Social Affairs Bureau Within Three Days

[By our reporter] The Grain Price Review Committee, which has been suspended for five days, met at the Bureau of Social Affairs at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those present were Section Chief Ji of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Qian Xingzhong of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhao Xingjie of the Shanghai General Warehouse, Zhang Xichao and Hu Xiangang of the rice shop industry, Cai Shengming and Yin Fuxiang of the rice industry, etc. Considering that rice from Sichuan, Jiangxi, Changshu, and Wuxi, etc., and foreign rice have been continuously transported here recently, the city's grain supply has become more abundant, and the market price has trended downward, the committee decided to slightly reduce the prices of various types of rice.

Type Negotiated Price

White Geng Thin Rice 64,000 yuan

Yang Xian 63,000 yuan

Bu Jian 58,000 yuan

Nian Jian 53,000 yuan

Bai Jian 50,000 yuan

Rice stores sell rice at the above prices plus the cost of handling and labor at the warehouse, plus a legal profit of 6%. For example, white geng thin rice will retail for 69,500 yuan. From today onwards, rice shops must not sell rice above this newly negotiated price.

[Also reported] In the past, grain merchants in the city were unable to circulate funds for selling coarse rice from Sichuan and Jiangxi. They requested the municipal government to sell it off and return the funds. After Mayor Wu agreed, he ordered them to complete the joint guarantee procedures for three rice shops first to ensure it. It is not known that the rice shop industry has not yet gone to clear it. Yesterday, Section Chief Ji of the Grain Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs told reporters, "I have just received Mayor Wu's order that if the rice shops do not go to the bureau to complete the procedures within three days, their business licenses will be revoked immediately."

[Also reported] The first batch of new coarse rice from Pudong was listed on the market yesterday, with an opening price of 44,000 yuan. Afterwards, it will come in a steady stream. Yesterday, a total of 13,400 shi of geng and xian yuan rice arrived in the north and south markets. Digestion was sluggish. High-quality goods were down 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Medium and low-grade geng jian fell sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bai yuan also fell by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour was weak. Oil prices were firm. Soybean cake was down another 100 to 200 yuan. Broad beans continued to fall by 500 to 600 yuan. Only raw peanuts were scarce, and the price rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The digestion of wheat by scattered households in various ports was more active, and the price rose by 700 to 800 yuan.

### Yarn Sales Are Dull, Cotton Is Currently Strong

Yesterday, the yarn market was weak and powerless. Although the output of yarn mills was reduced due to power outages, the minds of the peers were very high. However, the actual demand was insufficient. Therefore, Ma Chenchu once issued 140,000 yuan, and then returned to 138,000 yuan at the close. Small and medium-sized yarns were also very mediocre, generally not much different from the market at the end of last week. Only 20-count cone yarn rose in price by 40,000 yuan because a certain large pure weaving factory absorbed a large amount. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual. 20-count yarn was supplied by Baoguang and Nikko, and the price was similar to the market price.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market continued to be strong. The price of American cotton was easy to rise and difficult to fall. The bottom of the Shanghai port gradually dried up. Those who held spot goods were still hoping for higher prices and had no intention of depreciating. As a result, it was not easy for the buying and selling parties to reach an agreement. Factories did not open at all. Only the cotton number was slightly embellished. American cotton was closed on Saturday, and there was no electricity.

### Saving the Industrial and Commercial Crisis, Four Recommendations from Trade Associations, Please Ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Promptly Adopt the Central Government

Due to the current serious industrial and commercial crisis, the trade associations of the city invited members to discuss the matter for many days and proposed four recommendations. A letter was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for review and deliberation, and then forwarded to the central government agencies for adoption and implementation. The four recommendations are excerpted below:

(1) Strengthen the Specialization of Banks

The China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Agricultural Banks each have their own history and mission. To adapt to the needs of wartime, the Four Banks Joint Office was established. However, the office not only separates the powers of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, but also turns the bank into a yamen. Although the government currently stipulates that the funds of specialized banks should be used in specialized fields, not less than 50%, it also restricts loans of more than 30 million yuan, which must be reviewed by the Four Banks Joint Office for several months. The agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors urgently need loans, so how can they be so leisurely? Therefore, the Four Banks Joint Office must be abolished as soon as possible. The Central Bank must fulfill its responsibility as a bank's bank, handling rediscounting and refinancing businesses, while dispelling the illusion of shrinking bank accounts, reducing the statutory deposit reserve rate, and putting it to good use.

(2) Expedite Production Loans

In the past, the government's total amount of industrial loans accounted for only 2% of the annual expenditure due to its single-minded obsession with austerity, which was a major mistake. Our country's agriculture has been suffering from years of war and needs to be rescued urgently. The Farmers Bank should urgently handle loans to rescue agriculture. The conditions for industrial loans must be studied in light of the actual situation of each factory, and the necessary full funding should be provided. In addition to factory buildings, machinery, and equipment, joint acceptance by the industry can be adopted. Raw materials and finished products should not be frozen.

(3) Implement a Linked Import and Export System

And subsidize exports, such as adopting low-interest export loans, reducing or exempting transportation fees and tariffs, or cash subsidies. Adopt this system and stipulate that merchants use the foreign exchange earned from exporting local products to offset the need for their import foreign exchange, linking them in terms of amount or type. For example, importers of cotton yarn must export their manufactured products, cotton yarn or cloth, to offset their import foreign exchange, so that export trade depends on import trade for survival.

(4) Organize the Industrial Revival Investment Company

The company's capital is US$2 billion, with private investment accounting for one-quarter and solicitation from overseas Chinese and friendly foreigners accounting for three-quarters. It is also stipulated that our country's US$300 million in US funds can be approved to be invested as the company's capital, purchasing new machinery from overseas and investing it in domestic factories as shareholders, so that the foundation of domestic national industry will become increasingly solid.

### Public Bond Trading Is Sporadic

Public bond prices remained calm yesterday. There were only a few sporadic long-short balance transactions in the market. There was not much honor or disgrace at the opening and closing. In the middle, they first rose and then fell, and the fluctuations were also narrow. Tong Bing opened at 840 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 920 yuan, and then fell to 820 yuan, and finally hovered between 850 yuan and 870 yuan. The result was similar to last Saturday. Other bonds also lacked change.

### Bull Manipulation Is Easy, Chinese Stock Changes Are Unpredictable

Chinese stocks are volatile, and bull manipulation is easy. The trend of the day is to squeeze shorts. As soon as there is an upward trend, retail investors follow suit, causing dissatisfaction among large investors. Yesterday, the market used tricks again, deliberately raising the spot price. Retail investors really followed suit. The bulls took advantage of the situation to release their futures, so that the high price of Yongsah rose to 715 yuan, Meiya to 5,050 yuan, Jingfu to 307 yuan, Xinguang to 295 yuan, and Qinxing to 220 yuan. At this time, the bulls and bears struggled greatly. After 10:30 AM, the buying power began to show weakness and began to decline slightly. After 11:00 AM, the chips were overloaded again and could not be supported. Floating bulls began to cut losses. The large bull investors ignored it because there were too many unsold shares. At the low price at noon, Yongsah was 653 yuan, Meiya was 4,430 yuan, Jingfu was 270 yuan, Xinguang was 260 yuan, and Qinxing was 185 yuan. There was a slight consolidation before the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsah, Meiya, and Jingfu were still stable, while Xinguang and Qinxing fell slightly. Smaller and medium-sized stocks and veteran stocks were brought down, but the decline was insignificant.

Foreign stocks were initially stable and then weak. Retail investors were worried about their finances and were unwilling to register with foreign companies, and many closed out their positions. The overall situation was unfavorable, and buyers were slightly hesitant. Yisha gradually moved from a high of 10,600 yuan to a low. Large and powerful players had different views and were deeply afraid that the chips would decrease, so they absorbed them from time to time when the price was low. There were many gains in the middle. At the low price, Yisha was 9,200 yuan and Yinglian was 9,600 yuan. It was slightly stable near noon. As a result, compared with the previous close, steel stocks fell by 10%, Jardine Matheson fell slightly, and the rest fell by about 5%.

### Purchasing Goods from the Gold Pound Area, Settlement Can Be Made in Gold Pounds

The Central Bank recently revised the Interim Measures for Foreign Exchange Settlement of Chinese Imports promulgated on June 24 and has ordered all designated foreign exchange banks to implement it from now on.

(1) For purchases from all areas of the Gold Pound Area, such as European countries, Africa, the Near East, and Southeast Asian countries, settlement can be made in British Gold Pounds or the currencies of related countries. This does not apply to exceptions approved by the Central Bank.

(2) For purchases from the United States, Canada, the Philippines, and Latin American countries, settlement can be made in US dollars or the currencies of related countries.

### Floating Capital Turns, Gold Notes Tend to Be Weak

Gold has no attraction, and floating capital is flowing elsewhere. The market is mediocre and there is little special change. Although it struggled outside 1.97 million in the early morning, a part of those who exchanged gold for stocks gradually decreased slightly from 1.975 million. The Central Bank allocated two bars at a price of 1.96 million. After that, the low price was 1.955 million, the price was flat, and the transaction was scarce. At noon, it still hovered around 1.96 million. There was not much change in the afternoon. The trend was very stable. As a result, compared with last week, it fell back by 15,000. Ornamental gold was 200,800, patterned silver was flat, silver dollars rose slightly, and underground interest rates varied slightly from 1.1 to 1.5.

Foreign currency US dollars lacked special changes. After opening at 2,560 yuan, it gradually weakened slightly. The process was mediocre. At noon, it fell back to 2,520 yuan. It was slightly stable in the afternoon. As a result, it fell by 25 yuan compared with last week. Hong Kong notes were no more than about 565 yuan at the high price. The long telegram from Hong Kong was 184, which is equivalent to a Hong Kong exchange rate of only 543 yuan. As a result, the buying appetite was relatively sluggish. As a result, it fell by 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 545 yuan to 555 yuan. Supply exceeded demand. The Indian exchange rate was 660 yuan to 670 yuan. The British exchange rate was 8,800 to 8,900. American exchange rates were flat both officially and unofficially.

### Smoke Signals Everywhere, No Hope for Hangzhou Silk Sales to the North

— Hangzhou Report on July 13, Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

The Life of Female Workers in Hangzhou Silk Factory (Photo by Sun Shaoxuan)

Zhejiang silk is famous in China. In fact, the places in Zhejiang that produce the most silk are only Hangzhou, Wuxing, and Shaoxing. The Hangzhou spun silk, Huzhou crepe, and Shaoxing spun silk that we know are all special silk materials produced in the above three places. Among the three places, Hangzhou produces the most steel, even in the mountain countries of the southwest, it is no exception, and it is loved and worn by people all over the country.

The largest market for Zhejiang silk is in North China and Northeast China. Beiping, North China, was the former capital, and there are many literati who love to wear comfortable and free clothing. Zhejiang silk is soft and comfortable to wear, so it is adopted. And the northern country is cold early, people love to wear silk cotton clothes, this silk cotton can only be made of Zhejiang silk as the surface, so it will not竄out of the clothes. Otherwise, each white silk cotton head will flow on the surface of the clothes, which is not very elegant.

Our country has always not paid much attention to numbers, so there are no reliable statistics on the exact number of Zhejiang silk sales to the north. Roughly estimated, sales to the north are often more than 30% of the total output, and the number of foreign sales is not searchable.

No One Cares During Eventful Times

During the Anti-Japanese War, Hangzhou, Wuxing, and Shaoxing successively fell into the hands of the enemy, and the number of silk weavers naturally decreased sharply. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the silk industry wanted to cheer up and work hard, but for many years since the year, no one has come to ask about the price of Zhejiang silk in the Northeast and North China because of the problems of the Communist Army. Various foreign clothing materials are about to arrive in a steady stream. People who are greedy for cheapness and love fashion will certainly not want to buy Hangzhou silk anymore. Because of the sluggish sales, the level of living has risen day by day, and the cost has increased day by day, so the business has become even more bleak. Now, the silk industry is complaining every day. They miss the past prosperity, but are experiencing the current difficult situation. Although they have unlimited expectations for the future, they also feel that there is no certainty.

Rural Economy Suffers Hardships

The depression of the silk industry has also affected the silkworm farmers in the entire Hangjiahu and Zhejiang silkworm-raising counties, because good silkworms harvest good silk, which can of course be sold abroad, but the secondary silk obtained from secondary silkworms can be made into silk for self-use in their own country. Now the silk industry is sighing, many silk machines are not active, and silkworm silk has no way out, and silkworm farmers are also complaining. Therefore, the silk industry in Zhejiang is really affecting the rural economy.

The Livelihood of Most Women Is Precarious

How much has the amount of products decreased before and after the war? According to the survey of the silk weaving industry in Hangzhou City, there were more than 6,200 electric silk weaving machines and more than 8,500 hand weaving machines before the war, employing about 22,000 workers, with a monthly output of about 100,000 pieces. Now there are only more than 3,300 electric machines and only more than 2,200 hand weaving machines, with only more than 8,000 workers and a monthly output of only more than 34,000 pieces. The electric machine is less than one-half of what it was before the war, the hand weaving machine is less than one-quarter of what it was before the war, the workers are less than one-third of what they were before the war, and the output is less than one-third of what it was before the war. The median averages are two-thirds lower than before the war. Especially noteworthy is that hand-woven silk has decreased by three-quarters. These many hand-woven silks are often rural women or women who want to improve themselves. They depend on this for a living. Now that so many opportunities have been reduced, these many women will become consumers in society.

In other places, such as Shaoxing, electric machines have not yet recovered. It is said that Wuxing has only recovered a part, but hand weaving machines have generally decreased.

Two-Thirds of Workers Are Unemployed

We only look at the figures of the silk industry in Hangzhou City to know that the number of silk weaving workers has decreased by two-thirds. In fact, the unemployment of these two-thirds of silk weaving workers is not just the hunger and fear of more than 14,000 people, but will affect the entire family of each of them, and even affect the entire society. Is it not the same in Shaoxing and Wuxing? What will be the aftermath of this vast number of unemployed workers and this affected rural economy? Now, most people in the Hangzhou City silk industry are probably requesting loans, but whether loans are a solution is obviously a problem.

Improve Patterns and Weave New Silk

I think the most important thing is to improve the patterns and make new silks to compete with foreign products. This is really the most active way, because if we borrow some money to drag on, it will become deeper and deeper. If we are determined to improve silk, then the loan will also have a future.

Secondly, we hold an optimistic attitude, that is, the chaotic situation in the country will always be clarified one day. When the day of clarification comes, the markets in North China and Northeast China will still have to be won back. Therefore, at this time, we may as well continue to produce in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers.

Again, we can have reasons to prepare for foreign sales. As long as we improve the quality and study the psychology of Americans, we will work hard to promote it and strive to manufacture it, then the foreign sales market is not without hope.

However, solving this major difficulty at present still requires the government and the people to jointly find another way!

### Another Aspect of Suppressing Traitors in Hong Kong

— Special Correspondent Lin Youlan from Hong Kong Airmail, reporting on the 13th of this month.

In my previous dispatch, I mentioned that "traitors" are categorized based on the object of their betrayal. Due to differences in national laws, "Han traitors" betray China, while "English traitors" betray England. An English traitor is not necessarily a Han traitor. If China and England did not have this "unresolved entanglement" that is Hong Kong, with one located in the Far East and the other in Western Europe, then Han traitors and English traitors could each be managed separately, and no problems would arise. However, during World War II, Hong Kong was included in the China war zone, and the British forces that re-entered Hong Kong were ordered by our Supreme Commander, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to accept the surrender of the Japanese army. Although the Union Jack was raised again in Hong Kong after the war, this colony is now a colony with unresolved issues, and its appearance is vastly different from the past. Guangdong and Hong Kong are separated by a narrow strip of water, and many Han traitors are taking advantage of the different laws to flee to Hong Kong. The original Han traitors in Hong Kong are also using their "selling out" techniques to curry favor with the British, treating them as new lovers, feeling pleased with themselves, and acting recklessly, which has caused some storms. Among them, the most influential was the scene involving Hong Kong's top cultural traitor, Cen Weixiu. I have reported on this repeatedly in recent months, which I believe is well known to readers in China. The Hong Kong government, in order to cherish the friendship between the two great nations of China and England, has formally expressed its commitment to making great efforts to assist our country in extraditing Han traitors for trial. Previously, General Fetherstonhaugh had also reached an agreement with the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters on the method of exchanging Han traitors and war criminals. On April 16th, the Hong Kong government used a British naval vessel to transport three Han traitors captured in Hong Kong to be handed over, while Guangdong extradited six Japanese war criminals.

Li Hanchong, the Chief of the Eradication Conspiracy Office of the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters, had negotiated an agreement with the Hong Kong government on the exchange of Han traitors and war criminals, which included three points: (1) The Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters and its liaison officer stationed in Hong Kong are the main institutions and personnel responsible for negotiating, arresting, and extraditing Han traitors; (2) All citizens of the Republic of China who committed acts that violated the Chinese Regulations for the Punishment of Han Traitors and violated the National Covenant, from July 7, 1937, to August 16, 1945, are Han traitors. The Garrison Headquarters will notify the Hong Kong authorities of their names, ages, native places, and the details of their crimes for arrest; (3) After the crimes of Han traitors in Hong Kong are confirmed, the Hong Kong authorities will arrest them, and our side will send personnel to assist. However, if the number of Han traitors to be extradited is within 20 each time, the Hong Kong authorities shall arrest them within one week and hand them over to the personnel designated by the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters for extradition and transfer to Chinese courts for trial.

According to reports, after the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters released the first and second lists of wanted Han traitors, there are more than 300 Han traitors of all sizes hiding in Hong Kong! In the category of cultural Han traitors alone, in addition to Cen Weixiu, who single-handedly controls the "Overseas Chinese Daily," there are twelve others. In the past six months, the Hong Kong government has tried 54 war criminals and collaborators, but has only extradited three Han traitors: Kong Weixin, the Guangzhou opium king during the enemy-puppet era, Chen Cai, a notorious enemy-puppet secret agent, and Chen Gan, the military law director of the puppet Security Command Headquarters. The Han traitors who have been explicitly wanted are still almost all acting freely in Hong Kong, beyond the reach of the law. Who should be held responsible for this oversight? How can we investigate and punish them to uplift the people's hearts? I bring this up to urge people to pay attention!

### Aboard the Fleet Returning Home in the Caribbean Sea: Notes from Pearl Harbor, June 9th

— Qiuping

Everyone's mood has been restless these days. The words "set sail for home" have been mentioned countless times. However, as the date of return approaches, more and more rumors of postponement are spreading. This impatient waiting is reminiscent of the feeling of waiting to fly to India in western Sichuan a year ago. When you are not abroad, you want to go abroad; when you are abroad, you want to return home. Life is often surrounded by contradictions. Finally, the order came down.

On April 4th, eight Chinese warships held a grand review. On the 6th, they left Guan Port to return home, visiting the overseas Chinese communities in Santiago and Havana, Cuba, along the way.

The voyage from Guan Port to Santiago is only a few hours. We raised our flags and weighed anchor, and by 1 p.m., we could see the lighthouse and the ancient fortress ruins in the port of Santiago. We stood on the deck, using binoculars to observe this Spanish-style ancient city. It is the second largest city in Cuba, surrounded by a sea harbor.

In the port, the fleet changed its unloading and docking formation, led by the flagship, the escort destroyer Tai Kang, winding its way into the port. The port was already crowded with people, and overseas Chinese organizations had hired small boats to welcome us in the harbor. The boats were marked with large characters written in brush: "Welcome the Chinese Fleet." The boats were filled with neatly dressed overseas Chinese men and women. The men raised their hands to salute us, and the women waved in the wind. Our hands also waved tirelessly in return. Our hearts were filled with excitement and joy. We have not been forgotten! These are such kind faces greeting us and cheering for us.

First, the flagship fired a 21-gun salute to the Cuban government. The eight ships docked in succession, followed by a return salute from the Santiago fortress, mixed with cheers, reverberating and drowning out the rhythmic waves of the Caribbean Sea. The flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth fluttered in the wind, flying everywhere along the city slopes, the shore, and the harbor!

It is customary for the navy to grant leave after docking. By just 4 p.m., the streets, refreshment shops, and clubs were filled with young Chinese naval officers in twos and threes. White uniforms and blue shoulder straps brought a touch of the East to the medieval island city. When overseas Chinese saw us, they greeted us kindly and led us intimately to visit various overseas Chinese organizations, receiving welcome and hospitality from all sides. Emotionally, we forgot that we were abroad. We gained warmth and hope, especially since we came from the sea. Just as I and several soldiers stepped from the port into the city streets, we were surrounded by a group of Cuban children. Some stretched out their hands for American cigarettes, some asked for small change, and some followed us from a distance, peeking at our good fortune. Just as we did not know how to deal with this group of children, an overseas Chinese came over to greet us and offered to accompany us to tour the area. You could often encounter this kind of warm and kind overseas Chinese on the streets.

But a problem arose. This overseas Chinese spoke Cantonese, while we spoke Mandarin. When we tried to speak English, he spoke Spanish.

He silently led us through Second Street. The difficulty was finally broken by a long silence. We realized that although Chinese dialects are diverse, the written language is unified. So we started writing to each other. In his writing, we learned that since the Chinese fleet arrived at Guan Port to receive pre-war exercises, various overseas Chinese organizations in Cuba had successively telegraphed invitations for the fleet to visit. They were also actively raising funds to welcome us, hoping to promote the country's prestige and enhance the reputation of the overseas Chinese. The Cuban government also designated April 6, the day the Chinese fleet arrived in Santiago, as "China Friendship Day."

In the evening, the Kuomintang branch held a flag presentation ceremony to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which Commander Lin accepted on his behalf. After the ceremony, a dance party was held to entertain the fleet officers.

Soldiers were touring the night market, restaurants and eateries had the footprints of Chinese sailors, and movie theaters and department stores had the footprints of Chinese sailors. Today is China Friendship Day. Tonight, Santiago is the night of the Chinese Navy.

By the time we returned to the ship, there was no one on the streets. The medieval national flags still fluttered quietly in the night. One or two black people followed behind us, whispering, helping night travelers find their way home. I knew that there were many black people in Santiago and that there were occasional robberies, so I looked straight ahead and walked quickly, ignoring them. After returning to the ship, I learned that a soldier's camera had been robbed by a black person. Although the city police pursued the robber, they did not catch him.

The next day, the 7th, was the parade in Santiago. At 9 a.m., one-third of the soldiers from each ship gathered on the seaside road, led by the Santiago city police and water police in motorcycles, and the Cuban naval band played music, slowly leading the way. Three hundred young Chinese naval officers marched in step, the long, orderly line, amidst the crowds, applause, and cheers, parading through the ancient streets of Santiago. Our steps were light, and our chests were puffed out. Like victorious warriors returning from the battlefield, we received countless respectful and admiring glances. Like sons leaving for war, we received the boundless cheers and deep blessings of our hometown.

After the parade, I and my Cantonese classmate Deng went to the suburbs to play, taking some photos of the scenery and monuments to commemorate the trip. Passing the city hospital, we were invited inside for a tour. The magnificent architecture and complete equipment made it hard to believe that such a hospital, which should have been located in New York or Nanjing, was found in the ancient city of Santiago, Cuba. Later, a doctor told me that Cuba is famous for producing sugar, but few people know that Cuba is also one of the most medically advanced countries. Many diseases in the United States are treated by Cuban doctors who fly over to diagnose them.

Everywhere we went, people stopped to look at us, and praise and admiration were constantly directed at us, young Chinese soldiers.

Clearly, this naval visit gave the Cuban people a new concept of young China. Even the overseas Chinese who have lived on the island far from their homeland for a long time were overjoyed to meet hundreds of young people from their homeland in one day, as if they were reliving childhood dreams.

In the evening, the Kuomintang branch held a cocktail dance party to entertain the fleet soldiers. The branch was located in the bustling heart of the city, and the bright lights and exquisite medieval national flags decorated it like a magnificent fairy palace. The overseas Chinese in white formal wear were busy and attentive, greeting us, offering seats, serving tea, and young girls were smiling. These young Chinese who had sailed the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth from the Caribbean Sea into Santiago Harbor became honored guests.

Light Spanish music swirled from under the feet of the dancing couples into the quiet night sky, and curious people stood on the street, looking up.

Chinese people talking to Chinese people had to go through double translation. The overseas Chinese in Santiago have been in Cuba for a long time and can only speak Cantonese and Spanish. They mostly marry Cuban women. At the same time, because the environment does not require it, their children cannot even speak Cantonese. Therefore, at this dance party, to talk to these overseas Chinese girls, you first had to have an overseas Chinese translate the Spanish into Cantonese, and then have a Cantonese speaker translate the Cantonese into Mandarin.

There were no words, but the steps were consistent, heart leaning on heart, silently waltzing in this seaside city night, from the busiest time in the city until there was not a single figure on the street. On the morning of the 8th, the Chinese fleet blew its whistles and weighed anchor. On the dock were still the same people, waving flags and waving their hands, but the emotions were different from before. It is easy to meet but difficult to part. Coming quickly and going quickly!

### Visiting a Brave General in Panshi, Changchun Airmail, 15th

— Guan Rongqin

Heishi Town is about 90 li from Huadian City. On the afternoon of July 3rd, we saw it. Like Hengdaohezi, Heishi Town is also a small plain surrounded by mountains, belonging to Panshi County. The town itself does not have many residents, but it is still a center for the surrounding dozens of li and an important hub between Panshi and Huadian. Hearing that General Long was coming, the elders from villages as far as dozens of li away came. When they met General Long, they made many requests; the most urgent was to send troops to protect their villages or to issue firearms to deal with scattered bandits. Because of the harassment of scattered bandits, many villagers have painfully left their manors and moved to places where they have no roots. General Long agreed to try to find a way or forward their requests to the provincial government, but he asked the local authorities to repair the roads well, especially those that could be used by vehicles, so that the national army could transport supplies flexibly and quickly rush to their aid.

On July 4th, we arrived in Panshi. Seeing the bunkers standing on the mountain peaks around Panshi and at important road intersections, the name "Panshi" became even more fitting. General Long's troops stationed in Panshi have participated in battles to recover the south bank of the Hun River, Liaoyang, Sujiatun, Benxi, Kaiyuan, Xifeng, and Yitong after leaving the customs. They were also the first to enter Yongji. I met Regiment Commander Yang Maofa, who led a battalion into Yongji along the Jichang Highway. Regiment Commander Yang is from Xinyi, Guangdong, looks to be only thirty years old, is not tall, but has big eyes and a red face. He vividly told me about the process of occupying Yongji. He said that in the days before entering Yongji, the advance was very rapid, marching more than 100 li every day. At 3:00 p.m. on May 28th, they entered the city through the north gate. After a short battle, the Eighth Route Army was defeated and fled south. Amid the cheers and comfort of the people of Yongji, Regiment Commander Yang quickly deployed the city's defenses. About two or three hours later, the 88th Division and the 41st Division also entered the city from the east and west gates, respectively, further consolidating the defenses of Yongji.

The entire county of Panshi has a population of 260,000, and the urban area has more than 20,000. After the Eighth Route Army withdrew, the local authorities' main tasks were to comfort and rescue refugees, stabilize the local area, and repair roads. County Magistrate Hu Riyong, originally an instructor in the Youth Army, is loyal and approachable. Thanks to his tireless work, county administration has gradually gotten back on track.

At noon on the 5th, we took the Yantongshan Road from Panshi back to Yongji. Along the way, at every checkpoint, General Long was warmly welcomed and sincerely saluted by the people. Especially in Yantongshan, a small town, the people's enthusiastic rush was truly moving. In the long welcoming line, there were also students and teachers from the Korean Overseas School standing out. Wearing white uniforms with a touch of yellow, they waved flags and shouted. The president of the Korean Overseas Association here speaks fluent Chinese and had a cordial conversation with General Long for 20 minutes. He said that among the hundreds of Korean Overseas in Yantongshan, more than 200 had joined the Eighth Route Army. Those who remained also lived in poverty and hoped to return to Korea in the short term. General Long agreed to forward their requests, but before they returned to their country, he hoped that they would strengthen their organization and not disturb local law and order. If they were law-abiding, our soldiers and civilians would inevitably treat them with a friendly attitude.

### The Philippines Today

Esguerra Street on the south bank of the Pasig River in the city before the Japanese occupation. The city is the oldest district in Manila. The Philippine government, Manila University, the weather station, library, museum, church, countless primary and secondary schools, and monasteries are all located in this area, which has now been destroyed by artillery fire and become ruins.

### Nurturing the Seedlings of Industry

The root cause of the various problems in our country today can be attributed to stagnant production. If we continue to treat the symptoms rather than the cause, there will inevitably be a day when the disease becomes incurable! The fundamental solution lies in increasing production, especially industry. However, there is a major prerequisite - namely, the peace and stability of the political situation, because war is what causes production to stagnate the most. Therefore, we demand an immediate end to the war. All parties must recognize the direction of the world economy and implement a democratic agricultural and industrial policy based on the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father.

(1) Foundation: The Founding Father's proclamation of "restricting capital and equalizing land ownership," as well as his industrial plan, and the industrial construction program and agricultural land policy of the recent Sixth National Congress, are all guiding plans and programs for construction. The capital we need should be national industrial capital. The current various distorted capital will be expelled from the capital market. Our industrialization should be built on the foundation of agriculture. We should preserve our country's inherent heritage - agriculture; the fruits of industrialization should also only be enjoyed by the vast number of farmers, because they are the source of market purchasing power. But to increase purchasing power, we must solve the land problem, which is urgently needed in both the short and long term.

(2) Production Costs: The shortage of raw materials can also be said to be the failure to develop raw materials as much as possible, which is a major problem, and this is related to technical talent. Other issues include the abundance of water and thermal power equipment and supply, the improvement of production means such as machinery and tool equipment, the cultivation and rational allocation of labor, and the rectification of wages and labor disputes to ensure labor-management coordination. As for the issue of expenditure, it depends on the solution of the price problem. Production costs are closely related to production technology and production means. It is enough to look at the different production situations before and after the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe to know this. Now that the discovery of appropriate atomic energy may bring about an epoch-making change in industry.

(3) Talent and Management: The government should cultivate talent and promote true talent; if it continues the past practice of setting up positions based on people, it will be a major obstacle to the future of industrialization. The recent death of engineer Hao, who studied in France, is an example. At the same time, we must not be afraid to admit our shortcomings. For example, the return of a batch of exported goods due to non-compliance with standards is due to backward technology. Therefore, we should cultivate domestic talent on the one hand and utilize foreign technical talent on the other. For example, the large-scale hydropower project in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, as long as the power is in our hands, even if we set a fixed method, it will not harm the overall situation. With a spirit of hard work, use scientific management methods in a planned way to adjust and allocate normal human resources, so that everyone can use their talents to the fullest and be rewarded according to their work.

(4) Foreign Exchange: The level of the exchange rate is of great importance to domestic industrialists and business people. China has always been an importing country, so it should use tariff policies to strictly manage and control foreign exchange, and restrict the import of some non-essential goods. In this way, imported goods will not be dumped, and the development of the national industry in its nascent stage will not be affected. As for the export business, the state can use various methods to subsidize and support it, so that the investment and expansion of the national industry can be fearless. International trade should first seek self-sufficiency and then seek the promotion of overseas markets. If cotton textiles are exported on the one hand and inferior cotton fabrics are imported on the other hand, it is an unequal exchange, which is a distorted international trade.

(5) Transportation and Taxes: The transportation network of a country is like the blood vessels of a human body, and its importance is well known. To develop industry, we must develop transportation as much as possible to make production and sales transportation flexible. However, today China's transportation system is blocked and inconvenient. For example, there is a cotton shortage in Shanghai, while there is a phenomenon of goods being abandoned on the ground in the Shaanxi and Gansu production areas. As for taxes, direct collection methods should be used as much as possible, and the burden should not be shifted. We should also strive for fairness and conservation. The taxation of foreign goods should not be overly preferential.

The above are just a few of the major points. Other important points include the link with finance, the need for stable currency values, the abolition of usury, the rational allocation of production means, and the promotion of cooperative business methods. In short, saving the industrial crisis is not only a matter of industry itself, but all related departments must pay attention to it at the same time. Therefore, the future of China's industrialization is bright, and the key lies in whether the planners and implementers can implement it practically, so that the seedlings of China's fragile industry can develop and grow rapidly.

### Do Not Forget the Righteous People Who Miss Their Homes

Editor:

In the post-victory repatriation, many officials went down to the east without any difficulty. Secondly, those with a little means also found ways to receive public funds and had already returned to their homes, which they had left for eight years. Only we, a group of refugees from Jiangnan, numbering more than 200,000 (who are also righteous people), are still wandering in Guizhou and the Southwest, eating up all we have and living in poverty! The reason is that we ourselves have no way to raise a considerable amount of repatriation funds. At the same time, we are, after all, refugees, so how can we have the nerve to blame the government for forgetting us?

Some time ago, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Highway Administration held a program to send refugees back to their hometowns. The method was that the Administration and the Highway Administration subsidized half of the expenses for ordinary refugees, and the Administration and the Highway Administration bore the expenses for the extremely poor, including food expenses. But before long, this method was announced to be discontinued in late May. This is tantamount to a deadly blow to us, because we were expecting repatriation, so we sold all our belongings. Now we are simply in a desperate situation!

It is said that the reason for the suspension of repatriation is that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration failed to allocate the required subsidies in full, and the Highway Administration was naturally unable to continue to advance the funds, so this work was put aside like a tiger's head and a snake's tail. But our livelihood is difficult, and we are worried all day long. Are the government and society really going to ignore us? Zhang Chaogui (mason), Liu Kechang (barber), Shi Juru (peddler), Wang Fayaou (printing worker), and Pan Shichang (news vendor), all Soviet refugees in Guiyang.

### A Female Student's Fall

Mr. Editor:

The other day, I heard from our old classmate that a former classmate of ours, Ms. Qiu, who was an excellent student in both character and academics, has fallen into a place where souls are sold, to be played with and ravaged! What unfortunate news! A female elementary school graduate, due to family economic problems, became a... guide, selling her life's happiness. I sigh with regret for her!

I think in this society, I really don't know how many young girls are wandering and falling because of the flames of war. They were excellent students in school, and now! Their footprints are in hotels, dance halls, and bars. The ladies who smile at people and cry behind their backs, their pain is more unbearable than being cut by a knife!

Therefore, I shout loudly, hoping that society will set up more factories, as long as they can make a living, they will never willingly do this flesh trade! (Respectfully, Chen Xingqiao)

### Chao County Growing Amidst Thorns

— Fourteenth Chao County Correspondence, Bai Baiping

Speaking of Chao County, readers may not be too unfamiliar with it. It is the hometown of Generals Feng Yuxiang and Zhang Zhizhong, bordering the eastern shore of Chao Lake, and is a not-too-small county in central Anhui. Since May of the 27th year, it has spent seven years and three months of suffering under the clutches of Japanese devils. It was only on August 17th of last year that it returned to the embrace of the motherland. After more than seven years of torment, countless disasters, hardships, and bitterness, even after eleven months of management and revival, it is still full of broken tiles and rubble after extreme destruction and devastation. If you are a native of the county returning from wandering, as soon as you enter the county seat, you will have the feeling of reading "Rhapsody on the Abandoned Capital."

Enemy-Puppet Crimes Now Lead to Housing Shortage

Today's Chao County, whether in the city or in the countryside, also faces a housing shortage, although not as severe as in Beijing and Shanghai. The reason for the housing shortage is neither "sealing" nor "confiscation." In all the towns and villages that the Japanese devils passed through, the better houses were burned or demolished. The situation in the city is even worse. Now, the refugees are returning one after another, and the population is increasing day by day. The original housing for the people during the occupation already feels cramped, and there has only been destruction without construction. Nowadays, everyone is struggling under the high pressure of prices. The whip of life has beaten people to the point where they can't breathe. Where can they talk about building houses? Thus, a housing shortage has formed.

Urban construction is relatively easy to restore, but it is difficult here. Private sole investment in construction is out of the question. Even for public utilities, for example, the original site of the county middle school was burned down by the Japanese devils. After the victory, local people organized the "Chao County Middle School Building Committee," mobilized the people of the whole county to donate, and misappropriated a lot of local public funds, but now construction has been suspended halfway due to lack of money. The county government and its affiliated agencies are still renting private houses. From this, it can be seen that both the public and private sectors are in trouble!

Bearing Heavy Burdens, the Good People Suffer

The pain that the housing shortage gives to the people is not the sharpest. The disaster victims after the looting seem to have sores all over their bodies. When a large sore hurts too much, they forget the pain of the small sores. For more than seven years, the common people have been squeezed dry by the enemy, puppets, and bandits, and now only a few dry bones are left. They need rich nutrition and sufficient rest to have hope of restoring their original health. But what is the reality? The marrow in the dry bones is still being squeezed out, squeezed to the point of only a faint groan!

The reporter is not yet clear about Chao County's local finances, but will only talk about the burden on the people. Last year, the central government exempted the recovered areas from land tax for one year, which was a blessing from the country, and Chao County did benefit from it. However, the disguised taxes are much heavier than the land tax. The 70,000 piculs of military grain that Chao County was required to pay have already been paid in full, but the officially set grain price is far lower than the market price. Even with this cheap grain money, the common people did not receive the full amount at the official price. Where was the discount taken from? Only the common people's hearts are clear. Although the land tax was exempted last year, there was a item called "county-level public grain," with a levy of 30 to 50 piculs per "jia." This was only once, and the common people could still bear it. However, every month, rice, grass, and money are required because the county has a total of twenty-eight townships, each with a township office and a central primary school, and each "bao" has a "bao" office and a "bao" national primary school. The salaries of the staff and teachers of these institutions and schools, and all office expenses, are directly borne by the local people. In addition, there are temporary expenses for township and "bao" chiefs and "jia" heads, which also have to be raised and compensated. And that's not the end of it. The monthly salary of the "bao" police team soldiers is three "shi" three "sheng" of coarse rice and 3,000 yuan, which includes food and salary. Therefore, when the "bao" police team is stationed in a certain township, they always have to ask for extra things from the local area to supplement their food. This is not a question of the military discipline of the "bao" police team; the meager salary forces them to do so. Furthermore, each "xiangding" in the township office receives five "shi" of rice and 5,000 yuan per month. In today's constantly rising prices, it is barely enough to support themselves, let alone take care of their families?

To this day, rice prices in this county seat and countryside have risen as much as in Beijing and Shanghai. The reason is that the common people have no rice. Nine out of ten families have no food. The rice is still like green grass in the fields. It does not mature in a day because of the owner's expectations. The common people wander in the fields every day, stroking the only lifeline. However, it will only be harvested in two months. In these two months, they still have to produce rice, grass, and money!

Favorable Weather, When Will There Be National Peace and Prosperity?

The common people, under the shadow of sorrow and suffering, hope for a good harvest this year. The money borrowed, the rice borrowed, the addition of agricultural implements, and even marrying daughters and taking wives are all prepared to be repaid and purchased after the autumn harvest. Naturally, marriage expenses also come from this. Heaven has the virtue of cherishing life. This year, the crops are indeed very good. Since the rice transplanting until now, the weather has been favorable, without worrying about floods or droughts. Moreover, everyone says that this year's rice seedlings are better than last year, so the harvest will naturally be more than last year. This is a great joy in the hearts of the common people.

Although the common people are bearing heavy burdens now, they have hope for the autumn harvest. They have forgotten their own pain and are focusing on national affairs. In the past two months, the northern township of this county has become a stronghold for the Communist army. They appear and disappear mysteriously, gathering and dispersing unpredictably, sometimes splitting into small groups, sometimes merging into large groups. Therefore, how many people they actually have is still a mystery. It is said that this is the "people's army," and they directly ask the common people for rice and money. The families with some food and clothing in the northern township have been emptied, and sometimes they even kill people to show off their power. The local armed forces are weak and can only defend and block, but cannot advance and pursue, causing the people of the whole county to be uneasy.

After nine years of hardship for the country, the common people are no longer indifferent to national affairs. Today, what they hope for is peace, stability, and national unity. They don't care about bearing heavy burdens and suffering themselves, as long as they can live in peace, they will be satisfied. They used to live under the clutches of the enemy and puppets. Although the flowers bloomed and withered every year, they let the Lunar New Year, which they valued the most, pass quietly every year, without even pasting a couplet. It was not until last year's victory that they celebrated the Lunar New Year grandly, with "firecrackers in every house and peach wood charms on every door." Unexpectedly, the country was "...unfavorable." After defeating the brutal enemy, "civil war" broke out again. An old man pointed to the spring couplet "Favorable weather, national peace and prosperity" on his door and said to the writer: "This year is originally favorable weather, but when will national peace and prosperity be realized?"

### Education and Culture Progressing in Hard Work

The common people are still living in a storm, so it is difficult to make progress in everything. The rural areas are desolate, and how can the abnormal prosperity of the cities support the important task of the country? Today, every city also presents a phenomenon of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak. All undertakings are full of difficulties. The writer is relatively close to the education and culture sectors here, so let's talk about these two.

Chao County currently has one county middle school, one demonstration primary school, one Huanglu Normal School founded by Zhang Zhizhong, and central primary schools and "bao" primary schools in each township and "bao." The common ailment of each level of school is poverty, especially the central primary schools and "bao" primary schools. Because the rice and money are directly collected from the "bao" and "jia," and the common people themselves are crying out for food, they naturally cannot take out rice and money every month. It is common for teachers in the central and "bao" primary schools to have no rice to cook. How can we run the country's basic education well in this way? It's not a child's play! As for the teachers' salaries in the central primary schools, it is six "shi" of rice and 10,000 yuan per month. Even if it is paid monthly, it is difficult to avoid spending next month's income this month, let alone delay payment? The reporter here sincerely appeals to the government to please save the teachers soon.

Speaking of culture, it is very pitiful. You can't find a decent bookstore in the whole city. There are two newspapers, one is the Chao County Daily, jointly run by the party and government, and the other is the Chao Sheng Bao, organized by the Youth League. Both are quarto-sized lithographs, printed on one side only, divided into two pages. The first page publishes domestic and foreign news, clipped from newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, always two or three days old. Two-thirds of the second page is local news, and one-third is a supplement. Each page occasionally has some advertisements. Both of these are maintaining publication in hardship. The spirit of hard work of the staff is worthy of admiration. It is said that Mr. Tong Chunxuan, a provincial senator, Mr. Gao Qiwo, the principal of the county middle school, and local people who are enthusiastic about cultural undertakings, are planning to organize a printing house in the autumn and change lithography to letterpress printing. We wish them smooth success. This is necessary for the promotion of culture.

Generally speaking, today's Chao County is where the common people are in pain, the leaders of all sectors are working hard, and all undertakings are in the process of revival. The reporter hopes that when there is an opportunity to report on the situation here for the second time, this worn-out pen can write a joyful newsletter.

### Summer on the Shores of West Lake

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou, July 2nd

"If you compare West Lake to Xizi, it is beautiful whether heavily or lightly adorned." This is a line of poetry praising the beauty of West Lake. We people who live in Hangzhou always like to stroll along the lake when we have nothing to do. Indeed, sunlight, moonlight, and starlight set off and reflect various different beauties of West Lake. Spring has passed, and West Lake has changed into its summer attire. The tender green branches along the embankment have been painted with a darker color. The lotus leaves in the inner lake are luxuriant, and the lotus flowers are budding. When the boat passes by, the hull rubs against the lotus branches, making a "sha sha" sound, as if it has many things to tell you. A burst of lotus fragrance makes the travelers feel relaxed and happy. At night, when there is no moon, many people take small boats, bringing musical instruments, accompanied by young women, and sing in the lake. So when you are strolling along the lake, there are many boats that entice you to take their boat by calling out "Let's go listen to a little tune."

West Lake is a Never-Ending Source of Enjoyment

West Lake is beautiful enough. Many people in Hangzhou told me: "We have lived in Hangzhou for thirty or forty years, but we never get tired of playing in West Lake." Because Hangzhou has West Lake, it has a large income every year. I heard some people say, "Because West Lake can support Hangzhou, the city government is making every effort to clean up West Lake." This sentence seems to be good on the surface, but after thinking about it, one cannot help but criticize the municipal authorities. In fact, it is no wonder that people criticize them. On the busiest road, Baoyoufang, the sewage overflows on both sides. The shops are trying their best to dress up and decorate, broadcasting music, and calling on customers, but looking at the stinky water lying in front of them is really a powerful satire. The other roads, such as Qingtai Road, are no exception. We are even more worried that the asphalt road surface on these roads will soon be damaged. And the small alleys and back streets, "ju" is the appropriate word. It is also an inevitable fact that you have to grope your way home in the dark.

Recently, it seems that the city's lake channels are being dredged. The Huansha Creek, which is suitable for "drinking, washing, and urinating," is still busy with "drinking, washing, and urinating." Because the stinky water in Hangzhou flows everywhere, there are particularly many mosquitoes and flies. These mosquitoes and flies are not small in courage. You drive them away with a fan, but when you stop fanning, they come again. Especially the mosquitoes are particularly persistent, making you suffer unbearably.

Hangzhou Citizens Happily Drink "Rainwater," Rainwater being the water that flows down from the tin "gutters" installed on the roof. Whenever it rains, the rain flows from the tiled roof into the "gutters" and then from the "gutters" into the water tank. They don't ask whether there is dirt on the tiled roof or whether there is cat urine or bird droppings. They all consider drinking "rainwater" to be the best beverage.

Many hotels and food shops rarely have gauze covers to cover the cooked food, mostly letting dust and flies patronize.

Working Shirtless

In Hangzhou, except for a few luxurious buildings on the shores of West Lake that have sanitary facilities such as flushing toilets, the rest all use "chamber pots." The people who empty the chamber pots don't necessarily come early in the morning like in Shanghai. Some even come to empty them near lunch time. Therefore, feces and meals meet at the same time. It is even more unimaginable for people who eat, use the toilet, and live together, but they are used to it, and they are not surprised by it.

Many citizens of Hangzhou are also poor. They still have to seek their work. So, in a situation of working and sweating, the "shirtless" thing is very common. Although you can't see it on a few grand roads, it's also commonplace in back streets and alleys.

After the Dance Halls Were Banned

The dance halls on the shores of West Lake have been banned, replaced by female storytellers, as well as female singers and female storytellers, but they are not as prosperous as the dance halls. Recently, many female storytellers also accompany guests to play. Although the municipal government has posted "No sitting with guests" in the storytelling venues, it cannot prohibit it outside the storytelling venues, right? Besides, who can tell in the painting venue whether this is a storyteller or not? The China Restaurant has opened a rooftop garden on the roof of Hangzhou's tallest building, the Xihua Building, with some thatched sheds covered with reed mats, writing tempting words such as "Elevator up and down." In fact, this is the first time Hangzhou has had an elevator, but it is an underestimation of the old fellows of Hangzhou to call out "Elevator up and down."

The Kingdom Dance Hall has now changed to performing dance skills, the West Garden has changed to storytelling, and the West Lake has changed to singing. For some reason, some low-taste comedians from Shanghai are making a big splash here. Each entertainment venue uses prominent titles such as "Special invitation to the comedic master ×××" to attract customers.

Yingzi Road to the Lakeside

In the evening, from Yingzi Road to the lakeside, you can hear the sound of "ding ding da" everywhere. These are some people selling iced water. They set up small stalls, using many glass cups, with cold water in the cups, putting some red and yellow colors in the water, and then putting some sugar. There is also a piece of ice, using their specially made tool to shave some down and put it in the water in the cup, selling it for fifty yuan a cup. The sound of "ding ding da" is the sound of... collision when shaking the implement. This cheap cold drink is indeed doing brisk business.

Summer in Hangzhou is probably no more than the above, but until now, no one has been found to have cholera. Someone asked: "What's the reason for this?" Someone answered: "This is a Buddhist country. The Bodhisattva is spiritual, so it doesn't bring disaster to the old folks of Hangzhou!"

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(1) Zhu Dacheng asks: I have a house in the town of ×× County, totaling three courtyards. The first courtyard was burned down by the enemy after the incident. In the 30th year, I leased the land use right to the Wang family to build a house and leased the second courtyard to the Wang family to open a business. The contract stated that the term was eight years, and the house would be taken back when the term expired. The Wang family was required to take back the house built by the Wang family at the market price and the Wang family handed over the building list to me for safekeeping. In the 32nd year, the second courtyard and the land were leased to the Wang family along with the land for the establishment of land use rights. There are still two years before the expiration of the term for the complete recovery of property rights. I have suffered too much loss. Please answer: (1) Can the price of the pawn be increased to the Wang family? (2) Can the land use right be cancelled? (3) When all property rights are recovered in the future, how will the pawn price be calculated, in puppet currency or legal currency?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) No. (2) If there is no evidence of coercion or fraud, it cannot be cancelled. (3) Of course, it is calculated according to legal currency, and in reference to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation after Restoration, the court should fairly determine the increase or decrease in payment.

(2) Jiang Quan asks: I rented a small workshop in Wuxi. The landlord, Zhang, is a local bully. During the enemy and puppet period, he used his evil power to drive out other tenants. The lease contract is signed every six months or three months. The rent is particularly high. The land in Wuxi is severely short of housing. (1) If he refuses to accept the rent, is it considered a long-term rental in law? Is it valid to deposit the money in the local bank and notify him by letter to collect it? (2) Leaving aside the common legal currency, is it reasonable to use the price of rice as the standard? Is it a crime to despise the national currency? (3) If I suffer infringement due to the rent relationship, can I file a lawsuit and demand compensation? (4) The Shanghai Housing Management Committee announced that the rent for residential houses is calculated at 140 times that of the 26th year. Is it valid in Wuxi? (5) If I ignore his unreasonable demands or refuse to accept them, is it illegal? (6) If he claims that the house has been sold to others, what should I do?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) The notice of rent collection and deposit shall not be regarded as rent arrears. (2) It depends on whether there is such a custom in Wuxi. (3) The request for compensation must be based on actual damage. (4) It depends on whether the local administrative authorities have such regulations. (5) Since the lease has expired, whether to renew the lease must be resolved first. (6) If the lease is renewed, the lease right will not be affected by the transfer of ownership of the leased property.

(3) Li Shengyang asks: I had a house that was pawned before the incident. When it expired, we had not yet won the victory. When I asked to redeem it, the other party insisted that the money was silver coins and that the price of rice should be used to calculate the redemption. I did not have the economic strength. After mediation, I still followed the other party's proposal and signed another contract. Because I was confused by the saying that it would be considered absolute if it was overdue, I avoided signing. I don't know whether the contract signed under pressure before the victory can be revoked and resolved according to law. Please give instructions.

[Lawyer Zhu Yabai answers] You can only request revocation if there are facts and evidence of coercion or fraud.

Letter from the Direct Taxation Bureau

To whom it may concern: Recently, I read an article titled "Economic Loopholes" by reader Cui Zi'an in your newspaper, who had some misunderstandings about stamp tax tickets. The answer is as follows: (1) The highest denomination of the stamp tax currently sold is 1,000 yuan. Many merchants buy them, which may be unknown to the submitter. (2) Merchants who use more than 10,000 yuan of stamp tax tickets at one time can come to the bureau to apply for the issuance of a three-part payment form. After paying the tax to the national treasury with the payment form, the receipt can be used instead of stamp tax tickets. In fact, many merchants come to the bureau to apply for the issuance of a three-part payment form. The above two points are respectfully disclosed to dispel doubts. Sincerely, Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, July 18.

Telecommunications Bureau Prohibits Extortion

To whom it may concern: It is the duty of our bureau to send telegrams, and there is no regulation on receiving any fees. However, it has recently been found that a small number of unscrupulous elements are extorting petty fees from merchants in the name of the bureau, which is very hateful. In addition to repeatedly publishing prohibitions in your newspaper, we hereby send a letter requesting your newspaper to publish this letter and inform the merchants not to give any fees in the future, so as to stop bad habits and achieve cooperative results. We are deeply grateful and wish you all the best.

Spring and Autumn

### Red

— Zhong Yuan

In this world, there are many exceedingly lovable reds, and also many exceedingly terrifying reds. Lovable reds are like spring roses and red roses, and the red leaves and red beans of poets. Terrifying reds are like the seas of blood and rivers of blood on battlefields, and the raging flames of atomic bombs. Everyone knows this. But now I want to tell you a story about red, which is not about any of these. Please listen quietly.

There was a lively young woman who acted in plays. She said, "I'm too fat!"

So she tried to reduce her food intake as much as possible, eating only a little porridge, a little fruit, and a little unsweetened coffee.

Sure enough, she was satisfied. Looking in the mirror, her waist was as slender as a willow, and her legs were as beautiful as a painting. But then she discovered a flaw and said, "My voice is too hoarse!"

This seemed a bit difficult, but after consulting others, it wasn't hard. She ate two raw eggs every morning and shouted a few times at the sea. In addition, the person who gave her advice whispered in her ear, "As long as your face is outstanding, it doesn't matter if your voice is a little off!"

The young woman smiled knowingly, and then everything was ready.

The first night, the curtain rose, and the audience below was silent. -- The young woman was very anxious and desperately batted her eyelashes.

The second night, the curtain rose, and there was a slight "Bravo" from below. -- The young woman received a trace of comfort and desperately batted her eyelashes again.

The third night, the curtain rose, and there was a burst of applause from below. -- The young woman smiled slightly, all the while desperately batting her eyelashes.

Finally, one night, the curtain rose, and there was a thunderous roar from below! -- The young woman's heart bloomed with joy, knowing that she was red!

Red! Everything has changed!

The young woman sneezes, and a new poem appears in a tabloid. The young woman coughs, and a brilliant article appears in a tabloid. The young woman sheds a tear, and it's a terrible, terrible thing! ...

At three o'clock, General Manager Zhang's car stops at the door; at four o'clock, Director Li calls; at five o'clock, college student Xiao Wang appears at the back door with flowers; at six o'clock, veteran news reporter Lao Chen whistles in the alley. ...

The pictorial publishes photos of the young woman in every issue. The young woman has to bury herself in research, figuring out how to make the photos "beautiful eyes looking forward, a charming smile." ...

Large companies and hotels constantly invite the young woman to unveil monuments and cut ribbons. The young woman has to rack her brains day and night to design new outfits, figuring out how to dress in a way that surpasses the crowd, as beautiful as a celestial being. ...

Too much! Too much! In short, the young woman is red, but thousands of gazes bind her hands and feet, thousands of mouths wait on her every action, thousands of ears manage her pronunciation, and thousands of worries weigh on her heart. She can no longer get peace and freedom!

The story is finished. You must be saying that it's a shallow and meaningless story, with nothing to say. But the more shallow and meaningless things are in the world, the more perplexing they sometimes are. For example, the young woman in this story. You're surely going to laugh at her for being foolish and bringing trouble on herself. But wait! Please take a mirror and look at yourself: Hey! Aren't you also desperately "batting your eyelashes" at people, desperately trying to "become red"?

### Lamp

— Xiao Feng

This is truly a night of wind and rain. Raindrops constantly beat on the roof, and the cold wind hissed in through the gaps in the window, giving me a feeling of gloom and terror.

On the desk, a dim oil lamp flickers. A smoky tail of flame constantly swayed in the cold wind. The faint lamplight made this small room even more gloomy and terrifying. When the mice scurried under my feet, I almost doubted that this was the human world. It seemed that this small room was secretly transforming, shrinking in the dim light, as if it was going to be buried with me in this world of wind and rain. When I fearfully pulled open the door, a gust of furious cold wind, carrying scattered rain, struck my face. In the daytime, the mountain peak that stood majestically on the opposite bank of the river, the green trees, and the houses facing the river had disappeared into the dark atmosphere. The entire world was swallowed by darkness. The river, the mountains, and the sky merged into a pitch-black color.

Suddenly, from the distant riverbank, a bright light flickered, like a firefly swaying in the wind and rain. It floated across the riverbank, floated across the mountain path, and slowly disappeared into the dark shadows of the mountains. I knew that was a traveler's lamp in the dark night. In this bleak, wind-swept, and rainy night, the human world is so cruel. The wind and rain are like the relentless raging waves of life, constantly assaulting him. And the road of life is so uneven, mixed with muddy rainwater, that he may slip at any time, causing him to fall with painful wounds. However, this little light of a road lamp, like a mother's loving heart, a friend's warm hand, gave him infinite comfort, gave him infinite warmth, so that he could step by step walk towards that warm and bright place on this dangerous road.

The flickering lamplight has disappeared, and the world has returned to blackness. I wonder how many people are still groping on the windy and rainy roads in this dark world! Because they have all lost the bright road lamp. In the dark night of wind and rain, they cannot get any help and can only let the violent wind and rain swallow them.

The darkness seemed to be expanding, the wind and rain became even more violent, and a cold, gloomy atmosphere constantly permeated around me, as if I was about to be swept into this terrible world.

When I fearfully closed the door again and returned to the front of the desk, that dim oil lamp had become endearing. I trimmed the wick a bit, letting it emit a bright light.

In this dark world, only it can give me light and warmth!

Long Serial

### To Fly Together (93)

— Zhao Qingge

The fate of China, like Li Hua's fate, after countless calamities, is gradually seeing a new outlook! When the power of the Northern Warlords continued to inflict suffering on the people, revolutionary soldiers raised the banner of "Down with the Warlords" and began the Northern Expedition! China was praying for the realization of a new ideal, and Li Hua was also praying for the realization of a new ideal!

Li Hua respected both Liu Ziyun and Dong Shaoling as teachers, but she also had another indescribable emotion for Dong Shaoling. This emotion may be the emotion that Mrs. Mo was worried about. But Li Hua was not aware of it herself. She only felt that Dong Shaoling had a power that could control her. It seemed that if Li Hua did not see him for more than three days, she felt like she had a heavy burden weighing on her! And it seemed that if Dong Shaoling did not listen to Li Hua's performance for more than three days, Li Hua, from the stage, not seeing Dong Shaoling, who always sat in the right-side box below the stage, would immediately become bewildered and flustered! She herself was very strange, as she had never had this experience before. And when she was with Dong Shaoling, she was still taciturn. However, she was always smiling, and her smile seemed to be whispering; it was an indescribable infinite emotion!

Dong Shaoling, a neurotic intellectual full of emotion. But his emotions were expressed in many ways. In other words, his loves and hates were multifaceted, just as his talent was multifaceted. It seemed that he loved mountains and water; he loved flowers and grass; he loved painting and music; he loved new literature and old poetry; he loved cats and dogs and birds; he loved women and men. He hated thieves and eunuchs; he hated prostitutes and clients; he hated poverty and wealth; he hated foolishness and cunning. Because of this, his emotions could not be focused on a single "love" or "hate"! He could die for you, and he could die for him; but this was impossible, so he often suffered from not having enough emotion to distribute! And dissatisfaction! He had never stood on his own ground to think about something for himself or do something for himself, so he could also be called: a romantic intellectual of ego-less-ness. He loved Feng Hua very much, and it could be said that he liked her very much; he sympathized with her very much and was very willing to help her. But his "love" was like loving a child; a junior; his "like" was like liking a flower; a play; his "sympathy" was like sympathizing with a pair of innocent geese being hunted; like sympathizing with people who were generally abused and hurt; his willingness to "help" was like wanting to help all the weak under oppression. Therefore, the feelings he gave to Li Hua were nothing special, like the feelings he gave to everyone.

### Rainy Day

— Xie Beicheng

There was a time when I lived in Tianjin and tasted the flavor of floods for the first time. I remember that at that time, it wasn't long after the "July 7th Incident," but Tianjin had already fallen. Everyone's heart was wrapped in a layer of anxiety, waiting every day for the mimeographed newspaper to be delivered through the crack in the door (those of us who have experienced life in occupied areas naturally understand that we were forced to be mutes and forced to be deaf). The enthusiasm of those underground workers was worth thanking. Gradually, I got to know them, but this was also a very short thing. Finally, I heard that their pitiful mimeograph newspaper office had been "uncovered," and all the staff had been arrested. Some disappeared like that, and some, many days later, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, came to shake my hand and say goodbye. My mood was even more anxious than others.

One evening, sitting on a "rickshaw," I sent these "news workers" to the Zizhu Lin Wharf. I heard children singing loudly in a missionary school in the concession:

"Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!

Let our flesh and blood build our new Great Wall…"

I hadn't heard this familiar song for a long time. With tears of excitement in my eyes, I held my friends' hands:

"Bless you…"

My friends whispered back to me:

"Everyone is walking the road they should walk, and only children should be blessed!"

I remembered their words and silently walked home. In the twilight, I could still hear the children singing: "We must recover our lost territory, overthrow Japanese imperialism, and kill all the robbers of the old world!"

In this kind of anxiety, we heard other news every day: "The Qiangzi River is rising." Then it rained every day. The Qiangzi River's water got higher day by day. The flood was coming. One's own life was important, and the anxiety and shame of losing the motherland gradually faded. Instead, every household built walls, blocked doorways, and built dikes. Finally, one night, there was a great thunderstorm, and the water flooded Tianjin that night.

The place I lived was neither too high nor too low. The water only flooded the first floor. For the time being, I took the bathtub apart and sent it out through the window, temporarily using it as a means of transportation. This kind of life was naturally too boring, but it was also quite quiet. The running dogs had no way to carry out their spying tricks. Every day I tried to find a way to do something for my faraway friends, but what good could I do?

Others had already acted before me:

It was a drizzly, rainy day after the flood. Outside the window, children were hitting the water with bamboo poles, shouting:

"Another one, another one…"

"Plop!" The bamboo pole hit the water. I peeked out of the window and saw countless paper boats floating down from upstream, and they were all intercepted by the children.

Afterwards, every time I drove out in my bathtub, there were children who would secretly hand me a small piece of paper with active news from the motherland. Everything was worth looking forward to! I remembered my friend's words. Whenever there was a cloudy, rainy day, I always thought:

"Bless the children!"

### Short Note and Deep Sorrow

— Moyu

It's that long summer season of cicada song again. It's been nine years since we parted. These nine years have been such a long dream!

I love you, and I also hate you; I miss you, but at the same time, I plan to never see you again. For these nine years, you have kept me in a sweet and bewildered dream. I have already dedicated all my youth to those years of waiting for you to return; now I have left the edge of the dream and returned alone, and joy and sorrow will fade for me. I only have a contradictory and bitter mood, and the cruel memories and dream traces are deeply rooted in my memory.

You shouldn't have forgotten this annoying yet lovely rainy season! Nine years ago, when we said goodbye amidst the flames of war, the desolate rain and mist were corroding our hearts, which were filled with a faint melancholy. You and I silently walked shoulder to shoulder towards Route Picard. I stared blankly at a drop of water trembling precariously on the tip of a paulownia leaf beside the road. I told you in a low voice that this was probably a symbolic prediction of my future fate. You didn't shake your head bravely, as I had privately prayed for. Your silence gave me the feeling that I had stepped into a demon's realm; I boredly used my cold, trembling hand to wipe the mud off the corner of your clothes, and you suddenly said with hatred:

"The rainy season in Shanghai is really annoying!"

"Weren't you about to leave it?… The interior might be more worthy of longing."

These words of mine touched your imagined bright future. As you happily kissed my dimple with warm and resolute lips, the surge of passion made me unreservedly dedicate my life and blood to you in that night of heavy fog.

I have never been stingy like you in spilling hot blood into the sky of the motherland. A knight-like hero once occupied me, and I have never regretted that a brave and sincere friend like you actually abandoned me; because I knew that you had used the same bravery as you would in love to deal with your enemies, and you had also used the same sincerity as you would with a lover to be loyal to our country. What I can now caress is the last letter you sent from Hengyang. I will keep this letter as a precious gift to be buried with me, waiting for the end of my life.

I especially like to look up at the cloudy rainy season sky now, and I seem to expect to catch a glimpse of the warm projection of nine years ago that I am familiar with; I also especially like to go to the Bund to overlook the turbulent Yangtze River flowing eastward, and I seem to realize that it is the pure and unadulterated priceless sacrifice flowing out of my heart; I am now preparing to send away my remaining youth with distant memories, because this youth originally belongs to you!

The rainy season in Shanghai this year is particularly long, and the greasy rain silk always gently comforts my long-desolate heart; several times I have waded through the flood to Route Picard to retrace the lingering mud that once served as our elegy, the blue serenade passes through the quiet and deep street trees in the dusk, the night fog is still so heavy, the gloomy atmosphere that has never changed in these nine years! Do you know that I have crossed a long and bewildered dream? There are still lingering kisses on my lips, and noble and solemn enthusiasm still flows in my body, but, in the pool of my spirit, there has solidified like the chasms and deep sorrows of the nuns in the Vatican!

I hate you! Why don't you give me continuous possession in my dreams? Let me relive the brilliance and luxury of the past nine years; but at the same time, I plan to never see you again! Because I despise the fact that such a brave and exuberant soul of yours has silently withered into the soil along with the petals of spring flowers; forgetting to comfort a lonely person you once loved deeply!

The long summer season of cicada song is about to pass, and the rainy season is also about to leave my side; I have nothing to cling to in this cruel time, I quietly recite your letter, and I will eternally pray that you have an immortal and never-drying peaceful sleep!

### What I Know About Children

— Translated by Li

Published every Tuesday

This article is excerpted and introduced to wise parents and teachers from a recent work by Dr. Arnold Gesell, Director of the Child Development Institute at Yale University, published in the May 26th issue of the New York Times Sunday Magazine.

A growing child is truly the most complex organism. He must grow slowly, and he must grow on his own. We can certainly provide him with a suitable environment, but we cannot take over the work of his growth.

This growth process is most clearly manifested in the development of his motor skills. A child goes through more than twenty stages from straightening his body to learning to walk. At first, he can only lie down and lift his head, then he can crawl on his belly, then he will crawl back and forth with his hands and feet, and finally he will stand up and walk.

Similarly, children learn to use their eyes, hands, and fingers step by step. At sixteen weeks, he can only stare at the wooden block, but cannot pick it up with his hand; at twenty-eight weeks, he can clamp it up stiffly like a cat's paw; and at forty weeks, he can hold it with confidence.

This gradual development process also controls children's behavior and attitudes at different ages. For example, patting precedes pushing, drawing a straight line with chalk comes earlier than drawing a curved or oblique line, building blocks will definitely start with a tall tower and then a bridge, ungrammatical short sentences precede complete sentences, playing alone is earlier than group games, and concrete recognition is earlier than abstract concepts.

Common Mistakes

Although teachers and parents often use this natural development process to educate and train children, they do not sufficiently recognize the degree of maturity of children and the process of maturation. Often, children are severely punished simply because they are not mature enough and do not behave properly. Parents (or grandparents) in particular often get angry when their children do not eat properly. In fact, the development of eating and other daily habits depends entirely on the influence of the long-term family environment and the gradual maturation of their own abilities.

The main mistake we make in education is that we overemphasize what children "should" be like, and thus somewhat ignore what children "are" like and what they really "are." This naturally leads to our arbitrary demands and dictatorial educational methods on children.

Of course, this does not mean that we should reward children's bad behavior and indulge them. Unconditional laissez-faire would fundamentally lose the true meaning of education. However, in-depth exploration of the rules of occurrence of erroneous behaviors can help us to implement more enlightened discipline. In all training, we must be able to see ourselves and also see the child, so that our demands do not exceed the child's level of maturity.

Two to Ten Years Old

The following is a brief discussion of the general state of psychological development of children from two to ten years old:

According to the complaints of parents in infant nurseries, two and a half years old is the most confusing and annoying period. A two-and-a-half-year-old child is the most contradictory and irrational. He often makes two opposite demands at the same time: want and don't want; go and don't go; yes and no. He himself is not clear about what he wants, and therefore often easily throws tantrums. At one moment he accepts your meaning, but immediately, for no reason, he rejects it. The reason is like when he is just learning to crawl, but cannot crawl, he can only swing from side to side. A two-and-a-half-year-old child's psychology is in a swinging process of reaching balance, so there is no need to worry. By the age of three, he will become the most lovely and obedient child, and he will slowly learn to make choices.

Three years old is really the happiest period. Although so small, he is already able to master himself. Not only that, but he is also gradually learning to be likable and follow others' instructions. He will ask: "Is this how to do it?" This shows that he has already begun to consciously demand education.

New Developments

But his psychology is still developing recklessly. He will not stay in this relative state of balance for a long time. At the age of four, he will develop in new directions. He no longer cares as much about others' praise or blame as before. If you want him to obey, he will stubbornly ask you "why?" He is always trying to break free from restraints. He is considered to be lying and taking other people's things, because he is really not yet able to distinguish between fact and fantasy.

If managed well, then this outward-expanding four-year-old will slowly come to the constructive five-year-old. He accepts and demands others' guidance and is very obedient, so from the perspective of development, this is another relatively balanced stage.

However, the process of development will soon bring him to an even more troublesome period. At the age of six, he will lose that lovely temper. He becomes very irritable and argumentative, as if he is fighting with himself and with the environment all day long. Sometimes he is very suspicious, hesitant, and violently temperamental, and sometimes he is very gentle and approachable.

However, it should be pointed out here that children at this age are just beginning their school life, and teachers in schools cannot understand this important stage of child psychological development. Education that violates mental hygiene makes children even more irritable and difficult to tame.

New Balance

With normal development, by the age of seven, he will reach a new balance. He is more able to control himself than before, less impulsive, more calm, and gradually establishes feelings for teachers and classmates. He enters a state of absorption and digestion, making progress day by day.

Around the age of eight, he re-enters a period of outward expansion. He automatically comes into contact with the environment and makes friends with classmates amicably.

Thus, by the age of ten, he is more able to adapt to the environment appropriately. He is very cautious and at the same time very alert. He is fearless of anything and does everything quickly. He also likes to compete with others in schoolwork, and he is particularly receptive to knowledge about all aspects of society, and to feel prejudices of right and wrong. He is already able to participate in discussions of major social issues, such as crime, labor management, the black market, etc., so this is really a golden age for the implementation of ideological education.

### "Tomato" Rectification

— Qingyin

In Comrade Mu Yan's "Tomato" article in the previous issue, he disapproved of the tomato being called a tomato, because it is similar to a persimmon in shape, content, and color, but not to an eggplant. It would be more appropriate to call it a "Western Red Persimmon", and he said that the word "tomato" is a commonly used term.

The introduction of edible tomatoes to China is only a matter of decades. The name "tomato" may not sound fresh today because people are used to it, and the word "Western" is especially "that", but at the time when it was given a Chinese name, the word "Western" was applicable to everything foreign, and the word "eggplant" was no more suitable. Tomatoes belong to the Solanaceae family in plant classification. In Sichuan, tomatoes are called "Foreign Chili Pepper", and chili peppers also belong to the Solanaceae family. The person who named it at the time may not have known this, but his observation was accurate and gratifying. The tomatoes we can buy on the market are the most common varieties. Other varieties have many changes in color and shape, some are golden yellow, some are yellow-green, some are rose red, some are purplish red, ... some look like apples, some look like cherries, some look like mare's milk, and some really look like eggplants, ... the structure of the flowers and fruits, growth characteristics, uses, etc. are incomparable to persimmons, so I think the common name "tomato" is still worth continuing to use, until a better name is discovered.

### Are Actresses Playthings?

Mr. Hani:

I am a girl who grew up in an environment full of smog, and I don't know what is light? What is freedom? I have suffering in my heart, and there is no place to appeal. When I encounter difficult problems to solve, no one discusses with me, let alone guides me. Today, I venture to write this letter to you, please do not disappoint me and point me to a path.

I am seventeen years old this year. I have studied in a voluntary night school for a few years and know some characters. Therefore, my parents, who regard their daughter as a cash cow, always turn my mind from knowing a few characters. First, they wanted me to be a prostitute, saying that the "Long San" girl is one who sells her mouth but not her body, which is not considered vulgar. Later, after my desperate opposition, they changed their minds and wanted me to be a dancer, but I still refused to agree. So they came up with a good idea to have me learn to sing opera. There is a Yue opera actress living across the street from my house, and my mother asked her to introduce me to learn Yue opera. Now things have succeeded, and I don't know whether I should agree or resist. I often hear the teacher say: a woman's economy must be independent, but she must not be other people's plaything. I don't know if being an actress counts as a plaything, please give me a guide. Sincerely wish

You peace, Ni Caiju respectfully

Ms. Caiju:

From your graceful handwriting and smooth sentences, I know that you are a very promising woman. People who only love money and obliterate everything else are not only your parents in this flesh market in Shanghai. You are able to save yourself and are unwilling to be dominated by your parents, which is where you are stronger than others. Based on this, I think that if you cannot find another occupation that satisfies your parents for the time being, learning to sing Yue opera is not impossible. You must know that drama is originally a form of education through personal example. As long as you aspire to be a "female artist" who strives to educate the public, and not a "female actress" who follows the crowd or even sells her beauty, then learning to sing opera is also a legitimate profession. However, in the current morbid society, after you join the drama industry, you will inevitably encounter many obstacles that prevent you from moving forward smoothly. When that happens, you must take out the kind of perseverance you are now resisting your parents with to shatter your obstacles. My answer is like this, I wonder if you are satisfied? Wish

You success in your struggle! Hani

### Children's Park Suggestion to the Youth League

— Shaofu

Yesterday, our newspaper colleagues held the second fellowship garden party at the Shanghai branch of the Youth League on Jin Shenfu Road. The branch location is very large, and the garden is very clean and elegant. I had heard people say that the place was good, and the Provisional Council had also admired the cherry blossoms there. Yesterday was my first time going, and it was indeed good. It is said that it was originally the garden of the manager of Mitsui & Co. I have been to the residence of the manager of Mitsubishi & Co. on Shanzhong Road, and the scale is comparable to this. Mitsui and Mitsubishi are the largest financial groups in Japan, and their wealth and power can not only sway Japanese politics, but even the Japanese imperial family must yield three points. Now, under the control of MacArthur, this financial group system that exploited the Japanese people has been dissolved.

I browsed this garden-style mansion, small bridge, lotus pond, thatched pavilion, pacing, unable to express a kind of excitement in my heart, why do countless people in this world have no place to stand, and a few people's mansions are connected to the clouds? This large disparity is not only unreasonable, but also not the happiness of mankind, because it will cause resistance. Taking Shanghai as an example, the housing shortage seems to be very serious, but as far as I know, not every house is occupied. There are many houses that are just empty there, and the owners do not even care about gold bars. Many people live in a dozen rooms alone. This phenomenon is really ridiculous.

The garden of the branch is beautiful enough. I feel that if it is used once on an occasional occasion like now, or visited by a very small number of people, I suggest that the Youth League authorities open it to the public, it is better to change it to a children's cultural park. I have the following reasons for this suggestion:

First, to make children often approach the Youth League, have an impression of the Youth League, and gradually become loyal members of the Youth League when they grow up;

Second, the Youth League itself should also do work for children's welfare. Now, using this existing place, without spending money, it can be said to be beneficial without being wasteful

Third, a minimum amount of tickets can be charged as a cleaning fee for the garden.

I don't know if this suggestion can be adopted by the wise Youth League authorities?

### Jeep Cars Disregard People's Lives!

— Duyun

A few days ago, our landlady, Mrs. Yao, returned from visiting her relatives. When passing near the Queen's Theater on Tibet Road, she saw a Jeep recklessly crashing and not driving according to regulations. It went on the left and came from the way it was going. The bright lights were like the two giant eyes of a tiger. People were afraid when they saw it. An oncoming car could not dodge in time, grazed the side of the Jeep, and overturned. Both the car and the people overturned. The car was thrown to the side of the sidewalk, and the driver was groaning on the road. Two passengers were thrown onto the sidewalk. Fortunately, the driver struggled to stand up, and the passengers had facial bleeding, but the injuries were not very serious. A passerby said to him: "It doesn't matter, go back and bandage it"!

Unexpectedly, before he finished speaking, a three-wheeled car facing forward was hit head-on by the Jeep. The car overturned, and the passenger was crushed by the car body, with blood and flesh blurred. He was lying on the ground, and he seemed to be in pain, and he was still touching his face with his hands. After a while, he died. The man was about twenty years old, wearing a neat Hong Kong shirt, suit pants, a watch and a gold ring, and a Parker gold pen in his pocket. In the end, he bled too much to be saved, alas! Even the driver could not be found. It turned out that he was crushed under the car and died too!

When the tragedy occurred, it was past midnight. For a time, the audience gathered and surrounded the car. Police sirens blared, and the police rushed over. The two American soldiers in the car locked the car doors tightly and smoked cigarettes calmly. The police asked him why he was driving so crazily and reprimanded him a few times, but there was no follow-up. The audience just stared angrily. Mrs. Yao also came back.

The young man who was killed may have been returning from a dance hall, and disaster struck, and joy turned to sorrow. But ordinary people cannot be an exception. The lack of safety in transportation is becoming a fear for Shanghai residents. But the American soldiers did not intentionally hurt people. They must have been drunk and had no control, and were driving the vehicle recklessly, but there is no doubt that they should bear the fault of killing people! It is said that the soldiers who caused the accident were escorted back to their country by their officers for punishment; but if a way to punish the past is not thought of, the traffic in Shanghai is really too dangerous!

### The "Face" Problem

— Yiyi

It seems a bit incongruous to write about face and traffic together. In fact, it is precisely a kind of morbidity in the city's current traffic. If we want to rectify the city's traffic, we should not avoid treating the disease.

Some people may ask, what is this morbidity like? For example: "speeding", "parallel overtaking", "running red lights", are considered to be having "face" by general drivers! Naturally, what they call having "face" is because the driver is a person with "face", or his driver, using his "face", will not be willing to fall behind, and will not be willing to be bound by the prescribed speed and red lights, and will drive the vehicle as he wants! Anyway, if you violate the rules and cause an accident, there is "face" that can turn big things into small things, and small things into nothing. Therefore, you are like this, and I am like that. Even if there are traffic management rules and regulations that stipulate the methods of banning and punishing, if "face" is not removed, it is equivalent to being a written document!

In fact, people who do not abide by the rules and regulations and disrupt the good order are the most shameless. Not only does he not have face personally, but also causes the country to lose face!

### This Trend Should Not Be Encouraged

— Suobei

It may be excusable for a tram to not stop at a station, because some passengers are too "only care about themselves and not others." But the "terminus sign" at the east end is often wrong, clearly going to the Bund, but still hanging "Jing'an Temple", this has to be said to be: "demolition of rotten dirt"!

The original good habits, such as giving up seats and maintaining order, no longer exist; what has replaced them is having me and no one, selfishness and self-interest, getting on and off the car generally climbing in and out of the windows, which is sad! This action is mostly out of "strong currents"; they think that this is "heroic", but it is actually "picnicking"!

We call on: for the integrity of the country's face, this trend should not be encouraged!

People in the car are irritable and prone to temper. If they disagree, they will open their mouths to scold people and start hitting people. They cannot travel together! In "civilized" society, this trend should not be encouraged!

One mouth has two skins, and reason is always right. Getting something for free today is said to be very grand. The most common reason is: "Anyway, it's getting something for free from foreigners"!

Such a mentality, in a word: has no future!

This trend should not be encouraged!

### Intelligent People Do Not Give Up Eating Because of Choking, and the Number of Route Trams Should Not Be Reduced.

— Yanzi

On the seventeenth, Mr. Shaofu wrote an article about trams, saying that his relatives waited for Route 1 tram on Nanjing Road. Once it took 50 minutes, and once it took 30 minutes, but they did not wait, and they lamented that time was wasted.

It is said that the reason why there are so few Route 1 trams is because the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company felt that the wind of getting something for free was too great among the passengers on North Sichuan Road. They are all strong currents. Although the authorities posted imperial announcements in the car, telling them to buy tickets like ordinary passengers, they still ignored it and turned a blind eye. The tram company came up with such a passive countermeasure because they had no way to deal with it themselves and the authorities were powerless: reduce the number of vehicles and reduce losses. They would rather abolish Route 1. The few remaining vehicles are still perfunctory, and it is already a great favor to those who travel to and from Jing'an Temple and North Sichuan Road.

This method of the tram company is certainly the best policy for its rights! But he forgot his obligation to society. From the standpoint of society, it is strange that the British would completely put public utilities on the point of view of individualism! It is strange and regrettable! What is especially strange and regrettable is that the person in charge of Shanghai public utilities also turned a blind eye, and kept silent, forgetting what he was in charge of. Today's North Sichuan Road is very different from the prosperous situation in the autumn and winter last year. After the initial victory, the enemy nationals here, whether shops or residents, gathered one after another. Many shops along the street were closed, and for a time it felt barren. Reducing the number of trams seemed to have little relationship. Now, the Chinese have moved in one after another, so North Sichuan Road has restored its former prosperity, with a bustling crowd and an unusually lively atmosphere. Moreover, Zhongzheng Park is at the bottom of North Sichuan Road, and the swimming pool there has recently reopened. The improvement of tram traffic on North Sichuan Road is even more urgent. I wonder if the British tram company knows this situation? Do the public authorities know this situation?

If someone asks, how would you be satisfied if we improve it? Then I will bring up the old story again: before the war, I lived in Jing'an Temple for more than a year, and the office was at the bottom of North Sichuan Road. I took the Route 1 tram every day to go out in the morning and return in the evening. The full fare was 18 copper coins, and the time was 45 minutes. There were trams available at any time, even if you had to wait sometimes, it would not exceed 10 minutes at most. Today's requirements, in addition to the fare, the remaining two points can be used as a reference for the authorities. Do you say this is extravagant?

### Hope

— Hu Deling

Now taking the tram, from the perspective of passengers, is simply suffering: there are few vehicles and many passengers, which is obviously crowded. It is common to wait for two or thirty minutes without getting on the bus. If a tram comes, people rush to get on first and grab seats. The order is chaotic. Either their feet are trampled, their clothes are torn, or their pocket money is lost. The weather is hot, and many people are crowded together. Those who do not know each other also smoke cigarettes. The smell of smoke and sweat is particularly stuffy and uncomfortable.

I hope that: passengers should love themselves, line up to get on the bus, and no one should be an exception, so as to avoid the pain of being trampled on the bus. By proceeding in an orderly manner, pickpockets cannot start, which benefits oneself and others. Prepare the fare before getting on the bus, saving the conductor the trouble of finding change. Smoking is strictly prohibited on trams, paying attention to public health!

On the company's side, new cars should be added and put into service. The number of vehicles should be appropriately allocated according to the needs of each line. Damaged vehicles should be repaired as soon as possible, so that everything can be used to its fullest.

### It's Hard to Live, and It's Not Easy to Get Around

— Lan Tian

Let me first talk about my experience:

The trolley from Tilanqiao to the Bund is a route I often take and must take. Because Tilanqiao is the Jewish district, there are relatively many blue-eyed and yellow-bearded people coming and going. Although they are a nation without a country, their orderly style of queuing and waiting for the bus is still commendable. Therefore, at the starting point of this station, the "demeanor of a great nation" can sometimes be surprisingly "remarkable." However, sometimes there are fewer trolleys and more people. What to do? Needless to say, it's naturally crowded. It is common for the trolley to be unable to move for a long time. At this time, those "gentlemen" become "bitter oranges from Huaibei." Those who are weak and timid have to give way and wait for the next bit of luck!

Recently, fights have been very common. Ticket sellers and drivers seem to enjoy fighting as much as "Xiao Laotou in 'Killing the Fish Family' loves wearing new shoes for the New Year." The trolley stopped due to a fight obstructs the trolleys behind and congests all the trolleys around—of course, all this goes without saying.

At around four o'clock in the afternoon on the nineteenth, I took a trolley from Tilanqiao to Nanjing Road Bund. The ticket seller and the driver stopped the trolley and went down to fight with someone. I had to get off and walk. I walked to Zhongzheng Road Bund, and the trolley that was fighting had not caught up yet. Aren't all the passengers waiting at the Shiliupu station pointlessly "waiting anxiously"?

It's hard to live, and it's not easy to get around, alas, Shanghai!

Short Comments

### Corrupt Magistrate Retires, Finds a Way to Change Careers

— Wuling Ren

Some escaped villains believe that after a long time, there will be no problems. This is simply wishful thinking. But look at Xue Genghua, who once served as the head of the puppet Huangpu Police Bureau and the leader of the intelligence team at "76," who fled to North China after the victory and was finally arrested and sent back to Shanghai recently after nearly a year. This proves that the authorities will never relax their punishment of traitors, which is like a shot of stimulant for the people.

The chief female prosecutor of the Wujin Court Prosecutor's Office prosecuted the president of the court for crimes of corruption and dereliction of duty, which is both gratifying and heartbreaking. What is gratifying is that this chief prosecutor broke the bad habit of officials protecting each other, handled cases impartially, and was unyielding. What is heartbreaking is that the case of prosecuting corruption occurred within the court itself.

A magistrate who was removed from office due to corruption organized a news enterprise company with a capital of 20 million yuan. If this company publishes a newspaper, it should be particularly detailed, accurate, and reliable about general corruption news, unless it doesn't mention a word.

Yu Xiangyan, in the road bureau fraud case, has not yet been arrested and brought to justice. It is denied that there is no need to pursue the arrest. The weather is not so hot that it is possible to save trouble, because she repeatedly said in her letters: "As soon as I recover from my illness, I will definitely turn myself in."

A woman came to the crowd, begging to buy the oranges she was carrying,絮絮言其家境之貧苦，「丈夫兒子都被炸死了，家中還有一婆婆」...，I wanted to ask her why she didn't go to work in a factory, but then I thought it was like joking with her. Workers returning from the rear haven't found work, and there are many workers who have lost their original jobs. Where are there factories that can accommodate her to work? Therefore, I stopped myself from speaking and gave her 1,500 yuan very emotionally, buying three small oranges.

### It's Hard for Country Folk

— Ying Xiang

Crossing the road, taking a bus, bumping into walls everywhere, being scolded everywhere.

I am from Tunxi coming to Shanghai. I only feel dizzy from the colorful sights. The country bumpkin seeing the city slicker is a small wizard meeting a great wizard. I feel like a country bumpkin.

One day, I crossed the road, waiting from the red light to the green light and standing for a while before crossing. As I walked across, a rickshaw came horizontally from the left, unexpectedly hitting me and making my eyes go dark. I also heard the phrase "pig head."

One day, I took trolley number one from Haining Road to Qiujiang Road. The trolley was so crowded that it was airtight. I was squeezed on from the back, so of course I had to stand at the door. When the trolley had not yet stopped at Qiujiang Road, the door was already open. I was urged by the passengers and the ticket seller to jump down. I fell and my hands and feet were bleeding, and I was also called "innocent."

Another day, I took a bus from the Great World to Tongfu Road. When getting on the bus, a stack of thousand-yuan bills went away with a dark-glassed, short-dressed friend in the pushing and shoving. I noticed and shouted that there was a pickpocket. The bus arrived at the Mahuo Road stop. He jumped out of the bus and turned his head back and scolded, "stir-fried spicy stuffing." Today, on the way from Daxin Street to Beijing Road on a trackless trolley, a fountain pen disappeared again. I hated it very much. Are country folk repeatedly bullied? I couldn't help but lose my temper in our local dialect. Some of the passengers laughed, and the ticket seller said softly, "thirteen o'clock."

One evening, passing by Zhongzheng Road, a flirtatious woman followed me and said, "Want to play?" I loudly asked what she wanted. She pushed me and said, "Ah-mu-lin" (idiot).

I have learned a lot of Shanghai dialects this way. Is it that I, this country bumpkin, deserve to be scolded, or are country folk being bullied? Please enlighten the readers "me ni"!

### Miscellaneous Poems on Current Affairs

— Wu Daquan

Strikes, government employee strikes, teacher strikes, followed by sales boycotts—even rice has grown legs, not knowing where it has crawled to.

This is called "everyone can do magic tricks, but each has their own skill." The unlucky ones are us viewers, who can only stare at the wide-open rice baskets, helplessly.

China's ailments are strange and peculiar. This is not the only one. It is just one of the thousands upon thousands, the freshest of the thousands upon thousands.

This disease, this continuous and stubborn disease, this disease that plunges China into weakness, foreign doctors are also shaking their heads at it repeatedly. They suspect that the "democracy" trademarks are covering up man-made internal strife. May I ask the "democracy merchants" of political speculation: They seem to want to take back the strong stimulant that supports our hopes—Special Envoy Marshall.

Could it be that the people of the Republic of China can only swallow DDT?

### Sent to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (16)

— Zhou Shoujuan

There is another thing that I consider a great regret, which is that in the summer of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, because the bungalow we lived in had been around for a long time and was becoming dilapidated, and it was filled with the memory of our deceased son Rong, which made us miserable. Therefore, we hired workers to tear it down and rebuild it into a building; who knew that on August 13th, the tyrannical Japanese invaded, and the workers scattered. We had to abandon it halfway, only building a few walls, which aptly fulfilled the old saying "a family with only four walls." For nine years, due to limited finances, we have repeatedly delayed it, and it is covered with vines and weeds, looking like the ruins of Pompeii or the ruins of the Old Summer Palace. It is only for our family to look up and down and reminisce! After we came back, we lived in the three wooden sheds that were built for the children to stay in temporarily, which was truly what is called "slum dwellers." It's pitiful that you lived cramped in this wooden shed, although the interior was still arranged neatly, it inevitably felt like being blown by wind and rain; and on April 23rd, you quietly breathed your last in this wooden shed, not even finding a proper place to die. It really makes me feel guilty and 120 times sorry to you. Your spiritual tablet is set up in the temporary living room in the middle. This is a place that has been tugging at my heartstrings for the past month. During the twelve hours of the day, I knock the chime when I go out and call your name; I knock the chime when I come in and call your name. Every morning, I first offer you a cigarette, then light incense, and offer tea, washing water, breakfast, and fruit one by one before your portrait and ancestral tablet; I also always have to go to the garden to see what new flowers have bloomed, and put them in the three ancient porcelain vases on your left and right and in front, replacing them as they wither, with constant fragrance until now; this is my daily morning routine, and I will not forget it. At noon, I offer rice and dishes as usual, choosing some of the things you liked to eat during your lifetime; you said when you were sick that you liked the new broad beans and the spring bamboo shoots from the garden the most in the spring, and when the bamboo shoots and broad beans were on the market, your body would get better, and you could eat a bowl and a half of rice as usual. I was very happy to hear this, so I asked the old farmer in the garden across the street to pay attention to the growth of the new broad beans for me. Who knew they grew too late, and you couldn't wait to taste them; until the day everyone ate at the Renji Funeral Home. I saw a plate of green new broad beans on the table, which really made my stomach ache and my heart sour, and I couldn't eat it anymore! From that day on, in addition to offering one or two bowls of fish and meat at lunch, there was always a dish of bamboo shoots stir-fried with new broad beans, and this year there were especially many bamboo shoots in the bamboo forest, so every day there were bamboo shoots and broad beans, without interruption until the market ended. I don't know how your appetite is in the underworld? Are you tired of eating them? As for the cigarette after dinner and the snack around four o'clock, offering a cup of milk powder and bread and pastries, I can't forget your favorite bayberry jam, and I always have to spread it on bread to offer you, but whether you can eat it or not is another vague thing that cannot be investigated.

In the first few days of the initial mourning, all four daughters were observing mourning. They could still cry for you every day, but on the day following the first seventh day and the second seventh day, only Bao Mei and Ye Ma cried for you. Although there were noisy Taoists chanting sutras and playing cymbals, they could not cover up the bleak and lonely atmosphere; watching Yun Er wearing white clothes like snow, prostrating alone before the coffin, I couldn't help but shed tears, and hurriedly hid in the farthest corner of the garden. After that, Bao Mei returned to Shanghai, so for the third seventh day and the fourth seventh day, only Ye Ma cried for you, crying so sadly that I was always sad and shed tears beside her. On the eve of the fifth seventh day on May 27th, Bao Mei, Zheng Er, and Mei Er all came back, and invited seven monks from Guanyin Hall to perform a Buddhist service called "paving the blood river"; the next day, they chanted sutras all day long, not daring to set up offerings to disturb relatives and friends; but Zhang Zhenhou and his wife specially rushed from Shanghai to offer incense and pay their respects to you, and the highly respected Zou Jing Lao did not forget this day either, and graciously came. Such high friendship and deep affection will be engraved in my heart for the rest of my life.
