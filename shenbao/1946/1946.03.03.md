### Soviet Transport of Northeastern Industrial Equipment; U.S. Declares Non-Recognition; Disposition of Japanese Assets Abroad Under Discussion with Relevant Countries

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 1st] A spokesman stated today that news reports from the Northeast indicating that the Soviet Union is transporting so-called "war booty" from the region have prompted the United States to express its concern to the Soviet government. The spokesman said that the U.S. began discussing this matter with the Soviet government through the U.S. Embassy in Moscow about three weeks ago, and has recently started discussions with the governments of other related countries, without specifying which governments. The spokesman pointed out that these discussions do not mean that the U.S. has received confirmation of the Soviet Union's removal of so-called war booty, as the U.S. has not received direct intelligence on this matter, nor has it been officially informed of the actual situation. The State Department issued the following statement on the matter: "We have no secret or other agreements with the Soviet government or any other government regarding 'war booty' in the Northeast. The U.S. government does not recognize the interpretation of 'war booty' as including industrial or organizational elements, such as Japanese industries and equipment in the Northeast. Some time ago, we notified the Soviet government that the disposition of Japanese assets abroad, such as industries in the Northeast, is a matter of common interest and concerns all Allied nations that bore a greater burden in defeating Japan. During this period, it would be inappropriate to treat such industrial assets as 'war booty' and transport them from the Northeast, or for China and the Soviet Union to make any final disposition of Japanese assets abroad in the Northeast through agreements on the control of such assets. The U.S. government has recently begun discussing the issue of how to dispose of Japanese assets abroad as reparations with the governments concerned."

[United Press, Peiping, 2nd] The U.S. State Department's announcement that the United States does not recognize the Soviet Union's seizure of Japanese industrial equipment in the three eastern provinces of China as "war booty" has been welcomed by Chinese figures in Chongqing. They believe that this announcement proves that the United States will adopt a firmer policy towards the Soviet Union regarding the Sino-Soviet dispute in the Northeast, and are therefore greatly encouraged. Currently, the main hope of people here is that China can re-establish its sovereignty in the Northeast without hindrance, as Chairman Chiang recently instructed the Northeast Headquarters, clarifying that the principle of negotiations with the Soviet Union is that China will not accept any demands that infringe upon Chinese sovereignty.

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] Former Director of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, Donovan, said in a speech last night at the Overseas Press Club that the United States overestimated the strength of the Japanese army in Northeast China, resulting in the United Nations giving the Soviet Union too much reward for its participation in the war against Japan. Donovan stated that the secret agreement on rewards to the Soviet Union made at the Yalta Conference to get the Soviet Union to participate in the war against Japan was signed because the U.S. lacked intelligence on the Japanese Kwantung Army.

### Earnest Review of Party Affairs; Committee Members Speak Frankly; Second Plenary Session Holds Two General Meetings Yesterday

No general meeting has ever been so frank and thorough in its discussions as this afternoon, which is historically significant.

Until the lights were all on, the chairman announced that the party affairs report would be reviewed by Pan Gongzhan, He Zhonghan, Deng Xipeng, and others.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The first general meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 2nd. 226 members of the Executive Committee, including Yu Youren and Dai Chuanxian, and 80 members of the Supervisory Committee, including Wu Jingheng and Wang Chonghui, attended. The meeting was presided over by Committee Member Yu Youren. After the meeting began as scheduled, the chairman announced that the whole body should stand in silence to pay tribute to the officers and soldiers who died in the national war of resistance and to the compatriots who died in the disaster. Then, the Secretariat reported the number of attendees, read out the records of the preparatory meeting, and reported on letters and telegrams of leave requests from committee members. The Presidium then reported on the meeting dates, agenda, and other matters.

At 10:00 a.m., the Chairman announced a break for 15 minutes, after which the meeting continued. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng made a report on party affairs, which lasted 55 minutes. The meeting adjourned at 11:40 a.m.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Second Plenary Session held its second general meeting at 3:20 p.m. on the 2nd. Chairman Chuanxian announced a review of the Party report, soliciting opinions from the committee members. Eighteen people spoke, making extremely frank criticisms of the merits and demerits of the Party, and elaborating on ways to improve in the future. The enthusiasm was unprecedented in previous meetings. The discussion ended at approximately 6 p.m. After Chairman Wang Xuanqian began the review, Ren Zhuoyi was the first to speak. He pointed out the shortcomings of military training propaganda and mass movements, and believed that it was necessary to prevent the erosion of bureaucracy. Li Jingzhai said that the Party must pay attention to the suffering of the people. Gu Zhengding advocated strengthening democratic practices and party leadership, and eliminating wavering elements within the party. Hu Jianzhong said that work should be improved, as facts are powerful propaganda for resolving various contradictions. Miao Peicheng spoke broadly on foreign policy, advocating open research. Huang Yuren emphasized the necessity of party innovation, unity and democracy, and questioned the implementation of the resolutions of the Sixth National Congress and the First Plenary Session. Wu Tiecheng advocated strict party discipline. Luo Gonghua said that the Three People's Principles had not been successful, and that civil rights and people's livelihood still needed to be worked on. Gesang Zeren raised opinions on border issues. Deng Feihuang used his limited experience in his youth thirty years ago to conduct a rigorous review of the Party. Xiao Zheng demanded a thorough review of the Party's system and personnel to clarify the gains, losses and responsibilities. At this point in the review, the chairman announced a fifteen-minute break. The meeting continued at five o'clock, and the committee members continued to speak. Liu Chengcan described the difficulties of local people's livelihoods and said that they should be improved quickly. Chen Zhaoying reported that the morale of comrades in various places was extremely high, which was encouraging, but the treatment of public officials at all levels was meager, and methods should be found to solve the difficulties. Deng Wenyi explained the composition of party members and the transfer of party members in the army. Hu Qiuyuan proposed a sense of responsibility and talent-based theory as the primary conditions for improving party affairs. Gu Zhenggang gave a summary of the Party's form, nature, and foundation, and said that saving the country must first save the Party, and a revolutionary spirit should be used to oppose counter-revolutionary forces. Peng Zhaoxian analyzed the current internal and external environment, and made a frank review of the relationship between the Party and the government, the Party and party members, and the Party and the people. Finally, Chen Yiyun pointed out the emptiness of the Executive Yuan's report, and that the failure to protect women's rights during the war of resistance was unsatisfactory. By this time it was 6 p.m. The chairman announced the cessation of speeches and handed the party affairs report and the opinions of the committee members over for review, and then proposed the list of the Party Affairs Review Committee and adjourned the meeting. The third general meeting on the morning of the 3rd reported on the surrender situation and made a review, and rested in the afternoon.

### Sun Ke Delayed in Shanghai Due to Rain; Rescheduled to Fly to Chongqing This Morning

[This City News] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong and was originally scheduled to fly to Chongqing the day before yesterday to attend the Second Plenary Session, but he was unable to travel due to continuous spring rain. With good weather this morning, he will soon fly to Chongqing. Yesterday morning, a reporter visited President Sun at his residence. First, they discussed the issue of the draft constitution. President Sun said: The constitution of a democratic country should be changed according to the different times and environments. Many provisions of the current draft constitution are out of date, so many places need to be added and revised. For example, one of the laws established before the war stipulated that the authorities in various places must transfer the criminals they captured to the judicial organs for handling within 24 hours, but this has not yet been implemented because there is a restriction in the supplementary provisions. In the future, this supplementary provision should be cancelled to promote its implementation. When the reporter asked about the Northeast issue, President Sun said: The reason why the Northeast has become a problem is because there is a problem with domestic unity. Regarding the Jiaochangkou Incident, President Sun was unwilling to say much, considering it a disgraceful matter.

Sales will begin within days and are scheduled to end by the end of the month. Most are daily necessities.

### Northeast Issue Expected to Make Progress; Xiong Shihui and Others to Leave Chongqing Soon; Zhang Jia'ao to Fly to Changchun with New Proposal

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 2nd] Chongqing News: It is generally believed here that Soviet Ambassador Petrov's visit to Foreign Minister Wang the other day may bring new developments to the future of the Northeast issue. Also, Northeast Headquarters Director Xiong Shihui is said to be flying back to Jinzhou from Peiping within days. In addition, Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Economic Commission of the Northeast Headquarters, will fly to Changchun within days. It is said that this trip carries a new proposal drafted by our government, which may give the Soviet side considerable concessions in terms of capital and technology.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 28th] (Delayed) Zhang Zhizhong stated: The Soviet Union will definitely withdraw its troops, and the time is not far away. Military issues in the Northeast other than troop reorganization are expected to be resolved after this inspection of various places in North China upon return to Chongqing. In the future, the Military Mediation Department will send personnel to work in the Northeast. Before leaving Chongqing, Marshall had intended to inspect Shenyang, but it has been postponed due to the immaturity of the timing.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] The Soviet Union's recent announcement of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast has attracted much attention from all parties. However, the authorities have not received any reports of the Soviet army withdrawing. According to news from the Northeast, there are no signs of the Soviet army withdrawing, and newly mobilized troops are distributed in Harbin, Lushun, Dalian and other places. The Soviet Union's announcement is a propaganda effort to ease the patriotic sentiments of our people. Its intentions should be recognized by the people of the country. According to general observation, if the Soviet army does not withdraw, it will be a violation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty, and all responsibility will be borne by the Soviet side. Various groups in the accompanying capital are urging our government to seriously negotiate with the Soviet side on the withdrawal of troops.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 2nd] The Kunming City Council, due to the repeated postponements of the Soviet army in the Northeast, telegraphed the National Government today to seriously negotiate and declared that our country is not bound by the Yalta Secret Agreement.

### People from All Walks of Life in Shijiazhuang Hold Mass Rally

[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 2nd] This morning, people from all walks of life in this city held a patriotic mass rally and demonstration parade, shouting slogans along the way such as "Defend the Northeast" and "Uphold the Integrity of Territorial Sovereignty."

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 2nd] Zhenjiang News: Students from elementary and middle schools in Zhenjiang held a patriotic movement parade on the 1st due to the delayed withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast, shouting slogans such as "Defend Northeast Sovereignty" and distributing leaflets along the way.

### Zhang Xinfu's Remains Arrive in Shenyang

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 1st] Zhang Xinfu's body arrived in Shenyang today, transported from Fushun by the Soviet side. Mayor Dong Wenqi, together with Soviet Deputy City Defense Commander Sliecki, went to inspect. The body was placed in a coffin, covered with black silk cloth. Zhang was an old friend of Dong. After Dong carefully inspected, he confirmed that it was Zhang's body. The remains are temporarily placed in the Guandi Temple here. It is said that the transportation of Zhang's body to Shenyang was the result of several negotiations by our military delegation. The bodies of those who died at the same time as Zhang have not yet been transported.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Yu Xi schools students in Chongqing held a memorial meeting for Zhang Xinfu and other seven gentlemen today in the auditorium of Shapingba Middle School.

### Military Spokesperson Refutes Rumors

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] According to a statement issued by the military spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission on the 2nd: The Xinhua Daily published a telegram from the Northeast on March 1 today, falsely claiming that "Du Yuming shot and killed 29 CCP members including Guo Yachen in Tongliao." After investigation, the report has no factual basis. So far, the National Army that entered the Northeast has only reached Zhangwu, more than 140 kilometers away from Tongliao. Since the National Army has not arrived in Tongliao, the newspaper's false accusation that Commander Du shot and killed CCP members in Tongliao is self-evident. The troops sent by the government to the Northeast are all formal National Army troops, and there is no so-called Guang Division, nor are there any Seventh Division of the First Army and Division Commander Zhou Xuwu. The Xinhua Daily did not investigate the facts and deliberately fabricated rumors, which is inappropriate.

Zhang Zhizhong said: In the future, the Shandong situation should be based on the spirit of mutual trust and mutual concession, and sincere cooperation. Zhou Enlai said: Now that some major problems have been solved, there should be no difficulty in solving minor problems. After thanking the Jinan Group, Marshall used baseball as an example, saying that although the U.S. is not an umpire, it should inform both sides of the baseball rules and ethics that should be followed. Marshall also said: Now that Generals Wang Yaowu and Chen Yi have met, they will surely be able to cooperate in Shandong in the future. Subsequently, Zhang Zhizhong convened the military and political leaders of the government side, and Zhou Enlai convened the military and political leaders of the Communist Party, respectively, for talks.

The agreement we have reached is an agreement that both parties can agree to. We will not discuss who was right and who was wrong in the past, but only do what should be done now. I wish China an unlimited future. Those who participated in the banquet included Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall and their entourage, government and CCP officials in charge of military and political affairs in Shandong, and U.S. personnel.

### From Shanghai to Qinhuangdao (2)

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao

—Six Days at Sea Following the Northern Expedition with the Army—

Local prices are quite high. White flour is more than 300 yuan per jin, rice is 4,600 yuan per dou, glutinous rice is 3,600 yuan per dou (each dou is 16 jin), pork and beef are 400 yuan per jin, vermicelli is 400 to 460 yuan per jin, lump coal is 20,000 yuan per ton, crushed coal is 10,000 yuan, Lao Dao and Hademen cigarettes are 160 yuan a small box. Other daily necessities are also priced twice as high as in Shanghai. "Puppet United Reserve Bank" currency is still in general circulation, with an exchange rate of five yuan for one yuan of national currency. Many businessmen leave through this port to purchase goods in Shenyang for significant profits because prices in Shenyang are low. Therefore, trains going north are extremely crowded. The journey from here to Tianjin is even more packed. Train fares are very cheap, with a ticket from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin costing only 400 to 500 yuan in national currency.

In terms of administrative division, it is under a place in the Linjian County. The county government has an office in Qinhuangdao. The population is over 20,000, and education is relatively developed. There is a county-run junior high school in the city, divided into middle and elementary school sections for both boys and girls, totaling over 1,000 students. There are also six or seven public and private elementary schools, each with an average of 300 students. The elementary schools have already started on the 21st, and the county middle school is scheduled to open on the 25th due to the presence of troops.

Several people in the education field told the reporter: "The education community in the occupied areas suffered greatly during the past eight years. In North China, with very few exceptions, they endured humiliation and steadfastly defended themselves, making significant contributions to maintaining the lifeline of national education. All students were able to concentrate on their studies and avoid external affairs. After the recovery of the country, they should have been rewarded. However, not only is this not the case today, but the term 'puppet' is added to teachers and students, which is quite infuriating and disheartening."

The garrison of Qinhuangdao is currently the responsibility of the New Sixth Army and the security forces. At the docks, the US Marine Corps is responsible for police affairs and maintaining order. It is reported that the US Navy has also sent Marines to several other northern ports to perform temporary guard duties.

The US Navy landing ships that helped us transport the New Sixth Army, the Youth Army, and the New First Army (most of the New First Army arrived in Qinhuangdao on the 25th and immediately headed north) belong to the 78th and 14th Squadrons, commanded by Colonel Mennes. They are famous ships that participated in the landing operations on Iwo Jima and the Philippines. Many still have painted markings on the command deck showing the number of Japanese aircraft shot down and Japanese ships sunk.

The ships are equipped with small cannons, machine guns, and anti-aircraft machine guns. The bow of the ship has electrically operated iron gates to allow tanks, armored vehicles, jeeps, and personnel to enter and exit the cabin. Our soldiers rested in this large cabin, about 40 zhang long, and could walk up to the deck via a large staircase, which could also be raised or lowered electrically. Each side of the ship has cabin windows, each fitted with forty-one hammocks, as well as toilets, showers, medical rooms, etc. They gave up one side to our officers of all ranks, while the crew's living arrangements were mostly at the rear of the ship.

The American crew members of each ship are energetic and responsible in their work. However, due to differences in customs and our extreme poverty, many unpleasant incidents occurred between the two sides. The No. 596 ship, which the reporter first boarded, can be taken as an example.

On the first day of boarding, the ship insisted that our soldiers unload their guns, tie them up in batches, and send them to the ammunition depot along with the gunpowder, because accidents involving munitions and weapons had occurred during previous transports. We had no choice but to abandon the "guns should always be with the soldiers" rule and follow their regulations.

A new type of submachine gun carried by a battalion commander's attendant was taken away by an American sailor and disappeared without a trace. After much negotiation, only a certificate was issued by the captain when changing ships, stating that it had been "taken and lost by his subordinates."

In addition, many unpleasant things happened regarding cooking, toilets, water usage, and other activities. During this period, a lieutenant liaison officer dispatched by the US military, accompanied by a Chinese translator, conveyed the opinions of both sides or answered questions. Because the US Army authorities agreed to be responsible for transporting the National Army northward, they later requested the Navy to handle it due to the inconvenience of airplanes. Therefore, the liaison officers sent by the US Army could not make many decisions. The liaison officer on the landing ship I boarded was Graftoa, who was very enthusiastic and responsible.

The opinion of our troops is that the American Navy personnel and sailors are executing the orders of their superiors and assisting us in transportation. They can only help technically and cannot interfere with or direct our actions. Also, in the event of an accident or if they believe something is inappropriate, they can negotiate and discuss it with our troop commander and cannot make arbitrary decisions.

This time, the reporter followed the army on the ship for six days, sailing for three days and three nights. I have many thoughts that are difficult to describe in full. Today, I would like to write about some urgent issues that the authorities and everyone have a responsibility to improve and implement together: First, our marching diet is too difficult. It requires cooking on the spot at any time, which is cumbersome, time-consuming, dirty, uneconomical, and does not provide enough nutrition. Therefore, we must adopt the advantages of others and manufacture marching rations suitable for us, especially when traveling by train and ship.

Secondly, soldiers' compensation still needs to be reasonably addressed, because the current income is too far from other sectors of society. Also, the equipment in the military is still very poor. Both mental and material conditions are depressing, which is a great loss to the health and morale of the soldiers.

Thirdly, all actions need to thoroughly implement the New Life Movement. Agility and cleanliness need to be thoroughly implemented by everyone. This time, the Youth Army generally did well on the ship. Although the crew was still dissatisfied with spitting and urination, they were better than the general public who spit and urinate everywhere. In addition, the Youth Army was dusted with delousing powder upon boarding and sprayed with disinfectant once on the ship.

Leaving the mouth of Wusong, we rarely saw our ships. What we saw were the numerous sails on the river and the isolated sails on the sea. On the contrary, foreign ships came and went. The authorities and all compatriots must work together to help the country build merchant ships. It is too dangerous to rely entirely on others. In particular, I hope that speculators will not circle around manipulating prices but broaden their horizons and look further ahead! (February 25th, Qinhuangdao)

### Franco Remains Unrepentant, Deploys 200,000 Troops on Spanish Border, Vowing to Safeguard Security at Any Cost

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 2nd Broadcasting: After convening an emergency meeting today, the Spanish Cabinet issued a declaration by Franco, stating that the current deterioration in relations between France and Spain is entirely due to "Communist elements stirring up trouble." It also stated: "Red terror is spreading, forcing Spain to seal the borders between France and Spain." Franco claimed: "Communist elements are now supplying weapons to Spanish guerrillas, attempting to overthrow the current regime." Franco also denounced "attempts by certain countries to overthrow the Spanish regime." He also stated: "Spain will defend its national security at any cost."

According to a Paris dispatch, Franco has deployed 200,000 troops on the French-Spanish border.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 2nd Broadcasting: The Spanish people's resistance to the Franco regime is intensifying, especially the activities of the guerrillas. The guerrillas are spread throughout the country, and their traces can even be found in Madrid. It is reported that Franco has decided to take terror measures to cope with the current domestic crisis. In order to maintain the Fascist foundation, Franco intends to carry out a restoration under the "guise of democracy."

[Associated Press Madrid Dispatch, 2nd] The Spanish Franco government today pointed out that France's closure of the Spanish border is the responsibility of the "Communist group that listens to foreign slogans." A statement issued by the Spanish Cabinet stated that the Spanish government "holds an unwavering heart, is determined to maintain order, and guarantees national security, knowing that this is an expression of the unanimous feelings of all the Spanish people. At the same time, it calls on the conscience of all to oppose this unprecedented movement, which attempts to plunge an orderly and peaceful country into chaos and unrest by the worst means. This country adheres to international obligations and does not lag behind others." The statement also stated that the "movement" against Spain was launched as a protest against the recent execution of ten Spaniards, in an attempt to "glorify ordinary criminals as martyrs for political ideals."

[United Press New York Dispatch, 2nd] The New York Times today reported in a Washington dispatch that officials from the Army, Navy, and State Department are currently informally seeking ways to supply fighter jets to France in the event of war between France and Spain.

[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 2nd] The US State Department announced last night that the British government, following France, has in principle accepted a US-proposed trilateral declaration condemning the Franco regime. It continued, stating that the declaration may be published simultaneously in London, Washington, and Paris tomorrow.

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 2nd] High-ranking government officials here said that the wording of the joint statement by the United States, Britain, and France demanding that Spanish dictator Franco step down and prepare for fair elections in Spain has in fact been agreed upon.

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 1st] The content of the US proposal on the Spanish issue has not been officially announced, but according to diplomatic sources, the US government suggests that the first point is that the three countries publicly announce their opposition to the Franco regime, hoping that the Spanish people will rise up to replace it as soon as possible. The second point is that the three countries will recognize the Spanish interim government as soon as Franco steps down, in preparation for the country to hold free elections. A State Department spokesman announced that Britain and France hope to continue to consider this proposal before issuing a statement.

[French News Agency London Dispatch, 1st] The British Foreign Office has received a French note stating that the French government is urging the British authorities to pay attention to Franco's deployment of troops to the French-Spanish border to increase defenses, and declaring that Spain's concentration of heavy troops is enough to endanger world peace.

### US Export-Import Bank to Increase Lending Capacity

Truman Recommended to Congress Yesterday

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 2nd] President Truman today recommended to Congress to increase the lending capacity of the US Export-Import Bank by $1.25 billion, so that it can lend to countries other than Britain. His message stated that if Congress approves the $3.75 billion loan to Britain, the US reserves will only be used to lend to Britain. Other borrowers must apply to the Export-Import Bank. If the bank's lending capacity is increased by $1 billion, the government can obtain a total of $3.25 billion to meet the loan needs of various countries until the end of June 1947. According to key officials of the State Department, the Soviet Union applied to the United States for a loan of $1 billion in August last year, but it has recently been lost in government files.

[Central News Agency Albuquerque, New Mexico Dispatch, 1st] Former US Ambassador to China General Hurley delivered a speech here, criticizing American foreign policy, saying that the moral support, productive power, and armed forces of the United States should not be tainted with robbery ideas. We have proven that the principles we are fighting for show that we are stronger in production and stronger in combat, but weaker in diplomacy.

### The United Nations Once Planned to Build a 2 Million Ton Aircraft Carrier, Using a Mixture of Ice and Wood Pulp as Material

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 1st] Classified wartime documents released by the United States, Britain, and Canada show that the United Nations Chiefs of Staff once planned to build an aircraft carrier weighing 2 million tons using a mixture of ice and wood pulp, but it was never realized. This aircraft carrier was like a floating iceberg on the ocean. Once built, it would be over one-third of a mile long and have 50-foot-thick walls, making it impervious to torpedo attacks. The body would also have air conditioners to prevent the ice from melting. A 1,000-ton model was once built on a lake in Canada, but it was destroyed after six months. The purpose of building this cold-material aircraft carrier was to travel to the frigid areas of the North Atlantic to search for German submarines and serve as a mobile base for the European Air Force. According to the authorities of the United States, Britain, and Canada, ordinary ice is too fragile to build this aircraft carrier, so a mixture of ice and wood pulp was used to prevent it from breaking under severe shocks. The original British plan was to build an artificial iceberg, 2,000 feet long, 300 feet wide, and 200 feet deep, weighing 2 million tons, requiring about 70 million yuan, equipped with electric motors to propel it forward, and anti-aircraft guns on the deck. After the Quebec Conference in August 1943, the US Navy authorities once planned to build this ice ship to attack Japan, but later decided to abandon it.

### US Surplus Silver to Be Sold Abroad

At the same time, Congressman Pengge submitted a bill to Congress requesting that the price of gold be raised to $56 per ounce, so that the price of silver would be set at $1.29 per ounce.

### US State Department Clarifies Economic Policy Toward Japan

[United Press, Washington, 1st] The State Department today issued a formal declaration, outlining for the first time the clear and precise framework of the United States' economic policy toward Japan. It stated, "We have not, and will not, assist Japan in rebuilding its export industries with economic power. Generally speaking, the policy of the United States is to encourage Japan to produce and export non-military or non-defense-related goods in order to obtain the necessary foreign exchange to purchase food, fertilizer, and other essential imports to maintain a minimum standard of living, and to prevent the occupation forces' burden from increasing. Therefore, the United States will encourage the production and export of silk, tea, pottery, coarse fabrics, and other handicrafts." This declaration is generally similar to the economic policy towards Germany, with the quantity of exports being limited to what is necessary to obtain domestic necessities.

### Local Dispatches

Kunshan

Formulating a City Construction Plan: The county government, in order to rebuild the city after the war, has formulated a city improvement and construction plan in light of local conditions and people's lives. In addition to widening the main and branch roads in the city to 12 meters, 10 meters, and 6 meters respectively, the plan also widens various highways, such as Kun-Hu and Kun-Tai. The total construction area reaches 1.45 square kilometers. It is expected that after the implementation of the plan, Kunshan's urban area will be completely renewed.

Suzhou

Rice Market Improved After Suppression: Since the county government took emergency measures to suppress [prices], the county's rice market has gradually improved.

### Are Battleships Useless? Are Aircraft Carriers Obsolete? The Answer Will Be Revealed After the Atomic Bomb Test

[Reuters, New York, 2nd] The atomic bomb test to be held this summer at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands will not only test the destructive power of the atomic bomb on battleships, but will also determine how weapons will be distributed in the future. Naval experts in the United States and around the world are already questioning whether battleships are useless and whether aircraft carriers will become museum antiques. The US authorities' emphasis on this issue can be seen from the decision to stop the continued construction of the 45,000-ton giant battleship Kentucky. Naval Shipbuilding Director Nash has asked the House Naval Affairs Committee to decide how to equip the Kentucky after the atomic bomb test. The Navy authorities intend to make it the strongest warship, perhaps equipped with new weapons even more powerful than the 16-inch guns. These new weapons may be just a small sphere or a rocket launch device. At the same time, it has been learned that of the 37 new ships the US Navy is building, eight have been dismantled, including one heavy cruiser, two destroyers, one tank landing ship, two destroyer escorts, one submarine, and one destroyer. The total construction cost of these eight ships is £32 million, and £20 million has already been spent. General Doolittle told the Senate that the Navy is so that it can supply transport landing troops, and the Army can make the invasion of the mainland successful, however, the B-29 aircraft has been able to eliminate the need to use the navy and army. Battleships have long been useless, and aircraft carriers are about to become useless. Naval experts have recently debated fiercely the effectiveness of aircraft carriers. Admiral Nimitz believes that carrier-based aircraft were a factor in the victory in the war against Japan. Atomic bombs must be carried close to the target to be used, so the use of the Navy is still necessary. The unofficial cost of this atomic bomb test is estimated to be over $10 million. Civilians have already begun to question the value of this test. It is believed that the 97 ships sacrificed in this test have been properly placed in various locations in advance, and their damage has been calculated as much as possible in advance. Therefore, in addition to confirming known results, it is feared that no new discoveries will be made, and the ships used for testing are all incapable of acting. It cannot be regarded as a modern naval appropriate test. 150 reporters who have been granted permission to visit can be allowed to go to a point seven miles away from the explosion site, if the wind is fair at the time, after thoroughly checking the post-bombing reaction, the reporters can visit the bombed area to inspect the damage to the ships. During the test, automatic cameras protected by steel boxes were placed on the coral reefs around the island to film the explosion. There are also radio-controlled unmanned aircraft in the air, taking photos from the air, and there are also manned aircraft taking moving pictures, most of the ships for testing have been towed to the island, and the people of Bakini Island and Karan Island, which is 200 miles away from the island, will be ordered to withdraw, a total of 20,000 people will participate in the two tests, and the Navy authorities say that they are at no danger.

### The Terrible Heat of the Atomic Bomb Instantly Turned the Living Beings of Hiroshima to Ashes

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] After returning from a visit to Hiroshima, Japan, Mr. Saksena, the Indian representative of the Far Eastern Commission, said that an investigation after the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima revealed that 17,000 people were missing. It is expected that all 17,000 people were instantly turned to ashes by the terrible heat emitted by the bomb. The total number of deaths in the city should be 81,000, with a total of 47,000 bodies found. 17,000 people died one after another after the bombing due to the intrusion of toxic gases after the bomb explosion, and the remaining 17,000 missing people are feared to have been turned to ashes on the spot. There are still a few people in the hospital who are expected to survive, but they will inevitably have scars for life.

### US Launches Civil Frugality Campaign to Help Famine Victims Worldwide, Guarantee to Increase Food Aid to China

[United Press, Washington, 1st] Former President Hoover held a meeting today at the White House with President Truman and other interested parties to discuss the issue of global food relief. Afterwards, he told reporters that the United States will do its best to guarantee increased food aid to China. The US civil frugality campaign will be launched immediately. 20 million tons of wheat are needed around the world, but only 15 million tons are currently available. The shortfall will be supplied mostly by the United States. The famine relief issue cannot be discriminated against based on differences in race, religion, or skin color. Therefore, Japan will also be included in the relief plan. There are currently more than 500 million people in need of relief worldwide.

### When the Warm Winds of April Blow in Jiangnan, Where Does the Chairman Reside? A Mystery Before Returning to the Capital

[Our Nanjing Dispatch] Nanjing is experiencing a housing shortage, and even the issue of Chairman Chiang's residence remains unresolved. April is fast approaching, causing Mayor Ma Chao-chun considerable distress!

Before the war, the Chairman's official residence was located in the northeast corner of the Central Military Academy, a small red Western-style house, flanked by two larger office buildings and reception rooms, along with some uninspired, drab little houses for the staff. After being used by the Japanese, these buildings are in a sorry state. The Military Academy is currently the headquarters of the Army General Headquarters, which is reportedly to be disbanded in May. Its future use remains unknown. It is truly inappropriate for the Chairman to reside in this desolate northeast corner.

Twice Lodged at the Central Military Academy

When the Chairman came to Nanjing at the end of last December, he stayed in this place, and it is said that problems occurred with both the water and electricity supply. This time, the Chairman has come to Nanjing and is staying here again. The Madam did not accompany him, and this desolate area is even more heavily guarded, making it truly unsuitable for a sixty-year-old man to reside in. He is a man of great integrity throughout his life, but at least he should be given a warm and artistic environment, whereas this corner resembles a wilderness.

Not Drinking from Robber's Spring, Not Residing in Traitor's House

Wang Jingwei built a large Western-style house in the West Kang Road in the north of the city, which is extremely elaborate, grand, and unimaginably comfortable. The municipal government intended to reserve it for the Chairman's residence. The previous time the Chairman and Madam came, the Madam thought that it would be acceptable to stay there amidst the severe housing shortage. She went to see the house with the Chairman, but as soon as the Chairman entered, he felt extremely uncomfortable and sternly said, "Who wants me to live in this place?" Those around him were too frightened to speak, and the Madam did not insist, because the Chairman is a man of great integrity: "Even if thirsty, one would not drink from Robber's Spring," even if we have no house to live in, we will not live in a house once occupied by a great traitor. This time the Madam did not come to Nanjing, and the housing issue has been further shelved.

Shameless Traitor Wen Occupied the Building

In the National Government building on Guofu Road, there is the Chairman's Building, which is where he conducts official business, built before the war. It is a four-story, dull and drab building. The first floor houses the offices of various departments, the second floor has a small south-facing room in the center, which is the Chairman's office, the third floor is the National Government conference hall, and the fourth floor is the radio station. Wang Jingwei never used this building; it was enjoyed by Wen Zongyao, the head of the puppet Legislative Yuan, for a while. Wen Zongyao, the idiot, kept many concubines, and fearing that his concubines would run off with others, he housed them in the buildings near his office.

Wind and Rain Cause Significant Leaks

The original offices of the chief of the Civil Affairs Department and the chief of the Military Affairs Department were all occupied by concubines. The glass windows on the doors were covered with lauan plywood to prevent the concubines from secretly peeking at others. Wen's daughter also lived inside. Each floor had an iron door to prevent assassination. Even rice and coal were piled up inside. One can imagine the life of a traitor. This building has been battered by wind and rain, and now it leaks severely. It is said that repairs would cost tens of millions of dollars. Although the return to the capital is imminent, work has not yet begun!

Walking in and out is Unreasonable

This place was originally the Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan's palace of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. After Zeng Guofan captured Nanjing, it became the Viceroy of Liangjiang's yamen, which was extremely large. It takes a full ten minutes to walk from the main gate to the Chairman's office building. Cars cannot drive in, truly tiring the Chairman. It is truly unreasonable to have a sixty-year-old man walking in and out.

Chairman Chiang is about to formally return to the capital. Where would it be best for him to reside?

### Thirteen Million Hearts Burning with Passion! The People of Guangxi in Suffering

— Our Air Mail Dispatch, Liang Xiaozhong from Guilin

Guangxi after the calamity is like a pond where the embankment has collapsed, overgrown with weeds, desolate and lonely. The beautiful scenery of Guilin cannot hide the scars of war. The white bones in the Seven Star Cave, the loyal remains in front of Solitary Beauty Peak, along with a scene of broken walls and ruins, write a historical account that can never be erased. Wandering along the desolate fields on both sides of the West River, the sight of nine out of ten houses empty will make you unable to bear to look, afraid to think, but what is gratifying is that thirteen million hearts have not grown cold!

In the past, Guangxi's politics were known to be enlightened. Today's environment has changed somewhat, but those who seek a new path for Bagui have not forgotten this goal.

Every Provincial Affairs Meeting Results in Several County Magistrates Being Dismissed

"Resting with the people" is the government's hope and the people's demand. Anyone who dares to disturb the suffering people will eventually suffer the consequences. At every provincial affairs meeting, several county magistrates are inevitably dismissed or removed from office. As a result, on the dilapidated streets of Guilin, new county magistrates, former county magistrates, and those who aspire to be county magistrates are running around, seeking favors, seeking positions, seeking connections. Everyone is trying to "renew" themselves. One civil servant who was dismissed as a county magistrate sighed and said, "This world is truly difficult. A single postage stamp can replace a county magistrate." Indeed, the key points of Guangxi's current administration emphasize that the people must be treated well and the cadres must be treated strictly. Since the province was recovered, every county has changed its local officials. Unfortunately, the people handling affairs in the province have one mindset, but those handling affairs in the counties have a different one. It is difficult to be an official, and it is indeed difficult to find good officials. In less than a year, no fewer than twenty or thirty people have been arrested for corruption and dereliction of duty (Guangxi has only over ninety counties).

The people of Guangxi are helpless, and no one is there to receive their hearts. They are merely comforting themselves. The farmers of southern China are truly docile and are still silently enduring all hardships, unwilling to say more. For example, although recovered areas are exempt from land taxes, some counties (such as Wuming and Tianbao areas) are pretending to be deaf and dumb, collecting the taxes anyway, or establishing another item for collection under the name of warehousing. In the Guidong area, the taxes are so varied and numerous that the people are confused and cry out in distress. Farmers sell their lifeblood—cattle, and pawn all their pitiful property, paying off the taxes and clearing their debts, coupled with their long-standing poverty, so bandits have emerged.

Refugees Receive Emergency Relief Funds, Silently Crying Loudly

Guangxi's public security has always been famously good, which is naturally due to well-trained troops. However, since one major disaster, small disasters have followed one after another like rain during the night. After one major calamity, the entire province received only 50 million yuan in relief funds and received over fifty tons of relief goods. Not to be envious, just the demobilization expenses for Zhejiang University alone are 300 million yuan. What can 50 million yuan really do? Guangxi is truly too tragic! Refugees recently received "a sum" of emergency relief funds, with each person receiving 300 yuan at a time. Today, 300 yuan can buy two pounds of rice, half a pound of beef, or half a pack of cigarettes. Are the refugees, after losing everything, only worth these 300 yuan?

One refugee tore up the banknotes on the spot after receiving the money and cried loudly without saying a word! What else can they say? Of course, we are not saying that the government favors one over the other, but it is a fact that it has not paid attention to the actual situation and understood the suffering in the hearts of the people. What better way should the government come up with to nourish these people living on the brink of death! Only seeing the recovery and prosperity of a few cities is a myopic view. We ask the government to take a look at the rural areas that have not received any agricultural loans or seeds to this day!

Ox-carts Block the Highway, and a Band of Robbers Comes Howling

The withering of production, coupled with the obstruction of transportation, has led to the lack of regulation and formed a ladder of price increases. First, the price of rice rose to cause trouble. The most terrible is the Guixinan area, where the price has risen from over 6,000 yuan to over 15,000 yuan. Guibei has Xiang rice transported to help, and Guidong has Thai rice from Guangzhou, so it still hovers between 12,000 and 13,000, but a large amount of military grain has to be purchased from this arid land, and then there are small profiteers who make trouble from it, so prices are rising rapidly. Gold has passed 140,000, and the worst native cloth costs 400 to 500 yuan a foot. A decent hotel costs 2,000 to 3,000 yuan a night. Traveling is even more of a problem. A short trip from Nanning to Guangzhou cannot be made without 40,000 yuan. The travel expenses from Guilin to Nanning are not much less. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all difficult, and today's Guangxi is no longer an ideal paradise. Speaking of the economy, Guangxi indeed has no giants manipulating the market. Small merchants cannot cause big storms, but banks opening gold shops under other names, and a small number of people grasping an "enterprise company that holds the economic reins," looks somewhat unpleasant overall. Recently, merchants have also sent five representatives to Chongqing to request relief, and more requests are following. The mountains and forests of Guixi are originally the refuge of outlaws. Today, due to poverty and hunger, coupled with the instigation of a small group of organized and ambitious people (such as the bandits who invaded the Shiwan Dashan last winter), many useful men have sold their mountains, bought guns, and started doing "murder in the dark of the moon, arson when the wind is high." Whether in rural villages or small towns, the public security force is relatively weak, such as the small counties on the left and right rivers, which are also filled with rumors and on the verge of danger. The mountainous areas are like this, and the plains are no exception. The robbers are most covetous of cars filled with goods and passengers on the highway (without passengers and goods, car tires are also a target, one tire is more than 100,000). The method of robbing cars is truly ingenious: first, block the highway with two large ox-carts to prevent oncoming cars from passing. Then, a band of robbers comes howling, swarming up to loot everything, and the robbers in Guangxi are quite petty, mostly "wanting life first, then money," so cases of murder emerge one after another. Although it cannot be said that robbers are everywhere, they are indeed numerous, keeping the government busy and the security team anxious.

Guangxi Has Always Been Known for Its Poverty, Now It Is Doubly Difficult

Thus, a large-scale clearing campaign is planned, with the county magistrates personally leading the teams to set out, suppressing and appeasing at the same time. Up to today, the effect is naturally not small. In places where it is done well, the area is naturally peaceful. In places where it is not done well, chickens and dogs are chased all over the place. There are countless complaints to the media about the clearing campaign. Clearing is a stopgap measure. The fundamental solution is to carefully look at the shattered rural areas and lend a helping hand to the utterly exhausted farmers. This depends on the government's overall strategy. Here, we might as well take a look at Guangxi's relief work.

To be honest, Guangxi is indeed doubly difficult, and has always been known for its poverty.

A Small Jar of White Rice at Home Is Regarded as a Rare Treasure

To give an example, the farmers in Guixi and Guibei have always been eating corn and sweet potatoes year-round. Occasionally, a more well-to-do family will have a small jar filled with rice. When is this rice eaten? Except for a meal on New Year's Eve every year and a few meals during the Spring Festival, it is simply regarded as a rare treasure. The reporter, after being away from home for a long time, returned home and ate white rice every day. Many people gathered around and curiously looked at me, surprised that I ate rice every meal and not corn. Speaking of which, it is truly both funny and sad. On top of that, the great calamity before the new year left most of the land in eighty-seven counties barren. Housing leaks, commercial loans, requests for repayment of requisitioned materials, how can only farmers need relief?

Difficult to Travel with Water but No Boat, Qian-Gui Road Has Not Been Repaired

Among the merchants' requests is the urgent repair of the Qian-Gui Road. Naturally, the merchants' starting point is to facilitate commercial transport, but in fact, the hurried repair of the Qian-Gui Road and the Xiang-Gui Road (recently jointly referred to as the Xiang-Qian Railway) not only meets the needs of merchants but also addresses the needs of national defense. The existing railways that have been dismantled should be rushed to be restored. How can the roads that were destroyed to resist the enemy be left behind and not repaired? The initial report of the news was: "The Guilin section of the Qian-Gui Road will be repaired by the end of March," and later it was "the construction will be postponed to the beginning of April." In fact, they are waiting for equipment, and a group of employees has been living in Yishan for a long time. Today, transportation in Guixi relies entirely on highways. Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Wuzhou (connected to Rongxu), Qinzhou, Guangzhouwan, and Changsha, all have car intermodal transport. Taking a car is still convenient due to the competition of commercial transport companies, but the fare is a bit expensive, and there is always some danger. The rapid repair and construction of highways is purely the power of the people. The people come as soon as they are conscripted for forced labor, and they work as soon as they come, obedient to the point of being rare.

As for waterway transportation, Guangxi today has plenty of rivers but lacks boats. Except for Wuzhou to Guangzhou, where there are steamers, there are few rotten steamships on the Gui River, Yu River, Liu River, Fu River, and Li River. It is not that there are no boats, just that they have all been pulled to the lower reaches of Guangzhou and Zhao and have not returned.

Lost the Lady and Broke the Soldiers, Striving for Culture

Culture and education are better left unsaid, as it is heartbreaking to talk about them. The "highest institution of learning," National Guangxi University, received over 100,000 yuan in demobilization funds, but before it "recovered" from Guizhou to Guangxi, it was already "finished." It is now taking classes in a row of unsightly houses in Yujiang, Liuzhou, but thousands of children are studying hard. Although books and instruments have been lost or cannot be transported back due to lack of money, it is still considered a national university. The principal is still staying in Chongqing, probably to find some funding. Primary and secondary schools have also resumed classes early, and teachers' salaries are reduced again and again, and there are still arrears, but they are still gritting their teeth and cultivating talents for the country in the 1950s. There are few student movements, and everyone understands and sympathizes with each other.

The number of newspapers and magazines in the province is limited. The Guilin edition and Nanning edition of Guangxi Central Daily News, and the Guilin edition, Liuzhou edition, and Bose edition (recently moved to Nanning) of Guangxi Daily are considered major newspapers. In addition, each county has a daily newspaper, or mimeographed bulletin, mostly hosted by the county party headquarters, with only three or four hundred copies sold. There are quite a few magazines in Guilin like bamboo shoots after a rain, such as Banri Wenhui, Lingbiao Forum, and Construction Monthly, etc. Most are run by Guangxi people and read by Guangxi people. Compared to the previous two years, it is too unbearable to look back. Bookstores and publishing houses are even rarer. One strange thing is that no publications imported from other places have been seen here for more than a year!

"China is the country that has suffered the most severe losses in the world, and Guangxi is the province that has been most thoroughly destroyed in all of China." This statement is not an exaggeration at all. Asking the government to pay attention to this land is also the tearful request of thirteen million people. The sons and daughters of Bagui have contributed money, effort, and lives. Is all that they get in return just 50 million yuan in relief? We believe that the government will not be indifferent, let alone allow Guangxi, the important frontier in the south, to remain desolate! Naturally, striving to overcome the current difficulties is also the responsibility of the sons and daughters of Guangxi themselves!

### Resolving the Shanghai Housing Problem

— Qiu Hanyun

Shanghai is our nation's gateway, an industrial center, and a hub for international trade. Its population is dense, and the demand for buildings far exceeds the supply, a situation that was already reaching a crisis point before the war. Since Japan's invasion of China, a considerable number of buildings have been destroyed by artillery fire. Furthermore, the destruction of production facilities in the interior, coupled with poor security, has led to an influx of refugees from all directions, who view Shanghai as a promised land. They come with their old and young, like water flowing downwards, further exacerbating the housing problem to an unsustainable degree. The rent for a single house or even a single room is often charged with "black money" amounting to tens or hundreds of taels of gold, making it inaccessible to salaried workers, who can only sigh in despair at the sight of the door. As for the working class, crouching in pigeonholes and huddled in shacks, they have even less hope of improvement. If we wish to resolve this problem, the only solution is to promote large-scale construction, and the primary issue before construction is the utilization of land. If those who aspire to build lack land, and those who possess land are unwilling to build, then this problem will never be solved. Within the city, there are public spaces and private gardens everywhere, creating a stark contrast between the wealthy, who own vast estates, and the poor, who have nowhere to stand. We must rely on the government's efforts, implementing interventionist policies based on the principles of equal land rights, to force construction to meet the needs of the masses. The following steps are suggested for discussion by those who care about social welfare:

Abolish the Racecourse and Convert it into a Residential Area

The racecourse is located in the city center, occupying hundreds of acres of land. It is usually left unused, only serving the Westerners' horse races once or twice a year, with the sole purpose of gambling and accumulating wealth. It is harmful in every way and beneficial in none. Even if it were for practicing horsemanship, the suburbs would suffice. These are all extravagant practices of the Westerners, contrary to our nation's good customs. Now that the concessions have been reclaimed and sovereignty is in our hands, we should abolish it by decree. To meet the public's needs, it should be surveyed, divided, numbered, and open for public bidding, with a deadline for construction. This would increase the number of buildings in the city in a short period. While the relationship between supply and demand may not immediately reach equilibrium, it can be expected to come somewhat closer. Furthermore, the land price obtained from the auction should be designated as a fund for building affordable housing, carefully used to construct the first batch of affordable housing for rent at low prices. The rent should only cover the interest on this fund. Loans should then be taken out from banks to finance the construction of the second batch, continuing the cycle without depletion. After a few years, the Shanghai housing problem should be largely resolved. However, some people advocate converting the racecourse into a public sports field, which is still a Western concept of luxury and fails to consider the welfare of the common people. Weighing the importance of each option, we dare not agree. The racecourse is located in a crucial area, and the auction can yield a large price, sufficient for building affordable housing and regulating the supply and demand relationship, which is equivalent to equalizing land rights for all Shanghai citizens. Public sports fields can be set up in the suburbs, without the need to waste space in the city center.

Investigate Privately Owned Land and Force Construction

According to the Three Principles of the People, privately owned land should not be entirely at one's disposal. Except for sports fields, workplaces, and scenic gardens that can be used for public recreation, the area of a private garden should not exceed the area of its buildings. Any area exceeding the area of its buildings can be considered selfish and harmful to public housing. The government should send honest officials to conduct a clear investigation, define boundaries, and order landowners to build within a certain timeframe. Those who fail to build by the deadline should have their land forcibly acquired by the government to be used as a base for building affordable housing. The compensation for the compulsory acquisition should be paid with the issuance of short-term government bonds. The previously designated construction fund should not be used to avoid affecting the government's construction funds.

Establish Public Surface Rights to Attract Investment

The compulsory acquisition of land will undoubtedly result in a large number of vacant lots available for construction. If the government lacks the financial resources to build on all of it, it should attract citizens who need land and capitalists who are interested in construction to lease the required land. They should be granted the right to build and use it within a certain period (20 to 30 years). After the expiration of the term, the land should be reclaimed by the government to build more affordable housing. This type of legal relationship can be called "public surface rights." Lessees must pay a one-time fee equivalent to the price of the compulsory acquisition as a reserve fund for short-term government bonds used to acquire the land, specifically for paying interest and repaying the principal of these bonds. Lessees will not pay any further land rent during the term. At the end of the term, they can dismantle the buildings and retrieve their materials. The government has no obligation to purchase the buildings or refund the fee paid at the time of leasing.

Investigate Privately Owned Buildings and Force Rental

The housing crisis in Shanghai is a reality. However, there are still many extravagant landlords with surplus houses left unused and greedy landlords demanding "black money" and refusing to rent them out. The government should send honest officials to conduct an on-site investigation and set a deadline for renting them out. After the deadline, the government should introduce tenants, and landlords must not refuse. This intervention will also help to balance the supply and demand relationship.

Establish Housing Referral Centers

Establish housing referral centers according to the methods of employment agencies. Based on the results of the aforementioned investigation, the referral centers should draw up a registry of all houses subject to compulsory rental, inquire about the landlord's minimum rental price, and make a reasonable match based on the registration order of tenants. When registering, tenants should declare the number of family members, the number of rooms needed, and the maximum rent they can afford. After the referral center makes a match, the lease should be directly established, and if there are disagreements on rent, either party may petition the Evaluation Committee to assess it.

Establish a Housing Evaluation Committee

The aforementioned lease must be evaluated before it can be established. There are also many cases where leases have been established for many years, and landlords are demanding increased rent, which the tenants ignore, resulting in a stalemate. A fair evaluation is necessary so that both parties know what to abide by, in order to live in peace. However, while evaluation is not difficult, reasonable evaluation is very difficult. Evaluating too high, causing tenants to struggle to pay, is unkind. Evaluating too low directly exploits the landlord's due profits, and indirectly affects the investor's psychology, making them believe that construction is unprofitable, leading to hesitation, further widening the gap between supply and demand. This is neither a way to encourage construction, nor is it wise. In all fairness, at a time of high prices for all goods, both property owners and those without property feel distressed, so rent cannot but be increased, but "black money" must be prohibited.

The above concerns the welfare of all citizens of Shanghai. We sincerely hope that wise authorities and social elites will act righteously, overcome all difficulties, and unite to address this issue.

### Shanghai Seen Through X-Ray Statistics: A City Riddled with Tuberculosis

Since the end of the war, there has been a shortage of food and medicine, and tuberculosis has spread to various countries, causing serious attacks. Shanghai is the most populous city in our country, and the prevalence of tuberculosis is much greater than in other cities. Because tuberculosis is an infectious disease, each patient can spread countless infectious seeds. Close relatives and friends are often in contact, and all have the potential to be infected. The more patients there are in a large city, the greater the harm to public health. With dense population and frequent contact, no one can ensure that they will not be infected. X-ray examination can not only allow patients to get early treatment and cut off the source of infection, but also allow people to know how to prevent and avoid infection. It is the most important work to ensure the safety of public health.

To understand the rampant tuberculosis epidemic, a reporter recently visited the host of the Hongqiao Sanatorium. The sanatorium has been working very hard to promote X-ray examinations in recent years. According to the sanatorium's annual examination statistics, a total of 2,435 people were examined, and less than half of them had normal lungs. As many as 626 people suffered from lung disease, accounting for more than 24% of the total, which is alarming. (See X-ray examination statistics table.)

### X-Ray Examination Statistics

Analysis of the Condition | Number of People out of 2,435 | Percentage

Normal Lungs | 941 | 37.21%

Bilateral Pulmonary Tuberculosis | 145 | 5.73%

Bilateral Tuberculosis with Cavities | 44 | 1.73%

Bilateral Artificial Pneumothorax | 1 | 0.04%

Right Lung Tuberculosis | 167 | 6.60%

Right Lung Tuberculosis with Cavities | 44 | 1.73%

Right Lung Tuberculosis Infiltration | 1 | 0.04%

Right Lung Artificial Pneumothorax | 11 | 0.43%

Right Lung Apex Unclear | 6 | 0.24%

Black Shadow in Right Lung | 20 | 0.79%

Right Lung with Tuberculous Scarring | 3 | 0.12%

Right Hydropneumothorax | 4 | 0.16%

Right Thoracoplasty | 2 | 0.08%

Left Lung Tuberculosis | 122 | 4.82%

Left Lung Tuberculosis with Cavities | 11 | 0.44%

Right Pleural Thickening | 1 | 0.04%

Exudative Pleurisy | 21 | 0.83%

Pleural Thickening | 40 | 1.58%

Pleurisy | 40 | 1.58%

Deep Bronchial Shadow | 743 | 29.42%

Deep Hilar Lymph Node Shadow | 53 | 2.09%

Enlarged Aortic Shadow | 6 | 0.24%

These statistics are a confirmation of the rampant tuberculosis in this city. Living in this big city, we should be vigilant and deeply realize that this examination is not only for our own benefit, but also for public safety, and should not be ignored.

According to the sanatorium's statistics on the age of tuberculosis patients: the youngest is 2 years old, and the oldest is 19. The next highest are 20 years old and 23 years old, each accounting for 41 people. From 19 to 28 years old is the peak of tuberculosis patients, totaling 369 people, accounting for nearly 60% of the total. It is not unreasonable to call it the most dangerous age of life. We sincerely hope that young people will pay attention to it and not let the golden age be destroyed by tuberculosis. (Chen Ziming)

Special Commentary

### Protesting Against the Soviet Union, Advising the Chinese Communist Party

— Wang Yaming

The Soviet army in Northeast China broke its promise and failed to withdraw by the agreed date, and is now preparing for a long-term stay. At the same time, the Soviet side has allegedly made "four demands" on us, forcing us to recognize their privileges. The Dongbei faction suddenly proposed so-called autonomous demands, constantly brewing the division and separation of territorial sovereignty. Is Zhang Xinfu's murder any different from Cai Gongshi's assassination? The volley of gunfire that killed many officials in Fanyang is also dissimilar to the artillery fire at Beidaying.

Now, of course, the war has just ended, and all the participating countries, whether victorious or defeated, have only weakened their national strength, not increased it. The dead are dead, and the wounded are wounded. Of course, no country would attempt to start a war. But this very psychology of not wanting to start a war is the best inducement for diplomatic warfare, because the aversion to war can be used to extract more diplomatic gains with "war threats." Now, these countries that are striving to avoid war, both psychologically and behaviorally, are being threatened by countries that are rapidly and aggressively advancing, both in attitude and in action. This is the uneasy reality of the international situation after the war. The tension between China and the Soviet Union over the Northeast issue is a serious part of this international situation. The following four points are elaborated to illustrate our views on this issue.

"Security Needs" and Spheres of Influence

Before international disputes erupt, there must be a subject that generates the dispute. This subject is often the protagonist of the international dispute, that is, the country that is "dissatisfied with the status quo." Before this war, those countries dissatisfied with the status quo shouted the slogan of "redistribution of territory and resources," vying for territory from other countries and creating many international disputes, leading to the outbreak of the world war. Now those countries that shouted a redistribution of territory and resources have been publicly condemned, punished, and regarded as aggressor nations and defeated. Therefore, today's countries dissatisfied with the status quo have a new slogan. They believe that unless they expand outward and establish buffer zones or buffer states outside their borders, or even carve out spheres of influence, they cannot guarantee the security of other countries. They are expanding outward for "security needs." Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov said in his speech commemorating the 28th anniversary of the October Revolution: "We have no task more important than consolidating our victory. This victory was obtained in our unyielding struggle, and it opened a road to a new and great rise of our country and the future improvement of our people's living standards. We have never faced such a vast prospect of socialist construction and the growth of the power of the Soviet Union." The Soviet Union is realistically seizing its unprecedented opportunity, expanding its territorial sovereignty to consolidate the fruits of its victory in order to guarantee its national "security." But when a country's security must be guaranteed by outward expansion, international disputes will arise one after another. The Soviet Union yearns for the "authority of the Tsarist era" and left shadows that harmed international peace in the Yalta Agreement. After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, they attempted to establish their security line in Northeast China, making Northeast China a buffer zone or even a sphere of influence. But China's security has been shattered, China's territorial sovereignty has been divided, and the issue of China's national survival is involved. The problem is very serious.

"People's Regime" and National Division

The motive for creating international disputes must be a country's "outward expansion." The target of this outward expansion must be a relatively weak country. The way to expand outward is to instigate unrest in the weak country. Stupid behaviors like Japan's direct intervention are, of course, outdated. They can carry out their plans to expand their power amid domestic unrest. The nine eastern provinces of China are also experiencing so-called "people's governments" and "people's armies." What is especially frightening is that there are several people's governments in China, but they cannot form a unified organization among themselves. This is a division within a division. This approach is the same as Japan dividing China into Manchukuo Puyi and Nanjing Wang Jingwei, dividing the occupied areas and the traitorous puppets, and not unifying them, so that they can achieve the purpose of actual control.

War and Peace

After Japan surrendered, Chairman Stalin said: "Now we can believe that our motherland has been freed from the threat of German aggression in the West and the threat of Japanese aggression in the East." For the Soviet Union, whose national strength has expanded unprecedentedly, "eliminating the threat" is not the purpose that the Soviet Union should be satisfied with. What she needs more is "security guarantees." The Soviet Union has three actions to consolidate its victory and seize the opportunity of a thousand years. The first is the annexation of territories such as the Polish Belarusian Soviet, the Czechoslovakian Outer Carpathian Ukraine, the Romanian Moldavia, the Baltic ice-free port of Königsberg, the three Baltic countries claiming Soviet republics, the Finnish Petsamo region, and the incorporation of Japan's South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands into the Soviet Union, which have already become Soviet territory. The second is the establishment of buffer zones, such as the dabbling in the North Pacific and the dispute over Japan under control, and the conflicts between Greece, Iran, and Britain, which belong to this category. The third is the division of spheres of influence and the establishment of pro-Soviet regimes. The current situation and evolution in Northeast China tend to this goal.

In the author's view, peace and war are not absolute. If it is an indirect conflict of interest, that is, only a dispute over a buffer zone, this can still maintain a considerable balance of concessions, and war will not easily occur. But if it is a direct conflict of interest, or when the "balance" is about to be broken, that is, when the conflict of interest involves spheres of influence and territorial sovereignty, war will suddenly break out. The reason why Britain sacrificed Czechoslovakia in the Munich Agreement and did not break with Germany was that Poland was invaded and decided to declare war on Germany. After the "September 18th Incident," China had to prepare for armed defense, and the Lugouqiao artillery fire launched a full-scale war of resistance. This is the boundary between peace and war. So, is the Northeast issue today likely to become a threat to world peace? I believe that today the Soviet Union has actually swept up Outer Mongolia, and in East Mongolia and Xinjiang, it is also driving the "specialization" movement, which may soon become a Soviet sphere of influence. At that time, whether it is China's protest or international intervention, there is a possibility of triggering a war. To this day, there is no "Munich" gap between peace and war.

Patriotism and "Exclusionism"

Amidst the dark clouds looming over the Northeast situation, the youth of the whole country, moved by righteous indignation, held demonstrations and parades, shouting slogans, demanding that the Soviet Union withdraw its troops from Northeast China, demanding that the Soviet Union respect the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, and demanding that all parties abandon their selfish interests, unite as one, and jointly relieve the national crisis. Because of their friendship with the Soviet Union, the Chinese Communists despised this patriotic enthusiasm. They said, "Patriotism and exclusionism must be separated. China should cooperate internationally and not lead China into exclusionist actions. In the past, China mixed patriotism and exclusionism. Today, we hope not to lead patriotic actions to exclusionism." These words seem to say that patriotism must not protest against the Soviet Union, and protesting against the Soviet Union is not patriotism. What she means is that protesting against the Soviet army's failure to withdraw from Northeast China is "anti-Soviet," and "anti-Soviet" is exclusionism. But what is the difference between this and the reason why Japan said that China was "anti-Japanese" eight years ago? Japan used the crime of "anti-Japanese" to suppress the patriotic actions of our people, which eventually led to the "July 7th Incident." Today, our young students are innocent. They still dare not openly echo the memory of being oppressed with the crime of "anti-Japanese." Now we are protesting against the Soviet Union's breach of promise, delayed troop withdrawal, killing of receiving personnel, and removal of Northeast materials. Even the traitors dare not defend this. The CCP actually shamelessly called on young students not to be "exclusionist." Our country certainly needs to cooperate internationally, but can we agree to cooperation that forces us to cooperate with topics such as "economic cooperation" and "joint anti-communism" eight years ago? The CCP did not see the Soviet Union creating China's division, infringing on China's national rights, and seizing China's materials, but saw young students being "exclusionist" and "anti-Soviet," so they regrettably slandered the students' patriotism as "exclusionism." We don't need to study this for the CCP. The CCP has already been in the position of "chief criminal" for the national division movement. It is no different from sincerely appreciating the long-term stationing of the Soviet army. This flattering and wishful thinking is already obvious.

Final Remarks

From the above observations, we can see the seriousness of the Northeast issue, which has already constituted the form of a second "September 18th." If the Soviet Union has no intention of aggression, it should change its course at this time and not treat its allies as objects of power expansion. If the Soviet Union really has an intention of aggression, then before the nine eastern provinces become a defined sphere of influence, it should be stopped. Otherwise, once the situation is created and the Soviet Union's interests are expanded, it will be impossible to stop it. As for the CCP, we also want to urge them to wake up, "Brothers fight outside the wall to defend against insults." Otherwise, even if the CCP can seem to have "succeeded" for a while under the Soviet Union's wings, its pitiful degree is probably no different from Puyi and Wang Jingwei! Therefore, we want to awaken the importance of justice internationally, and to raise the lesson of the failure of Munich. Domestically, we must arouse the spirit of Turkey to correct international actions with aggression through strict diplomacy.

### All Opium Smokers in the City Required to Submit a Pledge of Reform Before the End of This Month

The Municipal Government, in accordance with the Central Government's measures to eliminate opium in the recovered areas, and using a self-reform approach in conjunction with inspection and reporting methods, instructed the Police Bureau to earnestly and responsibly handle the matter. Those who plant, manufacture, transport, or sell opium are allowed to submit a pledge of reform before the end of March. Those who fail to do so will be sent to the military judicial organs for legal punishment. Those who are addicted to opium are allowed to submit a pledge of reform before the end of March of this year, and must quit opium before the end of June of the same year. Those who fail to do so will be sent to the military judicial organs for legal punishment.

Those who are reported and acknowledge or are verified to be true will be exempt from punishment, but they must pledge to hand over all opium and related utensils to the police station. The rumor that the Neighborhood Chiefs in the various districts of the city will lead the Jia Chiefs to inspect opium smokers and privately stored opium door-to-door and that registration forms should be filled out by each resident and reported to the various district offices is purely a rumor and is not true. Regarding all measures to ban opium, the Police Bureau will completely handle matters in accordance with the law, so that opium smokers can reform themselves and quit their bad habits. The various district offices have never launched a door-to-door inspection of opium smokers.

### Bank of China Responsible for Regulating the Foreign Exchange Market: Sentiment in the Gold Market Improves; U.S. Dollar Notes Difficult to Sell

Yesterday, due to the statement by President Bei of the Bank of China that the foreign exchange market would be regulated starting next Monday without fixed exchange rates, but rather with adjustments based on natural levels, sentiment slightly improved, and the market became more active. The process was stable. It opened at 1.43 million, and buying orders came one after another. Although transactions were few, the price was once pushed up to over 1.5 million. Securities firms continued to supply at high prices, and the price gradually fell back to 1.41 million. Money exchangers and miscellaneous firms were still absorbing shares. The price rose again at noon, but it was difficult to break through the 1.5 million barrier. In the afternoon, it weakened again, reaching a low of 1.42 million. Finally, it remained above 1.47 million (including some transactions for next week), up 70,000 from the previous close. The Bank of China will use the current market price as the basis for regulation, and the market is expected to fluctuate. Gold jewelry was listed at 150,000 per item, silver at 1,800, and silver dollars at 850 yuan. The hidden interest rate remained at the original price, with a high of 0.25 and a low of 0.18.

The foreign exchange market for U.S. dollar notes fluctuated along with the gold market, and the situation has slightly improved. The key still revolved around 710 yuan per ten taels, with the advance and retreat inconsistent. After entry, it remained below the 2,000 yuan mark. Although there was a rebound in the middle, it was temporary, and outsiders found it difficult to sell. Those holding notes continued to panic, and there was once a lack of buyers, causing the selling price to fall to 1,920 yuan. Later, due to the rebound in the gold market, it improved slightly passively. As a result, there was no change from the previous close. The arbitrage price against gold finally widened to 74 yuan per ten taels, indicating that people are looking down on cash. The Hong Kong dollar has stabilized slightly, but transactions were not significant. Old Hong Kong dollar rose to 10 yuan, and new Hong Kong dollar was three yuan higher.

### Securities Weaken

Government bonds were slightly weaker after being strong. Miscellaneous stocks followed the upward trend. Type C bonds fell from 1,950 yuan in the morning to 1,800 yuan. Many old shares emerged, and small amounts of surplus funds from silver and money companies were still being absorbed. As a result, they closed slightly higher than the previous close. Type A, B, and D each rose by 80 yuan, and Type E rose by 50 yuan. Chinese stocks continued to advance on the exchange, but because trading was not active and lacked transparency, those taking profits sold at high prices, and credit tightened. After being strong, they weakened. Yong Yarn was the strongest at 2,900 yuan, Meiya at 2,300 yuan, and Jingfu above 140 yuan, but they fell back by 10% at noon. Compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn fell by 50 yuan, Meiya by 70 yuan, and Jingfu by 5 yuan. Foreign stocks also followed the same downward trend as Chinese stocks. Yisha was marked down 10% from 6,500 yuan. Other stocks also struggled, resulting in large stocks falling by half a percent and small stocks falling by more than 10% compared to the previous close.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise Due to Rainy Weather Affecting Supply; Oil, Soybean Cake Also Rebound

Yesterday, the rice market saw a reduction in supply due to continuous rain. Vendors and firms still had shares, which caused prices to rise by more than 1,000 yuan. After continuous weakness, oil prices recovered with a brisk digestive rate, rebounding by 2-3,000 yuan. Soybean cake also rose by 1-200 yuan. High-quality yellow soybeans were steady, while medium-quality yellow soybeans rose by 1,000 yuan. Flour prices declined slightly by 2-300 yuan because the digestive rate had decreased, and the intake from out-of-town firms had stopped. Hide and leather remained sluggish, and prices continued to fall by 1-200 yuan, indicating a weak trend.

### Silk Trade Becomes More Active

Recently, silk has resurfaced, and although credit is tight, transactions are still decent. Yesterday, high-grade raw silk was priced similarly to the previous day. In the afternoon, ordinary five-dan raw silk changed hands at 2.7 million yuan. Other lots were priced higher than the previous day. 120-count Rayon from Tianqiao opened at 1.82 million yuan and continued to rise to 845,000 yuan, closing at 1.9 million yuan, 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The silk market was very active, with frequent transactions, causing prices to rise across the board. Meiya was listed at 1.3 million yuan per 100 threads. Dage Bige opened at 4,000 yuan per yard and later traded at 4,200 yuan. Minsheng Brocade was 17,500 yuan per piece, and Linji yarn was 20 yuan per yard.

### Abundant Supply Causes Wen Hong Tea Prices to Fall; Other Teas Remain Steady

The Wenzhou Jordan-brand black tea that arrived a few days ago has been in contact with the client-side, but the spot market has been inundated with supply, forcing prices to decline sharply, falling by as much as 4-5,000 yuan compared to before. Other varieties continue to be discussed between supply and demand, so trading remains limited, and prices remain stable. As for Fujian tea, it is reported that a considerable amount of red and green scented tea will be shipped to Shanghai within days.

### Yarn Market Fluctuates; Spot Cotton Trading is Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market saw some buying interest due to the large decline the previous day. Gold prices rebounded, and yarn prices stabilized. 20-count yarn rose back above the 1 million mark, with the final transaction at 1.02 million, an increase of about 60,000 yuan from yesterday. Other counts also rose by about 3-40,000 yuan. Confidence is still lacking, and the yarn market appears to be in a fluctuating state. The Fangjian Company is selling various colors of flannel blankets at flat prices. It is reported that in addition to opening sales of cotton yarn next Monday, a large amount of cotton cloth will also be sold.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market saw little activity, but Fangjian did inquire about 200 bales of Texas American cotton from Hong Kong and the price was set at 41 U.S. dollars. In addition, small private yarn factories traded Brazilian cotton and Sanyu Zhen cotton at 90,000 yuan, and the industry traded Zhoupu seed cotton at 15,500 yuan. Market prices were generally flat and sluggish.

### Women's Fabric Sells Well

Women's fabrics continue to sell well. First-grade fabrics wholesale for 15-6,000 yuan per yard, second-grade fabrics are around 10,000 yuan, and third-grade fabrics are 6-7,000 yuan. Both buyers and sellers are benefiting from low capital requirements and good profits, so they are eager to sell them. Factories have realized this, and due to raw material costs, they are producing more women's fabrics than fine wool fabrics.

The Shanghai Woolen Fabric Trade Association has been reorganized and notified all member shops to attend a general meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce in Tianhou Temple next Wednesday to elect directors and supervisors.

### Tung Oil for Export Valued at 80,000 per Load

Tung oil has an export route, so those involved are very attentive. However, the delay in announcing foreign exchange rates has led everyone to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. It is recently reported that the foreign exchange rate will be announced soon, and interest is growing. Those who can match export sales have already valued it at 80,000 per load in the Shanghai market, while domestic sales require 76-7,000 yuan. Since the arrival of Hongjiang Tung Oil from Western Sichuan, the situation has changed. Local manufacturers know they cannot compete and will have to close down. The supply of Huaixi Hongjiang Tung Oil is also limited, so although each company has set the wholesale price at 60,000 yuan per barrel, they are unwilling to sell too much.

### Sugar, Tea, and Fruit Shipped in Large Quantities from Taiwan

### South America Needs Chinese Tea: Tea Merchants Are Rushing to Produce

[Our Report] Chinese tea exports from Shanghai have almost come to a standstill since the outbreak of the Pacific War. Since the victory, there have been increasing inquiries from overseas. However, due to the lack of smooth shipping and the uncertain exchange rate, there have been few large shipments. Now that the authorities are expected to announce the foreign exchange rate soon, inquiries from Europe, America, and other countries are becoming more enthusiastic. South America has requested tea samples and is preparing to place orders. Although some tea merchants in Shanghai are rushing to produce, their stockpiles are very depleted, so it will be difficult to develop. It is expected that the future of Chinese tea exports will be promising when the new tea season begins.

### Entire Faculty of Jiaotong University Appeals for Improved Treatment, Sends Telegram to Chairman Chiang, President Soong, and Minister Zhu Requesting Resolution or Forced Retirement

[Local News] The entire faculty of National Jiaotong University, in an appeal to demand improved treatment, specifically telegraphed Chairman Chiang, the Second Plenary Session, President Soong, and Education Minister Zhu, stating: "To Chairman Chiang of the Nationalist Government, the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, President Soong of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Zhu of Education: The treatment of professors at national universities is indeed meager, and their living conditions are exceptionally difficult during the war. They have endured and persevered. Now that the war of resistance has been won and reconstruction is underway, in this age of atomic energy, everything depends on science. The responsibility of higher education is therefore particularly significant. The Chairman has also repeatedly emphasized the importance of education. However, the monthly income of professors is only two-thirds that of laborers at national banks. Other business institutions provide various forms of subsidies to improve living conditions, such as additional meals, extra months of pay, or cost-of-living allowances. Even civil servants, who are also public employees, often receive benefits in kind. Professors, however, only receive a meager monthly income in legal tender. We do not consider the treatment of other professions to be excessively high and in need of reduction. In fact, such higher treatment is somewhat more reasonable. However, the treatment of professors in our country is excessively unreasonable. It is a common practice in all countries to treat professors well, and their income is invariably among the highest in the nation. In the United States, professors' salaries are determined by the professors themselves. Countries like the Soviet Union and Germany, mindful of the significant mission they bear, provide ample support. We sincerely appeal for improvement because our income is truly insufficient to cover our expenses and we cannot continue to make ends meet. Therefore, we urge a practical solution within the month of March, otherwise, we will be forced to collectively abandon teaching and seek alternative employment. This urgent telegram conveys our pressing situation. Respectfully, the Faculty Association of National Jiaotong University." Attached are suggestions for improving treatment: (1) Multiply the first one hundred yuan of salary by the cost-of-living index. (2) For every fifty yuan above one hundred yuan, multiply by a certain percentage of the cost-of-living index, making it progressively reduced.

Middle School Teachers Telegram for Relief

Otherwise, they will take practical action and have already organized the Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Association.

Besides disseminating this order, we hereby instruct you to comply. Any deliberate violation will be dealt with according to law."

### Capital Temporary University Student Case: Prosecutor Proposes Suspended Sentence, Debate Concludes, Verdict on March 6th

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] The eight student representatives involved in the Capital Temporary University disturbance have been released on bail. The investigative court was held ten days ago and the investigation of the facts has been completed. On the afternoon of February 27th, at 2:00 PM, the Capital District Court held a debate. Three judges, one prosecutor, one clerk, and eight defense lawyers for the defendants were present. Four hundred people attended the hearing. The court session opened at 2:30 PM and adjourned at 9:00 PM. The judges charged the students with gathering to threaten, obstructing official duties, and obstructing freedom. The students stated the circumstances of the day, and the lawyers defended them, arguing that they did not obstruct Wang's official duties at the time and that Wang went to the Ministry of Education voluntarily, not under the students' threats, ultimately arguing that they were not guilty. However, the judges examined the actual circumstances at the time of the incident and the results of the investigation and still intended to pursue legal action. After a lengthy debate, the prosecutor stood up and suggested that the students were completely driven by their desire for academic pursuits and that the unfortunate incident, although a transgression, was motivated by pure intentions and had no other purpose, which was excusable. He requested that the presiding judge invoke the relevant provisions of the criminal law to grant a suspended sentence. After further debate by the lawyers, the presiding judge announced the conclusion of the debate, adjourned the court, and scheduled the verdict for March 6th. According to general observation, if the students are found guilty but given a suspended sentence, the students will be nominally subject to criminal restrictions, and they will be deprived of their civil rights and unable to participate in elections during the term of the sentence. However, since the sentence is suspended, the criminal sentence will not be executed, and they will still be free to study, which is desirable for both sides in terms of human feelings and legal principles.

### Students from Vocational Schools in Recovered Areas May Participate in Judicial Examinations, But Must Pass Screening

### Communist Party Plans to Establish Northern University in Handan, Southern Hebei

[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] The Communist Party is establishing a new university in Handan, Southern Hebei, called Northern University. The president is Fang Wanlun, a scholar of classical texts for thirty-two years. He graduated from Peking University in 1917 and has served as a professor at Peking University and Sino-French University. Fang plans to combine academic research with practical application at Northern University. Fang told a United Press reporter at the Communist Party headquarters in Beiping that the Communist Party does not advocate abandoning the Four Books and Five Classics, contrary to general rumors. In fact, the Communist Party also pays close attention to the classics in order to discover the meaning of China's current and future development. Northern University will not only conduct scientific research using scientific methods, but will also be complemented by practical experience and application. Students and professors must spend half of their time acquiring practical knowledge and experience in the subjects they are studying, so as to keep up with the ever-changing scientific inventions. In recent years, science and industry have made rapid progress, and China must catch up in order to join the ranks of strong nations. The school will take a completely detached attitude towards the political views of students and professors, as truly progressive education must first have absolute freedom in politics and personal thought. The school intends to embrace both communist and nationalist social organizations, and students and professors who believe in communism may live according to the communist distribution system. Currently, more than 700 students have registered, and ten professors have been hired, but the opening date has not yet been determined. The school is organized into three levels: (1) preparatory courses, so that secondary school students who have not graduated due to living movements in the past few years can make up for it, (2) four-year undergraduate programs, and (3) graduate schools.

### National Education and Local Self-Government

— Lu Guanliu

In local self-government work, in addition to organizing security and public health, the most important thing is to promote national education. Therefore, there is a cultural education section in the organization of the administrative region to preside over education work, which shows that the responsible persons of each district have the obligation to promote national education. There are more detailed regulations in the new county system, and the government's performance in national education in each district is set as one of the criteria for assessment, because local self-government and national education are the basic works of our country. In places where local self-government work is completed, the implementation of national education is easy to have good results. In places where national education is developed, local self-government work is also easy to carry out. The two complement each other and are inseparable.

Now that the administrative districts of this city have been established one after another, and the household survey is coming to an end, most of the district chiefs have taken the reorganization of security and the promotion of education as their responsibility after taking office, which is really a good phenomenon. Although the national education work in many districts is now being actively promoted, there are still a few district government personnel who do not know where to start in promoting national education, so there are no corresponding achievements yet.

(1) During the household survey, the number of literate people and the number of out-of-school people should be surveyed at the same time. How many middle school students are there in this district? How many out-of-school adults are there? These should be surveyed clearly one by one. On the one hand, it can clarify the education situation in this district, and on the other hand, it can be used to prepare for the implementation of national education, so that the illiteracy in this district will be completely eliminated one day.

(2) In addition to the household survey, attention should also be paid to the school survey. How many schools are there in this district? Can the number of schools in this district meet the actual needs? If there are too few schools, then ways should be found to increase them. How is the distribution of schools? If the distribution is uneven, ways should be found to adjust it.

(3) The public land and public property in this district should also be surveyed. Because there must be public land and temple houses to run schools; there must be public property and public funds to have school funds. This is also very important for the development of national education.

(4) National schools are also called public schools. The source of funds, in addition to government appropriations, should also be raised automatically by local people. Therefore, the person in charge of the district office should try to promote enthusiastic education and public welfare people in this district to organize a National Education Funding Committee to serve as the funds for national education in this district, and must raise funds for the expansion of equipment.

(5) There is also the obligation to supervise and guide the schools that have been run in this district, because the quality of the schools has a great relationship with the future of the educated children. Therefore, schools that are run seriously and have excellent results should be encouraged, and schools that are run poorly should also be corrected. At the same time, we should cooperate in promoting the work of educational research in this district, so that the progress of education in this district can be rapid.

Education is the most important department in the work of national construction. It is very important for the career of individual children and the future of the country and society. It is hoped that those in charge of local self-government will pay attention to it actively, strive to improve it, and determine a plan to implement it in stages, so that the education business can have a day of rapid progress.

### Football Postponed, Basketball As Usual: Three Games Tonight

The fine rain all day long made it impossible for the football league to proceed, thus this week's ball game has become a desolate situation. Fortunately, the basketball game can be held as usual, which is a consolation. There will still be three games in the stadium ball room on South Shaanxi Road starting at 5:30 this afternoon. The women's V Team will compete with Qinglian, the second division A will be Ren Yu vs. V Team, and the last game of the first division A will be Jiangwan vs. Blue Team. Although the three games are not the most exciting, the strengths of each team are similar, and there is hope for a fierce battle at that time.

The women's V Team has won three of the five games in the league, while Qinglian has won two of the five games, and the results are close. This game is related to the fourth seat, and Xu Peizhen, the former record of Qinglian, has made rapid progress and has good prospects. If she can play well today, the V Team will be greatly threatened.

Ren Yu and V Team, the former has the ambition to win the championship, while the latter has lost all five games. The hope of winning is indeed Ren Yu, and the spirit of resistance of the V Team, the score will never be too far behind.

Jiangwan meets the Blue Team, Jiangwan team is in the league, it is difficult to take care of things at the same time, and once suffered a poisonous hand from the Shan team, and the battle with Tengke was also judged as a change, so there are currently two losses on record, and the strength is difficult to beat the Blue Team, there will also be a fierce battle. The order of the three games is recorded as follows:

V Team—Qinglian (Women's Group) 5:30 PM Ren Yu—V Team (Second Division A) 6:15 PM Jiangwan—Blue Team (First Division A) 7:15 PM

Movies and Theater

### The Problem of Writers' Livelihoods

— Tang Shaohua

The issue of improving the livelihoods of writers has been raised by many and has attracted some attention from society. Theater and film writers can originally be considered as a part of the writers' circle, so rather than discussing the issue of theater and film writers' livelihoods alone, it is better to discuss the livelihoods of writers more broadly. Indeed, writers in society are known as "intellectuals" or "cultural figures," but the hardship of their lives is beyond description. They bury themselves in their desks all day, gripping their pens tightly, racking their brains, but can only write a few thousand words. If "writing is hated by fate" and they are rejected everywhere, the whole family will starve. Or if they are fortunate enough to be adopted, how many liters of rice can the royalties they receive buy? Therefore, society should pay attention to the issue of writers' livelihoods. To put it more bluntly, the fate of writers has now reached the dividing line between life and death!

Furthermore, culture is the soul of society, and writers are the supporters of this soul. We cannot allow writers' lives to fall into hardship, even to the point where they can hardly sustain themselves. Therefore, we should support improving writers' livelihoods. In addition, the respect for writers and the value of their works are equally important issues. At the same time, a writer should stand on their own post, exert all their abilities, and take on the task of promoting social culture and enlightening civilized thought. During the period of national reconstruction today, they should also promote the principles of national and ethnic revival and reconstruction for the country and the nation, and awaken the whole people to jointly save the national destiny. Especially important is that they should have a spirit of great fearlessness, able to achieve the transcendent and unique will of "being incorruptible by wealth and status, unyielding in poverty, and unbowed by force." In order to be loyal to their own tasks, they must sacrifice the individual for the benefit of the whole, placing their own welfare below the welfare of the masses. The writer's pen must become the vanguard of the masses, or the helmsman who promotes society. No matter how harsh the environment or how violent the abduction, they must resolutely and stubbornly carry out their own work, to show the true color of talent and the noble personality of a writer. Therefore, the issue of improving writers' livelihoods will not affect the spirit that writers should have.

However, many people who claim to be writers now have actually forgotten their own tasks and duties, and are good at flaunting their integrity. They only talk about flowers and the moon, and never talk about world affairs. Even worse, they become megaphones or echo bugs, confusing black and white, distorting right and wrong, and using their identity as writers to put up the signboard of "progress," "freedom," and "democracy" to slander the authorities or lure young people to a path of depravity. Then, are such writers worth improving their livelihoods? — And their lives may be more luxurious than ordinary people — I would like to tell my dear writers that if you want to take on the task of promoting social culture, you must first abandon those wild ideas, stand on the position of the country above all else, the nation above all else, explore the truth, build a new culture, and then discuss improving your lives. Only then will you not be putting the cart before the horse!

### The Artistic Creation of Actors

— Yin Yan

Although China's theatrical art has passed its infancy, it is still quite far from reaching maturity. To be precise, Chinese theatrical art is still learning to walk and has not yet been able to stand firmly. It cannot be denied that our theater has produced many excellent actors in recent years. However, the fact is that most of these excellent actors are groping around with their natural talent. The rigorous experience and knowledge they have gained are inevitably too fragmented and too abstract. And I believe that the problems that actors must study at present should be more concrete and fundamental.

At this stage, the artistic creation of actors seems to be stuck in the imitation of general human nature. In the performances we see at present, the characters created by the actors generally feel very thin, and few can create archetypes. Generally speaking, perhaps it is because life is not rich enough. On the other hand, I think it is because they have not grasped the diversity and complexity of human life forms. The grasp of a character's personality should emphasize the principle of originating internally and manifesting externally.

Actors in artistic creation often fail to integrate the materials extracted from life, and instead use fragmented materials as the basis for imitation. However, the creation of an archetype is by no means based solely on the imitation of a very small number of people in real life, but rather on our correct artistic understanding, refining the most concrete forms of various qualities from many people and integrating them. To put it clearly, we are prone to directly imitating fragments of life and calling this realistic imitation art. I think this judgment is wrong. Sculptor W.W. Story said, "Art becomes art because it is not nature—so the most perfect imitation of nature cannot be considered art. Art is a mirror of the spirit, and the nature reflected in it carries various emotions from the spirit." Famous painter J. La Farge put it more succinctly: "Art is the world in the artist's eye." Poet Goethe also said: "The only reason why a work of art is allowed to exist is that it is different from nature." In summary, all works called art are by no means a simple imitation of the object. We should not forget the "role of the heart." We should imitate the images that are awakened by the object in our hearts and tailored.

So, what is the criterion for the artistic creation of actors? Aristotle said it well: "The creation of the highest art not only appeals to emotion, but also to reason." The harmony of emotion and reason is the criterion for our artistic creation of actors. Air Henry Irving also said: "The actor should fully express the thoughts and emotions created by the poet, and to achieve this, he must fully understand these thoughts and emotions." Another is the experienced French dramatist B.C. Coquelin, who emphasized practice. He said: "What becomes the art of acting is the creation of that living archetype, which is the most humane of all arts, therefore I think that is art, in other words, that is the blending of the 'poetic' charm and the 'ideal' image in the expression of reason." In summary, poetry and philosophy are the sources of all art, and the artistic creation of actors is also based on and promotes poetry and philosophy.

"Poetry" can help actors create imagination, and "imagination" is the actor's greatest asset. Without imagination, there is no creation. When an actor is dealing with his character, he should learn from the poet in dealing with his material; concentrate his thoughts on a specific aspect of life. Following the concentration of thought, a kind of emotion is immediately aroused, and at the same time many images are gathered. Under the excitement of these emotions, the images are gradually brightened up by means of synthesis, and definite forms are obtained to simulate the various colors of life. These images are governed by our will, and aided by the inspiration of virtue and talent. In this way, the artistic creation of actors will gradually become appropriate and enriched.

Philosophy seems at first glance to have no deep connection with the artistic creation of actors, but in fact, drama is the expression of life, and actors must naturally understand life. To understand it, they must start with philosophy. The connotation of life is complex and diverse. It is the confluence of various human wills and the crystallization of history and environment. If we want to explore its essence, we must find perfect tools, and philosophy is the most ideal tool. At the same time, the significance of our drama is not only in expressing life, but also in indicating the way of life; in depth, our task is not only to interpret the world, but also to change the world. What is the right path? Only philosophy can help us find it.

Philosophy helps us grasp the theme and create archetypes. It enables us to determine the character's outlook on life, and this understanding of the outlook on life is the solid backbone of building archetypes.

From another perspective, art of the highest value must contain a kind of "eternal will," which is the soul of beauty, the highest expression and joy of the artist's life. Painting uses canvas, music uses music, and literature uses words to convey its "eternal will." But our art of actors is limited by time and almost loses its "eternal will." More clearly, sculpture and architecture resist time with their own presence and express their indelible "eternal will." But our art of actors is limited by time and almost loses its "eternal will." However, if we lose it, how empty will our hard-working artistic creators be! Then how will we capture the eternal will that will be swept away by time? The eternal will of our acting art is the truth we express. It lives forever in humanity, with its stubborn will, impressing the hearts of tens of thousands of viewers. They will use it to transform the world, improve life, and give direct influence to history, so that future generations will benefit from it and pass it on to infinity. Therefore, we must further study philosophy and explore the truth in order to transmit the "eternal will" of our artistic creation.

In summary, actors should learn from poetry and philosophy. They can make our artistic creation more substantial and rich. Poetry is the blood and flesh of our artistic creation, and philosophy is the backbone of our artistic creation. They can make our theatrical art stand more firmly.

### About Historical Films

— Lai Ming

There have been many works containing historical elements in films, but the significance contained in each historical film work varies greatly due to the differences in each period. If we examine it closely, we can explore the differences in historical films in each period.

Today, historical films are appearing one after another in China and abroad. As for historical films in our country, the materials are especially rich, because there are thousands of years of history, which is enough for the historical facts needed in films. However, there is a great lack of relatively true historical films in our country. One reason is of course the lack of talent, and the other is that the knowledge of our people is relatively shallow. For example, the film "Confucius" in the past, although it was a historical film very suitable for scholars, could not be understood by most audiences, which is a very obvious example. The country with the most historical films should be Germany in the past. After the First World War, Germany declined to the extreme, and the people sought historical films that contained romance, that is, romance novels. This was the historical film of that period. After the Nazis seized power, the film was inevitably stained with the heroic color of the Nazis as a propaganda goal, and it was also used as education for the people to be mixed up. Secondly, the Soviet Union, which was the first country to nationalize films, also used the glorious historical films of socialism to encourage the people. As for the number of historical films in the United States, it has long been famous in various countries around the world.

However, historical films must be infected by criticism. In order to stand at the forefront of correcting historical factual errors, we must examine its skewed propaganda to prevent the intrusion of fake historical films into the audience.

### The Origin of the March 3rd Friends' Day

— Yong Wang

It is said, "At home, rely on parents; when out, rely on friends." This shows that friends are very important. I hereby suggest that the central government stipulate that March 3rd of each year be "Friends' Day" to arouse the people's attention to the way of making friends, how to make friends, what kind of friends to make, and how to treat friends. The purpose and methods are briefly described below, hoping that people from all walks of life will cooperate to promote it and give corrections. (1) Purpose: Everyone feels that human beings need mutual assistance and cooperation. The current society needs to revive morality. Launching "Friends' Day" is to make compatriots across the country speak of integrity, value morality, and keep promises, especially among friends. Everyone should cooperate and help each other, promote the movement of good etiquette, make good friends, be loyal to friends, and should be responsible for persuading friends if they have improper behavior, and should help sick friends. (2) Methods: On "March 3rd Friends' Day," newspapers publish special issues or more articles about making friends, various groups hold symposiums; schools hold lectures and recreational activities; families hold dinner parties or tea parties; individuals write to friends at home and abroad, reporting on their recent situations, or discussing academics and careers, or sending letters of greetings. "March 3rd Friends' Day" is promoted uniformly across the country, carrying out friend-benefiting undertakings, cultivating good friendship between friends, and carrying out public welfare and charitable undertakings for the country and society.
