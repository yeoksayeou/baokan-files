### Negotiations on the Northeast Problem in Chongqing: Marshall Meets with Zhou Enlai

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] Since General Marshall's return to Chongqing two days ago, he has held two talks with Chairman Chiang and negotiated with President of the Executive Yuan, Soong Tzu-wen, on the Sino-American loan issue. Apart from these, there have been no political interactions. With military conflicts in the Northeast escalating daily, Marshall's calm demeanor is drawing much attention. However, he hosted a tea party at Yiyuan today, inviting representatives from the government and various parties. This is Marshall's first gathering with representatives of various opposition parties in China since his return to Chongqing, where they will exchange views on current military and political issues in China. Besides attending the banquet and meeting guests, Marshall spent the rest of his time studying the report of the Military Mediation Team's representatives to the Northeast with General Gillem.

[United Press, Chongqing, 21st] General Marshall has arranged a meeting with General Zhou Enlai for 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd, which will be their first meeting since Marshall's return to China. Communist Party sources privately admitted that they were surprised by Marshall's reluctance to immediately involve himself in decisive negotiations. Marshall spent the weekend quietly at Chairman Chiang's residence in Eagle Rock. He dined with President Soong this evening and will attend a cocktail party hosted by the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in China tomorrow.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] To introduce Special Envoy Marshall and his wife to people from all walks of life in the temporary capital, U.S. Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Smyth held a cocktail party at No. 4 Jialing New Village from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. today, inviting people from all walks of life in the temporary capital to attend.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 21st] The Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters is awaiting instructions from the Chongqing Three-Person Group. Marshall and others are in Chongqing discussing ways to resolve the Northeast disputes. It is expected that instructions for the Three-Person Group will arrive in Beiping within a few days, enabling the executive team in the Northeast to take action. After the executive team's tasks are clarified, more teams will be sent to the Northeast. The Military Mediation Department does not appear likely to send teams immediately after the Soviet withdrawal from Harbin and Qiqihar.

### National Army Closes in on Gongzhuling; Communist Party Claims American Planes Strafe Siping Street; Military Affairs Commission Spokesperson Denies Fabrication

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] It is reported that the vanguard of the National Army has approached Gongzhuling. The Communist Army has assembled 50,000 to 60,000 troops there, preparing for a fierce battle. General Du Yuming is scheduled to inspect the front lines in person on the 25th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Chongqing Dispatch: The situation in Harbin has suddenly become tense. The Communist Army will immediately occupy Harbin after the Soviet withdrawal. Judging from the situation, the National Army only occupies points and lines, while the Communist Army is engaged in area development. The National Army moving from Shenyang to Changchun is now encountering difficulties, and the New First Army in Siping Street is also being threatened by the Communist Army. Because the government receiving officials in Harbin have no troops, some of them have left Harbin for Shenyang. The government may abandon Harbin.

[Agence France-Presse, Shenyang, 20th] Responsible sources report that Harbin is effectively under Communist control. Therefore, the safety of the few government officials remaining there when the Soviet Army withdraws from the city on the 25th is questionable. Mayor Yang is one of the officials staying to hold his post, preparing to receive Harbin from the Soviet Army and hosting a farewell banquet for the Soviet Army on the 21st. However, it is generally expected that Harbin's fate will be the same as Changchun's: the Communist Party will establish its regime after the Soviet withdrawal. Yesterday, a government plane flew over Changchun, reporting that traffic in the city has almost returned to normal.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 21st] With only five days until the Soviet withdrawal from Harbin, the situation in the suburbs is quite tense. Communist sources say that 1,500 National Army troops are retreating from Changchun towards Gongzhuling and are being pursued. Five American journalists and Army Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Legas are reported to be safe and sound.

[United Press, Chongqing, 21st] Communist anti-American propaganda is intensifying. Today, they again accused American planes of attacking Communist troops in the Siping Street area on the 17th and 19th. On the 19th, one plane was shot down, and it included "one American soldier." Most observers believe this news is inaccurate because American pilots have been ordered to be extremely cautious in Communist-held areas, and weekly flights departing from Shenyang have been prohibited. A government spokesperson believes that this news is deliberately fabricated. He stated that no American planes entered this area, and Americans never fly Chinese planes. Lieutenant General Gillem, Marshall's representative, revealed that the Executive Headquarters had not received any objections from the Communist Party regarding aerial activities. However, Gillem has asked the U.S. Air Force Command to report on U.S. activities in the past week and whether a plane has gone missing.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 21st] The U.S. military headquarters here stated that they would not deny the Communist Party's spokesperson's claim that American planes strafed Siping Street before the facts were investigated. It is claimed that, except for one American plane carrying Major Legas to Changchun, no other American planes flew to that area. Since Special Envoy Marshall returned to China, the Communist side has launched a major attack against the United States, such as: (1) Opposing U.S. assistance to the National Army in deploying to the Northeast; (2) Opposing the use of Lend-Lease Act materials and surplus U.S. military equipment to strengthen the National Army; (3) Strongly opposing U.S. assistance in training the Chinese Air Force, especially bomber squadrons. In addition, the Communist Party opposes financial aid from the United States and other Allied nations to the government. It is claimed that lending to China at this time will only maintain a reactionary dictatorial government. Special Envoy Marshall will hold discussions with all parties in China after spending the weekend in Lin Yuan, but the date for the formal meeting of the Three-Person Group has not yet been decided.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission made a statement on the 21st, saying that the Communist Party's newspaper, Chongqing Xinhua Daily, published a report today that American planes strafed Siping Street, which is purely fabricated. Upon investigation, there are no U.S. Air Force units in the Northeast at all. The newspaper's claim that American planes strafed Siping Street and that a plane was shot down is entirely intentional rumor-mongering to confuse the public.

### Communist Party Establishes Railway Administration in Eastern Nine Provinces

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] The Communist Party has independently established the East Manchuria Railway Administration in the eastern part of the Eastern Nine Provinces, with five branch bureaus under it: Meihekou, Tonghua, Jilin, Lafa, and Chaoyangchuan. It governs the Jilin-Shenyang (Fushun to Jilin), Mei-Ji (Meihekou to Ji'an), Si-Mei (Sipingjie to Meihekou), Chang-Tu (Changchun to Tumen River), La-Ha (Lafa to Harbin), and Tu-Mu (Tumen to Mudanjiang) main lines. According to the Communist side, except for the Wuchang to Harbin and Tumen to Mudanjiang sections, which are not yet open to traffic, and the Fushun-Qingyuan and Changchun-Jilin sections, which are suspended, the remaining 3,000 li are fully open to traffic.

### Taiyuan Sends Liaison Team to Pingyao and Other Counties for Mediation; Northern Section of Datong-Pukou Railway Damaged

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] The government representative Hu Xiangli, the Communist representative Zhang Xiqin, and their entourage from the Taiyuan Central Team liaison group of the Military Mediation Department departed by car at 9:00 a.m. on the 21st, heading south to first go to Pingyao, then to Jiexiu, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, and Lingshi counties for mediation. Also, the Houma team decided to go to Wenxi to inspect the besieged situation and discuss ways to supply materials on the spot.

[Another Dispatch] At around 1:00 a.m. on the 14th, six electric poles were sawed down by Communist troops and more than 600 meters of electric wire were cut off at a location 140 kilometers from Qianseyang Fangkou on the northern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway.

### Explosion at Ammunition Depot in Zhenjiang; Chairman Wang Reports the Incident in Wuxi

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 21st] The No. 116 Field Ammunition Depot of the Logistics Department caught fire at 7:00 p.m. on the 20th, and the sounds of gun and artillery explosions shook the hills, not stopping until 7:00 a.m. on the 21st. The details are as follows: (1) The cause of the fire is said to be either that the car driver left a candle burning while refueling with gasoline or that it was the work of strategists plotting planned destruction. (2) According to unconfirmed estimates, two to three thousand artillery shells and about 200 tons of bullets were burned. (3) The guarding officers and soldiers are being strictly interrogated by the 57th Division. (4) Deputy Division Commander Yang went to the explosion site to comfort the affected people.

### Bank of China Entrusted with Collecting and Exchanging Fake United Reserve Bank Notes by Hebei Post Office

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Financial circles report that the government has stipulated that the deadline for collecting and exchanging banknotes issued by the fake Central United Reserve Bank is May 7th and will not be extended. The total amount of fake United Reserve Bank notes issued reached more than 142.9 billion yuan. The Tianjin and Beiping branches of the Central Bank have already collected 80 billion yuan, less than two-thirds of the total. The remaining more than 60 billion yuan of fake United Reserve Bank notes are mostly scattered in remote areas of Hebei and Shandong provinces. This is because the Communist army is disrupting transportation, making it difficult to concentrate for exchange. It is heard that the government, to reduce the losses of the people, has ordered the Central Bank to entrust the Hebei Postal Administration to exchange as much as possible in various places, and it is currently being rushed.

### A Record of the Relief of Suiyuan and Baotou

— Special Correspondent Yong Zi

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou Airmail] After Japan surrendered last autumn, General Fu Zuoyi, commander of the 12th War Area (see photo), with extremely agile action, advanced from the Huanxi rear area, where he had fought bitterly for eight years, to Guihua and Baotou within a week. Because the soldiers were well-trained and moved quickly, he soon occupied all counties in Suiyuan Province. At the same time, Deputy Commander Ma Zhanshan was ordered to lead his troops from Halasei in northern Shaanxi into the Shuhu area under the jurisdiction of the 11th War Area, and Deputy Commander Deng Baoshan also arrived in Guihua from Yulin, where he had been stationed for eight years, to ask for instructions.

On Double Tenth National Day, the people of Suiyuan Province enthusiastically celebrated the first festival after the victory of the War of Resistance, and also congratulated General Fu on the recovery of Suiyuan territory. Unfortunately, immediately after this celebration, bad news spread one after another, and then alarms were raised in various parts of Suiyuan Province. Ma Zhanshan led his troops to Datong, where his advance was blocked. There was also contact in Suiyuan, Fengzhen, Liangcheng, and other counties. The prelude to the great war began on October 16th. The Communist army was attacking, and the National Army was defending. The beacon fires on the border suddenly broke through everyone's joyous and exciting emotions.

The troops transferred by the Communist army from northern Shanxi and Chahar became more and more numerous and were elite troops, including those of He Long, Xiao Ke, Nie Rongzhen, etc., totaling about 200,000 people. The Suiyuan troops of the 12th War Area had no choice but to give up several county towns first and retreat to Jining, an important town in eastern Suiyuan. Commander Fu, on the one hand, appealed to the people of the country to stop the civil war, but on the other hand, prepared for any eventuality and made strategic deployments. As a result, the Communist army's offensive became more fierce, and Jining was also evacuated. Guihua and Baotou were finally besieged.

In the Suiyuan battle that lasted more than two months, the two famous cities of Guihua and Baotou were besieged for a full 58 days. The Communist army besieged the city very rapidly. General Deng Baoshan originally wanted to return to Yulin but did not have time to leave the city and had to work with Commander Fu to defend the city walls of Guihua. General Dong Qiwu was responsible for defending Baotou, as was Chairman Feng Qinzai, who was passing through Baotou to Chahar. He Long personally commanded the Communist army's attack on the city. When the attack on Guihua failed, they attacked Baotou again. Both cities had fierce battles. It is said that in an emergency in the western suburbs of Guihua's old city, Commander Fu personally went to the front line, raised his arms to supervise the battle, and shouted loudly to the soldiers: "I am Commander Fu, rush forward!" As a result, the Communist army was defeated, and from then on, the Communist army reorganized its forces and shifted its target to Baotou for another siege, which also failed. Moreover, He Long himself was seriously injured in the suburbs of Baotou.

After the siege of Suiyuan and Baotou was lifted, Commander Fu, together with Deputy Commander Deng, took a flight from Beiping to Chongqing to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The reporters met with them in Lanzhou on their way back. Commander Fu did not consider the victory in this Suiyuan battle to be glorious. On the contrary, he felt very sad in his heart. He did not want any more civil wars to happen, but he hoped that the people of the country would clearly distinguish between right and wrong and see who was fighting whom. When Deputy Commander Deng saw He Long in Beiping, he smiled and said to He, "When we were besieged, the weather was so cold, we really wanted to invite you to come into the city for a meal of youmian ('youmian' is a Suiyuan specialty), but you kept fighting." He Long did not respond. (April 11)

### Chen Gongbo Appears Dejected; His Wife Writes Defense in Prison; Sends Son to Suzhou to Submit Request for Review

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] After Chen Gongbo was sentenced to death by the Suzhou High Court, his wife, Li Lizhuang, heard the news in prison in Nanjing. Disagreeing with the verdict, she wrote a request for a review in prison on his behalf and ordered her son, Chen Gan, to go to Suzhou and submit it to the High Court for forwarding to the Supreme Court at 5:00 p.m. on the 20th. After receiving this news, the reporter went to Wu Zhong Hotel No. 3, Daoqian Street today to investigate and learned that Chen Gan, under the alias Chen Lin, went to the detention center at 9:00 a.m. on the 21st to visit his father and presented the draft for his review. Chen was very dejected and said sadly to his son, "My death is not far off, there is no need to do this." Chen Gan heard this and tears flowed down his cheeks. He was stopped by the bailiffs before he could leave.

[Our Newspaper, Special Correspondent in Suzhou, 21st] Chen Gongbo repeatedly stated that he did not want to appeal on the day of his trial and sentencing. However, the Suzhou High Court suddenly received a request for review written by Chen's wife, Li Lizhuang, on behalf of Chen in prison in the capital, which was quite unexpected. According to the document, which was sent by Chen's son, Chen Gan, to the High Court for forwarding to the Supreme Court, the reasons for disagreeing with the High Court's verdict are divided into four points: (1) The case was only tried for six hours before the debate was declared over. Important key points of the case and evidence favorable to the defendant were not fully investigated. The document revealed that Chen had used the alias "Zhou Jin" to establish a relationship with the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) since 1940, expressing his support for Chairman Chiang and secretly working for the central government. Xu Tianshen and Chen Zhongping, MIB comrades in charge of contact, can prove this. The MIB had repeatedly sent secret telegrams, instructing him to cover underground workers, protect radio stations, and report on the contents of the secret agreements and negotiations between Wang and the enemy, and also gave instructions on anti-communist matters. "It can be seen that the defendant's loyalty to the country and the nation, his sincerity in supporting the Chairman, and his various measures to preserve the three southeastern provinces and promote national unity are indispensable." (2) The public defender never met the defendant before the trial. Because he did not understand the case and could not know the facts, evidence, and witnesses favorable to the defendant, he could not fully defend him, which was tantamount to a mere formality. "The benefits that the defendant should have received under the law have all been deprived. What fairness can be said about the trial?" (3) The defendant protected the MIB radio station and bailed out central government workers. In military terms, in addition to cooperating with Director Dai, he also contacted Gu Zhutong and He Zhuguo, which shows that he had no intention of resisting the government but was in fact enduring humiliation for the country, preserving the southeastern provinces, and following central government orders. "Even if he does not dare to claim credit for it, he should at least be given leniency in sentencing." (4) After the defendant left Chongqing, he personally sent a letter to Chairman Chiang, expressing his grievances and subsequent remedies, which can be regarded as an expression of surrender. After contacting the MIB in 1940, there were many exchanges and reports, which is even more in line with the surrender regulations. The original court did not cite the surrender regulations to reduce or exempt the sentence but sentenced him to death, which he does not accept. Furthermore, the Suzhou Dahua News has recently published fallacies sympathizing with Chen, which has been strongly refuted by other newspapers here today.

### Capital High Court to Install Electrical Appliances; Trial of Traitors to be Broadcast Everywhere

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Capital High Court recently sent a letter to the Central Broadcasting Station, requesting the speedy installation of broadcasting equipment so that the trial proceedings can be broadcast everywhere when the work of trying traitors begins. It is reported that the High Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Mei Siping for days, and is now searching for evidence and investigating his property in many ways. The public trial will be held on the first of this month. The trials of traitors Lin Baisheng and Li Shengwu will also begin separately in the coming days. In addition, the High Court has reached an agreement with a certain military authority regarding the detention center at No. 15 Ninghai Road, where the traitors were originally detained, and it has agreed to hand over the entire premises to the High Court for management. The handover procedures are currently underway.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 21st] The High Court opened a special investigation court yesterday to interrogate Lu Yiwen, the former puppet Manchukuo ambassador to Germany. Lu quibbled in many ways during the interrogation and admitted, "I really messed up."

[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 20th] The case of the puppet Shimen Mayor Guan Xishan has been concluded by the Fifth Branch of the Hebei High Court. Recently, the court detailed Guan's crimes of resisting the motherland and harming the people during the War of Resistance and filed a public prosecution. The court has been asked to handle the case with witnesses and letters.

### Three Gorges Hydropower Development Work: Concrete Plans Finalized, Savage Embarks on Return to America to Negotiate Everything

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] World hydropower authority Mr. Savage is scheduled to fly to America on the 21st. This reporter specially interviewed Mr. Qian Changzhao, Vice Chairman of the National Resources Commission, to inquire about the purpose of Mr. Savage's visit to China this time. According to him, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will assist the commission in designing the Three Gorges hydropower development project, which will officially commence on June 1st of this year. However, to coordinate with the design work, the geological conditions of the dam site and sluice gate locations must be explored through on-site drilling, and the entire reservoir must also be surveyed aerially. Mr. Savage's trip is to negotiate with the commission regarding the implementation of drilling and aerial surveying, as well as methods for Chinese engineers to participate in the design. Everything has now been concretely decided. Mr. Savage flew to Chongqing on the 26th of last month and stayed briefly at the National Hydropower Engineering Office of the commission in the Yangtze River. He then accompanied Director Huang Yuxian of the office by boat to Yichang, where he took small boats daily to the vicinity of Nanjin Pass at the Three Gorges exit, climbing mountains and surveying the dam site along the river for five days. Despite his advanced age of 68, he did not spare himself from hardship, which is truly admirable. From Yichang to Hankou, Mr. Savage also inspected the situation of the Yichang-Hankou waterway by boat. After arriving in Hankou, he flew to Nanjing. Mr. Qian happened to return from Taiwan at this time, and after discussing the matter, he felt even more confident that there were no technical problems with the Three Gorges development, and he had even greater faith in the various benefits after the development. Before leaving America, Mr. Savage had drawn eight artistic projection drawings of the Three Gorges sluice gate, dam, power plant, tunnels, etc., as well as how giant ships and small boats would pass through the gate, how electricity would be generated, and how floods would be discharged, so that even those unfamiliar with engineering could understand the entire layout and operation by looking at these projection drawings. Unfortunately, due to excessive baggage, he was unable to bring them. Mr. Savage has now telegraphed America to send the original plates to China by air. After the commission receives them, they will be printed and made public to the masses. Mr. Qian also mentioned that the Yellow River in China is the most severely afflicted by floods. In reality, the total amount of each flood is not very large. In this era of scientific advancement, it should not be allowed to flood as before. Mr. Savage was very interested in this issue and very much wished to apply his fifty years of experience in water management to conduct detailed research. When Mr. Savage comes to China for the third time in October of this year, if circumstances permit, he will personally inspect the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River and the Jing-Wei River basin.

### Election of National Assembly Representatives in Peiping Creates Disturbances

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 21st] The election of National Assembly representatives in this city has been delayed and has already caused some disputes. According to official explanations, occupational representatives cannot be elected because the Chamber of Commerce has just been reorganized, and the work of the farmers' and workers' associations has not yet been put on the right track. In terms of regional representatives, the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau convened the fifteen district chiefs of the city on the eighth of last month to elect sixty candidates for National Assembly representatives, including Chen Yuan. In the future, citizens who have been sworn in can select National Assembly representatives from the above sixty candidates. Currently, because the voter registration lists for each district have not yet been submitted to the election office, representatives have not yet been elected. However, this method of generating regional representatives has aroused dissatisfaction among some people here. Some magazines and more than forty student groups in Peiping recently established the Peiping National Assembly Representative Election Promotion Association and put forward five proposals: (1) Cancel the candidates who have already been proposed; (2) The election organization committee should be jointly composed of virtuous people from all parties; (3) Candidates should be fairly proposed jointly by all parties and people's organizations; (4) Cancel the citizen oath, and implement anonymous voting with citizen certificates; (5) Abolish the Baojia system and implement local autonomy.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 21st] Political waves are again surging in Peiping. Today at 2 PM, the National Assembly Representative Election Promotion Association, which opposes the method of district chiefs selecting candidates for Peiping National Assembly representatives, held a speech meeting in the music hall of Zhongshan Park. The speaker was Chen Jinkun, the director of the Peiping branch of Chaoyang University. As soon as the speech began, he was pelted with stones and eggs. Chen's left eye bled profusely. The national flag was also torn down by a Liu Chengyun, who was arrested and sent to the police station. Four people who presided over the speech went missing. Several students who attended the meeting were also injured.

### Most of Changlu and Tanggu Salt Flats Occupied by the Communist Army

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Because of the political situation, three-quarters of the Hangu salt flats under the Changlu Salt Affairs Administration have now been occupied by the Communist army. At the same time, a part of the Dagu salt flats of the Tanggu factory has also fallen into the hands of the Communist army and cannot produce salt. The Hangu salt flats are the largest of the salt flats under Changlu. The work of the salt flats is to allocate salt. Currently, it is impossible to allocate salt, and there will be no salt to produce next year. By then, the people who rely on Changlu salt will have to worry about eating bland food. The result of the Communist army's wanton destruction of coal mine production and salt flat work in various places has aroused extreme hatred among the people.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] The Communist army in the eastern section of the coast forcibly collects salt tax, destroying the national tax system. They forcibly collect salt tax in the name of the "Shandong Binhai District Administration of Industry and Commerce" in Baitabu and in the name of the "Huaibei Liberated Area Administrative Office Finance Department" in Xin'an, with a tax rate of 10,600 yuan per package converted into legal tender.

### Colored Pottery Shards from the Zhou Dynasty Discovered in the Suburbs of Chang'an; Excavated by a Professor from Northwestern University

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd] Professor Wang Ziyun of Northwestern University has recently been engaged in archaeological research in the suburbs of Chang'an. He has excavated many exquisite red and black pottery and colored pottery shards from a layer of gray soil of about several acres in the Northwest Pavilion of Shaolingyuan in the south of the city. Based on the examination of the forms of the various artifacts, it is concluded that this is the site of the ancient Du Bo Kingdom. According to records, Du Bo was a descendant of the Tao Tang clan of Emperor Yao. During the Zhou Dynasty, it was called Tang Du. King Cheng reduced Tang and enfeoffed the Du Bo Kingdom. To this day, the original site still has Du Cheng Town. People generally only see the ancient relics of Qin, Han, and Tang in Chang'an. This discovery can trace the relics of the primitive culture of the Chinese nation before the Three Dynasties. Mr. Wang is currently planning to discuss with the History Department of Northwestern University to engage in large-scale excavation work. It is expected that it will make many contributions to the Chinese historical community.

Editorial

### Another Plea for Chinese Industry!

Our newspaper has editorialized more than once, pointing out the crisis in the future of Chinese industry. Given the recent situation in Shanghai's industrial circles, we believe it is imperative to remedy the situation quickly. Otherwise, industry will not only face hardship, but will virtually head towards a dead end. Just look at the once-splendid textile industry. Recently, fabric and dyeing factories have found it unprofitable, and yarn factories are also gradually realizing that high profits will not last. It is clear that other industries, which originally had little profit to begin with, will have even less room to stand. The perilous state of industry is becoming more and more obvious every day, and no one can deny it. If factories are forced to a point where new openings are extremely rare, while closures are numerous and chaotic, then workers will not be asking for wage increases, but rather for relief funds. The workers' calls will not be for strikes, but for resuming work. If we close our eyes and imagine, it seems a picture is about to emerge: countless factories with smokestacks no longer emitting smoke, and a group of workers crying out for food!

Why has Chinese industry fallen into such a state today? The reasons are complex, and all parties bear responsibility, but the authorities bear the greatest responsibility.

First, the instability of the political situation and the failure to restore transportation have led to the stagnation of goods flow and high prices. This is the greatest evil cause. Who planted this evil cause? Undoubtedly, it is the Chinese Communist Party. For the past eight months, both Chinese and foreign individuals have hoped that China's internal political issues could be resolved through political means. The people have been anticipating this, the government has been working towards it, and friendly nations have been assisting. However, although a ceasefire agreement has been signed, attacks by the Communist army in various locations have never completely stopped. Even in the Northeast, which was not originally included in the military mediation arrangements and should have been taken over by the National Government to reclaim sovereignty, the CCP insisted on mobilizing large forces and taking advantage of the delayed withdrawal of Soviet troops to launch large-scale battles. The work of repairing roads and restoring mines in various locations has also been delayed and has not been realized due to the CCP's breach of contract. Coal production remains weak, and cargo transportation remains stagnant. This situation, coupled with military tension and popular unrest, has caused prices, which were already declining, to rebound due to stimulation. Since the rising trend of prices has not been curbed, workers' demands for wage increases will never end, and factories will eventually be forced to a dead end and have no choice but to close down.

Second, the government has not ceased its efforts to stabilize prices, but its efforts are fragmented and lack a comprehensive plan. Even if there is a plan, it is not necessarily firmly implemented, so that prices have always been in a cycle of large increases and small decreases, and small decreases and large increases, continuously growing higher. This is truly a fatal injury to industry, and workers who rely on wages for a living are especially terrified of price changes. Various prices originally showed a general downward trend in early April, but unfortunately, at this time, public utilities actually had a wild price increase movement! Shanghai's electricity fees have been approved to collect a "coal kilogram surcharge," and tap water has also been approved to collect 120 yuan per cubic meter (excluding the surcharge of 20 yuan). It is rumored that trams and buses will also increase by 200 percent in the coming days, and telephone and train fares may follow suit. We also know that these businesses are running at a loss and cannot continue for long, but we do not understand: why did power companies and others first greatly increase salaries and wages, increasing expenditures? We understand even less: why do these public utilities have to engage in a rotating price increase competition with other goods? Especially incomprehensible: why can't the government think from a larger and longer-term perspective, and temporarily adopt a policy of painfully subsidizing public utilities during the period when prices are trending downwards, so as to avoid their price increases and further stimulate the repeated rebound of other prices? The insane state of affairs in the early days of victory, when the Railway Bureau and the Post Office happened to raise prices, triggering shops to compete to raise prices, is now being re-enacted. How regrettable! It must be known that the income from this kind of public utility price increase is not large, and the government's subsidy savings are ultimately limited, but because they are allowed to raise prices, they directly and indirectly stimulate the repeated increase of general prices, so that the cost of living index in April and May, which could have been hoped to be not high, may not decline, or even still tend to increase, thereby further increasing government expenditures and larger deficits, and further causing workers to suffer from heavier living pressures, higher demands, and general industries to feel more and more unable to operate, only to close down one after another. The damage suffered by the country and society will be incalculable. To govern, one must know the big picture, and especially understand how to do big calculations. Then, based on the insights gained from their high-level and far-sighted vision, they can plan the most beneficial plan for the entire society. Otherwise, if they only know how to haggle over the advantages and disadvantages of small matters, thinking that there is one more income here and one less expenditure there, and then comforting themselves with self-praise, they do not know that they are being penny-wise and pound-foolish, which is precisely the result of this policy. The slight gains from past efforts to stabilize prices and appease labor unrest will also be destroyed by these short-sighted policies without leaving anything behind!

Third, speculative merchants are stirring up trouble, and the government seems to not be earnestly investigating and punishing a few of them, so prices often have unreasonable increases. For example, rice prices in this city had already fallen back in the past half month, generally to 25,000 or 26,000 yuan, but unexpectedly, as soon as large rice loan was approved, rice prices rose instead! Production areas were holding out for higher prices, and merchants were speculating and raising prices. With this large amount of money on the market, they searched and purchased nearby, further stimulating the rice merchants' private desire for profit, and thus an unreasonable rice price increase actually appeared. We have long seen that China currently lacks grain and should import grain from overseas. This point must be strongly argued for internationally no matter what. If they only know how to lend large sums of money to compete for rice in the domestic production areas or even in the rivers and canals of this city, it will not only fail to lower rice prices, but may instead stimulate grain prices in this city due to price increases in the production areas. However, although Director Chiang Ting-fu has been shouting himself hoarse in the United States, asking for assistance to our country's grain, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Anglo-American-Canadian Joint Food Board have repeatedly reduced it, and Britain has even strongly opposed the shipment of surplus grain from Siam to China for assistance. As one of the Allied powers, we have fallen into such an international position after the victory, and can only compete to purchase grain within the domestic mainland, but we have never seen influential figures in society say a word to friendly nations. Originally, borrowing money to buy grain is a good policy and good intention, but because we only buy rice in the mainland, we have instead opened the door for merchants and wholesalers to get rich, and increased the pain of tightening belts and starving for the common people. If the government continues to turn a blind eye and be at a loss, wouldn't it be a big joke? "The people regard food as their heaven." Especially the working class, who consume the most food, if rice prices are not stable, the consumption index will not be low, the labor unrest will not be quelled, and industry will not be stable and prosperous.

Fourth, we must mention the issue of labor discipline. Workers and factories are interdependent, and should not be treated as enemies. In China's current situation, labor and management must cooperate in order to overcome difficulties, revive China's industry, and lay the foundation for China's industrialization. But now, such as the long-term strikes by silk weaving workers, especially the behavior of Yuantong factory workers violently attacking factory owners and employees, and the illegal intrusion of workers from outside the factory or even idle hooligans into the factory to wantonly disrupt, not only violate the discipline that workers should abide by, but also involve disturbing social order. The government has the responsibility to stabilize society and protect enterprises. On this kind of thing, it must not be perfunctory and end with a piece of paper. If we really want to support industry and maintain law and order, then the government should always provide assistance to workers' legal and reasonable demands, and never condone illegal behavior of workers. Those who should be assisted should be assisted, and those who should be punished should be punished. Only then can there be discipline and careers can be managed. Or it is suspected that this may not be understood by workers. In fact, truly sensible and law-abiding workers do not want to destroy China's fragile industrial sprouts and dig their own graves. Removing certain "bad apples" is to protect the peaceful and prosperous life of good workers. Saving factories is saving workers!

Finally, we are willing to talk about the labor movement without avoiding taboos. It is a timely policy for the Kuomintang to support labor. There should be dedicated people in the Kuomintang engaged in the labor movement, which is beyond doubt. Furthermore, from the perspective of the workers themselves, they should organize labor unions according to law with the permission of the government. Factory owners should also understand the general situation and not arbitrarily stop them. However, we must point out that the purpose of the labor movement is to seek welfare for labor. Seek genuine welfare, and never intentionally induce workers to blindly follow with unreasonable demands, ultimately leading them to a dead end without knowing it. Furthermore, the labor movement must get on the right track, and must not use the labor movement as a means for various parties to win over the masses. Parties, groups, political and military forces should closely coordinate on this complex labor movement issue and unify policies. Otherwise, if policies come from multiple sources and orders are inconsistent, it will give an opportunity to those who deliberately sabotage and disrupt the situation. If a "fire" is lit here and a "gate" is opened there, the entire industrial world will be "like water, the deeper it gets, like fire, the more intense it becomes," in constant anxiety. Everyone will not have a good night's sleep, and the workers who truly rely on labor to make a living will eventually all be frowning and complaining about unemployment.

In short: China's current industrial world is oppressed by "low exchange rates and cheap foreign goods," and its manufactured products are already feeling difficult to compete. Furthermore, it is affected by "political instability, failure to restore transportation, unstable prices, and continuous labor unrest," and has almost reached the pain of "lack of maintenance and inability to close." As long as you encounter people in the industrial world, eight or nine out of ten are frowning and sighing, at the end of their rope, which is by no means a minority of people's alarmist talk. As for the general honest and good workers, they also know the fragility of China's industry, and the current treatment of workers is already quite generous. However, after all, reason is less and emotion is more, and it is difficult to avoid being incited by a few short-sighted and selfish people, often going on strike at the slightest provocation, and even extorting by force and violently attacking factory owners, creating a dangerous situation in which work efficiency is generally low and labor discipline is generally lax. If we continue to remain silent on this and do not point out the crisis in the future of Chinese industry, allowing it to continue to act recklessly, calling it "Labor Sacred," the result will actually be no different from digging a trap, causing workers to fall into a deep abyss, and it will be too late to regret it in the future. It is said that the United States wants to find a way to restore the production capacity of Japanese yarn factories to 6 million spindles, and a large number of Japanese prisoners and Japanese expatriates will return to the country. In the near future, Japanese industry will recover its vitality, and China will surely miss this opportunity! We must once again appeal for Chinese industry, that is, appeal for China and the honest and good workers, and request that the government have proper decision-making as soon as possible, supervise and encourage both labor and management to coordinate sincerely, and especially make the industrial world prosper and grow in a society with laws, order, reason, and emotions. If we do not plan for this, but still only focus on provoking antagonism and inciting labor unrest, thinking that this can be considered supporting labor, then we will be going in the opposite direction and will inevitably fail. Those who are stopping the industrialization of China are precisely these people!

### Dark Clouds Have Gathered at the Foreign Ministers Conference. The Soviet Union Expresses a Tough Attitude, Saying That the World Organization Cannot Reach a Decision Without Soviet Participation. Britain and the United States Recognize the Possibility of a Breakup with the Soviet Union.

[United Press, London, 20th] Moscow Radio today stated bluntly: Important issues related to post-war organization, without the participation of the Soviet Union, or with the Soviet Union participating but opposing, cannot be decided. This official Soviet radio station, in reviewing the Soviet Union's goals and achievements in Eastern Europe, acknowledged that a strong economic and political group is being established from Finland to the Balkans, led by the Soviet Union. Commentator Orlov pointed out the increasingly close relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. He said: These countries recognize that the war has caused drastic changes in the relations between major powers. The Soviet Union has become a major factor in international politics, affecting the dynamics of the entire world. Referring to the Soviet Union's recent decision to ease the terms of surrender for former enemy countries, Orlov said: These countries found it difficult to fulfill their obligations to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government is prepared to adopt compromise measures. Orlov also said: Many countries believe that strengthening political and economic relations with the Soviet Union is the best opportunity to enhance their international status. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's trade relations with neighboring countries are based on "equal rights," without any restrictions on third parties. However, he strongly emphasized that the Soviet Union cannot tolerate political interference in the name of trade. This statement by a Soviet commentator occurred five days before the opening of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, foreshadowing the path that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov may take in this important conference.

[Associated Press, London, 20th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in Paris next week. Will the hope of a unified and peaceful solution to European issues be successful? Or will it fail? Diplomatic circles here are quite worried about it. At the same time, it is increasingly felt that this conference is the last effort to promote four-power cooperation in concluding peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. For example, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, in a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that if certain countries do not agree with the peace treaty with Italy, the United States may draft the treaty alone. Britain and the United States acknowledge that each country has a high possibility of a breakup with the Soviet Union at the Paris conference. If the conference is to succeed, it depends on the extent to which the Soviet Union is prepared to compromise. Britain and the United States have both stated that each country intends to adhere to established policies. There is no sign that the Soviet Union will back down, so there is no hope of breaking the eight-month stalemate in drafting European peace treaties.

### On the Issue of the Franco Regime, the Three Powers Will Hold Negotiations. Australia Proposes that the Security Council Investigate the Case of Spain. Representatives from the United States and Mexico Have Both Expressed Their Approval.

[United Press, London, 20th] Well-informed diplomatic sources said today that the three-power talks between Britain, France, and the United States on the Spanish Franco regime are about to begin in London. France is now seeking to persuade Britain and the United States that "concrete action" should be taken against the Franco regime. The negotiations will be chaired by figures at the ambassadorial level. The British side is Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Harlech, the French side is Ambassador Massigli, and the U.S. side may be represented by Chargé d'Affaires Waldemar during the absence of Ambassador Harriman. A spokesman for the Foreign Office refused to confirm or deny whether negotiations had begun. Furthermore, the three-power talks will run in parallel with the Security Council's discussion of the Spanish issue.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] After visiting President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes today, Mexican Foreign Minister Najera announced that the Mexican delegation will support Australia's proposal to investigate Poland's accusation that Spain is threatening world peace. He said: Australia's plan is a good compromise.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 20th] U.S. representative to the Security Council Stettinius is currently drafting a speech here, which he plans to deliver to the Security Council on the 23rd. He expressed his support for Australia's proposal to send a delegation to Spain for investigation. Observers say that Australia's proposal will definitely be adopted by the Security Council.

[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 20th] The Spanish Franco government sent a note to the governments of Britain and the United States on the 20th of last month regarding the border issue between France and Spain, stating that Spain would not be responsible for any incidents that occur on the border between France and Spain. Foreign Minister Yada卓 also informed British Ambassador Sir Mallet during their last meeting that the activities of the Spanish Communist guerrillas on the border between France and Spain could cause great danger. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires has also been notified of this matter.

### Iranian Government and Azerbaijan Begin Negotiations

[Our Newspaper News] London, 21st Broadcast: An Iranian spokesperson stated today that representatives of the Tehran government and the Azerbaijan people have begun negotiations in Tabriz. It also said: The work of withdrawing the Red Army from Azerbaijan is proceeding according to the original plan and is believed to be completed before May 6. The spokesperson also denied that there had been conflicts on the border between Kurdistan and Azerbaijan.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 21st Broadcast: The Iranian Prime Minister today ordered the Iranian troops stationed in Azerbaijan to remain in their original positions immediately and not to take offensive actions. At the same time, he sent another delegation to investigate the truth and severely punish those who caused the incident.

### Soviet Union Launches New Attack on Turkey

[Associated Press, London, 20th] Moscow Radio broadcast today, launching a new attack on Turkey, criticizing it for exporting nine-tenths of its output during the war to supply the National Socialist Party, and saying that Turkey only severed diplomatic relations with Germany when it was determined that Hitler's failure was beyond redemption. As for the declaration of war on Germany six months later, it was purely nominal.

### Northwest Region of Hungary Colonized

Hungarian Economic and Transportation Systems Are All in Soviet Hands

[Associated Press, Capital of Hungary, 20th] An American economic expert declared today: The Soviet Union is colonizing the northwestern region of Hungary with Ukrainian farmers. This plan has been completed. Ukrainian farmers have gradually infiltrated the Taghe西 region for months. Taghe is a major town in northwestern Hungary. Hungary's entire economic and transportation system is now under the control of the Soviet Union or pro-Soviet factions.

### Patriotism Is a Responsibility, Why Talk About Reward?

The Righteous People of Crete Are Admirable

[Reuters, Crete, Michalokastron, 20th] An Allied investigation team went to Crete to investigate the righteous people who helped the Allied forces in combat, intending to give monetary rewards. However, it was reported that among the 2,329 righteous people who were expected to receive rewards, 2,264 refused to accept a single cent. When the Greek authorities wanted to reward patriots with money, they all said that the responsibility of patriotism could not be exchanged for money.

### Japanese Shidehara Cabinet Will Submit Resignation En Masse, Seeking Political Cooperation with the Three Major Parties. Yoshida Has a Possibility of Succeeding as Prime Minister.

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 21st Broadcast: According to Japanese government spokesperson Ishiguro, the current cabinet will resign soon, and a new cabinet is expected to be formed quickly. Prime Minister Shidehara will be reassigned as Foreign Minister.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] Well-informed political figures here believe that the Shidehara cabinet will resign en masse. It is expected that Shidehara will accept the Emperor's order to form a new cabinet, supported by the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party. In addition, some parties believe that Ichiro Hatoyama may resign as chairman of the Liberal Party, and Foreign Minister Yoshida will rise to replace him.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Special Dispatch] Jiji News Agency quoted the opinion of a political observer saying that if Prime Minister Shidehara cannot organize a strong ruling party to support his request to remain as prime minister, he may recommend Foreign Minister Shigeru Yoshida as his successor. He is also trying to obtain help from the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party. If these efforts all fail, he may request that all cabinet members resign together, and then completely reorganize the cabinet.

### Acheson Appointed Chairman of the Control Commission for Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Special Dispatch] MacArthur announced today the appointment of his former political advisor Acheson to succeed U.S. representative Marquette as chairman of the Four-Nation Committee for Japan. Neutral observers believe that since MacArthur has now appointed a career diplomat as chairman of the committee, the "undiplomatic" stance taken by the United States in the past two meetings will be more moderate in the future. MacArthur's appointment of Acheson also means that the U.S. Congress has gained the upper hand over the War Department, since all control over Japan has been administered by the War Department until now. Acheson has served in the U.S. diplomatic service for a long time, serving in the U.S. Embassy in China for many years. Before the July 7th Incident, he served as the first secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing. When U.S. Ambassador to China Gauss resigned in 1942, Acheson served as Chargé d'Affaires. Recently, he was reappointed as MacArthur's political advisor.

### The Pope Calls For Reviving Morality

[Reuters, London, 21st] Vatican Radio said: The Pope yesterday addressed 200 representatives of Italian youth groups, calling for millions of starving children. He said that history shows that the causes of war lie not only in economics and politics, but also in spirituality and religion. Moral degradation has a particularly great impact on young people. Divorce, atheism, obscene books, and obscene entertainment are the three most dangerous factors. He hopes that members of our church can do their best to save them. Children are the starting point for all major human problems, such as marriage, family education, and morality. If they are educated in the spirit of Christ, they can be spared future dangers.

### World Peace? Celebrating Easter Together

The First Time in Ten Years

[United Press International, Washington, 20th] The celebration of Jesus' resurrection coincides with world peace, a first in nearly ten years.

### US Navy Can Be Reduced If United Nations Is Successful, Nimitz Discusses Navy's Mission to Maintain Peace, Truman Approves Bill to Increase Naval Personnel

[United States Information Service, Washington, 20th] Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Admiral Nimitz delivered a speech on the 18th to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, generally discussing the role of the Navy in maintaining peace. Admiral Nimitz suggested that newspaper editors should promote further understanding of the United Nations as their own responsibility. He said: If the United Nations is indeed successful, then the US Navy can be reduced. Today, there is no enemy possessing equal naval strength. Why then do we still need a strong navy? Because the existence of our navy is not only for combat or controlling the seas but also for supporting our foreign policy. We have militarily become the most powerful nation in the world; therefore, for the sake of peace, we have a responsibility to ensure security.

[TASS, Washington, 20th] President Truman has signed a bill stipulating that the peacetime regular naval personnel be increased to 500,000 enlisted men and 35,000 officers (the original number was 230,000 enlisted men and 12,760 officers).

### What Are the Differences Between the American Democratic and Republican Parties After All? The Right-Wing Democrats Are Gradually Similar to the Republicans, The Left-Wing Republicans Are Again Similar to the Democrats

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] What exactly are the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States? This is a question that foreigners have always found puzzling. Today, even the American people themselves are gradually finding it difficult to distinguish. With only seven months until the congressional elections, although the American people consider themselves able to distinguish between the Democratic and Republican parties, they also acknowledge that the right-wing Democrats are gradually becoming similar to the Republicans in their thinking and actions, while the left-wing Republicans are gradually becoming similar to the Democrats. It is generally believed that this phenomenon is sufficient to predict that the Republican Party will form a genuine conservative party, while the Democratic Party will become a genuine liberal party. At the same time, union leaders and left-wing intellectuals will establish a left-wing third party. Of course, these developments will take several years to establish clear banners. It is still remembered that when the late President Roosevelt made a speaking tour of the southern states in 1938, he instructed voters not to elect right-wing Democratic congressmen and to have them join the ranks of the Republican Party. Although the people did not follow this call, those who continued to implement Roosevelt's "New Deal" continued these policies consistently. The current Secretary of Commerce, Wallace, advocates that President Truman, the Democratic leaders of both houses of Congress, and the Democratic National Committee form a special committee with the power to expel from the party Democratic members who vote against the government or its important policies. Right-wing Democratic congressmen from the southern states have expressed serious protests against this proposal. President Truman has not publicly expressed support for this proposal, but in his Jackson Day speech, he said, "I cannot too strongly support the notion of party unity." Although the President wants to carry out reforms within the party, with the election period approaching, he does not want to lose a large number of Democratic members and reduce the strength of his party. Regarding the internal affairs of the Republican Party: Supporters of Willkie and Stetson, who may be Republican presidential candidates in 1948, also occasionally vote in Congress in favor of government policies. Therefore, right-wing Republican mouthpieces such as the Chicago Tribune have also called for the expulsion of Willkie-ism and Stetson-ism.

### Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng Arrives in Shanghai, Discusses Shipping Reconstruction Plan, Will Soon Invite Relevant Agencies to Consult... Restoration of National Transportation Soon to Have New Progress

Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng, after returning to Fenghua to sweep the ancestral tombs, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by express train to inspect transportation affairs. The reporter made a special trip to Yu's residence to pay respects. Yu said: I have not returned to my hometown for more than ten years. This time, returning and witnessing the devastation of my homeland, I am deeply moved. I visited many charitable organizations, schools, public health facilities, and entertainment venues in my hometown and saw that several buildings had been destroyed. For example, the orphanage has no shelter to house orphans, and the work still cannot be started. In addition, I also went to Chiang Kai-shek's hometown, Xikou, and saw that his mother's tomb was still very well preserved, but the Wuling School building was quite severely damaged. Regarding his impressions of transportation construction in the city, Yu said, "I have not yet gained a concrete impression of the city's transportation construction. I will soon convene the heads of the road, electricity, postal, and aviation departments to hear detailed reports." Also, at 2:00 PM yesterday, Yu accompanied the Director of the UNRRA Shanghai Branch, Liu Hongsheng, and the General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Xu Xueyu, to observe the docks, warehouses, and recently imported freighters. Yu stated that the location of the city's docks and warehouses is excellent, but the construction is still too simple. It is quite inconvenient for large vessels of more than 2,000 tons to load and unload goods, and there is a real need for major improvements. Finally, when the reporter inquired about the postwar shipping reconstruction plan, Yu said, "The Ministry of Communications had previously formulated a five-year construction plan, which includes shipping. To cooperate with the construction needs of various departments, relevant agencies and technical experts will soon be invited to consult on the implementation steps. I very much hope that private shipping will develop more." Regarding the transformation of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company into a corporate organization, it has already been decided in the five-year plan, and its operations will be supervised and improved from now on. In addition, Yu expressed optimism about the restoration of national transportation, believing that after Special Envoy Marshall returns to China, there will be new progress in the short term. Minister Yu does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long and will return to Nanjing in the next few days.

### 15,000 Sheets of Improved Silkworm Eggs Distributed to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk-Producing Areas

News from the China Silkworm Company: The company recently transported 15,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs (each sheet weighing 10 centimeters, selling for 2,000 yuan) from Taiwan to Shanghai and has distributed them to silkworm farmers in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk-producing areas. In addition, 142 sheets of original silkworm eggs were also completely distributed last week. Forty sheets were sent to the Xin Can Cun Company in Kunming, and 102 sheets were sent to the Chongqing Silk Industry Company, all of which were gifts for experimental breeding and did not require compensation. According to the company, this type of original species can be divided into two types, strong and weak. The strong type produces less silk, while the weak type produces more silk, making it difficult to balance both. Therefore, this type of original species is limited to silkworm egg production plants for the purpose of manufacturing improved silkworm eggs and distributing them to silkworm farmers. Furthermore, the types are divided into 110, 112, 115, and 108. These four types have achieved good results after being tested in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. If they are also very good after being tested in Yunnan and Chongqing, the company will continue to supply them in the future.

### People's Freedom Protection Association Held Founding General Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai People's Freedom Protection Association held its founding general meeting at the Law Society on Beile Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over eighty representatives from sixty-four organizations, including temporary advisory councils, attended. Chairman Chen Tingrui said in his speech that the association currently has over ninety participating organizations. The purpose of the association is to protect the people's freedom. The word "freedom" is most valuable. The history of various countries shows revolutions arising to fight for freedom, with millions of heads taken to fight for freedom. These touching and inspiring historical facts are worth noting. The Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, led the revolution, overthrew the Qing dynasty, and established the Republic of China, also to fight for freedom. Therefore, the establishment of the Shanghai People's Freedom Protection Association is a meaningful undertaking. I hope everyone will work together to protect the people's freedom. Subsequently, the articles of association and temporary motions were passed. Articles 2 and 3 of the articles of association provide detailed regulations on protecting the people's freedom and are specifically recorded below: Article 2: The people's freedoms protected by the association are freedom of person, freedom of residence, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech and publication, freedom of communication, freedom of religious belief, and other freedoms that should be enjoyed. Article 3: If the people's freedom is infringed upon, the association has the obligation to protect it according to law. Finally, the following were elected: 45 directors including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Xianqing, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaowen, Wang Yunsheng, and Yong Xiangyun; 15 supervisors including Zhu Xuefan, Du Yuesheng, Xi Yushu, and Chen Diaoyu.

### Search for Missing American Soldiers in China 70-80% Completed, Parents of Fallen Soldiers Most Concerned

Although the US military is gradually demobilizing in China, they still have many unfinished tasks in China. Before leaving China, General Wedemeyer pointed out several items, one of which was searching for missing soldiers in China. To understand the recent situation, the reporter visited Colonel Charles, director of the Personnel Group of the US Military Headquarters, yesterday. According to him, there are approximately 2,000 missing US soldiers in China. The work of searching for missing soldiers has been intensified after the victory of the War of Resistance. Eight US military personnel were assigned to various locations to carry out this task, and 70-80% has now been completed. Most of the missing American soldiers are pilots. After their planes crashed in China, they sometimes died with the planes, and sometimes they were captured by the enemy and killed. Therefore, the so-called search for missing soldiers is mostly to find their graves or corpses, or the location of their martyrdom. Then, the circumstances and process of their deaths are determined, and a detailed report is made to their families. According to statistics, those who are most concerned about these fallen soldiers are not their wives, brothers, or sisters, but their parents. Currently, many parents are requesting to come to China to investigate the truth because their beloved sons are missing or died in China. The US military authorities must give these affectionate parents detailed explanations to make them understand the reasons for their beloved sons' deaths. This work is still ongoing.

### Jiaozhou Park Election Speech: Xi Yushu Declares He Is Not There to Show Off, but Hopes to Awaken People's Understanding of Democratic Politics

Amidst a nationwide chorus for democracy, the election of Shanghai's city councilors will be held on the 28th. To this end, the authorities have specially opened all parks free of charge starting yesterday, as venues for campaign speeches by candidates.

"Campaign speech" is still a novel term for most Chinese people. However, it has long been known to everyone in Europe and the United States. During elections, the lobbying, enthusiastic tension, and fiery displays are truly lively.

Xi Yushu, the Jiangning District candidate for city councilor, was the first to hold a campaign speech, giving a public address to over a thousand listeners at Jiaozhou Park yesterday morning. The weather was sunny and the sky was clear, with the solemn national flag fluttering overhead, symbolizing the limitless future of a democratic China.

He began by saying, "I am not here to show off, but to advocate the practical implementation of the spirit of democracy."

China is now a democratic and independent country, and the government is convening a National Assembly to implement constitutional government. But to do so, we must start with local autonomy and establish democratic local governments as the foundation for implementing constitutional government. Democratic politics must be from the bottom up; otherwise, it will be superficial, empty, and bureaucratic. Election, recall, initiative, and referendum are the four stages of civil rights. Election is the first step, and we should use it carefully."

Mr. Xi listed the policy proposals he would present to the City Council if elected, such as improving security, raising police standards, establishing sound finances, building hospitals, expanding transportation routes, increasing education funding, promoting compulsory education, and rebuilding housing for the poor, explaining each in detail.

Mr. Xi also hoped to awaken people's understanding of democratic politics and ensure that this general election adheres to democratic principles.

Cheng Tianfang, a member of the Central Committee who recently arrived in Shanghai, spoke as a guest, saying: "Chinese democratic politics will open a new era from this, a just and honorable activity." Cha Liangjian, President of the local court, said: "What is democracy? It is to ensure that people's physical safety, property, and freedom are legally guaranteed."

The 28th is approaching, so citizens, prepare to vote! Let us first understand the candidates' knowledge, morality, character, and personality, and see if they can speak for the citizens, seek benefits for the local area, and are qualified to be our representatives.

We must not give up our right to vote, but we also need to use it carefully, because it has a great impact on ourselves and on the local area! (Mu Ren)

### Caoxi Road Late Spring Gathering: Lavish Feast to Appreciate Peonies

— Our Reporter Mai Tian

It is the season when all flowers compete in beauty, but this spring seems more lovely than in previous years.

The century-old peonies in the Huang Family Garden in Caoxi Road attracted over a thousand admirers yesterday. This reporter and Ms. Qian Jianqiu, along with a dozen others, entered the garden gate and immediately saw guests filling the hall. The garden owner, Mr. Huang Jinrong, personally greeted guests in front of the "Four Teachings Hall," as if there were a joyous celebration at home. These century-old peonies are indeed worthy of their reputation. The owner had specially protected them with wire mesh and wooden fences, and even prepared a table of sacrificial dishes, lit incense, and offered prayers. In previous years, whenever the peonies were in full bloom, Mr. Huang would invite close relatives and friends to gather, appreciate the flowers, and drink merrily, creating a lively scene.

Since the Huang Family Garden was trampled by the enemy's hooves, all the special peonies, including the ancestral hall, the Buddha hall, and all the precious antique furniture, and even the birds and animals in the zoo, were killed and destroyed by the Japanese devils. Valuable items were shipped back to their country. Even the four characters "Wen Xing Zhong Xin" (Cultured Conduct Loyalty Trust) inscribed on the stone tablet by Chairman Chiang in the 20th year of the Republic were chiseled away. Only this peony plant was preserved after much effort and at great cost. Mr. Huang told this reporter: "In the 31st year of the Republic, Japanese rubber boat and cavalry teams rushed into our garden and stayed for more than eight months. All the antique furniture in our houses was either moved away or burned to the ground. After they had looted everything, they used explosives to blow up the empty houses, even destroying our ancestral hall! Finally, I spent a lot of effort and money to get them to leave. The tables and chairs we are using today were all borrowed from rice merchants!" "But," he lamented, "it is impossible to rebuild everything at once, as materials and construction costs are too expensive now!"

Yesterday, the Huang Family Garden showed an unprecedented scene for the first time in eight years. Mr. Huang prepared local dishes more flavorful than the delicacies of Xiangshan Restaurant in the large hotels, inviting close relatives and friends, social celebrities, local officials, and guests from all walks of life to the banquet, and also opened it to the public for visits. Chen Fukang and others served as general hosts, extremely busy. The military band of the Poor Children's Handicraft Institute played music. Forty square tables were set up in the "Four Teachings Hall," with one group eating after another, totaling no less than a hundred tables. Mr. Huang himself was served last. He is already 79 years old this year, but he looks quite healthy. He is also very optimistic and warmly greets every guest. Although his losses were enormous, now that victory has been achieved, I believe that his old heart must be infinitely comforted to see this day.

### Daming Lake Scenery is Unharmed, Jinan Suffers from Cerebral Congestion

— Air Mail from the 16th, Our Special Correspondent Jiang Jun

All readers of "The Travels of Lao Ts'an" cannot help but be fascinated by Liu E's depiction of Jinan's customs, especially Bai Niu, Hei Niu, and Daming Lake. Decades have passed, and the Niu sisters have become a historical relic. Today, only the scenery of Daming Lake remains, with its charm still intact.

March is the season of warm spring and blossoming flowers. A gentle breeze aids my refined interest, and I drive to visit the famous lake. The lake's color is unique, elegant without being cloying, and pleasing to both refined and popular tastes. Unfortunately, it is the northern part of Shandong, and spring arrives late. At this time, boating on the lake, the wind ripples the water, and there is still a chill. The lake is surrounded by four miles of sparse green, but the North Pole Temple stands tall, offering a distant view. The drooping willows on the outskirts of the city are tender green, and the earth is returning to spring.

Lixia Ancient Pavilion is the Top Scenic Spot on the Lake

Jinan has seventy-two springs, and Daming Lake is the collection of them all. The lake itself has no springs. Speaking of the lake's scenery, the Lixia Pavilion is the first to be recommended. There is a couplet inscribed by He Shaoji in front of the pavilion: "This pavilion is ancient to the right of the sea, and Jinan has many famous scholars." However, the Lixia Ancient Pavilion is now a new building. There is an exquisitely furnished reception room to the north of the pavilion, and a dining room to the south. According to the boatman who acts as a guide, on midsummer nights with a full moon, this place is a popular spot for famous scholars and poets to hold banquets and hire prostitutes.

Jinan is a large city on the banks of the Yellow River. The city's atmosphere is ancient and elegant without being corrupt. Although the market is slightly deserted, judging from the facades and furnishings of the shops, one can imagine that pre-war Jinan was indeed a fairly prosperous city. The area west of the city is the old commercial port area, with flat asphalt roads crisscrossing, and new giant buildings standing in rows, reminiscent of Qingdao.

During Han Fuju's nine years of governing Shandong, even today, people in Shandong do not have a bad impression of him. I have inquired among local people for their opinions on Jinan's construction, and they all agree that General Han did put in a lot of effort. It is said that Han Fuju was not corrupt and worked diligently. His troops were disciplined. In Jinan's streets in those years, you would not see a soldier riding in a rickshaw, nor would you see soldiers bullying ordinary people. The general suffered from not being literate, and although he worked diligently and was capable, he was sometimes confused. The joke about wrongly killing innocent people while trying bandit cases is still widely circulated. He was eventually sentenced to death for dereliction of duty and harming the country.

Twenty Miles Outside the City is a Communist Blockade Zone

Judging from the current situation in Shandong, Jinan is considered the most intact place outside the seven cities and six towns controlled by the government. It is said that the Communist army originally planned to occupy the vast area north of the Yangtze River, especially within Shandong Province, not allowing a single soldier of the Central Army to gain a foothold. Fortunately, the National Army was able to win a surprise victory, thus ensuring the security of Jinan today. There is another rumor: when Chairman He Siyuan led the guerrillas to recover Jinan, the county areas controlled by the government still accounted for one-half. How long ago was that? What remains is almost nothing. In the end, this reporter does not know the truth.

Twenty miles outside Jinan city, it is all a Communist blockade zone. However, the more than 700,000 citizens living in this cage are calm and living their lives as usual. The common people are very clear that with General Wang Yaowu stationed in Jinan, their lives and property have been secured. They say: "It's a pity that General Wang came a little late."

Shandong is Anemic, But Jinan is an Exception

Of course, the common people have their troubles, which is that the Communist army's blockade of supplies is driving up prices, increasing the burden on people's lives, and increasing it day by day. Although the highway between Jinan and Qingdao is said to be open, freight transportation is not smooth. The only hope is to rely on the supplies of the Relief Administration.

Because more than 85 percent of Shandong Province is occupied by the Communist army, people are flocking to Jinan. Thus, today's Jinan has a phenomenon of many talents gathering and crowding. Someone made this analogy: Jinan's current situation is like a patient suffering from "cerebral congestion." And its limbs—the counties of Shandong—are, on the contrary, generally "anemic."

Municipal Work Has Been Taken Over by the Chairman

In addition to this, Jinan has a second unprecedented miracle: more than fifty exiled county governments have gathered. The situation is quite similar to wartime England, except that these officials are not as welcome in England. Shandong people generally criticize them, believing that they have abandoned their official positions, left their posts, fled to Jinan, and are living a life of leisure as exiled officials, which is clearly not the attitude of revolutionaries.

In Jinan, looking at Shandong, Shandong's awkward situation is in dire need of a swift solution. Mayor Zhang Jinming told this reporter that he is currently doing almost nothing, because the power of the Shandong Provincial Government is only really present in Jinan. The municipal work has been taken over by the Chairman. At the time, this reporter replied to him:

"Mr. Mayor, when you have something to do, China will have a solution!" (Jinan, 16th)

### Healthy Province: Zhejiang - Shen Honglie Discusses the Basic Principles of Governing Zhejiang

— Our Hangzhou Correspondent Chu Yusheng

On the morning of my arrival in Hangzhou, I met with Mr. Shen Honglie, the newly appointed Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, on Avenue Joffre. Mr. Shen is not tall. He was wearing a dark blue suit, and his oval face was framed by a pair of black-rimmed glasses. His complexion was unusually rosy. I asked him about his impressions or opinions of Zhejiang. He told me that once, on his way back to work from Fenghua, he felt that the scenery of Zhejiang was extremely beautiful. In the 21st year of the Republic, he visited Hangzhou once and toured many scenic spots. He also visited Hangzhou once after Chairman Chiang was rescued from danger.

Excellent Impression

His impression of Zhejiang is extremely good. He said that Zhejiang is a healthy person. The people's level of knowledge is quite high, and their lives are quite good. This time, he was appointed as the Chairman of Zhejiang Province on short notice. As for the methods of governing Zhejiang, he believes that it is necessary to follow the needs of the people. Empty talk about many grand policies is useless. He repeatedly emphasized that Zhejiang is a healthy province, and everything is on track. There is always a way to deal with a healthy person.

Preparing to Tour

Mr. Shen is preparing to stay in Hangzhou for a period of time, and then he will tour the counties. He said that he had traveled through all of the more than one hundred counties in Shandong in the past.

"The needs of the people!" After I left, I kept pondering this sentence in my mind. I boarded the Shanghai-Hangzhou line and met many Zhejiang people in the carriage. Some were from eastern Zhejiang, and some were from western Zhejiang. They all lamented that their lives after the war were far worse than before the war.

Chatting About People's Livelihood

A Shaoxing man with a full beard said: "In some counties, the countryside is really not very peaceful! What guerrillas, New Fourth Army, it's all a mess. Now that we have won, who is willing to go back to their hometown and work hard to farm?"

I talked with almost all the Zhejiang people in the carriage. What do they need after all? They need to live and work in peace, so that they can make a living!

Zhejiang was originally not an area with flourishing industry, but its agricultural products are very abundant. Now that the countryside is restless, farmers are running to the cities. This is the real reason for reducing production and increasing consumption, and it is the current crisis in Zhejiang. Therefore, to enable Zhejiang to develop, the first thing is to stabilize the countryside in Zhejiang, and then seek industrial development. For example, Zhejiang's silk and tea are very famous. If we stabilize the countryside and plant tea and raise silkworms in large quantities, and open large-scale tea farms and textile factories, then the future of Zhejiang will be unlimited. Now the basic lives of farmers cannot be maintained. These businesses of running tea farms and textile factories have really become idle dreams. (15th)

### Low Cultural Level in Chengdu Causes Concern and Sighs in the News Industry

— Guo Hong, Chengdu Airmail Dispatch, 14th

People who have lived in Chongqing for a long time often utter a rather emotional saying: "Chengdu is heaven, Chongqing is hell." Why is Chengdu heaven and Chongqing hell? It stems from the following factors. Chongqing's laws are strict, alcohol sales are prohibited in restaurants, and gambling is readily suppressed. In Chengdu, these activities can be carried out openly. Chongqing's streets are uneven, making uphill and downhill travel arduous, and often leading to dead ends. Chengdu's streets are flat, arranged in a grid pattern, making walking on them pleasant and offering diverse routes. In Chongqing, all kinds of luxuries are prohibited, but in Chengdu, they are everywhere, and there's no worry about having money but no place to spend it. Chongqing lacks scenic spots. Places like Nanquan and Bei Bei are too far from the city, making travel inconvenient. Chengdu has many scenic spots, such as the West China Dam, Wangjiang Tower, Du Fu Thatched Cottage, and Wuhou Temple. You can stroll and sightsee at your leisure. In short, in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, Chengdu offers far superior conditions compared to Chongqing, no wonder Chongqing residents lament about heaven and hell.

It has been three years since this reporter left wartime capital Chongqing, and I am quite unfamiliar with the situation there. For the past two years, I have resided in Chengdu, so I know more about this "heavenly" city. However, I won't discuss its general overview here, but will instead attempt to sketch a portrait of one aspect of its cultural endeavors – the newspaper industry.

Chengdu's cultural level is pitifully low. Currently, there isn't even a decent magazine. If we only consider this point, compared to pre-war Peiping and Shanghai, and wartime Chongqing, it shouldn't be heaven, but rather hell! More accurately, it's a desert.

Chengdu's population is nearly 800,000. There are twelve newspapers, which may not seem few in number. However, according to investigations, the total daily circulation of local newspapers is no more than 30,000 copies, with each newspaper averaging just under 2,500 copies. Now, I will briefly describe the background, content, and organization of each newspaper:

(1) Central Daily News: This is the only official newspaper of the Kuomintang in Chengdu. It is headed by Qu Bingsen, who is a veteran in the news industry, having served at the Beijing Shen Bao twenty years ago. The newspaper's style is considered rigorous, but lacks flexibility. Although it has many news stories, they lack uniqueness. Its commentary is steady but lacks vigor. Its supplements are also similar. It publishes one broadsheet per day, and once briefly added a supplementary sheet, but discontinued it due to excessive losses. Its highest circulation was 10,000 copies, but it is currently declining.

(2) New China Daily News: This is the official newspaper of the China Youth Party. The president was originally Song Yiqing, a member of the party's Central Committee. This spring, Song went to Shanghai with Zuo Shunsheng to prepare for the China New News, and the position was taken over by Li Huang. A year ago, the newspaper's commentary communicated with the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League, sparing no effort in attacking the government. After the victory, its attitude changed, and it gradually became more cooperative with the government. Since the Northeast issue arose, the newspaper has strongly criticized the Soviet Union based on its principle of "internally eliminating national traitors and externally resisting powerful forces." The newspaper has relatively timely news and numerous telegraphic dispatches and communications. It publishes one broadsheet per day, and its circulation reached 8,000 copies at one point, but has now dropped back to 5,000 copies. It has considerable influence in the local student community.

(3) Huaxi Daily News: President Liu Zixin, graduated from the Journalism Department of Fudan University, reversed the previous style and became more focused on entertainment.

(3) Huangpu Daily News: Originally named the Party Army Daily News, it was founded in 1937 and was affiliated with the Central Military Academy. After the victory, due to the growing calls for the nationalization of the military, it was renamed. The current chairman is General Wan Yaohuang, the education director of the military academy, and the president is Wang Yuxian.

(4) Chengdu Express News: The current president is Shi Liang, the special commissioner of a certain administrative inspectorate district in Sichuan Province. It ceased publication last autumn due to internal personnel issues, and resumed publication this spring.

(5) New News: It has an old brand and wide circulation, but its style is outdated. The president is Chen Sixiao, a student who studied in Japan and is currently a supervisor of the Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters. This newspaper has a unique abundance of local news.

(6) Xinmin Daily News: It is non-partisan and purely a commercial newspaper. The publisher is Chen Mingde, a Sichuanese senator.

(7) Southwest News: The chairman is General Deng Xihou, the Director of Pacification for Sichuan and Kang provinces, and the president is Cai Yubin.

(8) Chengdu English Daily News: This is the only English newspaper in the area, and it is sponsored by the Chengdu branch of the British Embassy's Information Office.

(9) Xinmin Evening News: Publisher Chen Mingde. This newspaper is known for its supplements, and its news is also mainly focused on entertainment. Initially, it sold around 20,000 copies, but after the victory, due to the departure of key internal personnel, it has declined sharply and now sells 3,000 copies per day.

(10) Chengdu Evening News: Publisher Yao Shouxian. At one point, this newspaper had a well-organized internal team and powerful commentary, selling over 20,000 copies and breaking the record in the Chengdu newspaper industry. However, it did not last long, and it was reorganized due to various reasons. With no one to take over, it has become a yellow newspaper.

(11) Eastern Evening News: The person behind the scenes is Xu Zhongqi, the Director of the Sichuan Provincial Police Department.

This covers all the newspapers in Chengdu. During the War of Resistance, all the newspapers were able to maintain themselves with some effort, and many even had surpluses. However, since the influx of newspapers from other cities, especially Shanghai, the circulation has plummeted. Except for New News, every newspaper is losing money heavily. Currently, people in the newspaper industry are overshadowed with concern, sighing and worrying about their future. The only remedy is to improve the content, otherwise, their future will undoubtedly become increasingly bleak.

### Many Disturbances in Hangzhou Schools

Hangzhou Advanced Industrial School Students Demand School Buildings; Zhejiang University Students Demand Increased Public Funding

[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou] Hangzhou Advanced Industrial School, originally reorganized from Lin'an Industrial School in western Zhejiang, moved from Changhua to Hangzhou after the victory last year. The Education Department designated the Maitreya Temple in Songmu Chang as the school building. However, the temple was occupied by troops, and despite repeated negotiations, they have not yet moved out. Chen Lingsheng, the principal of the school, in order to maintain the students' studies, found a house in Guo Village on the West Lake and started classes there. However, due to the limited number of rooms, it could only accommodate more than 100 students, which caused dissatisfaction among the remaining students, resulting in a movement to expel the principal. They suspended classes and petitioned the provincial government and the Education Department. After the department sent personnel to investigate the truth, the director of the relevant section, Hong Chichang, went to the temple and negotiated with the garrison to allow a portion of the building to be used for student classes. At the same time, he summoned all the students for an address, admonishing them for their excessive actions and issuing two major demerits and two minor demerits to five students who were the leaders of the incident, temporarily preserving their student status and remaining under school supervision. Therefore, since the 10th, all students have resumed classes as usual, and the disturbance has been resolved. (Thin)

[Another report] Publicly funded students at the Zhejiang University main campus went on strike on the 17th to express their determination to the education authorities to "study in peace only after having enough to eat and wear." The school authorities, believing that the strike would cause serious damage to the students' studies, adopted a compromise solution, first borrowing and advancing meal expenses. The school immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting that it increase the public funding待遇 in accordance with actual difficulties in order to adapt to current prices. The students expressed satisfaction and resumed classes on the 18th. (Butterfly)

### Beiyang College to Reopen in Tianjin in September

### Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Hebei-Rehe-Pingjin Branch Subsidizes Primary School Teachers

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Hebei-Rehe-Pingjin Branch, considering the difficult lives of teachers in private primary schools, is providing a bag of flour to those with a monthly income of less than 50,000 yuan to show respect.

### University Professors and Primary School Teachers in This City Petition Minister Zhu; The Common Goal is to Demand Improved Treatment

[Report from this city] Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education received representatives of Shanghai National University professors at 10:00 AM yesterday at the Shanghai Branch of the Three Youth League: Wang Lizhang from Fudan University, Ying Gongjiu, Zhu Fu; Gu Baochang from Tongji University; Miao Jie from Jinan University; Chen Shiying, Chen Daxie, Cao Hesun, Zhu Baiying, and Wang Dashi from Jiaotong University.

University Professors Petition

The conversation lasted two hours and yielded no results. Minister Zhu reported that the university faculty research fund has been changed from 500 yuan to 2,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan. This report was put on file in February, and has not yet been implemented. Therefore, it is in fact unrelated to the professors' request. Minister Zhu also stated that this small sum could not solve the problem, but was only a small gesture. The professors repeatedly proposed two reasonable principles for improving treatment, namely, first, professor treatment should be calculated according to a different standard, and second, the standard must link a portion of the new funds to the cost of living index. Minister Zhu only agreed to study and consider this, and the professor representatives asked Minister Zhu to submit the above principles to the government and do his best to fight for them.

University Students Petition

While Minister Zhu was meeting with the professor representatives, student representatives from Jiaotong University and the First Branch of Lin Da also led a group to petition at the site, asking Minister Zhu to promise to meet the professors' demands so that they could resume classes immediately and avoid wasting their studies. The students stood in the hot sun for several hours, but the minister did not come out to see them until the professor representatives left. It is reported that the entire faculty of Lin Da has telegraphed the Ministry of Education in response, also stating that if there is no satisfactory solution by the end of April, they will stop teaching on May 1 and resolutely demand practical and genuine improvements to their treatment. The main campus of Fudan University in Chongqing has sent a letter to Fudan University in Shanghai, stating that it has launched a response. The Shanghai National University professors' representatives, feeling that the requests yielded no results, plan to petition Chairman Chiang and prepare to go to Beijing to petition during the National Congress meeting to maintain the principle of education being paramount during the period of national reconstruction.

Primary School Teachers Petition

[Another report] The Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Joint Training Association sent more than 300 representatives to the Academia Sinica yesterday morning to petition Minister Zhu. However, Minister Zhu was elsewhere, and Kuang Shujun and Chief He received them successively. The representatives immediately submitted a petition, requesting three points: (1) Following the example of municipal school teachers, private middle school teachers should be given a subsidy of 200,000 yuan per person, and primary school teachers 150,000 yuan per person. (2) There is no distinction between public and private teachers, and their treatment should be the same. (3) Increase the proportion of educational funding to 20% to 30%. Finally, Chief He announced to the crowd that he would be responsible for forwarding the requests to the municipal government no later than Monday morning, ordering the Municipal Education Bureau to handle them diligently. The representatives were satisfied and dispersed in an orderly manner.

### Sichuan University's Growth During the War of Resistance (Part 2)

— Jing Ming

Since moving back to Chengdu, the professors and students of Sichuan University immediately became active, participating in various academic and political activities outside the school. At this time, Chengdu already had several universities, many of which were very famous in the country: There was West China Union University, Ginling Men's College, Ginling Women's College, Cheeloo University, and the Central University Medical School in the Huaxi area; Guanghua University in the west; and the later Yenching University and other schools in the city. In terms of scale, no school could compare with Sichuan University. Therefore, if there were matters of opposition and competition, the universities in Huaxi would unite to deal with Sichuan University; in matters of cooperation, Sichuan University, due to its national status, invariably stood in a leading position. From the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943] to the present, the number of departments and students has increased year by year. In the 33rd year [1944], a night school was established, specifically for out-of-school working youth. It was stipulated that students would complete the entire curriculum in five years. Night school graduates could be issued diplomas, which had been approved by the Ministry of Education. This was a bold attempt, but the results were not bad (previously, Soochow and Shanghai College also established night schools, but they were all missionary schools). In the 34th year [1945], the College of Science was renamed the College of Science and Engineering, and departments of Aeronautical Engineering and Hydraulic and Civil Engineering were added, as well as a second division of the Teachers College. Currently, the total number of students in the entire school is 3,640 at the main campus, and approximately 1,200 in the night school and preparatory courses, approaching a total of 5,000. In terms of the number of students, among all universities in the country, it is probably the largest, except for National Central University. The departments are: the College of Liberal Arts, with the departments of Chinese, Foreign Languages, and History and Geography; the College of Law, with the departments of Law, Political Science, and Economics, and a Judicial Group; the College of Science, with the departments of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, and Aeronautical Engineering, and a Chemistry Specialization Program; the College of Agriculture, with the departments of Agronomy, Forestry, Horticulture, Plant Pathology, Sericulture, Agricultural Economics, and Agricultural Chemistry; and the Teachers College, with the departments of Education, Public Training, Chinese Literature, English, History and Geography, Mathematics, and Physics and Chemistry (from this year onward, in addition to Education and Public Training, a Physical Education Department is also planned, and the remaining departments will be merged into the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences). The night school has three groups: Chinese, Law, and Commerce, as well as selected students in Education, English, and Journalism. In addition, there are the Liberal Arts Research Institute, the Science Research Institute, and the Second Division of the Teachers College.

Such a large-scale school with so many students will certainly have a significant impact on the future of Sichuan. According to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's estimation in *China's Destiny*, Sichuan alone will need at least 50,000 specialized professionals with college degrees or above in the next ten years. If Sichuan University is to shoulder half of the responsibility for cultivating these talents, and given the current annual graduation rate of fewer than 500 people, it will take fifty years to cultivate them. Seen in this light, the future of Sichuan University is limitless!

But the problem is not that simple. From a qualitative perspective, today, not only Sichuan University, but no university in the country can be considered satisfactory. Lack of faculty, simple equipment, and insufficient funding – it is truly riddled with problems! In terms of facilities, Sichuan University has a good school environment. If the construction plan of the previous president could be realized, it could accommodate 10,000 students and cultivate an average of over 1,000 people each year. But this funding, calculated at current prices, is unknown how many hundreds of millions of yuan would be needed? Sichuan University, after all, did not suffer major damage from the war, but the so-called collection of 200,000 books are mostly old books from five years ago, and because they came from a combination of several schools, some are incomplete, some are redundant, and it is not easy to add to or supplement them. Sichuan University cannot be considered short of equipment, but most of it is already outdated. In the rapidly developing atomic age of science, to catch up with advanced countries, it is necessary to start almost from scratch. These problems are not unique to Sichuan University; they are common to all universities in the country, and the state needs to provide a comprehensive solution. Today, Sichuan University's only advantage is that while other schools are busy planning to move back and rebuild, it can start construction one or two years earlier.

Commercial News

### Price Fluctuations Last Week Greatly Threaten People's Livelihood! Eliminating Speculation is Imperative!

The commercial and financial situation in the city has recently been gradually getting on track. The price of gold has stabilized at around 1.6 million, and the price of rice has hovered around 25,000-26,000 for quite some time. The cotton cloth market has also not returned to its previous volatility. If efforts continue, the future is not without hope. However, a storm that had been brewing for many days suddenly erupted last week. Although the police have cracked down on the black market for public bonds, the price increase remains in effect. After rice loans were issued, the price of rice immediately soared by nearly 10,000. Merchants are unable to settle foreign exchange for prohibited imports, and they flock to the market to purchase US yarn, causing the US dollar to jump again. The price of gold also fluctuated accordingly. At the same time, tram, electricity, water, and train passenger and freight transport prices all increased during this period. Therefore, the prices, which seemed to be stabilizing, have once again stirred up huge waves. It is difficult to predict what the future holds. The details are recorded below:

Gold: The Central Bank's allocation has not been interrupted, and fluctuations last week were actually caused by speculators engaging in arbitrage. When the market opened on Monday, it was as high as 1.62 million, then fell back to 1.55 million. From Tuesday to Thursday, it fluctuated between 1.53 and 1.55 million. On Friday and Saturday, it rose again due to securities firms covering their positions and pawnshops making up for losses. The price rose from 1.55 million to 1.62 million. The final price at the end of the week was 1.575 million.

Foreign Currency: US dollar trading was quite active. Although the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate remained unchanged at 2,020 yuan, there were many import merchants settling payments, coupled with the inflow and outflow of speculative funds, causing fluctuations in the middle of the week, especially on Friday and Saturday, which were the most profitable. The highest price reached 2,430 yuan, and the lowest was 2,080 yuan. The final price at the end of the week was 2,220 yuan. It is said that the Central Bank has not approved applications for large amounts of US dollars, but according to the Central Bank, legitimate merchant applications are always approved. It is also said that US exporters can use US dollars instead of US exchange, so importers of generally prohibited goods and speculators are engaging in large-scale activities in the market.

Public Bonds: Due to extremely loose credit conditions, speculative funds are concentrating on unified public bonds, and the market is becoming feverish, with high prices emerging endlessly. At the beginning of the week, amid pervasive buying sentiment, Type C bonds jumped out of the 5,000 mark. Subsequently, due to artificial silk firms selling to take profits, the price retreated within the mark, but still rose by 560-570 yuan compared to the end of last week. Other bonds also saw advances. On Tuesday, the buying sentiment did not diminish. Type C bonds opened at 5,100 and went straight up to 5,350 yuan. At noon, retail investors sold and the price retreated by about 200 yuan, but other bonds were pulled up, and there were many transactions. On Wednesday, the price increase intensified. Retail investors and cotton yarn firms continued to push forward relentlessly, and the market became even more dazzling. Type C bonds even rose from 5,250 yuan to an unprecedented high of 5,500 yuan. Subsequently, due to active crackdowns by the police, the frenzy stopped abruptly. On Thursday, unified bonds only saw scattered transactions to cover short positions, and the price was called higher by several hundred yuan. On Friday, trading did not officially resume, and there were only some closing transactions. The asking price for Type C bonds once reached an unprecedented high of 5,700 yuan. The final price was reduced by more than 200 yuan. On the weekend, the black market for unified public bonds opened at 5,400 yuan, briefly retreated slightly, and finally closed flat. Other bonds each rose by about 100 yuan.

Stocks: At the beginning of the week, domestic stocks first fell and then rose. Initially, they were thriving due to loose credit conditions. Subsequently, due to the property tax issue, people were weak and rushed to sell. Shanghai Yarn Factory and Mayar Silk retreated to within 5,400. In the afternoon, large investors absorbed the selling, and the prices rebounded by more than 200 yuan. Three small stocks rose by varying amounts from 10 yuan to 30 yuan. Foreign stocks rose, with Jardine Matheson rising by 100-200 yuan, Wheelock Marden rising by 500 yuan, and China Paper and Jardine Matheson each rising by 200 yuan, and British American Tobacco closing flat due to rumors of the establishment of a sub-market and manipulation by British merchants. On Tuesday, domestic stock prices rose in the morning with retail investors absorbing, with Shanghai Yarn Factory rising to 5,200 yuan and Mayar Silk to 4,400 yuan. Subsequently, the bullish trend stopped due to selling. Buying sentiment was strong in the afternoon, and as a result, Shanghai Yarn Factory and King Fook Jewelry closed flat, while Mayar Silk rose by 80 yuan. Foreign stocks retreated due to selling. On Wednesday, domestic stocks were oversupplied, and the market was tired. The situation improved slightly in the afternoon, with Shanghai Yarn Factory and Mayar Silk each falling by about 200 yuan. Foreign stocks rose and fell by varying amounts. On Thursday, domestic stocks continued to decline due to selling, with Shanghai Yarn Factory and Mayar Silk each falling by more than 100 yuan. Except for New Kwang, the three small hot stocks each fell by three to five yuan. Foreign stocks did not officially resume trading. On Friday, the domestic stock market was stagnant, and prices fell sharply due to large investors selling. Shanghai Yarn Factory retreated to 4,500 yuan, and King Fook Jewelry to 380-390 yuan. The situation stabilized in the afternoon. Foreign stocks continued to be closed. On the weekend, domestic stocks initially appeared weak, but then saw a rebound due to bullish traders absorbing at low prices. Foreign stocks mostly rose.

Food: At the beginning of the week, rice was actively bought and sold, but the market price jumped by 1,500 to 2,000 yuan due to deliberate price increases in the producing areas. Wheat flour also rose by 400-500 yuan due to large-scale purchases by Shantou firms. On Tuesday, rice prices were still fluctuating, rising again by 200-300 yuan to as much as 1,000 yuan. Wheat flour was in greater supply than demand, re-entering the 10,000 yuan mark. In terms of miscellaneous grains, soybeans were stagnant, while peanuts were rare and rose sharply. On Wednesday, rice prices did not retreat due to sellers' support, with japonica and indica rice each rising by more than 3,000 yuan. Ying Yuan rose by 5,000 yuan, and Bai Yuan was even more popular, soaring by 7,000 yuan. Wheat flour rose in tandem. Among miscellaneous grains, only peanuts declined. On the fourth day, the upward trend of rice prices was still developing, with japonica and indica rising by 500 yuan, glutinous rice rising by 1,000 yuan, and wheat flour continuing to be popular at 150 yuan. Soybeans and peanuts both rose sharply. On Friday, there was a slight pullback, but Bai Yuan remained at a high peak. Wheat flour rose again by 200-300 yuan due to buying by northern firms. Soybeans fluctuated, and peanuts fell by 1,000 yuan. On the weekend, rice rose again by about 1,500 yuan, and wheat flour also saw a rise of 700 yuan. Except for Kaifeng peanuts, grain prices rose across the board.

Raw Yarn: In the past week, initially, due to the increasing inventory of raw yarn in Shanghai and the normal sales of raw yarn by merchants, the market was completely stagnant. Until the weekend, stimulated by the rising prices of US dollars and gold the previous day, and the long-dormant Tianjin firms suddenly began to purchase raw yarn, with demand from inland areas such as Beijing and Shanghai also being quite high. As a result, buyers on the market were eager, suddenly creating a situation of demand exceeding supply. The prices of 16s and 20s yarn rose the most. During the whole week, the highest price increase was 2.7 million for 60s yarn, and the lowest was 510,000 for 10s yarn. In terms of count, 32s Fairy Peach fine yarn rose by 280,000 compared to the previous weekend, the largest increase, followed by 16s Heavenly Horse and Bright each rising by 120,000, and 20s Special Double Horse rising by 75,000. Only 42s Blue Phoenix remained unchanged.

Cloth Market: Because the peak season has passed, Shanghai has a large inventory, and merchants lack large-scale demand, the market lacks vitality. The prices of all brands were largely unchanged compared to the previous weekend, fluctuating by two or three thousand.

Cotton Market: It was initially weak and then firm. Manufacturers were increasingly watching and waiting. Subsequently, due to the rising US dollar, cotton merchants raised their prices. Most firms were forced to increase their orders, and as a result, the prices of all cotton types rose by two or three thousand yuan compared to the previous week.

Fuel: As for other industries, they also mostly showed a firm trend. However, in the fuel industry, due to the supply of spot goods and the abundance of chips, the market was weak, and the prices of all goods were expected to decline. The price of Yangquan and Jiaozuo coal at the beginning of the week was 400,000 yuan per ton, and by the weekend it had fallen to 360,000 yuan. Pao Bao charcoal was especially unpopular, but the market price still hovered at a high peak of 9,000 yuan per dan.

### Commercial Loans Frozen in Hong Kong to be Returned by the End of the Month

[Hong Kong News] When Hong Kong was liberated, the Hong Kong military government handed over all enemy-related or pre-war warehouse goods, or factories and warehouses that had been controlled and used by the enemy, to the Hong Kong Property Control Officer for management and control. Merchants and civilians were allowed to collect documents and apply to the authorities to retrieve them. Merchants and civilians had submitted applications to the Property Control Bureau, but no news of a resolution had been received. It is reported that the authorities have continued to release the warehouse goods of these merchants. The Property Control Bureau has now begun processing these accumulated requests and expects that all of them can be returned to the merchants before the restoration of civil administration at the end of this month.

### Unbearable Memories: Western Medicine Business in Shanghai Depressed After US Loans Arrived, Costs Too High, Wages Increased, Imitation Products Severely Affected

[This Newspaper] Vitamin, sulfa drugs, DDT, penicillin and other preparations from American goods have recently become increasingly common in the windows of pharmacies and grocery stores in the city, and even on the stalls selling US military supplies on the street. In terms of price, they are five to ten times cheaper than similar domestic products, which is no longer a rare occurrence! "Cheap and good" is originally the golden rule for buyers to select goods. No wonder people are rushing to buy American Western medicines. The domestic new medicine industry, which once prospered, seems to have encountered a very serious misfortune.

Imitation Products are Not Bad: The reporter interviewed several leading figures in this field, and they all said in unison that although most of the above-mentioned new medicine preparations were gradually invented during this war, the Chinese people were determined not to fall behind and successfully imitated them one by one with the spirit of catching up. In terms of ingredients, except for penicillin, which is relatively inferior to foreign goods due to manufacturing equipment limitations, it can be said that none of the others cannot compete with foreign goods. However, Shanghai, which has always been known for its low labor costs, currently has an ordinary worker's salary of tens of thousands of yuan, or about sixty to seventy US dollars. The wages that senior technicians in the United States can earn each month are only slightly higher.

Wages Too High: But comparatively speaking, the United States makes full use of machines, and one worker's output can often equal the work of many workers in China. Therefore, the labor cost, which used to be an absolute advantage, has now become relatively inferior. In terms of raw materials, many of the basic raw materials for Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry are mostly pre-war inventory.

Raw Materials Too Expensive: These rare raw materials have either become the darlings of hoarders year after year, or have become the balls in the speculative market, and their prices have already been pushed to the peak. This is another fatal blow to the production cost of the domestic new medicine industry!

Speaking of the import of foreign Western medicine raw materials and finished medicines, because shipping has not yet returned to normal, there is only a small amount of imports. Therefore, a common 100,000-unit penicillin costs only four or five US dollars in the United States, but once it arrives in Shanghai, it costs more than 10,000 yuan in legal tender. This is clearly profiteering.

Foreign Loans are Much Cheaper: However, even at this price, it is enough to defeat the same domestic preparations with ease. If shipping becomes smooth in the future, and large quantities of orders pour in, and the exchange rate remains unchanged, then the future of the domestic new medicine industry is quite bleak! It is said that based on the reasonable price of American Western medicines in the future, at most it will only be enough to pay for labor costs in Shanghai, let alone other manufacturing costs! This is by no means an exaggerated pessimistic view, because according to statistics, there were more than 20 large chemical raw material factories and hundreds of small ones in Shanghai during the war.

Chinese Factories Have Closed: But now 90% of these factories have closed. The remaining ones are also hesitant and are thinking of changing their plans. General American chemical raw material factories produce ten to twenty tons of sulfa drugs per day, while Chinese factories still calculate daily production by the pound, which is a vast difference. Speaking of the city's domestic pharmaceutical factories, there are more than 50 large and small.

Living on Old Capital: But most of them are operating sluggishly, relying on selling inventory and living on old capital! The authorities of a large pharmaceutical factory in the city admitted frankly that their recent monthly turnover is not enough to cover half of their expenses, and their inventory is being sold at a loss. Looking back at the booming state of the domestic new medicine industry during the war, it is like another world!

Remedial Measures: Is the domestic new medicine industry hopeless? Not necessarily! Some people say that under the inability to compete on raw materials, should the principle be to make finished medicines domestically? This would require the government to slightly adjust the current tariff rates on Western medicine raw materials and finished medicines. It is said that the former was originally set at 25% and the latter at 30%, the difference between the two is too small. Can the import tariff rate on raw materials be lowered, while the import tariff rate on finished medicines is increased? Some people also say that the import of raw materials should be based on the principle of what the Chinese people cannot produce themselves. Still others argue that the government should provide strong support to the new industry in terms of funding, so as to purchase a large number of foreign equipment, and then use its own manpower and resources to manufacture the raw materials and finished medicines needed. These views all have their reasons and are worth providing as a reference for those who care about the future of the new medicine industry. At the same time, we must also recognize that in addition to its mission of serving patients, new medicine also occupies a pivotal position in national defense and military medicine. Only in this way do we feel even more that domestic new medicines are worth supporting and revitalizing. During the war, the booming parabola of Shanghai's domestic new medicine industry soared into the sky, but it was inevitably deformed and empty, so it could not withstand the attack of foreign waves, and the parabola immediately suffered a setback and plummeted. Needless to say, the foundation of the new medicine industry itself has its shortcomings. Some say that the vision is not far-reaching enough, some say that it is too focused on making profits, and some say that the quality of the products is relatively poor... Fortunately, we learn from one lesson and learn one trick, and the government's help is needed for the revival of the domestic new medicine industry, while its own redoubled enrichment and efforts are even more important! Otherwise, how can it resist the unabated giant waves? (Canglong)

### Cigarette Factories Still Issuing Loans, Cigarette Tax Adjustment Not Yet Implemented

Regarding the cigarette industry in the city, it was previously reported that the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau was going to adjust the cigarette tax rate, so there was talk of cigarette factories adjusting new prices. It is now known that the authorities are still considering the cigarette tax rate, and the date of implementation has not been determined. Therefore, the old tax rate is still being levied in recent days. Recently, Yizhong Tobacco Company has shipped a large quantity of Great Britain Brand, Old Knife Brand, and Qinghai Brand cigarettes from Qingdao. These should have been subject to additional cigarette tax and temporarily not issued, but because the bureau has not yet issued a formal order, they have been issued as usual, and the price of cigarettes has not increased.

### Price Drop in Malaya Has Three Reasons

[Malaya News] Commodity prices in Malaya have fluctuated greatly in the half year from last September to the present. In the early days of the British army's landing, commodity prices had returned to their pre-war state. Since last October, they have been rising straight back, reaching their peak between January and February of this year. Since February, they have been falling again, such as black market rice has fallen from 120 yuan per dan to about 35 yuan per dan. Grain has also fallen by an average of half. The reasons for the sharp drop in commodity prices are: (1) Factories have not resumed work, and many workers in various industries are unemployed, resulting in poor purchasing power. (2) Native products and medicine are exported, while foreign goods are imported in large quantities, absorbing a large amount of floating capital. (3) The implementation of rationing of flour, bread, meat, milk, and cigarettes from February has affected the decline in commodity prices. But the biggest reason is the lack of free trade, which has caused the stagnation of various production organizations in Malaya, resulting in paralysis of the market.

### 30,000 Dan of Subsidized Salt at 14,215 Yuan Per Dan

The Songjiang Salt Affairs Branch of the city is implementing subsidized sales from now on in order to suppress food salt prices and supply the needs of the people. The price is 14,215 yuan per dan, and the quantity is 30,000 dan. The quantity purchased per household has not changed, and sales will continue until the quantity is exhausted. Those who need to purchase this subsidized salt can go directly to the branch office on Xinzha Road to go through the purchase procedures.

### A Casual Discussion on Golden Banknotes and Speculation

Since the victory, US dollars have been highly sought after in the speculative market. Their speculation is so active that it surpasses silver dollars, and the rise and fall of their prices can determine the movement of silver dollars. This was especially evident in October and November of last year. However, after the government announced its intention to set the exchange rate, the status of the US dollar plummeted. This is because people were unsure whether US dollars could be settled in the future, so everyone rushed to sell them. In the previous period, US dollars determined the movement of silver dollars, but now the opposite is true, and the changes in silver dollars determine the changes in US dollars. Originally, the hedging ratio price of six hundred yuan for US dollars to ten taels of silver dollars was broken, once opening up to about eight hundred yuan. Since the announcement of the exchange rate in mid-March, with the exchange rate fixed at 2,020 yuan, the US dollar was sluggish in an environment of ample funds. At the same time, due to the Bank of China's allocation of silver dollars, speculators were unable to stir up trouble. Therefore, from the announcement of the exchange rate until the previous week, the US dollar never rose, and even fell to below 1,900 yuan at one point. However, since the previous week, the situation of the US dollar has been like a turn for the better. First, there were rumors that the US dollar exchange rate would be raised. Those with sensitive nerves believed that the US dollar exchange rate had a range of flexibility and that a raise was not impossible. Therefore, everyone absorbed it, and by the end of the previous week, it had rebounded to above 2,000 yuan. Since last week, the rumors of raising the US dollar exchange rate have remained strong, and the market has seen another rise. On the weekend, it rose to above 2,400 yuan, and US dollar speculation has returned to a fever pitch. The closeness of its hedging with silver dollars is also becoming increasingly significant, as follows:

Monday 756
Tuesday 743
Wednesday 741
Thursday 757
Friday 693
Saturday 709

(Note) Calculated based on the final closing selling price.

After this sudden activity of US dollars, the general hedging against silver dollars is still seen as roughly 600 yuan for ten taels. Whether this trend is possible is closely watched by the market. In terms of the current US dollar situation, the government is unlikely to raise the US dollar exchange rate, and in fact, it is not necessary. The main reason is that imported goods ordered by importers from overseas have continued to arrive at the port recently. Among these many orders, there are of course those that do not comply with import regulations. After arriving at the port, they must be settled, and if they cannot be obtained from the central government, they must search for US dollars on the market. Under the circumstances of real demand, coupled with the fueling of speculators, a momentum of advancing straight ahead has been created.

The general observation is that it may be possible for the hedging between US dollars and silver dollars to approach 600 yuan for ten taels in the process, because speculators have long known that it is difficult to retreat under the central bank's unlimited allocation of silver dollars. Observing the recent few times that 1.6 million yuan was penetrated, it did not move forward any further, which is a very clear example. However, when the golden banknote hedging reaches 600 yuan for ten taels, it is also very possible for speculators to see silver dollars as cheap, gather their strength to absorb them, break through the central bank's allocation price, and move upward.

### Commodity Prices in Taiwan Province Are on Par with Shanghai, Merchants Complaining Endlessly

[Special Report from Taiwan by Our Newspaper] General commodity prices here have maintained a balance with Shanghai. In the recent month, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Zhaoshangju," "Ziyou," "Haiyu," "Haidi," "Haichen," and "Taipei" ships successively sailed to Taiwan, bringing in large quantities of supplies, especially flour. As imports exceeded demand, prices trended downward, falling from over 740 Taiwan dollars per bag to around 480 Taiwan dollars. Although prices have risen recently, they are still hovering up and down. White sugar is priced at 12 yuan per catty in the market and 9 yuan at wholesale. Cypress wood is priced at 900 to 1,200 yuan per stone (100 cubic feet). The price of gold is around 780 yuan per mace (calculated using the old scale at 80% purity). The price of rice has also fallen to 16 yuan per catty. As for other daily necessities, cigarettes from Shanghai such as "Zhonggaole" are priced at 30 yuan per pack. "Simaituo" shirts and cosmetics are not in demand. Most merchants from Shanghai are feeling overwhelmed, facing a dilemma. The price of goods is almost the same as in Shanghai. If they need to transport local specialties, there are no regular ships. Moreover, civil servants and the public in Taiwan are living in insecurity. The prospect of opening large-scale department stores and surplus food stores in this province is bleak. The attempt to transfer surplus funds to Taiwan to develop industry and commerce or set up factories cannot be implemented immediately due to the environment. Both material and spiritual losses are suffered. The prices of hardware such as copper, iron, aluminum, and sulfur are relatively low, and it seems that profits can be made, but they are listed as prohibited export items.

Special Edition on Production and Construction

### Industrialization and Practical Science

— Lin Han

As Professor Contiti of the University of California said, "China cannot be transformed into a mechanical industrial society overnight. If it could, it would be unfortunate; it is also unacceptable to believe that economic construction can be completed by simply transplanting a few Western mechanical secrets and tools." This sentence frankly reveals some of the maladies of China's industrial construction and the path that industrial construction should not take. It is truly a direct hit, and no one can deny its truth!

This means that we cannot achieve industrialization in a short period of time. We can use machinery to develop production, but this cannot be considered as having already industrialized or completed economic construction. Because, "mechanical secrets and tools are the tangible results of practical science after a long and painful process." Mechanical secrets and tools are built on the foundation of practical science. What kind of foundation there is can support what kind of building. The foundation is improving day by day, and the building is also expanding and updating day by day. The reason is very clear. Nowadays, practical science is progressing all the time, so mechanical secrets and tools are constantly being renewed. Even if we can find the mechanical secrets and tools, but without practical science as its foundation, it is really like a mirage, a soap bubble, temporarily producing a dazzling effect, but soon it will disappear! Therefore, true industrialization and practical science are related and inseparable.

In today's urgent task of nation-building, everyone is shouting for nation-building, and everything is competing for first place. In particular, "industrialization" is being shouted with a resounding voice, and it has attracted the most attention and interest from the people of the country. In order to seek rapid industrialization, many people are purchasing foreign machinery and foreign technology in large quantities. It is true that in the transitional period of China, obtaining this batch of machinery and technology for emergency use is not entirely unhelpful to the overall situation. However, the urgent task related to China's true industrialization is to develop science. We hope that the government can have facilities such as promoting science, increasing education funds, rewarding further study and research, and promoting expertise to "catch up," and we hope that the industrial community and enthusiastic industrialists can do their best to assist in achieving complete success.

### The Current Sericulture Industry

— Ren Hengliang

Since Leizu invented sericulture, China has had a history of thousands of years. When the sea ban was lifted and trade between China and foreign countries was opened, silk suddenly became a major export product of China, comparable to tung oil and tea. Farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces relied on this as a sideline, and every year they recovered profits from overseas, I don't know how many. Afterwards, because the Chinese sericulture industry adhered to old methods, resulting in poor products, the overseas market was almost entirely seized by the late-rising Japan. Cocoon prices fell, the market slumped, and farmers' enthusiasm for raising silkworms was greatly reduced. However, because there was no other sideline to replace it, the rural areas were almost on the verge of bankruptcy, which worsened in 1931. Before the war, a small number of visionary people in the sericulture industry, such as engineer Zou Jingheng of Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory, repeatedly went to Japan to study and investigate. As the saying goes, "The stone of another mountain can be used to attack jade." Therefore, in 1936 and 1937, silk factories in Wuxi sprung up, mostly imitating the improved reeling methods of Japan. The products became increasingly refined, almost comparable to Japanese silk. Overseas credit became better day by day, silk cocoon prices rose step by step, and farmers' enthusiasm for raising silkworms revived, flourishing for a time, almost with a sign of revitalization.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders did everything they could to destroy China's sericulture industry. They established the so-called China Central Company, which controlled the purchase of cocoons at the lowest record ever seen. Farmers suffered heavy losses and had no choice but to flatten the mulberry fields and switch to planting rice and wheat. The machinery of various private silk factories was also dismantled and destroyed without exception. Since the victory, the government, recognizing the importance of sericulture in China's export position, established the China Sericulture Company by incorporating the enemy and puppet sericulture organizations that had been taken over, as well as silk and silk weaving factories, to support the development of China's sericulture industry. Private silk factories, such as Yongtai Silk Factory and Jiatai Silk Factory, silk industry giants in Wuxi, have also launched operations one after another. However, looking forward to the future of the silk industry, there are many crises and there is no room for optimism.

1. Nylon artificial silk invented in the United States has better tensile strength and uniformity than natural silk and has the potential to replace natural silk.

2. Most of the silk weaving machinery in the United States has been mostly converted into artificial silk fabric devices due to the impact of silk shortage during the war, so sales are becoming narrower day by day.

3. Silk from Italy and Japan are being sold at depreciated prices.

4. The current foreign exchange policy is unfavorable to exporters, so prices are falling.

5. The current silk price is about 2.5 million yuan per picul, but the fuel cost used in the manufacturing of each picul of silk is almost half the price of a picul of silk, not to mention that labor costs are high and manufacturers have no profit to make.

Therefore, the sericulture industry in the future should strive for improvement in both breeding and reeling. If it is stuck in the current methods, the entire sericulture industry is in danger of gradually declining.

### The Importance of the Children's Toy Industry

— Han Ming

Advocating for the children's toy industry may be criticized by some as a superfluous and boring thing. Indeed, at a time when the country is riddled with holes and construction is urgently needed, and the restoration and development of large industries such as transportation and production, and the solution and improvement of small issues such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation are countless and waiting to be addressed, the children's toy industry will naturally be forgotten! However, here, the author can point out two important points of the children's toy industry and prove that it is an indispensable undertaking.

(1) Modern children's toys are changing with each passing day with the development of science and the progress of material civilization, and they are becoming more and more meaningful and effective. For example, modern children's toys include models of airplanes, balloons, trains, ships, cars, cannons, etc. Airplanes and ships are also equipped with small engines. This kind of toy not only arouses children's great interest, but also makes them recognize and understand the general outline of modern advanced scientific machinery. In terms of education, it is really a great harvest! In addition, small bicycles, small leather balls, table tennis balls, badminton, and other toys for children can also enable children to achieve good results in terms of technology and physical fitness.

(2) Generally speaking, there are no children in the world who do not like toys. Therefore, except for those from very poor families, children are inseparable from toys all day long. Therefore, the number of children's toys in demand is really huge and considerable. In the past, the money that overflowed due to the dumping of Oriental children's toys was also shocking. Therefore, self-sufficiency in children's toys can be said to be a way to plug a leaky cup.

Furthermore, the lessons learned from this World War make us deeply admire the success of Germany's model education after World War I, which deepens our understanding of children's toys. The author believes that children's toys are not only used to amuse children to laugh and cry, or to exercise their bodies. Facts tell us that children's toys are also a kind of effective educational tool! Therefore, developing the children's toy industry is still worth advocating.

### An Overview of Mutual Commerce Management

— Xu Baiyi

The Duration of Recession

Since the existence of a recession is a serious threat to general industry and commerce, the issue of how long the recession will last is something that every management personnel should study. This depends on the severity of the recession. If the causes of the recession include every point mentioned above, then the recovery period will take longer. If there is only one point, then the recovery period will be relatively shorter. We can list the symptoms that can be seen during a recession as follows:

1. The selling price of goods first has a sharp drop, followed by a slow price drop.

2. Production stops, causing many people to lose their jobs, or general industry and commerce implements layoffs and reductions.

3. The prices of various goods fluctuate, but gradually fall to a similar level.

4. The existing raw materials are gradually used up, replaced by newly imported raw materials, but at lower prices.

5. Due to the drop in goods prices, selling goods does not even have a profit or has only a very small profit.

6. Bank loans are reduced, and it feels difficult to pay many payable accounts.

7. The masses purchase at the lowest limit, creating a phenomenon of buying and using as they go.

8. Small-scale industrial and commercial businesses close down one after another because they cannot meet the conditions for survival.

To turn from a recession to prosperity, the following steps must be taken:

1. All inventory is slowly sold out.

2. All parties gradually feel the need for goods.
