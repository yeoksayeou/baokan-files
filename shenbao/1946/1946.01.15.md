### Sun Ke and Others Propose at the Fourth Meeting: Expanding the National Government to Accommodate All Parties; Members Engage in Lively and Extensive Discussions

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] The Political Consultative Conference held its fourth meeting at 3:00 PM on the 14th. The agenda was (1) Political Category (A) Government Organization Issues. Government representatives Sun Ke and seven others presented their views on expanding the organization of the National Government. Youth Party representatives Zeng Qi and four others also proposed a plan to reform the political system and implement political democratization. Only broad discussions were held on the above two proposals during today's meeting. Thirty-four members, including Guo Moruo, attended. Sun Ke served as the chairman of the meeting. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM. The fifth meeting will be held tomorrow morning to continue the discussion.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] At the fourth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, National Party representatives Sun Ke and seven others put forward the following opinions on expanding the organization of the National Government: Before the National Assembly is convened, the Chinese National Party intends to amend the Organic Law of the National Government in preparation for the implementation of constitutional government, in order to enrich the National Government Committee. The main points of the amendment are as follows: (1) The number of National Government Committee members will be increased by one-third from the original quota. (2) Twenty National Government Committee members will be appointed by the Chairman to be filled by non-party members. (3) The National Government Committee is the highest guiding body for politics. (4) The matters to be discussed and decided by the National Government Committee are as follows: (A) Legislative principles, (B) Policy guidelines, (C) Major military and political plans, (D) Financial plans and budgets, (E) Matters submitted by the Chairman for discussion, (F) Suggestions jointly proposed by one-third or more of the committee members. (5) If the Chairman of the National Government believes that the implementation of the National Government Committee's resolutions is difficult, he may submit them for reconsideration. If two-thirds or more of the committee members still insist on maintaining the original proposal during the reconsideration, the proposal shall be implemented. (6) In case of emergency, the Chairman of the National Government may take expedient measures, but shall report to the National Government Committee after taking the measures. In addition, the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan will also be amended as follows: The Executive Yuan will have a number of political affairs committee members who may also serve as heads of various ministries and commissions. Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Bulei, Wang Shijie.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] Wang Shijie reported that the government's opinions on expanding the government organization are being discussed, showing that the ruling party is preparing to return political power to the people and accommodate virtuous people from all parties to participate in government decision-making and implementation. On the one hand, the National Government Committee will be expanded and its powers strengthened, replacing the power of the Supreme National Defense Council, as an initial step to return political power. On the other hand, the status of participation in the meeting will not be mentioned before the tasks and session of the National Assembly are determined, so as to make cautious consideration and consultation. Zhang Dongsun believes that before discussing the issue of government organization, the government should fulfill the four promises made by the Chairman on the opening day of the conference and immediately abolish or amend laws that clearly hinder the freedom of the people within two or three days. Liang Shuming even more strongly advocated that if the government cannot do this, then there can be no discussion. The question of government reorganization is pressing, creating a bad impression. Shao Lizi said that the National Defense Council held a meeting this morning and has issued an order to abolish or amend various instructions restricting freedom of publication and assembly within ten days, and political prisoners will be investigated and released within seven days. Chen Bulei, who rarely speaks easily, said upon hearing Zhang and Liang's remarks: The government has restricted various freedoms over the years due to the war, and all facilities have been checked and abolished or amended due to the end of the war. However, given the size and complexity of China, it cannot be done effectively if it is forced to be completed within two or three days, which would defeat the original intention. If this is used as a condition for discussing the government reorganization, it may also affect the progress of the consultation and will not be the welfare of the people. His calm and factual remarks reflected the sincerity of the government and were highly praised by the attendees. However, Zhou Enlai then rose to sternly question the cases of Yang Hucheng and Zhang Xueliang. Zhang Lisheng firmly replied: If I were in the position of a party member, I would have the determination and courage to answer. However, in order to take into account the government's position and the smooth and harmonious progress of the meeting, I am unwilling to rehash old grievances and do not want to answer. His stern words and expressions moved everyone, and this disturbance finally came to an end, and the meeting was able to continue.

### Air of Cooperation at Xiehe Hospital; Mediation Department Starts Work; Hopes for Smooth Completion in Two or Three Weeks

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] A silver American military aircraft, number "9148," arrived this afternoon at 4:00 PM, carrying twelve peace envoys. Robinson, in a sky-blue suit, was humble, cautious, and serious. Aside from saying that he had been to Beiping, he did not reveal anything about his mission or plans. He is preparing to formally receive reporters at a formal gathering. Director Zheng Jiemin answered all questions and was filled with an air of peace. He said: Stopping the conflict is absolute. He came by plane and is preparing to return by train. When reporters asked how long it would take to complete the cessation of conflict and restoration of transportation, he replied: This is a problem that has not been resolved in nine years of negotiations, and we hope to complete it all in two or three weeks. Ye Jianying is not as thin and handsome as imagined, but rather resembles a chubby little peacemaker. He has a short mustache and wears the most fashionable waist-belted khaki wool military uniform, with a blue wool coat. It is said that he and Director Zheng are in Beiping for the first time. He also said that the Communist Party will absolutely abide by the order to stop the conflict and restore transportation, without any discount. He hopes that the separated cities and villages of North China can be reunited in the future. From his remarks, it was revealed that the Communist Party has nominated Zhou Enlai to attend the three-person group, and the government's selection is undecided. Another representative may also be nominated by the Consultative Council from neutral parties. Because problems that can be solved by ourselves should not trouble our allies. They are all staying at the Beijing Hotel. Robinson is staying in Room 12 on the third floor, and Zheng Jiemin is staying in Room 19 on the second floor.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Robinson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Jianying will work in the cooperative atmosphere of Beiping's Xiehe Hospital to heal the wounds suffered by North China in the military conflict. Zheng hopes that all the work can be completed smoothly in two or three weeks, or even one or two weeks. He said: The two sides have been negotiating for nine years, and if we don't resolve it, we'll be talking until we're old. The Military Mediation Executive Department has 150 people each from the Nationalists, Communists, and Americans, for a total of 450 people. Only twelve arrived today, including three from the United States, four from the Nationalist Government, and five from the Communist Party. All personnel will arrive in Beiping completely before the 25th, and the office location has been chosen for them at Xiehe Hospital. As for how to work, the three will initially exchange ideas tomorrow. When reporters asked Zheng and Ye whether they would visit other places recently, Zheng replied: Waiting for orders. Ye replied: Let's take a look at Beiping first. Generally, under the Military Mediation Executive Department, a number of branch stations will be set up as needed. The Military Mediation Executive Department itself will be divided into three groups: secretariat, liaison, and execution. The personnel for the secretariat and liaison groups have not been determined, the US representative of the execution group is White, the Nationalist Government representative is Cai Wenzhi, and the Communist Party representative has not been determined. The three commissioners of the Military Mediation Executive Department each have one vote. All resolutions must be unanimously agreed upon by the three, and in case of disagreement, they shall be handled in accordance with the terms of the order to cease conflict and restore transportation. Although the department has no direct binding power over the war zone, all orders are issued in the name of the Chairman of the National Government and can be directly ordered to both the Nationalist and Communist armies.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Zheng Jiemin, in answering reporters' questions here, often spoke of not dwelling on past accounts. Ye Jianying's speech also contained few provocations. An atmosphere of peace and harmony filled the three commissioners of the Military Mediation Executive Department. This is a good omen that there is great hope for stopping the conflict and restoring transportation. When reporters asked about the mission of the Military Mediation Executive Department, and how to explain its handling of surrender matters, Zheng replied: The final goal of the surrender work must be to repatriate overseas Chinese back to their countries. Although most of the surrender work has been completed, this kind of work has not yet been completed, so it is said that the task of the execution department is to handle this item. Ye also believes that the surrender issue has become a thing of the past. The main work of the department at present is to stop the conflict and restore transportation, send back Japanese prisoners of war, and the reorganization, concentration, and deployment of national troops will be handled by the three-person group. In addition to the Nationalists and Communists, the three-person group was originally composed of a member from the United States, but today Ye said that Chinese problems are best solved by ourselves, and the consultative conference may have new resolutions, and the member originally participated by the United States may be replaced by a neutral Chinese person.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Ye Jianying said: I feel very good after circling Beiping in the sky for a week. This is the Communist military strategist's first impression of Beiping. It was his first time in Beiping, and he called himself a country bumpkin. He did not judge the achievements of the Political Consultative Conference, but only said that everyone was sincere. He also guaranteed that the Communist army would absolutely abide by the order to stop the conflict and restore transportation. One reporter asked: If administrative personnel from a certain county go to places where the political decrees are widespread, will conflicts occur between the two sides? Ye vaguely said that local autonomy will be implemented in the future, and small conflicts cannot be guaranteed to be nonexistent. Someone mentioned the suffering of the people in the besieged city of Beiping, and Ye said that now the countryside is surrounding the city, and in the future, the countryside and the city will be integrated.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The situation in Rehe is still unclear. Lu Wenzhen, deputy chief of staff of the Eleventh War Zone, told reporters: The command received the ceasefire order yesterday and immediately forwarded it for compliance. The Nationalist troops on the Ping-Rehe line are still between Shixia and Gubeikou. The situation within Rehe is unclear. He also said: In the past two days, the Communist army has still been harassing us, and the Communist army is still rushing to build fortifications near Hashan. Zheng Jiemin answered reporters' questions: According to the information he received in Chongqing on the 11th, the Nationalist troops were in the Lingyuan area. Due to the delayed transportation, the ceasefire order may not have been delivered as scheduled, but the government will ensure that all Nationalist troops earnestly implement the ceasefire order.

[United Press, Beiping, 14th] The staff of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters are preparing to begin their arduous task of ending the war in North China this morning. The three commissioners may hold a meeting to discuss the situation in North China. According to Ye Jianying's statement to reporters yesterday: He does not believe that the Nationalist representatives will have any difficulties in visiting the Communist areas.

[Another dispatch] The three commissioners of the Executive Headquarters agreed to issue a joint statement within a day or two.

### British Gunboat HMS Petunia Formally Handed Over to China

[British News Agency, London, 14th] The Admiralty announced that the 3,000-ton Flower-class gunboat HMS Petunia has been handed over to the Chinese Navy in accordance with the Sino-British Lend-Lease Agreement.

### Laws Hindering Freedom; Deadline Set for Drafting Abolition and Amendment Measures; Political Prisoners to be Investigated and Released Within One Week

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] At the routine meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the morning of the 14th, Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting and gave instructions based on the two items of "People's Freedom and Political Prisoners" in the matters announced by the government at the opening of the Political Consultative Conference on the 10th.

### Communist Army Still Destroys Coal Mines After Ceasefire Order Announced; Active Preparations for Tianjin-Pukou Railway Repair

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Xuzhou News, the Zaozhuang coal mine has been repeatedly destroyed by the Communist army, and it will take half a year to repair it after the ceasefire. The Jiawang coal mine northeast of Xuzhou was attacked and greatly damaged by the Communist army yesterday. The people cannot understand the intention of the Communist army to continue destroying coal mines everywhere after the announcement of the ceasefire order. Also, the railway north of Lincheng was demolished by the Communist army for more than ten kilometers yesterday.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The transportation authorities are actively planning to repair the railways. It is reported that the first to be started is the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The damaged part of the road is about 300 kilometers long. The most difficult problem now is the material problem. There is a lack of rails and sleepers, which is even more troublesome. We are now quickly trying to buy them for application. It is reported that the highest authorities have ordered the Tianjin-Pukou line to be fully repaired and opened to traffic before the end of February, so the preparations for road repair are extremely active. The engineering personnel have all gathered in Xuzhou, waiting for the materials transported north from Pukou and the materials transported east along the Longhai Line to arrive before they will start work immediately. If there is no problem with the materials, it is said that it can be completed within the time limit. Secondly, the Huainan Road is easier to repair because it is a light railway, and it is already underway and can be repaired and opened to traffic in a short period of time.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] According to the Jinan District Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the sections of the Jiaoji Railway from Jinan to Xindian, Yaogou to Fangzi, and Caijiazhuang to Qingdao are all open to traffic without obstruction. The Zhangbo branch line is only open to Dakunlun. The remaining unrepaired sections are being rushed to repair.

### Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Busy in Nanjing for Ceasefire Work

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The deadline for the ceasefire has passed, but the Communist Party's credibility is not trusted. The hardship of the Nationalist army's task is increasing. When the Nanjing Army Headquarters issued the ceasefire order, it used all kinds of communication tools to transmit the ceasefire order and printed nearly one million leaflets, which were carried by planes and distributed to various places. After Deputy Chief of Staff Bai returned to Nanjing, the first question he asked Chief of Staff Xiao was about the ceasefire issue. The first thing Bai and Chen Cheng discussed after meeting was also the ceasefire issue. Minister Chen's enteritis has slightly improved, and it is reported that he will go to Shanghai for medical treatment in the next few days. Deputy Chief of Staff Bai is now busy with the ceasefire all day long. When asked whether the ceasefire can be viewed optimistically, Bai only nodded and pointed to the newspapers in Shanghai and Nanjing on the desk, saying: "We still need to wait for the facts to prove it." In addition, Deputy Chief of Staff Bai inspected Bengbu and Xuzhou this time and inquired in detail about the current traffic conditions and the suffering of refugees in various places, and gave many instructions.

### Wang Shijie Explains the Expanded Government Organization Plan at the Fourth Meeting

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] At the fourth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Wang Shijie explained the government organization plan. The main points are as follows:

The proposal to expand the government organization put forward by the Chinese Kuomintang representatives has been printed and distributed to everyone. Before explaining this proposal, let me report our basic concepts. First, we believe that the organization of government agencies should be expanded to accommodate people from outside the Kuomintang within government agencies. Second, we believe that the agencies that accommodate people from outside the Kuomintang should not be limited to the highest decision-making bodies of the government, but also the executive agencies can accommodate people from outside the party. Chairman Chiang also declared this in his New Year's Day broadcast. Third, the expanded organizational system is ultimately a transitional system from now until the implementation of constitutional government, so both legal and factual considerations must be taken into account. The so-called consideration of facts is to make this system closer to the future constitutional system; the so-called consideration of law is to avoid fundamentally shaking the legal system during this transitional period. We have formulated this plan for expanding the government organization based on the above three principles. Our plan for expanding the organization of the National Government consists of six items:

(1) The number of members of the National Government Committee will be increased by one-third from the original number. The current National Government Committee has 36 members, and 12 more members will be added, for a total of 48 members.

(2) Members of the National Government Committee may be appointed by the Chairman upon request to fill positions with people from outside the party. The so-called appointment means that the Chairman of the National Government requests the approval of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. This procedure will be maintained before the National Assembly is convened, otherwise the legal system will be changed. However, in terms of personnel selection, since we want to accommodate people from outside the Kuomintang today, we must first solicit opinions from all parties before requesting appointments. As for the distribution of quotas, it is also impossible to stipulate in law, especially under the current circumstances. If it is forced to be stipulated in writing, it will inevitably lead to unnecessary disputes and will not help. How to stipulate the distribution and personnel selection can be resolved after the government consults with all parties after the method is passed. However, I must add that everyone present recognizes that the Kuomintang is a large party participating in the leadership position. If the number of Kuomintang members is only more than the number of any other party, but does not have a certain majority, the Kuomintang will not be able to fulfill its leadership responsibilities.

(3) "The National Government Committee is the highest guiding organ for politics." This clause is an abstract provision. The actual power of this committee is clearly and specifically stipulated in the next clause.

(4) The National Government Committee has six powers: A, to discuss and decide on legislative principles. In the past ten years, this agency was formerly in the Central Political Conference, and later in the National Defense Supreme Council. The meaning of this power is that the principles of all legal bills are determined by the National Government Committee, and after the decision, the Legislative Yuan formulates laws based on the principles. The same applies when amending laws. B, to discuss and decide on policy guidelines. All major government policies have been discussed and decided by the Central Political Conference or the National Defense Supreme Council in the past, that is, the bi-weekly military and foreign affairs reports. After the reports, if it is deemed necessary to discuss and decide, it can also be discussed and decided. C, to discuss and decide on major military and political plans. Regarding military and political affairs, the Executive Yuan and the Military Affairs Commission are currently in charge, but the National Defense Supreme Council has the power to make all and final decisions on military and political affairs. The so-called power to discuss and decide on major military and political plans refers to this. D, to discuss and decide on financial plans and budgets. The government's annual national budget and other financial plans are now approved by the National Defense Supreme Council, which is changed here to be decided by the National Government Committee. E, matters submitted by the Chairman for discussion. The above five items are exercised by the National Government Committee. Here, I want to explain to you that this plan does not include the power of appointment, the power to select and appoint ministers of various ministries and commissions, within the powers of the National Government Committee. From the perspective of political effectiveness, we cannot include this power. The highest level of the power of appointment is selection and appointment, and the power of selection and appointment has never been exercised by the National Defense Supreme Council. As for the deputy ministers of various ministries and commissions, and the personnel selection of various provincial governments, it has always been decided by the Executive Yuan. If people from outside the party join the Executive Yuan in the future, they should participate in the exercise of this power of appointment. As for the appointment of ministers of various ministries and commissions, according to the examples of democratic countries, they are often not submitted to the parliament for approval. The United Kingdom is the most obvious example. In China's situation, if a responsible Premier of the Executive Yuan has to submit each minister to the National Government Committee for discussion and criticism, it will be difficult for the Premier to be responsible, and those who cherish their reputation may not be willing to take on the post of minister. Naturally, there may be improper personnel selections in the government as a result, but there is also a remedy for this, because our plan still has item "F", that is, one-third or more of the members can jointly propose any motion. Then, if a minister is found to be derelict in his duties, a motion for impeachment or other corrections can naturally be drawn up based on item "F". We believe that not only during this transition period, the method of the power of appointment can only be like this, but even in the future constitution, the appointment of ministers of the Executive Yuan will probably only be like this in principle.

(5) If the Chairman of the National Government finds it difficult to implement the resolutions of the National Government Committee, he may submit them for reconsideration. If two-thirds or more of the members still insist on maintaining the original plan during the reconsideration, the plan shall be implemented. The meaning of this clause is that the absolute veto power is not given to the Chairman, and at the same time, the Chairman of the National Government is not a so-called "reigning but not ruling" Chairman, like the head of state of the United Kingdom. The system in this clause can be said to be adopted from the United States.

(6) In case of emergency, the Chairman of the National Government may take expedient measures, but shall report to the National Government Committee after the measures are taken. In the current situation, it is inevitable that emergencies will occur externally. When emergencies occur, the Chairman must have the power to take emergency measures. The last clause is that the Executive Yuan shall establish several ministers without portfolio, and the ministers without portfolio may concurrently serve as ministers of various ministries and commissions. This clause is to enable people from outside the Kuomintang to participate in the executive agencies. As for the number of ministers without portfolio and whether they concurrently serve as ministers of various ministries and commissions, it should not be rigidly stipulated, and the needs of future facts can be used to determine it.

In this plan, we did not mention the National Political Council. The reason for not mentioning it is that the task of this National Assembly has yet to be clarified. It remains to be determined whether the task of the National Assembly is to draft a constitution or to implement a constitution. If the National Assembly is convened on May 5 and drafts and implements a constitution at the same time, the issue of the National Political Council may not need to be discussed much, otherwise the status of the National Political Council must be seriously considered. We are prepared to offer our views on the National Political Council issue when the task of the National Assembly has been decided. (End)

### UN General Assembly Scheduled to Discuss Atomic Energy Control This Week; Yugoslav Representative Elected to the Economic and Social Council

[Report from this newspaper] According to a London broadcast on the 14th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has arrived in London today to lead the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to discuss the control of atomic energy and the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) this week. After a two-hour meeting yesterday, the Standing Committee has already decided on the agenda issues.

[United Press, London, 14th] When the United Nations General Assembly debates the issue of atomic energy control this week, US Secretary of State Byrnes, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, French Foreign Minister Bidault, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will all speak. At the same time, two proposals from the Cuban representative were not included on the agenda. One proposed expanding the Executive Committee, which was referred to a special committee of the General Assembly. The other requested a declaration on international obligations and the rights of humanity and nations, which was deemed unnecessary because the United Nations Charter already had adequate provisions.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Representatives of various countries at the United Nations General Assembly today emphasized reorganizing the Social and Economic Council to eradicate the roots of war in the social and economic fields. Representatives of various delegations discussed outside the meeting and generally believed that the Council is expected to begin work within two weeks to improve the lives of people around the world, solve unemployment problems, and protect various basic freedoms of mankind.

[United Press, London, 14th] Eighteen seats on the United Nations Economic and Social Council are being contested. Seventeen have already been elected. New Zealand and Yugoslavia were competing for the remaining seat. Today, New Zealand withdrew its candidacy, and Yugoslavia was elected, breaking the deadlock. At the same time, the General Assembly decided on the terms of office for the council members as follows: China, France, Canada, Belgium, Chile, and Peru will each serve three years; the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, India, Norway, Cuba, and Czechoslovakia will each serve two years; and the United States, Greece, Ukraine, Colombia, Lebanon, and Yugoslavia will each serve one year.

Security Council to Convene Soon to Lay Foundation for the United Nations

[United Press, London, 14th] The Security Council, composed of the five major powers and eleven countries including Brazil, Poland, the Netherlands, Egypt, and Mexico, is scheduled to meet at the beginning of this week to equip the United Nations with teeth, decide on the meeting date of the Military Staff Committee composed of the chiefs of staff of the five major powers, and order it to determine the distribution table of military force provided by the fifty-one member states for the organization of the world security force. The Security Council will then decide on the selection of the Secretary-General, and the five major powers must unanimously agree on the selection of the person. It is reported that General Eisenhower will definitely not be a candidate for Secretary-General. Other details are not known, and perhaps this issue will have to wait until the plenary session convened in the United States in April before a decision can be made. One of the important tasks determined by this plenary session is to establish a Trusteeship Council to supervise the implementation of the United Nations Trusteeship System. All territories currently under mandate, territories taken from enemy countries, or territories voluntarily wishing to be placed under the trusteeship of other countries are subject to the jurisdiction of the trusteeship system. Some British newspapers predict that when the General Assembly discusses this issue, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will first propose that Britain's mandated territories, including Palestine, Tanganyika, Togoland, and part of the former German African colonies and the Pacific's Nauru, be transferred to the United Nations Trusteeship Council.

Various Parties Favor Eisenhower for the Post of General Assembly Secretary-General

[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 14th: The post of Secretary-General of the United Nations is of great importance, and many parties favor General Eisenhower, but Eisenhower has stated that he is unwilling to take on this position.

[United Press, London, 14th] The "London Sunday Express" urged the United Nations representatives to nominate General Eisenhower as Secretary-General of the United Nations General Assembly, making him "the most powerful person in the world." The newspaper said that Eisenhower is detached from the politics of his own country and other countries, and is unanimously trusted by the people of all countries in the world. The newspaper declared, "Whoever is elected Secretary-General of the General Assembly will be the most powerful person in the world, because he has the power to punish aggressor nations."

### Pan-American Foreign Ministers Conference Scheduled for This Spring; Mexican Government Issues Declaration Advocating Joint Action to Prevent Aggression Yesterday

[United Press, Mexico City, 14th] The Mexican government issued a declaration last night, ten thousand words in length, proposing that when the foreign ministers of the American countries meet in the Brazilian capital this spring, they should conclude a treaty under which all countries will take joint action to prevent aggression. If disputes arise among the American countries, they should be submitted to the Pan-American Committee or the International Court of Justice for handling. The contracting countries should formally declare that they will not engage in wars of aggression. If the American countries have disputes with other countries, they must not resort to force. Except as permitted by the United Nations organization or as decided by it to take joint action, or as legitimate self-defense under the United Nations Charter, force must not be used under any circumstances. The following methods should be used to impose sanctions on aggressor countries: recall ambassadors stationed in the country, sever diplomatic, economic, and commercial relations, suspend all postal and telecommunication exchanges, or use military force. As for which country is merely an aggressor country, if there is any doubt, the Executive Committee of the Pan-American Union should make a temporary decision first, and then the Pan-American Consultation Meeting should make a final decision. This treaty should be signed by the American countries within this year, and a Pan-American Staff Corps should be organized to control the military forces that each country should dispatch to deal with the aggressor country.

### US Secretary of the Navy Discusses New US Naval Plan; Will Maintain Seven Fleets Totaling 1,079 Warships, Large and Small, Stationed in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean

[US Information Agency, Washington, 13th] The US Department of the Navy today announced the 1946 deployment plan for the US fleet. According to US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal at a press conference on the 11th: The Department of the Navy has adapted to the needs by referring to the complex issues of modern naval organization. Those who attended the Secretary's press conference also included Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Nimitz and Under Secretary of the Navy. Forrestal said: The naval war plan has been reflected in the mission of the Under Secretary of Naval Operations. All naval combat weapons, with special emphasis on aviation, submarines, amphibious warfare, and research. The Navy will utilize the experience and lessons of World War II and apply the experience to practical plans, trials, and peacetime training. He also said: "The Navy has always paid great attention to aviation, but at the same time, it has never neglected or overemphasized other factors in naval warfare. All naval weapons must be continuously improved." Our post-war navy must combine all the elements that make up the navy into one, modernize it, and make it extremely excellent. The current appointment of experienced officers for aviation, submarines, amphibious warfare, and weapons improvement is the first step. Admiral Nimitz announced the 1946 Atlantic and Pacific naval plan, stating that the plan aims to support US foreign policy and the occupation forces in Europe and the western Pacific, while completing naval demobilization and assisting the Army's restoration work, and also training the post-war navy.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The Department of the Navy announced today that the United States will maintain seven fleets after the war, totaling 1,079 warships, of which 319 are active, 73 are reserve, and 687 are stationed domestically. These seven fleets are distributed as follows: three stationed in the Atlantic, three stationed in the Pacific, and one stationed in the Mediterranean and European waters. The headquarters of the Pacific Fleet will remain in Pearl Harbor. The vacancy left by former Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Spruance will be filled by Admiral Towers. According to the Department of the Navy, all warships in each fleet in each ocean will be rotated. For the purpose of training personnel and in accordance with other needs, foreign countries will be visited. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Nimitz has nine senior officers to assist him, and at the first meeting, he announced the naval administrative policy in accordance with the current organizational structure. It is said that the US Navy's post-war policy can be reflected in the selection of the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. Among all types of naval weapons, special emphasis is placed on aircraft, submarines, amphibious operations, and research. The US Navy plans to fully utilize the experience gained in World War II and incorporate this experience into experimental programs and peacetime exercise tactics.

### The United States Army, Navy, and Air Force to Conduct Atomic Bomb Explosion Force Tests This Summer; Johnson Predicts Future Navies Will Only Operate Underwater; Conant States Atomic Energy May Be Available for Commercial Use Within Five Years

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th (Reuters)] Rear Admiral Blandy, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, told reporters today that the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force will jointly conduct tests this summer on the impact of atomic bomb explosions on warships and surface and underwater vessels. If Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz agrees, tests of unmanned rockets may also be conducted simultaneously.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Vice Admiral Blandy, Deputy Chief of Special Weapons Operations of the U.S. Navy, officially announced today that the joint Army-Navy plan to test the effects of atomic bombs on large fleets is now ready and has been handed over to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who will soon disclose the location, date, and other details of the test. This test, which could revolutionize naval warfare, will not be held before spring, but a fleet is currently being assembled. Its composition remains secret, but it is expected to include captured German and Japanese vessels as well as obsolete American ships. Well-informed sources predict that Vice Admiral Blandy will be appointed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the overall commander of this test. Blandy stated that the test will involve a large number of personnel, including naval aviators, army aviators, army troops, and scientific personnel. It must be conducted from domestic, international, and naval, army, and technical perspectives. An official announcement revealed for the first time that observers from other Allied countries may be allowed to attend.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Senator Johnson, a member of the Senate Atomic Energy Committee, predicted that in the future atomic world, all navies will operate underwater. He stated that since the birth of the atomic bomb, all surface ships have become ineffective. He imagines future battleships as uranium-powered submarines equipped with atomic bomb rockets. In future wars, not only battleships but also oil tankers and aircraft carriers will operate underwater. He stated, "The entire navy must operate underwater because surface ships cannot withstand the power of atomic bombs." Johnson believes that mankind will never be able to abandon atomic bombs as weapons of war. "This is the cheapest and most effective weapon. If there is war, it will inevitably be used. Anyone who thinks otherwise is deceiving themselves."

[United States Information Service, New York, 13th] According to New York Times reporter Pearce, the Society of Automotive Engineers, at a meeting held in Detroit last week, predicted that atomic energy could be used for commercial purposes within five years. According to Dr. Conant, former president of the Columbia University Institute, "Based on the progress of research on the commercial application of atomic energy, it seems possible to use atomic energy in large power plants, transport ships, airplanes, jets, propulsion engines, and rockets. However, I do not currently believe that atomic energy can be used to power automobiles, as at least five to ten feet of space is required to protect against atomic energy radiation." "Atomic energy is unlikely to completely replace ordinary fuels in most applications but will serve as a supplement to existing fuels." "There is hope for obtaining cheap atomic energy by burning lower-grade materials together with U-235, which may reduce the production cost of atomic energy." "We currently only have superficial gains. At present, the equivalent cost of U-235 is US$52,000 per pound, while aviation gasoline only costs two cents per gallon. Compared to coal, U-235 costs US$9,000 per pound, while coal only costs US$6 per ton. The most pressing issue now is how to effectively utilize its high temperature. Fortunately, atomic energy can be applied at low temperatures, and most industrial applications do not require a very high concentration of U-235. In other words, the substance does not exist under highly explosive conditions."

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] The establishment of the United Nations headquarters has raised many questions in Washington. Although the permanent location of the headquarters has been decided to be near New York or Boston on the East Coast of the United States, the exact amount of funding required, the number of buildings needed, and when it can be completed are still uncertain. Some speculate that the construction cost may be US$25 million, or even more. This is based on the fact that the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva cost approximately US$10 million to build, and it was built during the recession around 1930, when labor costs in Switzerland were much lower than in the United States. However, in the coming years, the prices of raw materials and wages in the United States are likely to be very high, and the United Nations organization requires more buildings than the old League of Nations. The League of Nations had only five main buildings: offices, an assembly hall, conference rooms, a library, and a secretariat. No one knows how many buildings the United Nations organization needs, but it will inevitably need more space than the old League of Nations. The League of Nations had a maximum of fifty member states, and only forty-five remained at the end. The United Nations organization currently has fifty-one member states, and it is expected to increase to sixty in the future. The scope of work of the United Nations organization is also much broader than that of the League of Nations, so it undoubtedly needs more staff. The League of Nations had a maximum of seven hundred staff members, including senior scientific and economic advisors and secretaries. The United Nations General Assembly will soon decide on the permanent location of the headquarters and send a design committee to carry out the design work of the headquarters. According to the current plan, this committee must submit its final recommendations by 1947, and construction of the headquarters will begin immediately. The required expenses will be shared proportionally by the member states. Architects from various countries will likely compete for the selection of the building style under the guidance of the United Nations organization, as they did during the construction of the headquarters in Geneva. After the drawings are finalized and all preparatory work is completed, the next question will be how long it will take to build these buildings. Various speculations seem to have reasons, so it is impossible to say a rough period. The old League of Nations began working in London in 1919, and the cornerstone of the Geneva headquarters was laid in 1929, but it was not fully completed until 1936. The interior decoration was mostly donated by member states, which was an excellent opportunity for publicity in various countries. Their art statues, etc., could be used to showcase them to the world. This method may still be adopted by the United Nations organization, and the maintenance costs may still be borne by the member states. In addition, there are many other minor issues, such as whether the staff of the United Nations headquarters enjoy extraterritorial rights in the United States, like foreign ambassadors and ministers to the United States. According to current diplomatic practice, the host country cannot sue foreign ambassadors and ministers for debts or arrest them for murder. Only their home governments have the right to do so.

### Korean People Demonstrate Again to Protest Trusteeship

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 13th] Approximately 1,000 Korean people marched today, scattering leaflets, to protest the Moscow Conference's decision to place Korea under a four-power trusteeship, expressing sympathy for the newly established "Committee of Seventy-Seven." This is the third anti-trusteeship demonstration in two weeks. National Party leader and "Committee of Seventy-Seven" member Cai Hong (transliteration) stated that the demonstration was the final expression of the Korean people's hatred for the trusteeship plan. At the same time, Communist leaders, under attack from various parties claiming they advocate the Sovietization of Korea, specifically announced their denial.

### Japanese General Election Postponed to Mid-March; MacArthur Approves New Cabinet Appointments

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th (Special Telegram)] According to Allied General Headquarters instructions, the Japanese general election, originally scheduled for this month, will be postponed until before March 15th. The Japanese government will continue to maintain its position until that time. Headquarters instructions explained the nature of this general election, stating that the most important thing is to take all steps to ensure that the free and unrestrained will of the Japanese people is fully expressed in this election. All Japanese people should take necessary measures to ensure that this inviolable right can be effectively implemented.

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] MacArthur's Headquarters approved the new appointees of the Shidehara Cabinet last night. At 11 p.m., the final three cabinet members of the completed cabinet reshuffle were formally appointed before the Emperor Hirohito. The new three cabinet members are Minister of Interior and Minister of Transportation Chuzo Mituchi, Minister of Education Abe, and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Tsuchishima. Today, according to reliable sources, the new Minister of Commerce, Saburo Ogasawara, formerly served as the president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, so questions arose during the final decision, causing the formal appointment ceremony to be delayed.

### Australia Still Suffering from Heat

### Eisenhower and Nimitz Attend Congress to Answer Demobilization Criticisms; American Troops in the India-Burma Theater Demand to Return Home

[United Press, Washington, 13th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower and U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz will attend a joint meeting of Congress on Tuesday to answer questions regarding the slow progress of the Army and Navy demobilization plans. This is a direct result of the demonstrations made by American troops in various places regarding the slow demobilization. The extent to which Army and Navy leaders can quell congressional public anger will likely have a significant impact on the passage of the compulsory military training bill and the extended service bill.

[Associated Press, Calcutta, 13th] Five thousand American troops in the India-Burma theater met today, accusing the Army Department authorities of improper demobilization arrangements, shipping non-essential materials back to the United States first. This is the second major meeting held by American troops since April. The meeting passed a resolution requesting the U.S. Congress to urge demobilization, immediately sending back to the country all personnel whose implementation of American policy is not absolutely necessary.

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] According to Army Department records, more than half of the U.S. Army has been demobilized, and one-third of the Air Force has been demobilized. At its peak, the U.S. Army had eighty-six combat divisions, totaling 8.3 million people. Forty-six divisions, approximately 5 million people, have now been demobilized.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Rear Admiral Denfield, Chief of Naval Personnel, announced today that all naval personnel whose service period is about to expire can retire. It is said that as of January 8th, the number of naval officers and soldiers has decreased from a peak of 3.3 million to 1,316,299, slightly exceeding the planned demobilization plan. After the demobilization is completed, the Personnel Bureau will be responsible for maintaining a regular navy of 500,000 people.

### Japanese War Crimes Issues Included on the Agenda of the Far Eastern Commission

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] The issue of Japanese war criminals has been included on the agenda of the Far Eastern Commission today. The committee has broad powers to determine the occupation policy of Japan. The issue of war responsibility is within its scope of discussion. However, representatives have not expressed whether any changes will be recommended in terms of policy. Major General Dyke, director of the Civil Information and Education Section of Headquarters, discussed the Japanese education reform plan with representatives today. The delegation is scheduled to inspect the factory area and Yokohama within two days, and hold meetings with the military government and the import and export group on Thursday. On the 24th of this month, they will discuss the issue of war criminals with the judicial authorities of Headquarters. Major General McCoy, chairman of the committee, announced today that the eleven member representatives (the Soviet Union has not yet sent a representative to join) of the Far Eastern Commission have not yet decided whether any recommendations will be made regarding the occupation policy during their stay in Tokyo. Perhaps they will only take action after leaving Japan. It is now decided to depart on the original ship, the "Mount McKinley," and arrive back in Honolulu on the second of next month.

### U.S. Congress Convened Yesterday; Relations Between Congress and the President Are Tense; Members of the Senate and House of Representatives Will Be Re-elected

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The second session of the 79th U.S. Congress convened today, which is the first peacetime meeting since 1941. The problems to be discussed are piled up like mountains. How to mediate the relationship between Congress and the president, which is tense to the point of breaking, is also a concern of all parties. In addition, this year is also a year for the re-election of Congress. All 435 members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate members, namely 32 people, will be re-elected in November. At that time, the Republican Party will take the opportunity to overthrow the Democratic Party's advantage in Congress. Its success or failure is enough to influence the American political situation thereafter, so both parties are going all out for this week's meeting.

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The White House announced today that President Truman is preparing to request Congress to extend the effective period of the wartime price control law for one year, until June 30th of next year. It is heard that Congress intends to approve it with slight amendments.

### International Trade Conference to Be Convened in Washington This Spring; Representatives from Fourteen Countries Will Attend; It Is Said the Soviet Union Plans to Request Loans from the United States

[United Press, Washington, 14th] According to sources in Washington today, an international conference will be held this spring. Representatives from fourteen countries other than the United States will attend the conference. The main purpose is to discuss the conclusion of a separate trade agreement between the United States and the participating countries. The countries attending the meeting include Australia, Brazil, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Netherlands, India, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] According to reliable sources, France is continuing to request economic assistance from the United States, and other countries are also eager to obtain loans from the United States. It is rumored that the Soviet Union plans to obtain a US$6 billion credit loan from the United States. According to another reliable source, the amount of loans that foreign countries, especially European countries, intend to borrow from the U.S. Export-Import Bank has exceeded the bank's fund several times. Officials believe that Congress must be consulted as to whether it intends to increase its lending capacity. It is pointed out that a few months ago, Congress approved a new amount of US$2.8 billion, increasing the bank's lending capacity to US$3.5 billion. It is said that although the U.S. Export-Import Bank has approved loans to France, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, and Denmark, the needs of other countries have greatly exceeded the bank's remaining funds.

### Development Plan for Andaman Islands Under Study

[Reuters, New Delhi, 14th] The Indian government is studying a plan to develop the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. The two island groups stretch for 250 miles in the Bay of Bengal. The climate is particularly suitable for growing sugar cane and for animal husbandry. The timber produced in Andaman is of rare quality in the Indian Ocean region, comparable to the wood used for Swedish matches. It is planned that sawn timber and matchwood will be exported from the island in large quantities within three months.

### Overseas Chinese Guerrilla Leader Colonel Lim Bo Seng's Remains Buried in Malaya

[Reuters, Singapore, 14th] The remains of Colonel Lim Bo Seng, leader of the Overseas Chinese Guerrilla, were buried yesterday in the suburbs of the city, at Lim's and his family's former residence, with great honor. First, Chief Executive McCullen laid a wreath in front of the coffin, and then the funeral procession departed, passing through the city to the suburbs, a distance of five miles, with crowds of people lining the streets to pay their respects. Colonel Whiteham of the British Army delivered a speech in Chinese, recalling his collaboration with Lim, first in India, and then jumping into the forests of Malaya by parachute to engage in guerrilla activities. According to McCullen, a monument will be built in Singapore to commemorate Lim's achievements. During the funeral procession, officials sent by the Chinese government who had infiltrated Malaya by plane or submarine, as well as groups from the 2nd Battalion of the British Highland Light Infantry, led the way with British armored vehicles.

### U.S. Receives Payments for Remaining Materials in China to Promote Cultural Exchange; U.S. Senate Military Committee to Discuss Further

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The proceeds from the sale of the remaining U.S. materials in China may be transferred to a scholarship fund for the exchange of Chinese and American students. Senator Yake proposed in Congress to turn U.S. wartime weapons into a tool to promote international understanding, to be applied to countries such as China, Australia, Britain, France, India, and the Soviet Union. The so-called exchange students will include transportation, education, and other scholarship expenses, estimated at US$2.5 million per country per year. The proposal will soon be submitted to the Senate Military Committee for opinions. This move will make the State Department the agent for all remaining overseas materials and lend-lease items. The State Department can use this to enter into agreements with relevant foreign governments, so that the funds can be used as a "fund for teaching and research for foreign students in the United States and American students abroad, and all other educational activities."

### The United States Announces the Invention of an Electronic Reconnaissance Device

[Associated Press, New York, 13th] The U.S. Navy Department announced today the long-range electronic reconnaissance device invented during the war. It is said that this device played an important role in the victory of the Atlantic naval battles. Its technical term is called "High-Frequency Electrical Guidance Direction Finder," which can locate a ship or an airplane in half the world, but it is often used in conjunction with the weather predictor radar for shorter distances. This device is installed on ships or airplanes and can disperse submarine groups before they gather. In 1942, it detected the location of a German submarine that had landed saboteurs on Long Island and sunk it. This device can collect any sound or radio signal in international traffic routes and display the direction of its source in a fraction of a second. By installing two or three sets on shore or in the air and sea, simple arithmetic can be used to calculate it.

### Nationwide Telephone Workers Brewing General Strike

Labor Department Mediation Fails

[Reuters, New York, 14th] The Labor Department's mediation of the telephone workers' strike has failed. The union is still in a meeting and should be able to decide within a few hours whether to order a general strike of all 263,000 telephone workers nationwide.

### France Begins Arresting Wealthy Traitors; The Power of the "Two Hundred Families" Declines

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] French authorities have begun arresting wealthy traitors, many of whom belong to the so-called "Two Hundred Families." National Production Minister Paul (a communist member of the cabinet) decided to investigate the activities of the three directors of several electrical and steel manufacturing plants during the German occupation. Paul's actions were not submitted to the cabinet for a decision. However, most of the factories that continued to operate during the German occupation will be affected, and so far, no industrial leaders have been brought to trial for treason. With the next election scheduled for June, there are widespread calls for major entrepreneurs with confirmed treasonous acts to be punished before the election. Since the liberation of France, the economic and political power of the so-called "Two Hundred Families" has been greatly hit. If this broad term is used to refer to people who have become wealthy through generations of operating industry and commerce, their number may be close to four thousand, far more than two hundred families. Before the war, these "Two Hundred Families" actually controlled most of France's industry, including banks, railways, steel industry, telephone industry, shipyards, power plants, telegraph companies, automobile factories, insurance companies, textile factories, distilleries, flour mills, sugar factories, and a large number of food stores. Now, the coal mines in northern France have been nationalized, the Bank of France and the four major lending banks, as well as the Renault automobile factory, have also come under state control, and power plants will soon be taken over. Therefore, the economic and political status of France's wealthy has been shaken.

### Britain Is Preparing to Film Outdoor Radio Telecasting

[Reuters, London, 14th] The boat race from Putney to Interlaken is scheduled for March 30th, and the Epsom Derby may also be held in early June. If the broadcasting company's plan is completed by then, the competition will be filmed by radio telecasting machines. The broadcasting company has formed two photography teams specializing in outdoor telecasting, equipped with two or three specially equipped trucks, costing as much as 40,000 pounds each. Telecasting personnel will gather in mid-February to discuss the filming plan.

### Local Correspondence

Songjiang

Fire Department Organization Completed

The fire-fighting affairs in our county, after the fall of Chongqing, were limited by funding and not fully prepared. It is now learned that the association actually in charge has restored the original Firefighting Federation organization, with four district associations established under it. Tang Chengmei is the chairman, and it is divided into three sections: General Affairs, Investigation, and Affairs, each with specific responsibilities. Wu Zhongfang and three others are the directors of Districts One, Two, Three, and Four.

Hangzhou

Principles Decided for Financial Relief

In recent years, the finances of various counties in Zhejiang Province have reached an extreme state of difficulty, and local autonomy projects cannot be carried out. The total estimated revenue of all counties in the province for this year may only be a little over 4 billion yuan, while the total expenditure is about 8 billion yuan. The revenue is only half of the expenditure. The provincial government specially resolved the following five principles for balancing the estimated revenue and expenditure of each county for this year the other day:

Suzhou

The Jiangsu High Court Orders the Arrest of Yuan Shu

Yuan Shu, a native of Hubei who once served as the president of the puppet "New China Daily" newspaper, the head of the Jiangsu Education Department, and the deputy director of the Qingxiang Office, etc., was reported for promoting enemy propaganda. After the Jiangsu High Court issued a summons that went unanswered, it sent a letter to all military and police agencies requesting their cooperation in his arrest and investigation.

Changshu

Sixth Political Affairs Meeting Held

The county government held its sixth political affairs meeting yesterday. County Magistrate An presided over the meeting, and the following important cases were resolved: (1) To formulate measures to encourage animal husbandry and protect afforestation, to increase production; (2) To formulate regulations and detailed implementation rules for requisitioning labor for dredging rivers, as well as methods for rewards and punishments, to facilitate construction; (3) To formulate provisional measures and forms for handling commercial registration, to be submitted to the province for approval; (4) The Civil Affairs and Construction Departments will jointly form a National Labor Service Corps.

Submitting a Request to Restore First-Class County Status　Before the war, this county was originally a first-class county. Recently, the provincial government adjusted county levels, downgrading this county to a second-class county. Local people here believe that the county's population, land area, and taxes all meet the requirements for a first-class county, and have specially jointly submitted a request to the provincial government to restore its first-class county status.

Jiangyin

Sending Representatives to the Province to Request Relief

This county is located in a strategic area and suffered severe damage from the enemy and puppets during the Anti-Japanese War. Since the establishment of the Post-War Relief Association, it has actively begun investigations. The index of loss is extremely large and cannot be restored without five years of construction. Now, Shen Yalen and others have been specially appointed to go to the province to report the actual situation to the provincial government, the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation, and the Su-Ning Branch, and to request the dispatch of special commissioners to Cheng (Jiangyin) for inspection, to clarify the situation and to expedite the implementation of relief work.

Wuxi

County Administration Expenses Must Be Self-Sustained　Jiangsu National Assemblyman Xue Mingjian telegraphed the Executive Yuan last month, requesting that the central government should coordinate the administrative expenses of various counties in the recovered areas. Recently, he received a reply telegram from President Song stating, "National Assembly transmits to Assemblyman Xue Mingjian, your message of November, Zhen is received, I know the financial situation of the recovered areas and the difficult situation, which shows your concern for the people's suffering. However, since the restoration has just begun, the national expenditure is huge, and the legal local autonomous taxes should still be collected, in addition to the exemption of field taxes. Therefore, at the beginning of the restoration of each province, given the exhaustion of the people's strength in the occupied areas and the shortage of tax revenue, the government allocated recovery expenses for support. Now that order is gradually being restored in various places, and industry and commerce have also entered a normal state, the administrative expenses of each county should not entirely depend on the national treasury, and self-sufficiency is required. From next year onwards, in addition to the central government's allocation of national taxes at an increased percentage to the recovered county and city expenses, a subsidy method has been set for all county and cities that have exempted field taxes. The central government will allocate the percentage of field tax and the originally stipulated county-level conscription of 30% county-level public grain, which will be allocated by the national treasury to stabilize the lives of county-level personnel. This is a reply to the previous telegram. Please note, Song Ziwen, Dong Xing, four seals."

### Government and Communist Party Representatives' Talks: The Four Stages
### Shao Lizi and Zhou Enlai's Reports to the Third Consultation Meeting

First Report (Continued and Concluded) Shao Lizi

Gentlemen and members of the press, having reviewed the four stages of the talks, you can judge whether both sides participated with sincerity. You can also see that none of the participants dared to slack off. Mr. Zhou has already spoken about the achievements of the meeting, especially regarding the decisions of the Political Consultative Conference. The time spent on the issue of the Political Consultative Conference was not insignificant. It is really not easy to demand quick results in our meeting habits and techniques. However, everyone had the desire to resolve the issues. Therefore, although much time was spent, it was not wasted or intentionally delayed. The talks were not public, with only a simple news bulletin released each day, which both sides deemed necessary. This was to cultivate a good atmosphere in the talks and avoid unnecessary provocation. During the talks, we spoke frankly about everything. Sometimes, we argued until our faces were red and our veins were popping, but we could soon return to a harmonious mood. If the talks were public, perhaps some would take things out of context and make hasty accusations, which would affect the psychology of the participants. Restraints during the talks would lead to reluctance to speak freely. Therefore, both sides agreed to publish the contents to the public when there were results, but to refrain from doing so during the talks. Every issue discussed can be said to be within the minutes of the meeting. If there are points that were not published, they were agreed upon by both sides. Today, I might as well offer a brief explanation to dispel certain misunderstandings. For example, after the meeting minutes were published, military conflicts occurred and escalated. Was this not considered during the talks? I want to clarify that the initial draft of the meeting minutes had thirteen items. The original text of the last item was about avoiding conflict. The Communist Party proposed that all armed conflicts should cease immediately, as long as the Communist troops did not obstruct the advance of the Central Army. This was because the Communist Party initially requested a halt to the advance, and the Central Government clearly replied that the Central Army was advancing to accept surrender, and the Communist Party should not obstruct it. In the final draft of the minutes, the text mentioned above was removed at the insistence of the Communist Party when the meeting minutes were about to be published, to which the Central Government representatives agreed. At that time, the intention was not to cause unease among the people, hoping that discussions would continue quickly after the minutes were published, and that all issues would be resolved, so that military conflicts could naturally be avoided. Later, the talks progressed slowly, and the Military Subcommittee never even convened, which was not foreseen at the time.

Mutual Concessions for the Sake of the Country; Both Sides Have Their Positions

The matters insisted upon during the talks, as seen in the tenth item of the minutes, clearly show that this issue has not been resolved. However, even in this item, we acknowledge that the Communist Party had its position and made concessions, and the Central Government did not completely reject the Communist Party's views. For example, regarding the popular election of governments at all levels, the government representatives stated that they could agree from the county level to the administrative inspectorate area. The meeting minutes also stated, "The Central Government can consider county-level elections plus appointments, while provincial-level elections must wait until the constitution is promulgated and the status of the provinces is determined before they can be implemented." From these points, it can be seen that both sides made many concessions, while also maintaining their respective positions. The government's position was that military and political orders must be unified, a point that it could not concede. During the talks, the government did not first propose a concrete plan, which may be subject to criticism from our conscience and friends. We did not take the initiative in the talks, but we are happy to accept this criticism. Why didn't the government proactively propose a plan? There is a very important reason for this.

An Amicable Atmosphere; The Government Consistently Cultivated It

After the victory of the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang's telegram inviting Mr. Mao Zedong fully explained the government's hopes. We only wanted to listen to the Communist Party's opinions. If the government had first proposed a concrete plan, it might have led the Communist Party to believe that the government already had a preconceived notion, which would have hindered the progress of the talks. The Communist Party initially put forward eleven points, to which the government responded to each one in writing. Although there were slight changes in the published items of the meeting minutes, they were largely based on the eleven points initially proposed by the Communist Party. From this, it can be further seen that the government consistently cultivated an amicable atmosphere and sought to resolve the issues with sincerity. Speaking of the concessions made by both sides, there are many instances that can be seen. At the beginning of the discussion of practical issues, Mr. Zhou Enlai stated that the Communist Party was prepared to make concessions this time and would not insist on the conditions put forward between December of the previous year and January of this year, such as party conferences, a coalition government, and a joint command. Therefore, when the government responded to the eleven issues, it immediately accepted whatever it deemed should be agreed to and tolerated, and frankly explained the reasons for anything that needed further consideration. The meeting minutes already had a solution, but the military issues that were still pending implementation were also the result of concessions from both sides. For example, the number of Communist troops reduced to twenty divisions clearly demonstrated the concessions made by both sides. The Central Government initially agreed to reorganize the Communist troops into twelve divisions, because in the 32nd year of the Republic, the Communist Party only requested ten to twelve divisions. In the 33rd year of the Republic, the Communist Party only requested six armies and fifteen divisions. This time, the Communist Party initially requested forty-eight divisions, and finally compromised on twenty divisions, which is clear evidence of concessions from both sides.

Political and Military Orders; The Government Firmly Insisted on Unification

What the Central Government resolutely hoped to achieve, and what the people of the country commonly believe is important, is the issue of the unification of military and political orders. As long as military and political orders are unified, all issues can be discussed and resolved. I have always believed that both sides are sincere in resolving the issues. The points on which they have not been able to compromise are due to their respective non-negotiable positions, but they are definitely not insurmountable and cannot be mutually resolved. During these talks, many issues have indeed been resolved, such as convening the Political Consultative Conference. When the meeting minutes were published, a general plan had already been agreed upon, so the time spent on this issue in the resumed talks on October 20th was not much. Also, regarding the National Assembly issue, we have heard Mr. Mao Zedong's views and know that he has a spirit of compromise. Of course, the various issues related to this will have to be resolved by the Political Consultative Conference. Finally, in my position as a government representative, I express my unforgettable gratitude for the assistance and enthusiastic attitude that General Hurley gave to the talks between the two sides. In particular, his efforts in the last two days before leaving Chongqing moved us even more. I take this opportunity to report this and express my admiration!

Second Report (Continued and Concluded) Zhou Enlai

The Communist Party put forward eleven key points, and then the government representatives responded to each item in writing. The points on which agreement was reached during the discussions were recorded, and the points on which agreement was not reached were further discussed. Subsequently, the Double Tenth Agreement, the meeting minutes of the government and Communist Party representatives, was signed. Among them, there were still several major issues that were deemed unnecessary to publish because they had not yet been resolved and needed to be discussed later. For example, regarding the issue of advancing troops, the government troops requested to go to all enemy-occupied areas to accept surrender, while the Communist Party requested that some areas where the armed forces led by the Communist Party were active, the enemy-occupied areas that had already been liberated, or the enemy-occupied areas that had already been surrounded by the armed forces led by the Communist Party, should have both sides' troops temporarily stationed in their original locations before the issue of accepting surrender was resolved, because they could not agree with each other, so the meeting minutes did not include it. Clearly, after the publication of the meeting minutes, the root cause of the continued expansion of the conflict lies here, which can also be seen in the twelve items that have already been published. During this period, the discussion went from general principles to specific issues, and we have always considered the resolution of general principles to be the main success of the Double Tenth Agreement, because as the transition from the War of Resistance to peace, both parties believed that it was necessary to establish basic principles so that the cause of peaceful national construction could have something to follow. Therefore, Mr. Mao first stated this principle to Chairman Chiang, which was agreed to and appreciated by Chairman Chiang. This principle has already been announced in the first item of the meeting minutes. I believe that it is still unchangeable today, and it is often relied upon to prevent the unfortunate conflicts that have occurred in the past few months from continuing and stopping. Precisely because a principle has been established, entering into the discussion of specific issues can achieve many agreements, such as the Political Consultative Conference in the second item of the meeting minutes, which has already been held here. The people's rights and local autonomy and other issues in the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth items were again announced by Chairman Chiang the day before yesterday. The ninth item is about the military issue. The Communist Party put forward opinions on the reorganization of the national army and also acknowledged the minimum number of Communist troops to be reorganized and the withdrawal of troops under the leadership of the Communist Party from eight regions, and prepared to establish a three-person military subcommittee to discuss the issue of military reorganization. The tenth item is about the liberated areas. This issue could not be agreed upon, so a method was decided: (1) continue to discuss; (2) if the discussion is unresolved, submit it to the Political Consultative Conference for discussion. The eleventh and twelfth items are about traitors and surrender, and agreements have been reached in principle, but because they are related to the issue of advancing troops, they have also been discussed but not resolved. From this, it can be seen that in the meeting minutes, political principles have been established, people's rights have been secured, the nationalization of the army has been stipulated, and a method for taking the first step has been established, but local political power has not been properly resolved. This continued until the talks after the Double Tenth Festival last year, and it still has not been resolved. From the experiences of these two periods of discussions, it can be seen how difficult it is for the two parties, which have been in opposition for many years, to reach an agreement. Therefore, we feel that it is better to learn a lesson from painful experiences for the reference of everyone at this Political Consultative Conference, rather than just empty talk about the past.

Maintaining the Basic Spirit; Mutual Recognition and Mutual Agreement

Now, I would like to share the four lessons learned from the discussions with everyone: The first point is to recognize each other and not to belittle each other. Since we are discussing, we want to solve the problem politically, so we should recognize each other and not be hostile to each other. In particular, the representatives of the two sides in the discussion should always maintain this attitude. I would like to especially mention here Mr. Zhang Huainan, a Kuomintang friend who worked for unity in the first half of the War of Resistance and passed away, and we should commemorate him. Mutual recognition and no hostility is not only what the parties concerned should do, but also what the members of the two parties should do. The Communist Party has such a belief that no matter how serious the conflict is, we will not change what we have already recognized. To give a few key examples: (1) We believe that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today. We recognize and support them, and we strive to realize them in our own work areas, and we will never abandon our already recognized beliefs because of conflict. (2) We recognize Mr. Chiang's leadership position in the country, not only in the past eight years of the War of Resistance, but still so after the victory of the War of Resistance. This was mentioned in the Communist Party's 7/7 Memorial Declaration in the 31st year of the Republic, and this statement has been proven after more than four years. (3) We recognize that the Kuomintang is the largest party, and we have always respected the Kuomintang's position gained in historical struggles. (4) Although the National Government is ruled by the Kuomintang alone, and it is still a one-party government to this day, since we are cooperating, we have not failed to recognize the National Government since the end of the 25th year of the Republic, and we have never wanted to overthrow the National Government, but only to request the reorganization of the government. Just look at the democratic governments behind enemy lines since the War of Resistance, which are local in nature, and there has never been another central government to take leadership, which proves it. Even the People's Representative Conference of the Liberated Areas, which was prepared to be convened in the Liberated Areas last year, can also be a joint organization of the people of the Liberated Areas. We believe that these understandings are very important. With this recognition, it can prove that there is no hostility, and it is the basis for establishing a political solution. Therefore, we also ask the Kuomintang to give us the due recognition, such as the issue of the legal status of the Communist Party, the issue of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other liberated areas, and the issue of the armed forces led by the Communist Party that we have mentioned in the past, because recognition is one thing, and recognition does not mean that these troops cannot be reorganized or that these local governments cannot be re-elected. The second point is to discuss with each other and not to be dogmatic. Since it is a political solution, we want to agree with each other, rather than one side making a decision and notifying the other side to do it. This will not solve the problem. If this Political Consultative Conference can handle this point better, it will definitely be able to establish a model for consultation. Many past disputes often caused more estrangement and more obstacles because they could not be consulted with each other. Friends cannot handle a matter like this, let alone the relationship between the two parties and the affairs of the country and the people. We believe that in the Political Consultative Conference, we hope to solve the major affairs of the country and the people in an atmosphere of consultation.

Under the Major Premise; Mutual Concessions and Mutual Competition

The third point is to make concessions to each other and not to dominate. Since the political solution is ultimately beneficial to the cause of the country and the people, and since it is beneficial to the cause of the country and the people, then what cannot be conceded between the two parties and among all parties? It is true that the principles of establishing a country, such as the Three Principles of the People and the democratic state system that China needs today, cannot be conceded. Without this standard and direction, we cannot talk about cooperation. However, under this major premise, many specific issues should strive for mutual concessions, such as the military issue, the local autonomy issue, and the people's rights issue that have been disputed in the past, all of which should be resolved through mutual concessions under the direction and system of establishing a country, and should not demand domination. Some people say, you only ask the government to demand democratic rights, what about the areas led by your Communist Party? We sincerely answer: All the guarantees we have made to the government, we will not only implement them in the areas where we operate, but we are also willing to implement them first. If we do not implement them well enough, we are willing to accept criticism from all parties and seek better reforms. If you don't believe us, we are willing to welcome anyone to inspect and provide guidance, especially those who were displaced and living in other places due to the War of Resistance to return to their hometowns, because they are the owners of those places. The fourth point is to compete with each other and not to cancel each other out. We feel that since it is a political solution and seeks cooperation, then whether it is the two parties or all parties, there will always be some differences of opinion, and we should compete in work and strive locally, rather than saying that if you do well, I am not happy, or if this side does well, that side is not happy, because good things should be welcomed, no matter where they are done or which party they come from. Only in this way can the people's power and the national essence of China not be canceled out, but can be beneficial to national construction.

The above four points are painful experiences and lessons learned from the nine years of discussions between the two sides. Although they seem like general comments, we sincerely hope that everyone and the people of the country understand that this is a heartfelt statement. We sincerely hope that this aspect can be recognized at this Political Consultative Conference, which is the main part of my report. Incidentally, I will answer a few questions in the discussions.

Answering Questions from All Parties; Eight Points as a General Response

In the past, we could not publicize the content of the discussions every time, and we often received criticism from all parties and even blame from public opinion. However, both sides in the discussion wanted to handle things well, and only publish them when they were discussed well. The inability to publish them at any time was also the hard work of both sides at the time. However, we cannot fail to understand the blame from all parties and even public opinion because of the hard work. Therefore, today, based on this understanding, I will briefly answer the questions that the Communist Party has often been asked during the discussions after the War of Resistance. First, do the Communist Party representatives only manage local affairs and not talk about overall affairs in the discussions? According to my report below, it can be seen that in the War of Resistance, we first talked about the overall situation and then the local situation, and then from the local situation back to the overall situation. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we first agreed on the direction and then talked about the specifics. We would never dare to talk about local issues without a direction. This is impossible. This is not only the case on the Communist Party's side, but also on the government's side. Second, do we only talk about military affairs and not about politics? In the twelve items of the meeting minutes, it can be seen that the political issues include the most, and there are only three items in the military aspect. If it were not for the delay in the issue of local autonomy in the political part, the military issues might have been resolved long ago. Third, do we only talk about our own side in the discussions and not about matters related to the people? I can say that it is not because many items in the agreement are related to the interests of the people, but even the reorganization of the army is a major event related to reducing the burden on the people, and local autonomy is even more related to the democratic issue of tens of millions of people. Fourth, is it limited to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, or have other parties not received due attention? No, the convening of this Political Consultative Conference can prove this point. Fifth, does the Communist Party only ask the government and not ask itself? The report just now can prove that everything that is asked of the government must be implemented in its own region, and many have already been implemented. If you don't believe it, please feel free to inspect and provide guidance. Sixth, is the local autonomy we are talking about local separatism? In the past, in the environment of the War of Resistance, the scope or procedures of popular elections behind enemy lines were not thorough enough, but they were indeed elections, and we recognize that this election should be more thorough in peacetime. This is the right of the people and cannot be called separatism, because local autonomy should be separated from military reorganization as two separate things. Seventh, is the Communist Party giving up the idea of a coalition government? No. In the discussions after the victory of the War of Resistance, in order to achieve effective solutions to problems, there should be steps and procedures, so the parties hope to solve this problem in the peace and national construction program and even the National Assembly Charter. Eighth, which comes first, political democratization or military nationalization? We answer: If we focus on only one aspect, it will inevitably lead to opposition. For example, the Communist Party says that political democratization must come first before the military can be nationalized. Or the government says that the military must be nationalized first before politics can be democratized. This will not solve the problem. Our opinion is that they should move forward in parallel and converge on one path. We see that the ninth item of the meeting minutes has set an opening method for military nationalization, and at the same time, that item also says that the government believes that if various issues cannot be fully resolved, then the number of troops can be considered, which proves that the government's opinion is also the same. The above eight questions are often encountered by many parties. Today, I am not only giving this general answer to the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference, but also to all compatriots in the country.

How does the latest B-29 bomber take off?

The American B-29 bomber, also known as the "Super Fortress", was extremely active in the war against Japan and had a special mission to destroy Japan's military industry. The power it displayed was truly amazing.

National Demonstration: The latest B-29 aircraft undergoes a test flight at Eglin Air Force Base in southern Florida, USA. Before takeoff, the aircraft uses jet propulsion to help it take off from the airfield.

### Fifty Years of Struggle and Eight Years of Resistance: A New Situation Unfolds in the Northeast

— By Jiang Junzhang (First Part of a Special Article for This Newspaper)

Our Northeastern region, drawn into the vortex of international politics and becoming one of the world's major issues, began with the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. It has now been a full fifty years. During these fifty years, sometimes Japan monopolized it, sometimes Imperial Russia monopolized it, sometimes there was a balance of power between Japan and Russia, and sometimes we, the masters, were enslaved by Japan. Even the Soviet Union could not maintain its limited Chinese Eastern Railway. However, at the height of this tumultuous development, our China, regardless of the dangers ahead and the complex and difficult domestic and international environment, set the fundamental plan of resisting aggression and recovering lost territories. Finally, after eight years of bloody battle, we achieved the goal of recovery. Although future difficulties are not absent, with the sincere cooperation of the Soviet Union and the moral assistance of the United States, the takeover of the Northeast has been gradually realized. Following this path, we believe that the recovery of the Northeast, under the rule of our central government, is only a matter of time. Therefore, the author, with a joyful heart, is happy to report to our readers on the international relations of the Northeast, especially the recent period of international relations.

Uniting with Russia to Check Japan

Speaking of the international relations of the Northeast, we cannot but trace back to the weakness of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, which is the root of the problem. The continental policy of Japan and the eastward expansion policy of Imperial Russia are another major driving force that complicates the problem. We will not forget that in the Sino-Japanese War, Japan ceded our Liaodong Peninsula. Due to the intervention of Russia, Germany, and France, the Liaodong Peninsula returned to Chinese territory. However, this intervention led Li Hongzhang, a diplomat at the time, to believe that uniting with Russia to check Japan was a major turning point for the future of the Northeast. With this ideal, Li Hongzhang went to Moscow under the pretext of attending the coronation ceremony of the Russian Tsar. What he brought back were the charter for the joint Sino-Russian operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway and a secret treaty of political and military alliance. This Chinese Eastern Railway is the later Chinese Eastern Railway and South Manchurian Railway, which is today's Changchun Railway. The result of the Chinese Eastern Railway branch line reaching directly to Lushun and Dalian was that the Liaodong Peninsula was finally transferred to Imperial Russia in the form of a leased territory. This created the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. In this war, the Qing government, without ambition, abandoned its then-current policy of uniting with Russia and maintained neutrality within the局， allowing its beautiful land to become their battlefield. The useless Imperial Russia was also defeated by the Japanese army and fled in a panic. The balance of power between Japan and Russia was thus created, and China maintained its sovereignty over the Northeast under this balance of power, dragging on until the eve of the "September 18th" Incident.

Japanese Occupation

After the "September 18th" Incident, Japan monopolized the Northeast. At that time, although the operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway was still in the hands of the Soviet Union, Japan did not force the Soviet Union to hand over the railway. However, Japan had its own methods. It built a parallel railway to the west of the Chinese Eastern Railway, running from Hailar through Solun, Dalai, and Changchun, connecting the old Jidun and Tianbao railways, and reaching the edge of the Tumen River. From the edge of the Tumen River, it built a railway north to Jiamusi on the edge of the Songhua River, intercepting the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway at Mudanjiang. It also built a branch line from Lafa on the Jidun Railway to connect with China's old Hu-Hai Railway, intercepting the Chinese Eastern Railway at Harbin. It also extended China's old Tao-Qi Railway in two lines to Heihetun on the banks of the Heilongjiang River. From then on, the Chinese Eastern Railway was cut into four sections, closely surrounded, and its military and economic value was reduced to the minimum. At this point, the Soviet Union's possession of this railway only added many troubles and burdens. This was the actual reason why the Soviet Union had to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. This happened in March 1935. Therefore, the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the Northeast has also been ten years ago, only four and a half years after our country's regime was driven out.

Three Major Documents

From the September 18th Incident to the two years after the start of the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan on July 7th, China's position in the Northeast was limited to legal and nominal, and the assistance obtained internationally was only passive, at most sympathetic. It was not until the outbreak of war in Europe, Japan's southward advance became more urgent, and it officially concluded an alliance with Germany and Italy (1940), that British and American strategists began to recognize that the East Asian war situation was the key to the security of the Pacific and had an inseparable connection with the victory or defeat of the European war situation. Based on this understanding, China's diplomacy towards the Northeast gradually developed into a practically beneficial stage. This beneficial situation can be seen from three of the most important documents. The relevant documents are excerpted as follows:

Cairo Communiqué

The Cairo Communiqué is a declaration issued by President Chiang, President Roosevelt, and Prime Minister Churchill after their meeting in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, in December 1942. One of the paragraphs states: "The purpose of the three countries is to deprive Japan of all the islands in the Pacific that it has seized or occupied since the beginning of the First World War in 1914, and to return to the Republic of China the territories that Japan has stolen from China, such as the four northeastern provinces, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands."

Potsdam Declaration

Also, in July of this year, the leaders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union met in Potsdam, Germany. At the meeting, a declaration was issued in the name of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, outlining the terms of Japan's unconditional surrender. The declaration had a total of thirteen points, among which the eighth point stated: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented." This means that the four northeastern provinces must be returned to China, and this declaration has obviously been formally recognized by the Soviet Union leader. Therefore, China's recovery of the Northeast has received an additional layer of guarantee.

Editorial

### Another Piece of Sincere Advice to France

The case of the French ship "Béldine" arbitrarily transporting war criminals out of the country has gradually caused a serious situation recently. Yesterday, Shanghai students even held a parade petitioning, demanding that the government make serious representations. If a reasonable solution is not quickly sought, the situation may further deteriorate. Representatives of 51 countries are currently meeting in London to discuss the establishment of the United Nations organization, with the aim of maintaining lasting world peace. It is truly regrettable that such an incident as the "Béldine" could occur and not be resolved promptly. The gradual deterioration of this matter is mainly due to the statement made by the French government spokesman on this incident. According to a United Press Paris dispatch, the French government spokesman declared: "France will submit the issue of extraterritoriality in China to the London United Nations General Assembly for discussion. The French view is that before a new treaty is signed between China and France, France still retains extraterritoriality in China, and officially supports the position of the French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Ferriere." Prior to this, the French Consul General in Shanghai had also declared that he would treat it as a "local incident." Attempting to change such a major incident into a "local incident," which the Chinese people hate the most, is enough to anger the Chinese people. Furthermore, the French government spokesman wants to submit the "Béldine" incident, which infringes on Chinese sovereignty, to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. The Chinese people cannot but regard this as a major stain on Sino-French friendship. We must not only refute the impropriety of the French government spokesman but also hope that our National Government can take the necessary measures.

The French view is that France continues to retain consular jurisdiction in China before the new Sino-French treaty is formally signed and takes effect. This newspaper has published an article refuting this view. Because the old Sino-French treaty was naturally abolished with the collapse of France, and the French privileges in China, including consular jurisdiction, were also abolished with the abolition of the old treaty. Although the new treaty has not been formally established, it should theoretically be subject to Chinese law. How can it still attempt to retain the privileges of the old treaty? Moreover, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already sent a note to Mr. Peng Guyu, the French interim Chargé d'affaires in China, on May 19, 1943, solemnly stating that "all concessions, the Beijing legation area, the Shanghai Public Concession, and the Xiamen Public Concession, as well as administrative rights, consular jurisdiction, and other privileges obtained by France in accordance with the unequal treaties between China and France, have been extinguished due to France's illegal acts (at that time, the French side violated international law and presumptuously signed a treaty with the puppet organization to return the concessions), and the Chinese government is no longer bound by them." On December 3, 1945, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced: "It has been found that the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by various countries in China have all been abolished, and our courts should not recognize any country still exercising extraterritoriality in our territory." France has no objection to the above measures and has already recognized them. However, now there is the absurd behavior of the French Consul General in Shanghai and the absurd remarks of the French government spokesman. The Chinese people cannot but express their indignation at the French side's behavior and remarks.

The French side's desire to submit the "Béldine" incident to the United Nations for arbitration is sufficient to show that the French side has no sincerity in resolving this incident, but attempts to delay it, create a precedent, and continue to exercise its already abolished privileges. The sinister intention of this is self-evident. The United Nations organization has not yet been formally established, and the operation of this organization still awaits a later date. Even if its organization has reached the operational stage, an incident like the "Béldine" is not an international dispute, but a clear illegal and unfriendly act, which does not meet the conditions for submission to international arbitration. Moreover, China has no obligation to accept the submission of this case to international arbitration. The French government is not unaware of all these things. The reason why it made such remarks is to despise our government, despise our sovereignty, and deliberately delay the resolution of this case, hoping to gain a favorable position. Our government has protested against this case and demanded the replacement of the derelict French Consul General, the withdrawal of all French troops and Vietnamese police in Shanghai, and the abolition of the French consular court in Shanghai. According to a special telegram from Chongqing, the French diplomatic envoy in Chongqing also believes that the conditions are generous and should be accepted as soon as possible to settle this case. But seeing the attitude of the French government spokesman, it seems that the resolution of this case is still far away. Isn't this intentionally stimulating the emotions of the Chinese people? We certainly do not want to see the expansion of this incident, but the French side should also be responsible for not increasing the factors of expansion. To be fair, the French traitors deserve their punishment. We will not protect them, and the French government can also hope that they will be punished. As long as the French side reports to our authorities, the French traitors in China will certainly be punished in accordance with Chinese law, and the application for extradition is not absolutely unthinkable. However, the French government is acting arbitrarily, infringing on sovereignty, resulting in this unfortunate incident, and afterwards, it is supporting the illegal behavior of the French Consul in Shanghai. The French side should bear sole responsibility for the occurrence and expansion of this incident!

After the development of the "Béldine" incident to the current stage, we feel that the diplomatic authorities are too tolerant, and the protests and demands made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot calm the indignation of the people. Our government should attach importance to this matter as an attempt by imperialists to revive their old dreams, re-raise more serious protests, and demand that the French government respond immediately. If there is any delay, we should take decisive measures to recall the diplomatic envoys stationed in France and revoke the recognition of French diplomatic and consular personnel stationed in China. We would like to offer another piece of sincere advice to the French government here: China and France suffered from the aggression of the Axis powers in the Second World War, and the pain was great. How should we be able to empathize with each other, learn from the pain, and jointly seek the reconstruction of world peace. Why is France disregarding everything and creating such an unexpected incident as the "Béldine" and the subsequent deteriorating situation? France should immediately correct itself today, so that a major incident can be turned into a minor one. Otherwise, in order to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents, the Chinese government should not hesitate to take decisive measures to ensure the integrity of national sovereignty.

Since the liberation of Paris and the French government's return to Paris, the consistent style of French foreign policy has been reckless and nonsensical. The worsening of Anglo-French relations caused by the bloodshed in Syria is a precedent. Now it is recklessly confronting us again. The French foreign policy is not what we want to advise on. The French government has its own discretion. However, this kind of reckless policy cannot be applied to other places, and it will inevitably cause dissatisfaction and resentment from the Chinese people if it is applied to our country. China is no longer the China of fifty years ago! The Chinese people are no longer the people who have endured humiliation for a hundred years! We have always believed that the incident is a resurgence of the old habits of imperialism, which is absolutely incompatible with the growing new China. We want to subdue these imperialists' attempts! We would also like to especially remind everyone: If any foreigner is still muddle-headed and wants to follow the ugly style of imperialists and openly obstruct our sovereignty, we can punish them by the national law of the government, and the people must not disrupt social order!

### Large Speculative Funds Cause Waves: Many Twists and Turns in the Gold Market, Resulting in Continued Rise of 24,000; US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Are Stable

Yesterday, due to reports that the gold and US dollar markets in North China had suffered tragic declines, the market was suddenly suppressed by sellers, and there was a slight retracement. From the opening price of 846,000, it fell to a low price of 838,000. Later, the two major gangs of securities and paper industries divested their stocks and exchanged them for gold, with a lot of speculative funds. The market changed its target, and the gold market showed more demand than supply, gradually showing a good outlook. At noon, the long-supported shorts suddenly panicked, and there was a small short squeeze scene, rising to a high price of 888,000. The longs also came out one after another, and soon stabilized and turned flat. In the afternoon, it once retreated to within 870,000, and finally struggled around 875,000. As a result, it continued to rise by 24,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry in silver shops was listed at 93,000, and silver was still 700 yuan. Silver dollars hovered around 440, and the black market interest rate was slightly tighter, about 8% to 10%.

The US dollar was quite stable, slightly advancing and retreating with the gold market. From the morning opening of around 1,435 yuan, it retreated to around 1,430 yuan and hovered for a long time. At noon, the price of gold suddenly became popular, which triggered a wave of arbitrage, and then gradually rose to above 1,470 yuan. In the afternoon, it slightly fell back to around 1,450 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. The arbitrage price for gold has been pulled up to more than 600 yuan. Due to the arrival of goods, Hong Kong dollar prices loosened across new and old currencies. However, due to some people absorbing the currencies when the price was low, the situation was still peaceful even though there was no huge performance. As a result, the price of old currency fell by 10 yuan, and the price of new currency fell by 3 yuan.

### Bing Bonds Reach New High Price: Chinese Stocks Fall Back, Foreign Stocks Are Stable

The trend of public bonds continued to be popular yesterday, but large investors shifted their targets and sold bonds to exchange them for gold. Under the loosened chips, the price did not rise much, and miscellaneous brands fell back instead. Bing bonds opened at 1,320 yuan in the morning and rose all the way to a new high price of 1,465 yuan. Large investors closed their positions, and the stock market also experienced a pullback. At noon, it fell back more than 100 yuan, hovering around 1,350 yuan. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the price of Bing bonds continued to rise by 50 yuan, A and B bonds were flat, and E and D bonds fell back by 15 yuan and 60 yuan respectively.

The Chinese stock market situation gradually became flat and tired from chaos. Large investors, such as the securities and paper gangs, sold aggressively at high prices, causing Yongsha to fall back from a high price of 1,470 yuan, Meiya from 1,060 yuan, Xinhe from 420 yuan, Xinguang from 87 yuan, Qinxing from 77 yuan, and Jingfu from 83 yuan. However, some retail investors were confused by the large investors' underhanded tactics and absorbed the stocks at low prices. At noon, with the large investors' divesting of stocks in exchange for gold becoming obvious, the retail investors were trapped and painfully rushed to cut their losses. Yongsha then fell sharply to within 1,300 yuan, Meiya to 880 yuan, Xinhe to 280 yuan, Qinxing to 62 yuan, Jingfu to 64 yuan, and Xinguang to 67 yuan. At this time, the unpopular stocks did not see low prices because the time was late. However, the bidding price gradually increased in the afternoon. Compared with last Saturday, Yongsha fell back by 80 yuan, Meiya by 65 yuan, and Xinhe by 70 yuan. The price difference between the three small hot stocks was quite close. Therefore, Xinguang alone fell by 7 yuan, and Jingfu and Qinxing fell by only 3 yuan and 4 yuan. The unpopular stocks still saw a small increase.

Foreign stocks initially saw securities gangs joining in one after another, and retail speculative funds followed suit. After the market opened, a strange scene suddenly appeared. Yisha first jumped up by 10%, and the other stocks also followed suit. At this time, people in the industry and foreign businessmen slightly came out to adjust, and then they turned around. Later, the Chinese stocks suddenly suffered a tragic decline, and the floating long camp collapsed, anxiously falling back. At noon, compared with last Saturday, Yisha was flat, Wheelock Marden rose by 600 yuan with the help of the environment, but it was a one-sided selling price from the supply side, and Yibier and Paper each rose by 6 yuan. The rest rose and fell differently.

### Yarn Prices Were Weak Yesterday: Textile Construction Supplies and Sells Large Quantities of Yarn

Yesterday's yarn market turned flat and tired in the morning. 20s and 16s yarns were still stable, while 32s fine yarn and 42s thread saw their prices go down step by step due to the continuous supply and sale of state-owned yarn mills, falling by about 570,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. In the afternoon, Textile Construction Company publicly sold a large quantity of yarn again, and the prices were as follows: 10s 330,000, 16s 430,000, 20s 610,000, 32s 950,000, 32s double-strand 1,000,000, 40s 1,000,000, 42s 1,080,000, 60s 1,700,000, 80s 1,950,000. The above yarns are all products of Japanese factories that have been taken over, such as Nikko, Blue Phoenix, Fairy Peach, and Tachiba brands. The future of yarn prices may be suppressed because of this.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Are Flat: Glutinous Rice Is Scarce and the Price Is Good

The rice market is still bland and weak. Northern japonica and early thin rice both fell by a small amount of 2300 yuan. Indica rice is also showing a tired trend, but white yuan and dark yuan are scarce and expensive. Due to the year-end sales, they are very strong, with 2300 yuan. Soybeans are still tight. Soybean cakes rise and fall sharply. Today, due to the South Seas moving, they are rising by more than 100 yuan again. Oil prices are still firm and slightly tighter. The appetite for flour from the South Seas has weakened. High-end products have been cut in price, and the wine market has been quite active in winter store sales, rising by 500 yuan.

It is also reported that the total transaction volume of rice and grains in the market last week reached more than 20,000 shi, including 6,774 shi of white japonica rice, 11,096 shi of thin rice, 1,620 shi of yang indica rice, 880 shi of du indica rice, 590 shi of wu indica rice, 448 shi of white yuan, and 662 shi of dark yuan, totaling 22,070 shi.

### American Tobacco Leaves Arrive in Shanghai: American Cotton Will Also Be Shipped in Large Quantities

The Dada ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 1,106 pieces of cotton from Nantong. It is said that a large batch of American cotton will arrive in Shanghai in the coming days.

An American businessman stationed in Chongqing recently went to the Chongqing Municipal Goods Tax Bureau to inquire about the amount of import tax on cigarettes in detail. It is said that American cigarettes are extremely cheap. For example, CAMEL cigarettes only sell for a few US cents per pack in the United States. Even with the addition of freight and various taxes, the cost is low. They may soon be shipped to China for sale in large quantities.

### Silk Trade Is Active: Rayon Rises Endlessly

Last week, rayon rose by 200,000 yuan. The market opened very flat yesterday. No. 120 Tianqiao was 950,000 yuan. Later, due to the lively trade, there were more buyers than sellers, and the price showed a sudden advance, with the highest bid being 1,075,000 yuan and closing at 1,030,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to do 1,040,000 yuan, with a transaction, which was 70,000 yuan stronger than the end of last week. The distance between the stack bill and the spot goods at the end of last week was 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, the market was only 140,000 yuan short, because the authorities had already opened the stack bills held by legitimate merchants, and the goods could be shipped within days, so they competed to buy each other, and the price moved forward. The factory's retail trade was very active, and the price also progressed, about 110,000 to 120,000 yuan higher than the end of last week. The market price of silk goods and the cost calculated by the raw material price are very different. Someone searched for it, and the price advanced. The American sheet was 660,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and the Minsheng brocade was 9,800 yuan per piece.

### Statistics on Export Settlement Handled by the Bank of China

Before the exchange rate was determined, the government entrusted the Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of China to handle export settlement procedures. Up to the most recent date, the amount of settlement handled has reached a total of 2.7 million US dollars. The bank temporarily uses the ratio of 1,000 yuan of national currency to 1 US dollar and 250 yuan of national currency to 1 Hong Kong dollar. Therefore, those who buy black market foreign exchange in the market are wary of this provisional ratio and dare not buy in large quantities, taking a wait-and-see attitude.

### Yarn and Cloth Manufacturers Continue to Fight for the Return of Looted Goods

[Special dispatch from this newspaper] Yarn and cloth manufacturers in this city have submitted legal and commercial difficulties through the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and the Yarn Industry Association for the remaining amount of yarn and cloth that was forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets, requesting the return of the goods. The Materials Review Committee has no specific opinions on this issue, and the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau also has no appropriate disposal methods. Yesterday, representatives of the association, such as Pan Shihao, Dong Jiufeng, Zhou Jiasheng, and Wu Mingrong, met with the Director of the Review Committee, Peng Xuepei, and the Secretary-General of the Processing Bureau, Yang, and others, and personally presented the situation of the forced purchase at the beginning and the principle that the victims should be asked to return the goods in law. Peng and Yang both expressed that the government is seriously considering it, and said that they also deeply sympathize with the yarn and cloth manufacturers' severe oppression and heavy losses at that time. According to the representatives of the association, they will collect various materials, collect the process, and list the laws and regulations, and call on all walks of life again in the near future.

### Asphalt Spot Goods Are Very Scarce

Asphalt has suddenly become popular due to the increase in candle sales. This year is the year of victory, and the people are cheering and encouraging, and superstitious undertakings have also increased, so the candle business has been particularly lively recently. The goods prepared by each candle for the year's sales are not enough to meet the market, and they all want to purchase raw materials. Because the industry was caught off guard, they had to purchase from various production areas, so they were transported from Lanxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing and other places to Shanghai for sale. The current market price of Lan oil has dropped from 19,000 yuan to 18,000 yuan, and Heben is 23,000 yuan. Due to the temporary failure of transportation, the spot goods are very short, and only a small number can be dealt with.

### Anthracite Coal Continues to Rise, White Coal Screenings Remain Weak

Since the anthracite coal chunks have sold briskly, there has been a shortage of actual goods on the market, and prices have tended to rise. Anthracite coal dust has also been pulled up in price. White coal screenings, amid a cycle of peak and slow sales, continue to weaken. White coal small pieces and coal dust remain stable. Due to the rise in anthracite coal prices, firewood has shown a slight upward trend, while regular pine and mixed firewood remain normal.

Recently, there has been a constant flow of ships on the Suzhou River, bringing large quantities of jarred charcoal from Huzhou, reaching several hundred pieces daily. According to industry insiders, each dan (unit of weight) is priced at 5,500 yuan, plus commission, and transactions are very busy.

Correction: In yesterday's issue, the article "New Enterprises Established in Shanghai One After Another" contained an error. The "Kaiming Food Co., Ltd." should have been "Kaikai." We hereby make the correction.

### Municipal Bureau of Education Announces: Private School Tuition Fee Approval Process: Careful Study and Calculation Standards Divided into Four Aspects

[Special Dispatch from Daguang News Agency] The amount of tuition fees to be collected by various private primary and secondary schools in the city for the next semester has been approved and announced by the Municipal Council. To understand the process of approving these tuition fees, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Municipal Bureau of Education yesterday. It was stated that the Municipal Council had repeatedly and carefully studied the approved amounts, taking into consideration both the burden on parents and improving the livelihoods of teachers, striving to balance both sides. The calculation standards are roughly divided into the following four aspects:

(1) Tuition fee income will be entirely used for teacher and staff salaries. Office expenses and other costs will be the responsibility of the school board to raise. Tuition fees for reduced-fee and free students will be covered by loan and subsidy income. If these are insufficient, the school board will find a way to make up the difference.

(2) For primary schools, each class is calculated with 45 students, and teachers and staff are calculated with 1.5 people per class. If each student pays 6,000 yuan in tuition fees, then each teacher and staff member will receive a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan (each semester is calculated as six months).

(3) For junior high schools, each class is calculated with 40 students, and teachers and staff are calculated with 1.75 people per class. If each student pays 9,000 yuan in tuition fees, then each teacher and staff member will receive a monthly salary of 34,000 yuan.

(4) For senior high schools, each class is calculated with 40 students, and teachers and staff are calculated with 2 people per class. If each student pays 12,000 yuan in tuition fees, then each teacher and staff member will receive a monthly salary of 40,000 yuan.

### Private Primary and Secondary Schools in This City Discuss Tuition Fee Issues: Requesting the Municipal Government to Allocate Subsidies

[Report from This City] Principals of private primary and secondary schools in this city gathered again at the YMCA Hall in Baxianqiao at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss tuition fees, salaries, and loan issues for the next semester. More than 300 schools, including Cunde, Mingde, Daozhong, Kunfan, Minguo, and Aiguo, attended. Jiang Jizhou, Yu Chuanding, and Cui Jianwu were elected as the presidium. Chairman Jiang Jizhou first gave a report, followed by a collective discussion. The details are recorded below:

Chairman's Report

(1) After the last meeting decided on the tuition fee standards, the Municipal Council decided on another standard, which is very different from the standards we decided on. The highest salary for primary school teachers and staff is only 25,000 yuan, and the lowest is 18,000 yuan, which is not enough to maintain their livelihoods. (2) Originally, private schools did not want to increase tuition fees, but when the municipal economy is not sufficient, there is no other way. (3) The reasons why we want to increase tuition fees are: (1) Increasing tuition fees can make excellent teachers return to school, (2) The salaries of private schools should not be lower than those of municipal schools, (3) School finances should be absolutely transparent, (4) Equal educational opportunities, so that families in better circumstances can bear more of the burden, and private schools can set up more free places.

Matters for Discussion

(1) Support the principles for the next semester proposed at the last meeting (7th) (teachers should receive the same salaries as those in municipal schools). (2) Please allocate monthly subsidies to private schools from the Municipal Government, 25,000 yuan per grade for primary schools, 30,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 35,000 yuan for senior high schools. Otherwise, in order to maintain education in this city, please raise the tuition fee standards. (3) If the subsidy has not been approved and the tuition fee standards set by the Municipal Government have not been revised by the 25th of this month, each school will issue a declaration of its own tuition fee standards and publish a joint enrollment advertisement. (4) All students studying at all levels of schools and female students studying at private primary and secondary schools in this city will be exempt from tuition fees. (5) When teachers and staff in this city are on leave for marriage, bereavement of parents or spouse, or female teachers giving birth, they will still receive their original salaries, and the salaries of substitute teachers will be paid separately by the school. (6) Each school should strictly implement financial transparency. (7) Recommend Xu Jingqing and eight others to petition the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Education. The meeting ended at 4:30 PM, and a reception was held for the press at the original location. Jiang Jizhou, principal of Minguo Girls' High School, reported on behalf of the temporary presidium, stating that the fee principles stipulated by the Municipal Bureau of Education were significantly different from the budgets of the schools. They requested that the bureau allow them to adjust the fee regulations and allocate subsidies. They also requested that newspapers not use the term "school shop" again and that they report accurately. They also requested that the hardships and demands of the private schools in the city be represented on their behalf. Principals from various schools successively expressed their opinions, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### Over Two Hundred Business and Industry Groups in This City Issue Declaration on the Current Situation: Telegram to the Political Consultative Conference, Expressing Five Points, Hoping for Joint Advocacy from All Sectors of the Nation

In light of the opening of the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing, the Shanghai business community held a symposium yesterday to discuss the current situation. Representatives from over one hundred trade associations, including the silk, rice, pharmaceutical, cotton textile (representing the sixth district of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui), wool, new medicine, paper, and rubber industries, attended. All agreed that the success or failure of this Consultative Conference is crucial to the rise and fall of the nation. The business and industry community, as a part of the citizenry, bears the sacred task of economic construction and urgently hopes that the Consultative Conference will end the situation of strife and unrest and lay the foundation for a peaceful nation-building plan. Based on the principle of "sovereignty resides in the people," it was decided that the various trade associations would jointly issue an important declaration. Mr. Luo Qinghua was immediately appointed to draft the declaration, which was signed by the representatives present. It will then be distributed to over two hundred trade associations in the city for joint sealing and mailing to the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing. The full text of the declaration is excerpted below:

Solemn Declaration to the Chongqing Political Consultative Conference: As the first session of the United Nations General Assembly opens, the Political Consultative Conference convened by our National Government is also appropriately held in Chongqing at this time to seek an end to the domestic strife and unrest and to discuss a peaceful nation-building plan. Our Shanghai business and industry trade associations, in view of the fact that the outcome of this conference is truly a turning point in the rise and fall and survival of the nation, hereby, based on the principle of "sovereignty resides in the people" and "everyone is responsible for the fate of the nation," solemnly declare to all participants and compatriots throughout the country:

Restore Transportation, Reorganize Military (1) Restore Transportation and Reorganize Military: Ever since the Japanese warlords ignited the flames of aggression at the Beida Camp in Pan Yang on September 18th, first forcibly occupying our Northeastern territory, creating the puppet state of Manchukuo, and then gradually encroaching on North China, attempting to realize their ambition of annexing Manchuria and Mongolia, destroying China, and conquering the world, they ultimately launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, triggering a full-scale World War II. During the unprecedented national crisis of the past fifteen years in our country, we faced strong enemies from abroad and internal divisions. Although under the slogan of a united national sacred war of resistance, political and military orders were never thoroughly unified, the situation of preventing division and separation was never completely eliminated, and although there was a program for resisting Japan and building the country, it was never wholeheartedly accepted by local political machines. Using this to cope with a national war of resistance unprecedented in history and to decide the fate of national survival, although fortunately allied nations jointly cooperated and justice ultimately prevailed over power, every time one looks back on the past, one still feels a crisis is imminent and shivers with fear. Since the surrender of the defeated enemy, while the world is celebrating peace, our country has unexpectedly extensively launched a civil war of mutual slaughter. In the Yellow River basin, north and south of the Yangtze River, and even in Manchuria, Mongolia, Chahar, and Suiyuan, flames of war reach the sky, people are killed in the fields, transportation is destroyed, mines are destroyed, and the remaining people are displaced. The national crisis is about to be extinguished, despite the earnest exhortations of the Allied nations. The international standing that military and civilian compatriots have obtained through eight years of bloodshed and flesh and blood is already in danger of shaking. Our business and industry sectors have suffered the pain of internal and external troubles for many years and feel it most directly and deeply. Therefore, we are most deeply resentful and painful about the civil war. Fortunately, the Three-Man Group meeting has achieved success, and the order to cease conflict and restore transportation has also been announced. Therefore, we sincerely request that all troops immediately comply with the order to cease conflict, reorganize the military, and restore transportation so that righteous people can return to their hometowns and engage in agriculture, facilitate freight transport, stabilize prices, and enable the economy and finance to return to normal as soon as possible. The government should also resolutely carry out the surrender mission in all parts of the country and quickly send enemy prisoners and expatriates back to their countries so that social order in all parts of the country can be restored and stabilized as soon as possible.

Resolutely Oppose the Special Status of the Northeast

(2) Oppose the Special Status of the Northeast: The nine provinces of the Northeast are an integral part of the entire territory of the Republic of China, rich in resources and abundant in products, and are the lifeline for our country to embark on industrialization and economic construction. Its administrative system and political facilities have always been, and will always be, indistinguishable from those of the inland provinces, and it must not be separated from the central government in the slightest. Recently, there has been talk advocating the "specialization" of the Northeast. If those people are not insane, they must have ulterior motives. It must be known that we can all recall the absurd theory of "Manchuria-Mongolia specialization" advocated by the enemy on the eve of September 18th. We are even more pained and resentful of the "North China specialization" and "autonomy of the five northern provinces" in the mouths of the enemy and traitors before and after the Tanggu Agreement. The painful lessons of history have given the people of the whole country a clear and correct understanding. Today, no conspirator should妄想妄想 inherit the old tricks. The Northeast is the Northeast of China, not the private property of any family or faction. The outdated tricks of feudal warlords playing with idols can no longer deceive the Northeast compatriots who have learned from their pain. All those who seek to dismember the national territory and sovereignty, attempt to establish separatist regimes, and cleverly promote heretical ideas aimed at brewing a second Manchukuo are resolutely opposed by us and will ultimately be condemned by the national public opinion, leading to their own destruction.

Hope for Wise Correction of Disguised State-Owned Enterprises

(3) Protecting Chairman Chiang's Economic Policy: The Shanghai business community wholeheartedly supports Chairman Chiang's new economic policy and the advocated Supreme Economic Council. If our country wants to embark on the path of democracy, prosperity, and strength, it must devote itself to economic construction, improve production technology, and improve the people's living standards. Shortly after the end of World War II, President Truman announced eight economic policies in Congress, emphasizing the maintenance of industry and commerce and the prevention of unemployment and inflation. The stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade. If our country, a country with backward production, wants to improve the lives of workers and farmers, it must first protect industrial and commercial enterprises and encourage production and export. The distorted theory of class jealousy formed by the changes in social life during the war, "No merchant is not奸," and the贱merchant doctrine must first be swept away. Our country won victory through the national war of resistance. In the future, we must mobilize the strength of the entire nation to engage in construction. Industrial and commercial entrepreneurs should even more follow Chairman Chiang's teachings, rise up together, act independently, and bear the sacred task of economic nation-building. As for the steps for economic recovery, we must first seek the recovery of industry and commerce. During the war, Shanghai's industry and commerce were the first to be devastated, and then they moved inland, supporting the war of resistance. The equipment was old and the materials were dwindling. Those who remained in Shanghai were repeatedly looted by the enemy and puppets, exhausting their ability to knock bones and suck marrow. People's strength has been exhausted, regardless of inside or outside. The business community is riddled with wounds and urgently needs to recuperate. The government should reduce and exempt taxes in accordance with the principle of cultivating tax sources and reduce its burden. We cannot agree with the fiscal policy of establishing a financial policy on the sale of factory equipment to balance the deficit. It is found that most of the factory materials of the enemy and puppet industries received by the government were taken from our country's industrial and commercial operators by the enemy. Regardless of what method was used on that day, each thing has an owner. After receiving them, the government should find out the original owner, return them all, and order them to resume work within a limited time. Those who have been newly built or added by the enemy and puppets should also be used to give priority to compensate industrial and commercial entrepreneurs who have lost factory property due to the war of resistance in front and behind the front lines in order to restore production as soon as possible. If this is not done, no matter what the excuse, whether it is to sell for profit or to become a disguised state-owned enterprise to compete with the people for profit, we believe that it is not Chairman Chiang's original intention to reward and assist industry and commerce, and it is impossible to calm people's hearts and win the trust of the public. We sincerely hope that the government will promptly make wise corrections.

Rewards and Punishments Must Be Clear, and People's Hearts Will Naturally Be Calm

(4) Stabilizing People's Hearts, Rewards and Punishments Must Be Clear: Stabilizing people's hearts is the urgent task of the present, which is generally recognized by both the government and the public. In order to achieve this goal, the first thing is to strictly distinguish between the loyal and the traitors, the obedient and the rebellious. History says, "When Emperor Gao of the Han Dynasty entered Guanzhong, he made three laws with the people to start anew, and the people of Qin were at peace." The war has ended for five months now, and the economic recovery of the recovered areas has not been restored to normal as expected in order to increase production. The reason is that half of the receiving personnel have failed to complete their tasks quickly, and the other half is due to the uneasy hearts of the people in the recovered areas, who are suspicious and watching. It is found that the Regulations on Punishing Traitors have been promulgated, and if there is any behavior in the business community that betrays the motherland, relies on the power of the enemy and puppets, and endangers others, those who have been found guilty and have solid evidence should be publicly tried and sentenced according to law in order to 重法法 discipline. If the suspicion is insufficient, the government should not implicate innocent people according to law, and the government should widely inform the public and set a deadline for reporting in order to appease those who are hesitant. Furthermore, the way of governing is to value clear rewards and punishments. Those who are guilty should be punished, and those who have made contributions should also be rewarded. During the war, there were many in the business community who destroyed their families to relieve the country's difficulties, some who assisted the war of resistance without fear of hardship and danger, and some who endured humiliation, shielded their colleagues, and covered up underground work. It seems that they should all be commended separately to encourage them. If rewards and punishments are clear, people's hearts will naturally be calm.

Advocating Democracy Requires the Rule of Law

(5) Implementation of the National Assembly and Constitutional Government: We hope that the Political Consultative Conference will smoothly achieve its task, end the situation of years of strife, and lay the foundation for peaceful nation-building. We hope that the conference will conclude satisfactorily as soon as possible, hold the National Assembly on May 5 as scheduled, implement constitutional government, and return power to the people. We advocate democracy, and we need the rule of law even more. Only through the National Assembly to return power to the people can we comply with the rules of democracy. The Political Consultative Conference is a bridge to the National Assembly, not an agency for allocating rights. We do not want the prediction of the New York Star Daily to be realized, "This situation may even be delayed for several years." We do not want to imagine "ending one-party tutelage" and replacing it with "multi-party dictatorship." Only by convening the National Assembly on schedule, implementing the Constitution, and legally producing a democratic government can we fulfill the unanimous desire of the whole country. Only farmers, businessmen, scholars, and soldiers across the country are the true masters of the country. We hope that the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference will accept our above contributions, and we hope that business groups and compatriots across the country will not give up their rights and duties as masters, unite, and jointly advocate. This is our declaration.

Chinese and American officials in this city went to the airport to welcome him. The enthusiastic atmosphere was no less than what was seen when General Marshall arrived in Shanghai. The Chinese officials who went to welcome him included Chief of Staff He Yingqin's representative, Director Bao Jing'an, Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Commander Li Jilan, Commander Zheng Dongguo, and Representative Feng Youzhen of the Central Propaganda Department. The American officials included General Wedemeyer, General Stratemeyer, Commander-in-Chief Kirk, Chief of Staff Carter, and General Brink.

Eight Hundred American Soldiers Petitioned on the Spot: Secretary Patterson's special plane was originally scheduled to arrive at 10 am yesterday, so reporters and welcomers from various newspapers went to the airport to wait in the morning. It was not until noon that they received a telegram stating that the special plane would arrive in Shanghai after 2 pm. Those who waited at the airport for more than four hours included a petition group of more than eight hundred American soldiers. They intended to request an audience immediately after Secretary Patterson's arrival in order to present a request for early repatriation. At 2:50 pm, Secretary Patterson's special plane landed, with sixteen American planes lined up in the air to welcome it.

Inspected Our Honor Guard on the Spot: After getting off the plane, General Wedemeyer and others stepped forward to shake hands. Secretary Patterson was wearing civilian clothes, a gray呢 hat, and a black coat. After shaking hands with the welcomers, he inspected the honor guard sent by the New Sixth Army to welcome him to the airport to the sound of the band playing. After the inspection, he entered the city with General Wedemeyer in the same car.

Mayor Held Cocktail Reception: Mayor Qian Dajun held a cocktail reception at his private residence at 6 pm yesterday to entertain Secretary Patterson.

Secretary Patterson said to the representatives: I will give serious consideration to the requests of the soldiers during my stay in Shanghai. Secretary Patterson also promised to talk to the soldiers publicly today. It is heard that Secretary Patterson will stay in Shanghai for one or two days before flying to Manila.

### Oppose the French Infringement of Our Sovereignty: Students Throughout the City Demonstrate and March, Demanding that the French Consulate Hand Over Cacopino

After the "Beldin" incident, the French side has not given a satisfactory reply to our country's protest. In order to safeguard the integrity of national sovereignty, more than 30,000 students in this city gathered at the Bund in front of the former French Embassy at 2 pm yesterday, demanding the recall of the French Consul General Fee Lihuo, the handover of the arrested French traitor, and a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. They then conducted a large demonstration.

Police Deployed: At that time, the Huangpu Branch dispatched a large team of police officers to set up machine guns in front of the French Embassy to protect it. The students surrounded the embassy, shouting slogans such as "Down with French Imperialism," "Hand over the French traitor immediately," and "Expel Fee Lihuo," and sang the national anthem. However, the French Consulate General had moved to Terrasse Road, and the embassy is now in Chongqing, so the French Embassy and Consulate General on the Bund were both empty.

Full Petition: At 2:40 pm, the large team went to the Municipal Government to petition Mayor Qian. The entire procession arrived at 3:30 pm, and five student representatives were granted an audience with Mayor Qian. Since Mayor Qian was out on official business, Secretary General Shen met with them on his behalf. The student representatives made five demands: (1) Negotiate with the French government to hand over the French traitor arrested in Shanghai, (2) Recall the French Consul General stationed in Shanghai, (3) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future and apologize to our country, (4) Take back the French Tram Company, and (5) Take back the Sino-French School. Secretary General Shen said that items 1, 2, and 3 were national issues. Before and after the "Beldin" incident, our side filed representations with the French authorities stationed in Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now lodged a serious protest with the French Ambassador and is conducting negotiations in Chongqing. Items 4 and 5 require further study of the plan before making recommendations to the central government.

Mayor's Address: At this time, Mayor Qian also heard the news and arrived. He immediately addressed all the students on the balcony, saying: "I feel very good about your actions to safeguard national sovereignty this time, but you should study hard with peace of mind, and everything should be in order and not go beyond the rules. The government will definitely do what everyone wants and make serious representations to France." All the students then shouted slogans.

Demonstration March: At exactly 4 pm, all the students believed that Mayor Qian's reply was satisfactory and began a large demonstration march. The procession turned from Henan Road to Nanjing Road, shouting slogans along the way and distributing the "Declaration of the Shanghai Students' Movement to Uphold China's Sovereignty Against the French Consul General's Disregard for International Law." The procession lasted for thirty minutes, and the order was good. After passing Nanjing Road along Jing'an Temple Road, they arrived at Jing'an Temple at about 5 pm.

The Rice Industry, Silk Industry, and more than sixty other trade associations in this city jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Chongqing yesterday regarding the French warship Beldin's private transportation of the French traitor Cacopino out of Shanghai, infringing on our sovereignty. They requested that sovereignty be safeguarded. The telegram stated: "To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Chongqing: French Consul General Fee Lihuo, disregarding our country's protest, privately used the French warship Beldin to transport the French war criminal Cacopino out of Shanghai, showing contempt for our country and infringing on our sovereignty. This is the worst of all. The Consul General, without knowing remorse, still strongly claimed that the case was a local incident, claiming that he had not received a notice from the French Ambassador to China regarding the closure of the consular court, and that before the Sino-French New Treaty was signed and took effect, the French Consul General still had consular jurisdiction. His strong arguments are the tricks of imperialism. After our country recovered extraterritoriality, we repeatedly issued orders and made a statement to the French Provisional Chargé d'Affaires in China, Peng Geguo. How could the Consul General not know this? This move is obviously an attempt to use the traditional concepts and misconceptions of the people of Shanghai towards foreigners for decades in order to create an accomplished fact and shirk responsibility. He is obstinate and unrepentant, which is extremely hateful. This case is the first major event that occurred after our country recovered extraterritoriality. The Consul General and the captain colluded with each other, resulting in this action of infringing on our sovereignty, and they should both bear criminal responsibility. If effective measures are not taken, such as countries using this case as a precedent, then various regulations on abolishing consular jurisdiction will become mere words. We dare to jointly telegraph you, Minister, requesting you to immediately lodge a serious protest, be sure to replace the Consul, formally apologize to us, and guarantee that the same situation will not occur again. Before the case is resolved, legally suspend all activities of the Consulate General and prohibit French merchant ships and warships from entering our country's ports in order to safeguard sovereignty. Our association will, if necessary, use national diplomacy to sever all economic relations with French officials and civilians in China as a retaliatory measure to urge them to reflect. The telegram is impatiently awaiting your orders. Sincerely, the Rice Industry, Silk Industry, and more than sixty other trade associations in Shanghai. Han."

### Household Registration Survey Limited to Ten Days

### Chamber of Commerce Has Concrete Opinions on Capital and Profit Tax

[Our Report] The issues of book capital and profit tax have long been of concern to the industrial and commercial sectors of this city. The Industrial and Commercial Laws Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly studied these issues and now has concrete resolutions and suggestions to the government, which are excerpted below:

(1) On the issue of converting book capital, we support the three measures previously proposed by the Certified Public Accountants Association and request that the government give preferential treatment to old shareholders who were unable to participate in capital increases due to force majeure.

(2) On the issue of profit tax, we request that the government exempt profit tax and amend the Income Tax Law to reduce the burden on the industrial and commercial sectors. For the portion of 1945, due to the various difficulties faced by industry and commerce in the occupied areas, it is impossible to levy taxes according to the tax law. We request that the government formulate simplified and lenient measures for handling the matter.

(3) Regarding the issues of business tax and stamp tax, the association has also held discussions and appointed Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, Xu Zuoliang, Wang Jianping, Pan Shihao, Xu Xiaochu, and others to form a small group meeting to conduct special research before submitting them to the full committee meeting.

### Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court Tries Ling Guangyan and Others Yesterday; Accused Traitors Await Rescheduled Trials

[Our Report] Yesterday, the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court continuously tried five cases of traitors, starting from 9:00 AM. The details of each case are as follows:

First, Judge Zhu Zonghai ascended the bench to try the traitor Ling Guangyan, a 38-year-old from Wujiang. He graduated from Chizhi University in his early years and studied in France. Before the war, he went to Japan in a private capacity to study commercial law and married a Japanese wife. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he joined the puppet organization and successively held various puppet military and political positions for up to six years. After the victory, he was captured by our military police at the Ducheng Hotel in this city. The case has been tried repeatedly, and the court yesterday presented newly received evidence stating that Ling had established a Dafafa Company gambling house and a comfort station in Suzhou, forcing our female compatriots to be ravaged by the enemy. Furthermore, on the seventh day of the first lunar month of 1943, he led the enemy to sweep through Wujiang County, resulting in the deaths of many villagers. In addition, he seized the land of the master of Suzhou's Lutai Feng Company and privately owned more than 2,000 mu of land in Wujiang and hundreds of mu in Suzhou. Ling denied all of the above crimes, but claimed that he only owned a little over a hundred mu of land in Wujiang. Because the four defendants cited by the accused had not appeared in court, and the evidence received still needs to be investigated, the hearing was postponed.

Further Investigation Required, Court Ordered Remand: The cases of Xue Youwen and Hu Cheng森 were also tried. Xue was 41 years old, from Nanjing, and was formerly the Director of the Fourth Section of the Puppet Police Branch Bureau on Putuo Road. He was accused of arresting youth league members Li Chengxuan and others, and was involved in various political murders during his tenure. However, he claimed that the Fourth Section was in charge of Baojia (household registration) and factories, and was not involved in espionage work. He further stated that he had not been consulted about the arrests and had even tried to release the thirteen people afterward, listing the fact that he had released our arrested underground workers. The court ordered further investigation before retrial. Hu Cheng森, a former detective at the Putuo Road Puppet Police Branch Bureau, was then questioned. He had arrested communist youth Qiu Miaoqi, which Hu admitted to in court. Because both defendants were suffering from serious illnesses, they were not questioned further and were immediately taken away. The defendants' defense lawyer applied for bail for medical treatment, but it was denied. The court ordered treatment in the prison hospital. Next, witness Li Chengxuan described in detail the circumstances of his arrest. Because it involved political secrets, the audience was not allowed to listen.

At 2:45 PM, the sentence for Xu Xing, a member of the puppet inspection office who oppressed villagers, was scheduled to be announced. However, Judge Liu postponed the sentencing because the facts still needed to be investigated.

Defendant Denies Recruiting Workers for the Enemy: Judge Cao Jun ascended the bench to hear the case of Gu Youtang, who served as a translator and recruited workers for the enemy to work in Singapore. Gu testified in court that he only served as an interpreter and had nothing to do with recruiting workers. The recruitment was handled by the Japanese technician Shimazaki Seizo and the foreman Chen Shuiyao of the factory. The court ordered that the Japanese person be summoned to testify, and the hearing was postponed.

Judge Liu Yugui heard the cases of Jiang Yougen and Zuo Ming, who were also accused of recruiting workers for the enemy to work in the Philippines. Jiang was the Chairman of the Lubandian Red Gang Carpenters' Union, and Zuo was a translator for the Yamahisa Company. In 1943, the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office commissioned the Yamahisa Company to recruit 180 shipbuilding carpenters from Lubandian to go to the Philippines. Jiang claimed that the recruitment was conducted by the Japanese, and that he was even beaten by Japanese military police for tearing down the recruitment notices posted in Lubandian, so he was actually wronged. Zuo Ming claimed that he had not been consulted about the recruitment and was therefore not involved. Next, the manager of the Yamahisa Company, Kuroda, and the accountant Tono appeared in court to explain everything. Later, four representatives of the Tono Carpenters' Union defended Jiang and guaranteed his past behavior. The court stated that the facts would be investigated before a retrial, and the defendants were remanded in custody.

Court Will Continue to Open Today: The High Court has scheduled to try the traitor Lin Meicun and Wu Yimin at 9:00 AM today, and the traitor Gan Deyun at 10:00 AM. At 9:00 AM tomorrow, the traitor Shi Xikun will be tried, and at 9:30 AM, the traitor Han Shaolin will be interrogated.

Children

### A Plea for the Children

— Shi Xi

After eight years of bitter suffering during the War of Resistance, most of our children are suffering from acute malnutrition and debilitating anemia, both spiritually and physically. Apart from a few "privileged" children who are "well-fed and chubby," the majority of children are disheveled and unkempt, malnourished "future masters of China."

Unfortunately, they are born into such a world: without adequate nutrition from birth, without perfect families, without progressive and rational societies, without money, without help, without space to survive, without human warmth... All they have are difficult and painful experiences, and the taste of hardship and exploitation! They live an inhuman life.

For the sake of our "second generation," in this day of regained light, we should make a plea for the happiness of the children:

First, our children need nutritious food;

"Food is the first necessity of the people," and children are no exception: milk powder, oatmeal, cod liver oil, eggs, fish, meat, beef, fruits, vegetables, and various foods containing calcium, iron, phosphorus, protein, and vitamins are all urgently needed nutrients. Only with adequate nourishment can children have healthy bodies and lively spirits.

Second, they need warm clothing;

The climate varies with the seasons, and children need clothing suitable for all seasons. While luxury is not required, it must be warm, easy to wear, and hygienic.

Third, they need comfortable housing:

Unclean air, crowded populations, and dirty alleys are all sources of disease. Our housing is too unhygienic. We need improved and rational housing. The design of "children's new villages" should be the most ideal home for children.

Fourth, they need kindergartens, garden-style children's schools, children's libraries, children's canteens, infant care centers, nurseries, welfare homes, children's health check-up centers, children's hospitals, dental hospitals, sanatoriums, children's music academies, children's theaters... All equipped with the latest scientific equipment, as well as child health care facilities, and other agencies to seek the happiness of children. The implementation of all these is what children urgently need today after the war.

Perhaps you say that our hopes are too extravagant, but human effort is essential. If we do not consider the future of the country and the nation, then so be it. Otherwise, we should lay a solid foundation for our "second generation" of descendants and cultivate them well, so that they are better than our generation.

I hear that the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and British children's relief organizations will soon send personnel to China to investigate the needs of children in our country in terms of relief and provide spiritual and material assistance. Although there are many organizations in various provinces and cities in our country that carry out children's welfare work and carry out various relief efforts, we ourselves feel that our economic capacity is limited and we cannot do more ideal undertakings. In this day of victory, since international people are sympathetic and willing to provide assistance to our children's relief undertakings, it is precisely the time for us to cry out loudly. I would like to present the above points as a "brick to attract jade" for appeal.

Random Thoughts

### Not Buying It

— Yi Shui

"Not buying it" is a Shanghai colloquialism, implying contempt for the other party. If A doesn't buy B's line, it is because A doesn't take B seriously, or simply looks down on him. The reason for looking down on someone is always that A has power, has a backer, while B does not. Therefore, A can be smug and show an attitude of looking down on everything and not caring about anything.

At this time, the smart B will assess his own strength and, realizing that he can't win, will have to endure it. The hot-tempered one may clash head-on. The worldly one may smile it off. The proud one may break off relations from then on. The shameless one may fawn on the powerful. The calculating one will always find a way to retaliate.

The relationship between people is like this, and the relationship between countries is similar. It is only natural for a large country not to buy the line of a small country. It is only natural for a strong country not to buy the line of a weak country. This is a trend caused by strength. The small and weak one, even if they bow their heads temporarily, can only bow their heads for a while. Like the independence movement in Java, they will still have to bow their heads sooner or later, I think.

However, if an insignificant little thing, a second- or third-rate country, relies on its backer or has some sense of superiority, and reveals an attitude and fact of not buying the line of a great power after its victory, the great power, for the sake of national face, may not let it go easily, right?

Our nation, famous for its love of peace, just happens to encounter some outrageous friends. Could it be that the concept of semi-colonies has not been forgotten by these little things? Like the massacre of overseas Chinese in Thailand, we have not heard the next installment. This time, French warships blatantly took away prisoners from Chinese territory without a word. These friends who have someone backing them, or have a sense of superiority, still have not taken victorious China seriously!

Fortunately, we have always advocated peace with foreign countries, so what does this count for? Haven't we already protested! Really, what does this count for? Not buying it, fine, not buying it is fine. Ah Q said, "Haven't we already won?"

Science

### Changing Helium

— Ru Shui

Helium first came to the fore during World War I, when it was only used to fill blimps. At first, blimps all used hydrogen, but hydrogen is flammable, while helium is not. After continuous research, it has gained a place in today's industry and medicine. Now, let's introduce the uses of helium.

Seamen in ocean-going rescue boats often need to dive into deep water to do rescue work. In the past, they could only dive to a depth of 300 feet and stay for a few minutes, and often risked suffocation. Now, they can go to places 600 feet deep in the sea and stay for five or six hours. This is entirely due to the help of helium. Because in deep sea, the blood is subjected to external pressure, which often causes cramps and dizziness. If helium is added to the air breathed by rescuers, bubbles will not form, leading to suffocation. It is also not as easily soluble as nitrogen, so its diffusion power in the blood is extremely high.

Today, the best hospitals in Europe and the United States all have helium equipment. It can treat severe asthma, pneumonia, and other breathing problems. A mixture of helium and oxygen is blown into the blocked part, and helium carries the oxygen to the diseased area to facilitate breathing. In addition, helium can also be used to help newborn babies whose lungs cannot expand.

Anesthetics used during surgery often cause patients to die. It is said that this is because the anesthetic "explodes" in the lungs. If helium is mixed into the anesthetic, this danger will disappear.

Magnesium is the most ideal light metal for manufacturing aircraft. However, ordinary welding methods often do not produce satisfactory results. When the flame from the blowtorch comes into contact with magnesium, it burns out. Therefore, a helium tube is installed next to the blowtorch nozzle. When in use, the helium gas forms a layer of non-flammable gas curtain, which isolates the magnesium from the air, so the magnesium does not burn.

For long-range air navigation, the smaller the total weight of the aircraft, the better. Using helium to inflate tires is much lighter than using air.

### What it Takes to be a Scientist

— Sun Jia

"Mysterious genius is nothing more than 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration." The 84-year-old Edison said only one sentence to a group of reporters who were praising his great genius.

"The word 'discouragement' does not exist in a scientist's dictionary."

"A scientific mind does not readily admit the word 'impossible'," Fulton said when he was planning his steamboat 'Clermont' and others called it 'Fulton's folly'.

"Scientific exploration and research, in itself, contains the utmost beauty, and the joy it gives is the best reward; therefore, I found happiness in my work, and originally had no other hopes..." When Madame Curie visited the United States for the second time in 1929, President Hoover and others held a grand welcome at St. Lawrence University, conferred honorary degrees, and on behalf of the entire U.S. government, presented her with a check for $50,000, saying that the American people thanked her for her contribution to mankind. Madame Curie immediately announced that she would use the $50,000 to purchase one gram of radium element to donate to the laboratory.

"The mysterious is the most beautiful thing in the world. It is the source of all true art and true science. Anyone who cannot feel the mysterious emotion, anyone who cannot stop in astonishment, and stand reverently in awe, is like a dead person; his eyes are closed," Einstein said very plainly about his reason for researching science after publishing the theory of relativity.

### Life in a Dream

— Mei Youyun

People always tend to be dissatisfied with reality and long for the past. Although that "past" is clearly composed of segments of their own past "reality," they insist on saying "the past is like a dream." When they recall certain pleasant stages, they become even more immersed in the past, saying that the past is "dreamlike and lovely." But did they ever carefully experience that dreamlike and lovely past reality?

If one could truly view one's entire life as a dream, then isn't the unsatisfactory reality before our eyes just a fragment of that dream? Why can't we regard reality as the past, and objectively interpret everything from a standpoint detached from reality? Whether it's joy, pain, or sorrow, why must we necessarily curse it? And why accept it with a "dissatisfied" heart now, only to recall it with a "dreamlike" intoxication in the future?

Of course, reality is mostly unsatisfactory. Buddhists also say that this world is a Saha world, and that people born into this world must endure everything. Since everything in the present will become the past in the future, what pain or sorrow cannot be endured?

"In the dream, there are clearly the six realms of existence; after awakening, there is nothing in the vast world." Don't these two lines from the Song of Enlightenment also speak volumes? Although we cannot yet verify whether there is truly a soul in the "after awakening" state, if we can use what it says about the "dream" to compare it to our lives, wouldn't it alleviate many unnecessary troubles?

I am not saying that we should truly regard life as a dream, but rather that I want people not to torment their hearts too much with the dissatisfaction of reality. As long as one's mind and spirit have a point of focus to which they are devoted, and one moves toward that point, no matter what kind of environment one is in, if one can truly have a clear conscience, then all pain and hardship can be endured. If your spiritual devotion is beneficial to humanity, and contributes to "making this world a better place," then all suffering can be transformed into happiness, and allow you to love your reality.

War

### Atomic Man

— Yu Songyao

When the atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima, six Japanese soldiers were sitting on a long bench, their backs against a brick wall. Their backs were facing the epicenter of the explosion, about one kilometer away, and the eaves and a small hill shielded part of their bodies.

Therefore, they did not die from the shock wave of the atomic bomb like other victims, or be burned by the flash, nor were they directly killed by Y-rays. The next day, all six were admitted to the hospital. Five of them died within 48 hours of admission – the cause of death was said to be probably due to the radioactive particles scattered in the body during the explosion. Only one person is still alive.

In the past few weeks, scientists have been carefully studying everything about this living "atomic man," such as his diet, living habits, and ancestral background – in order to find a way to survive the next great war.

### Truman's Leisure Activities

— Zhong Zhongzuo

President Truman likes to relax his tense nerves with music in his spare time. Although he is humble, saying he is "banging on the keys," he actually plays the piano very well. When his 22-year-old daughter, Mary Margaret, sings, he enjoys accompanying her on the piano the most.

President Truman also loves reading. When he was young, he often frequented the public library in his hometown. For a period of time, he read congressional records every night before going to bed. Now? He naturally spends most of his time reading official reports.

### The Unfortunate Fate of the Atom Smasher

— A Yu

On November 23rd last year, U.S. Army engineers in Japan used hammers, iron melting tools, and crowbars to dismantle Japan's largest atom smasher in seven hours. The parts were loaded onto cargo ships and dumped into the sea at a depth of 4,000 feet. At the same time, in the vicinity of Tokyo, four other smaller smashers were also destroyed.

If Eisenhower's order had arrived sooner, those massive instruments would not have met this unfortunate fate. Eisenhower's order was to transport that 200-ton machine to the United States, as it was originally purchased from the United States in 1938.

But the order arrived too late. American atomic scientists are blaming General McVorsey for "being foolish and reckless, committing a crime against humanity." They said that Japan's atom smasher was for research purposes, not for making atomic bombs. McVorsey calmly argued that it was not his idea, and he was acting on the orders of his "superior." No one questioned who the "superior" was.

### Weak Woman Appeals Against Encroachment by Unscrupulous Merchant and Requests a Righteous Lawyer to Handle the Case Pro Bono

To the Editor: Yuan Xizhen purchased 200 shares of the China Raw Hide Company in October of the 32nd year of the Republic through the Hengsheng Company established by Tao Heng, totaling 200,000 storage currency. At the time, Tao Jun, due to insufficient funds, persuaded Xizhen to purchase half the amount, totaling 100,000 storage currency. A share contract was established by the Hengsheng Company established by Tao Jun. At the same time, Tao Jun added his private seal to the contract as proof. However, to this day, over two years have passed, and Tao Jun has never informed Xizhen about the company's contents. Xizhen has never been given the benefits she is entitled to, and despite repeated inquiries, Tao Jun has always delayed. Unexpectedly, Tao Jun had been planning for a long time and suddenly, after the victory, changed the name of Hengsheng Company to Tonghai Hide Company. Tao Jun still manages the business, but he neither added the seal of Tonghai Hide Company to the previous contract nor hired a lawyer to publish an advertisement saying, "The China Raw Hide Company has suspended business due to the current situation. Whether it will continue to operate is up to the company to decide," etc. Upon hearing this, Xizhen was extremely perplexed, as Xizhen is a woman who is unfamiliar with business investment and does not understand legal issues. She trusted Tao Jun only because he promised her benefits and repeatedly persuaded her, so she did not hesitate to sell her family property and entrust it to him. Moreover, after the previous investment, Xizhen's family property has been severely depleted, resulting in a difficult life for her family. However, Tao Jun, with his wealth and power, bullies a woman and disregards the contract he established. Xizhen originally intended to sue in court, but she is unable to afford the legal fees required to hire a lawyer. She wonders if there are any righteous lawyers in this city who would handle the case pro bono and file a lawsuit according to the law, so that Xizhen's family can eke out a living. Therefore, she requests your newspaper to grant a space to disclose this case to uphold justice and provide relief. She sends her regards with endless anticipation. Shen Xizhen from No. 5 Zaifu Lane, Beihai Road, Shanghai.
