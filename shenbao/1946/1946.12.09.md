### National Assembly Presidium Holds Tea Party to Host Review Committee Conveners, Requesting Accelerated Review of Constitution Draft so that it Can Be Submitted to the Assembly on the 13th

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The National Assembly Presidium hosted a tea party for the conveners of the various Review Committees at 4:15 PM on the 8th in the First Lounge on the second floor of the Assembly Hall. Attendees included Sun Ke, Zou Lu, Wang Chonghui, Bai Chongxi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Jiang Juntian (represented by Lu Yi'an), Hu Shi, Yu Bin, Fu Sinian, Bai Yunti, Bai Haifeng, Huang Zhengqing, Chen Yiyun, Ren Peixun, Hong Lanyou, Lei Zhen, and 68 others. Sun Ke delivered a speech stating that the purpose of the tea party was to discuss the procedures for the meeting. He then reported the decisions made at the 13th Presidium meeting as follows:

(1) The conveners of each Review Committee are requested to actively conduct review work during the four days from the 9th to the 12th, holding meetings in the morning and afternoon, in accordance with the Assembly's agenda, so that the first reading can begin at the Assembly on the 13th and conclude on the 19th, closing the session as scheduled.

(2) The quorum for the Review Committees is set at one-tenth of the total number of members in each committee.

(3) Approximately 400 proposals have been compiled into eight volumes, which will be printed and distributed to each Review Committee as they are completed.

(4) Each Review Committee will establish a "Preliminary Organization Group" composed of the nine conveners and ten representatives publicly elected by the Review Committee. This group will summarize and list the proposals and extensive opinions, formulate specific amended clauses, compare them with the Constitution chapter by chapter, and submit them to the Review Committee. Major or fundamental changes should be simultaneously notified to the Presidium for transfer to the Comprehensive Review Committee. The conveners may meet every evening to review the progress of the Review Committee.

(5) Regarding the issue of journalists attending the review sessions for reporting, the conveners may, at their discretion, hold closed meetings when necessary and ask the journalists to temporarily leave the venue.

(6) Each Review Committee does not need to wait for all proposals and extensive opinions to be delivered before starting to organize, arrange, and submit them for discussion.

After Sun Ke finished speaking, Hong Lanyou continued, saying that although the deadline for accepting proposals was set at midnight on the 9th, they are still arriving in a continuous stream. It is planned to compile all of them into eight volumes, plus a general introduction, all of which are being printed as quickly as possible and will be delivered to each representative. As for the oral and written extensive opinions submitted by the representatives at the Assembly, totaling hundreds of thousands of words, organizing and classifying them is particularly difficult. The production efficiency of the printing press has reached its limit, so it has been decided to first distribute copies to the relevant Review Committees by mimeograph.

Subsequently, Kuomintang representatives Zou Lu, Ren Zhuoxuan, and Social Democratic Party representative Li Junban raised opinions regarding the speeches and impromptu opinions of the representatives at the Review Committee. Sun Ke replied that impromptu opinions can still be discussed and submitted at the Review Committee. However, if the speaking time is too long, or if the opinions are the same as those already expressed at the Assembly, the chairman of the Review Committee can exercise their due authority to weigh and handle the situation to avoid wasting time.

Kuomintang representative Huang Shaogu raised questions regarding the technical aspects of proposal allocation and the nature and authority of the Review Committee. Hong Lanyou, Sun Ke, and Lei Zhen responded separately: (1) The Secretariat will provide a general classification and summary of the proposals and extensive opinions, presented as a written catalog. Each Review Committee can contact the relevant groups at any time regarding a particular issue. (2) The work of the First to Eighth Review Committees is primarily based on the proposals, referring to extensive opinions, to evaluate each amendment and decide on the most suitable one to be submitted to the Assembly for responsible review. (3) The work of the Ninth (Comprehensive) Review Committee is to discuss and resolve important or fundamental amendment opinions and issues with more constraints. At this point, Kuomintang representative Zhong Tianxin proposed canceling the provisions for the two sessions of the Joint Review Committee and the Comprehensive Review Committee in the agenda, advocating that they be convened ad hoc when necessary, and that the Review Committees be given sufficient time to meet and discuss.

Yan Fen suggested that organizing and summarizing proposals and opinions is administrative work, not review, and that it is unnecessary to form a Preliminary Organization Group, as electing members would only waste time.

Lin Bin also reported that the Second Review Committee had already been carrying out this task by the conveners and secretaries, and the progress was quite rapid, all advocating that there was no need to establish a Preliminary Organization Group.

After discussion, it was decided to submit these two issues to the Presidium meeting on the morning of the 9th for reconsideration. Finally, Hong Lanyou announced the meeting times and locations for each Review Committee on the 9th, and the meeting adjourned at 6:40 PM.

### Army Joint Grand Exercises: Infantry, Artillery, and Paratrooper Performances are All Extremely Realistic; National Assembly Representatives from All Regions are Delighted

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The joint army-air grand exercises were held at 9:00 AM on the 8th at Jietuo Village outside Zhongshan Gate in the suburbs of Nanjing to welcome the National Assembly representatives. The General Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense for the Army and Air Force were extremely busy with preparations and exercises beforehand, and even conducted rehearsals all day on the 7th, rushing to handle various related reception matters at night. Therefore, when people arrived at the exercise site this morning, they saw that the arrangements were well-organized and orderly. The seats for the audience were all on the ground, with a box of snacks for each person for a picnic. Today, the capital's weather was clear and sunny, and thousands of people bathed in the sunshine to watch this realistic exercise. First, Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense gave a speech, followed by Chief of Staff Shen Zhuangyu reporting on the exercise items. The exercise began at 10:00 AM, with Tang Enbo serving as the supervisor, Liu Zhenqing as the commander-in-chief, Mao Yingchu and Luo Yingde as the Air Force commanders, Ma Shigong as the paratrooper instructor, Jin Zhen as the artillery instructor, and Li Ziliang and Tan Zhenduo as the infantry commanders.

All the exercises were extremely realistic, earning endless praise from representatives from all regions. Minister Bai, Chief of Staff Chen, and Commanders Zhou and Tang were all on hand to receive guests, explain, and clarify. They dispersed around 2:00 PM. Minister Bai's speech was approximately as follows: "Today, the Ministry of National Defense is holding army-air exercises here to welcome the National Assembly representatives. You representatives are the representatives of all the people, and the army is the armed force of the people, the army of the people. Therefore, inviting you here today can be said to be inviting you to inspect your own armed forces, your own army. The National Assembly began in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], and after several twists and turns, it was not realized. It is only now that it can be held, and soon we will have a constitution. If we want to guarantee that the constitution can be implemented, we must first establish a strong military force to consolidate national defense, so that we can resist foreign aggression. The evolution of military affairs has now reached the atomic energy era. The Ministry of National Defense has a National Defense Science Research Association that is constantly conducting research, and we hope that scientific national defense can be realized soon."

Liang read a written statement, first saying: "We are going to Shanghai this time because Zhang Junmai and Wu Xianzi sent urgent telegrams today urging us to discuss everything in person. Generally speaking, Shanghai knows that we have the intention to withdraw from the party, and deeply feels that this matter is entirely due to the unsoundness of the party, and there is an intention to reorganize it. Because of our many years of friendship, we are very willing to contribute some ideas on reorganization."

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] Hu Haimen said: The Social Democratic Party's organizations at all levels are still in the preparatory stage, and this trip to Shanghai will discuss the establishment of a formal party organization.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Military information: The Communist army under Yang Chengwu in Xushui is currently fleeing from Lai River and occupying Xu Wei Town in Xushui, attempting to re-invade the northern section of Pinghan and threaten Baoding.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] The Communist army in western Shanxi has been attacking Zhongyang for a week. Dozens of fierce attacks have been repelled.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th] The Communist army in Pinging attacked Baijingyi from Mashan Village, East and West Huicun, and Waling Village east of the city at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 6th.

At dawn, the Communist army occupied the high ground in the East and West Huicun, forming an encirclement. The National Army, due to the disparity in numbers, withdrew to Shanxian north of the village. The Communist army increased its support and launched several fierce attacks, but failed.

### On-the-Spot Account of the Army and Air Force Exercises: Our Reporter Zhang Ming; Minister Bai Says People's Representatives Inspect People's Armed Forces

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Minister Bai and General Chen both wore high-top leather boots, the former yellow and the latter black, appearing in the plaza of Jietuo Village at the exercise site in the guise of hosts, shaking hands and greeting guests at any time, and explaining everything, full of spring breeze. Although he was in military uniform, it diluted a lot of the solemn atmosphere. The seats for the audience were arranged very delicately. Although they were sitting on the ground, the ground was sloped, with a military blanket on each level. After sitting down, it was the same as the grandstand of a stadium, and everyone had a box of snacks, which could be described as everyone being happy.

When Minister Bai gave his speech, he was on the rostrum opposite the guests, but the broadcasting equipment was behind the guests. When they heard the sound, everyone turned to the back, while the speaker was in front.

The Relief Administration sent a large number of rations, so the tide of receiving rations stirred up "peace and order" in the venue.

At the beginning of the exercise, three bombers formed a small team, totaling two teams, coming from the sky. Chief of Staff Shen Zhuangyu reported that these were "enemy" planes attacking. Only when he turned around, five planes, three in front and two in the back, were coming head-on. Then the "enemy" planes began to drop bombs. The Chief of Staff's report: "Entering one by one, dropping bombs one by one." The listeners laughed. In the infantry-artillery coordination program, the sound of artillery and machine guns resounded through the mountains, as if they were on the battlefield, but the reaction was a burst of relaxed laughter. The shells exploded on the hillside and caught fire, the raging fire burning the weeds.

During the paratrooper exercise, the smoke screens were particularly beautiful, with purple, red, yellow, and green, covering half the sky, like a vast fog. When the paratroopers began to descend, beautiful black and white flowers spit out from the strong fuselage, weaving out spots of flowers in the clear sky, the colors beautiful, just like a moving pattern painting.

On the ground, Minister Bai specially introduced the identity of Commander Tang to reporters, saying: "Today, he is the only one singing the opera."

After the exercise, the reporter interviewed Secretary-General Hong, who said: "I think Minister Bai's words were the best: People's representatives inspect people's armed forces."

Jietuo Village is in the suburbs of Nanjing, a 40-minute car ride from Zhongshan Gate. So today the road to Jietuo Village was crowded with cars, a collection of the best cars in Beijing. (December 8)

### UNRRA Director Issues Statement: Lifts Suspension of Shipments to China, and Stipulates Monthly Shipments of Supplies to China

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia issued a statement today saying that as a result of improved distribution of UNRRA supplies within China, he has lifted the order to suspend shipments of supplies to China. LaGuardia's previous resignation will take effect on December 10. The above statement was issued two days before his resignation. This is the result of negotiations between our Executive Director Li Zhuomin and UNRRA in the medical government, and between Zheng Shinan, director of the Executive Yuan's office in Washington, and LaGuardia here. LaGuardia has established a system that stipulates that UNRRA China Mission will stipulate the amount of supplies to be shipped each month based on its estimate of China's distribution capacity. Zheng told reporters regarding this matter: It is currently estimated that our country's capacity to distribute supplies is 175,000 tons per month. When inland transportation and port facilities in our country are improved, the distribution capacity can be further increased. LaGuardia's full statement is as follows: In view of the continuous improvement in the distribution rate of special supplies in China, especially the complete clearing of accumulated materials in the ports, which is satisfactory, as reported by Mr. Eggerton, director of our China Mission, I have lifted the order to suspend shipments of supplies to China, with the exception of certain supplies that China is not yet prepared to accept. A system has now been completed that stipulates that the UNRRA China Mission will stipulate the volume of supplies to be shipped each month based on its capacity to distribute supplies in China.

[United Press, Success Lake, 7th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia loudly shouted in the Economic Committee of the United Nations General Assembly today in a stern and sarcastic tone: "Peace cannot exist in a hungry world." He also invited the United Kingdom and the United States to at least accept the compromise of international relief. LaGuardia also advocated that Canada draft this compromise plan. LaGuardia said: "It is most unfortunate that the major food-donating countries in the world disagree on future relief steps. Relief work cannot succeed without consensus."

### Canada Proposes Special Committee to Replace UNRRA, UN Economic and Financial Committee Unanimously Approves

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 7th] Regarding Canada's proposal to establish a committee of experts next year to replace the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Economic and Financial Committee of the United Nations General Assembly convened and unanimously approved it after discussion. Previously, the United States had proposed a plan for relief matters to be directly negotiated between "have" and "have-not" nations. UNRRA Director La Guardia also proposed establishing an international relief organization. Canada's plan is a compromise, stipulating the appointment of eight experts to form a committee to take over UNRRA's responsibilities in Europe from December 31st of this year and in Asia from March 31st of next year. If the plan receives final approval from the United Nations, the committee will be responsible for: (1) determining the minimum amount of food and other essential goods that needy countries must import in 1947 to prevent economic collapse; (2) determining the foreign exchange required for these countries to pay for their imports; and (3) drafting a report proposing appropriate methods to provide sufficient funds for these countries to pay for their imports. The United Kingdom and the United States, which have independently supplied 92% of UNRRA's relief materials, remain firmly opposed to joining the proposed international relief organization, as they wish to decide which countries to assist. La Guardia, on the other hand, insists that the new international relief organization should base its decisions solely on the needs of needy countries and the capacity of food-surplus countries when allocating relief supplies. The British representative to the Economic and Financial Committee, Mr. Welles, told Agence France-Presse after the meeting that the United Kingdom supports the Canadian compromise. A representative of the US delegation stated that if the committee of experts acts solely in an advisory capacity, the US government would not object. The Economic and Financial Committee is scheduled to formally vote on the Canadian proposal on the 9th, and it appears to have the full support of all member states of the United Nations.

### British Cruiser "Dawn" to be Transferred to China

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] The British government will formally transfer the cruiser "Dawn," leased to China, as soon as the Chinese naval personnel training in London are ready to receive the ship. This was announced by Mr. Dugdale, Parliamentary Secretary to the British Admiralty, in response to a question in the House of Commons. He said, "Britain's decision to lease several warships to China was made in response to China's request in 1944 for Britain to lease them to assist the Chinese Navy in actively engaging in the war against Japan. Now that the war has ended, Mr. Dugdale hopes that these British warships can assist China in its naval reconstruction and consolidate the close ties between the Chinese and British navies that have lasted for over seventy years."

### Siberian Cold Front Reaches Tianjin and Beijing

Temperature Drops to Over Ten Degrees Below Zero

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 8th] The Siberian cold front reached the northeast of Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union at 2:00 PM on the 6th. It was estimated that the front edge of this cold front would reach the vicinity of Beijing by the afternoon of the 7th. Therefore, a general forecast on the 6th predicted an increase in wind force on the afternoon of the 7th (cold fronts are often accompanied by strong winds). As a result, the front edge of this cold front reached the vicinity of Beijing at 4:00 PM on the 7th, with the wind gradually strengthening and the temperature dropping simultaneously. The wind force peaked at 11:45 AM on the 8th, reaching 72 kilometers per hour. The lowest temperature was -11.6 degrees Celsius, and the highest temperature dropped to -6.4 degrees Celsius. This is the first strong wind in North China since the beginning of winter this year. The highest temperature dropping below zero degrees and the lowest temperature dropping below ten degrees below zero are both firsts for Beijing this winter. The center of this cold front was still in northern Mongolia on the afternoon of the 8th, so North China will need to endure another two or three days of cold weather. The wind force may gradually decrease on the 9th. This afternoon, the front edge of this cold front has reached eastern Japan.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 8th] Since last night, gale-force winds have been howling here, and the weather has become extremely cold. The wind has not stopped roaring all day today, and the cold has intensified. The Baihe River is freezing, and the temperature has dropped to -5 degrees Celsius.

### Central Air Transport Corporation's Shanghai-Lanzhou Flight Almost Caused Disaster Due to Misidentification of Direction

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th] The Central Air Transport Corporation's Shanghai-Lanzhou flight arrived in Lanzhou on the 7th and returned to Shanghai on the 8th.

Fortunately, the aircraft maintained contact with the ground and finally arrived in Xi'an at 10:00 PM that night. However, due to the excessive flight time and the imminent depletion of fuel en route from Qinghai to Shaanxi, it had to jettison its cargo, luggage, and mail to reduce the load in order to reach Xi'an. The items jettisoned included 50 sets of automobile tires, several pieces of luggage and cargo, and 14 bags of mail. This is the second time recently that Central Air Transport Corporation's Shanghai-Lanzhou flights have jettisoned mail, cargo, etc., due to flight obstructions, the first time being two weeks ago.

### Ancient Han and Jin Tombs Discovered in Zhangshu Town, Jiangxi

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 8th] Ancient Han and Jin tombs were recently discovered in Zhangshu Town, Jiangxi. Rao Huiyuan, Director of General Affairs at the Jiangxi Provincial Middle School, discovered several Han and Jin tombs on Niutou Mountain in the outskirts of the town. One of them has already been exposed to the surface. The bricks have patterns of pythons, dragons, double coins, and auspicious fish, as well as inscriptions such as "Chuping" and "Ningkang Second Year," "Tomb of Cui Silang's wife, Hong Siniang," and "Gui Family Tomb." "Chuping" was the reign title of Emperor Xian of Han, and "Ningkang" was the reign title of Emperor Xiaowu of Jin, so it can be proven that these are ancient Han and Jin tombs dating back 1500 to 1600 years. Rubbings are currently being studied by experts.

### UNRRA Sells Various Agricultural Implements to China at Low Prices, Negotiations Began Last Week

[Our City News] In order to assist in the restoration of agricultural engineering in China, UNRRA will sell various farming implements to approximately 3,000 blacksmiths in 19 provinces of China at the lowest possible prices. This plan is being discussed and implemented jointly by the Agricultural Engineering Team of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and UNRRA. These discussions were conducted in Shanghai last week by relevant personnel. The plan involves UNRRA assisting China in setting up an agricultural implement factory that can produce 20 million agricultural implements, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will manage the agricultural implement store loans so that iron shops destroyed by gunfire can resume work. Blacksmiths in cities and villages can purchase various agricultural implements at the lowest possible prices. An organization established in Yangshupu, Shanghai (near Fuxing Island), supplies 200 to 250 agricultural implements daily at extremely low prices. Similar organizations will soon be established in Zhengzhou, Henan, and Guangzhou.

### The Whole Story of the Shenzhen Bloodshed: British Troops Disregard Human Life and Damage Our Sovereignty

— Our Guangzhou Correspondent, Liang Feng

This is another incident that the Hong Kong British government "deeply regrets." Before the Wang Yongxiang kicking death incident has been resolved, at around 2:00 PM on December 3rd, another bloody incident occurred at Man Kam To near Shenzhen on the border between Guangdong and Hong Kong, where British troops crossed into Chinese territory and killed our farmer Zhang Tianxiang. This is truly the most unfortunate event. Although the Chinese and British authorities have always been friendly, unfortunately, the British troops under their command have repeatedly violated the wishes of the authorities and acted recklessly. Since the victory, countless unpleasant incidents have occurred between them. This time, the British troops crossed into Chinese territory, which is already inappropriate, let alone killing someone. Damaging human life is a small matter, but damaging our national sovereignty is a big deal. If these incidents are not resolved satisfactorily, then the safety of the overseas Chinese residing in Hong Kong, who account for 98% of Hong Kong's population, will be even more difficult to guarantee in the future.

Blood-Stained Border Between China and Britain

The day after the incident, the reporter went to the scene to investigate. Villagers gathered, talking about what happened, and everyone was indignant. The place is the border between China and Britain, separated by the Shenzhen River. The south is British territory, and the north is Chinese territory (Shenzhen). A wooden bridge, the Man Kam To Bridge, spans the river. To the south of the bridgehead, there are two British military forts, which were heavily guarded at the time. A machine gun was set up on the side of the bridge, and a small armored vehicle with a machine gun mounted on it was parked there, all facing north towards Chinese territory. It was heard that the number of British troops had also increased compared to usual, and the movement of other military vehicles was more frequent, as if facing a formidable enemy. However, on the Chinese side, in addition to the police maintaining order, there was no sign of alert. The location of the incident was 39.5 meters from the north bank of the Shenzhen River, about 80 meters from the British border crossing. The body of the deceased Zhang Tianxiang was still lying on the side of the road, a desolate sight! The place was right behind the Chinese customs wooden sign next to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, which had Chinese and English words such as "Stop for Customs Inspection." The deceased was wearing a black serge short jacket and pants, yellow canvas-faced rubber shoes, white socks, and a woolen hat to the side of his head. His face was covered in blood, and the right corner of his mouth was torn because the bullet entered from the corner of his mouth and exited from his right ear.

Mother and Sister Painfully Recount the Deceased's Life

At the time, two old women were sitting around crying, who turned out to be the deceased's mother, older sister, and siblings. Later, from their mouths, they told the story of the deceased's life:

The deceased, Zhang Tianxiang, was 29 years old and came from Xiangxi Village near the Shenzhen River. His father, Zhang Cai, traded in fresh and salted fish. When Zhang Tianxiang was sixteen years old, his father died of overwork, and from then on, he had to shoulder the burden of the family. His family included his 55-year-old mother, his older sister A'e, his younger sister Zhang He, and a 16-year-old younger brother Zhang You, all of whom relied on him to make a living by doing small businesses. He had also studied in a private school in Shenzhen for two years when he was young, but dropped out after his father died. When the Japanese army invaded Shenzhen, the houses where people lived were burned down. He took his family and temporarily lived in a thatched hut under the Yuen Long Mountains. Because he was angered by the brutality of the Japanese army, he hid it from his mother and joined the guerrillas, spending four years in a hail of bullets, harassing the enemy until they were exhausted. He only moved back to his hometown after the victory. Who would have thought that he could safely pass through the dangerous days of the past few years, only to be sacrificed unjustly today? From today onwards, they don't know who this family of several people will rely on!

British Troops' Brutality is Hair-Raising

The events unfolded as follows: At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, two children, about thirteen or fourteen years old, carried two packages of about two pounds of white sugar (some say it was flour) from the New Territories back to Shenzhen. When they passed in front of the British military checkpoint, the British troops claimed that they were "smuggling." The children, frightened by the British soldiers, ran wildly from the Man Kam To Bridge towards Shenzhen. However, the British troops chased after them relentlessly, crossing the bridge into Chinese territory with weapons and grabbing the two children, beating them severely. When the villagers nearby saw this, they protested loudly, which led to a dispute. Because of language barriers, the misunderstanding deepened. Later, Mr. Jiang of the Chinese customs heard the news. Because he was fluent in English, he stepped forward to mediate. He learned that the British soldier's name was Lieutenant Mac Robart, the leader of the Gold Medal team of the 45th Battalion stationed on the border. When Mr. Jiang stepped forward to mediate, he was initially expelled. Later, when he was identified as a customs official, he stopped. Mr. Jiang immediately reprimanded him for not crossing the border with weapons, but the British soldier said, "The area 100 yards north of the Shenzhen River is British territory. I can not only come here at any time, but also..." At that time, more and more of our people gathered, and seeing his brutality, they were all extremely angry. The British soldier became even more angry and immediately ran back to the British barracks. After a while, gunshots were heard, and bullets flew from the British side, firing six or seven shots in a row. As a result, the villagers gathered at the bridgehead ran away in droves, and Zhang Tianxiang was unable to avoid them and fell to the ground. This unfortunate incident thus began.

Local Officials Lodge Protests

After the incident, Yuan Zhichao, the town chief of Shenzhen, Lin Wannian, the chief of police, and Lu Shen, the company commander of the 16th Regiment of the Military Police, all rushed to the scene after hearing the news and lodged protests with the British troops stationed there. However, Mac Robart vehemently denied that the person was killed by British troops, saying that the British troops had fired two shots with .303 bullets, and that it would be proof if the deceased was hit by this type of bullet. Our side replied that the bullet had already come out of the body, so how could it be identified? It would be best to gather all the British soldiers to check their guns to find out who fired the gun. Mac Robart was speechless at that time. Later, British Police Chief Ruddy and a British colonel also arrived. Our side continued to negotiate with them. The British side initially wanted to shirk responsibility, but after being identified, they admitted that "This incident is unfortunate, and we should take full responsibility. However, we should report it to our superiors and wait for their judgment." Since our side believed that they had already admitted responsibility, they could continue to negotiate and immediately returned to Chinese territory. This was the initial situation of the negotiation.

Public Organizations Hold Emergency Meetings

At that time, the local villagers, gentry, and leaders of various public organizations were all indignant after hearing about the incident. They immediately convened an emergency meeting at Shenzhen Elementary School and established the "Shenzhen All-Circles Support Association for Opposing the British Troops' Killing of Zhang Tianxiang by Crossing the Border," with thirteen local organizations serving as members of the association. The reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang Zhenying, chairman of the association, who said, "This time, the British soldiers were unreasonable and barbaric, and they actually crossed the border with guns and killed people. Not only did our villager Zhang Tianxiang die innocently, but it was also a great insult to our national dignity. If the perpetrators are not punished, there will be no way to protect the lives and property of our people in the future. Therefore, they represent the 100,000 people of the county and vow to be their support and do their best to achieve victory." Several important resolutions were made by the association that day: (1) Request the government to negotiate with the British authorities to hand over the soldiers who committed the crime to our government for strict punishment; (2) Provide compensation to the deceased's family; (3) Urge the government to recover Kowloon and Hong Kong; and (4) Before the case is completely resolved, request the government to negotiate the withdrawal of the British troops stationed at Man Kam To from the border for five miles. That day, the association immediately sent Xu Hua (secretary of the Linchuan County Provisional Council) and Zheng Qichang (head of the Construction Section of Linchuan County) as representatives to Hong Kong overnight to report the incident to Guo Dehua, our diplomatic envoy for Guangdong and Guangxi. They also came to Guangzhou on the 4th to report to the local party, government, and military authorities and the Senate, urging the authorities to take effective measures to protect the lives of the people. Currently, public organizations here have unanimously resolved to support them. Twenty-six organizations jointly issued a telegram on the 5th, calling on the National Assembly representatives to propose to the conference that the National Government actively negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau in order to safeguard territorial sovereignty. Moreover, the people of Guangdong Province are all filled with grief, indignation, and excitement.

Hong Kong Official Announcements Differ

As for the Hong Kong authorities, after the incident, the official Hong Kong announced the next day that "At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, more than a dozen plainclothes Chinese were intercepting traffic and conducting inspections at the foot of the Man Kam To Bridge in the Chinese territory of the New Territories. Armed Chinese military police stood behind them, but took no action. A soldier of the garrison on the British side crossed the bridge to inquire about the truth, but was driven back. After the soldier retreated to the British post, he accidentally pulled the trigger for some reason. A gunshot rang out, and unrest was seen on the opposite bank. Later, it was heard that someone was injured. The Chinese police officer immediately went to the British side to negotiate. The soldier was not ordered to fire. The British military authorities immediately detained the soldier after the incident and dealt with him severely." On the same day, the Hong Kong British Army Headquarters announced on the 4th that "On the 3rd, a soldier of the garrison on the border of Kowloon and the New Territories fired a .303 bullet. The investigation at the time confirmed that it was a misfire. According to a report from the Chinese authorities, the bullet killed a Chinese civilian standing on the Chinese side. The military authorities are thoroughly investigating this incident. At the same time, the British military authorities take full responsibility for the death of the deceased and express their deep regret." These two British official announcements alone already have slight discrepancies. Currently, after negotiations by Guo Dehua, our diplomatic envoy for Guangdong and Guangxi, General Festing, Commander of the British Army in Hong Kong, has replied, in addition to making a verbal apology, he has proposed three guarantees: (1) Compensation for losses; (2) Severe punishment of the perpetrator; and (3) Guarantee that the same incident will not occur again in the future. Currently, the special envoy is carefully investigating the entire case and collecting materials to report to the Central Government before formally lodging a written protest with the Hong Kong government. (Editor's Note: Special Envoy Guo's report has been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and our official note has also been delivered to the Hong Kong side on the 7th. The news can be found in the newspaper on the 8th. In addition, there is another article by our Hong Kong special correspondent regarding this case, which will be published on page 9 tomorrow.)

On Special Topics

### Capital Education

— Zhou Shang

This past year, we have paid close attention to education in various cities. Summarizing reports from all sides, only two words can describe it: "decline" and "chaos." The education in cities in the rear is in decline, declining beyond recognition. The education in the recovered areas is chaotic, disturbingly chaotic. We cannot help but tremble under the slogan of "Education First." Everyone knows that the nation's future rests on the next generation, and the cultivation of nation-building pillars relies entirely on education at all levels. However, in reality, it is impossible, and no one is coming forward to improve the current situation of decline and chaos.

Naturally, Nanjing's education cannot escape the chaos either. Everyday, children are changing schools, teachers are losing their jobs, principals are dismissed and schools cannot open, and when schools do open, district offices refuse to move out, and other such phenomena occur. However, the Nanjing Education Bureau is, after all, the education bureau of the capital. Under these circumstances, they are still trying to cultivate whatever vitality they can find; they are quickly repairing whatever sores appear. Recently, they have gritted their teeth and drafted a three-year plan, hoping to popularize national education, eliminate illiteracy throughout the city, improve the quality of education at all levels, and make reasonable arrangements for the entire education system. The other day, they invited local experts to discuss it for half a day, which is indeed a welcome sign and something worth paying attention to. This is because the education of the capital is not just the education of Nanjing, but has national implications, and its influence extends beyond Nanjing.

Nanjing is now the political center. We hope that Nanjing will not only be the political center but also become a center of educational expertise. This is not only for the education of the Southeast region but also to build a center for Southeast education. Beiping (Beijing) has long been known as a "cultural city" and a "student city." In addition to schools and students, it has abundant facilities such as libraries, unmatched by any other major city in the country. Before long, Nanjing should at least be comparable to Beiping. Currently, the education center of the Southeast region is still in Shanghai, but Shanghai is a commercial port and not a place for an education center.

Once Nanjing becomes a new education district and a new cultural city, the benefits will be numerous. Nanjing's mountains and rivers are majestic, a place where emperors built their capitals, rich in historical sites. If education is to promote patriotism and national unity, love for the rivers and mountains and recalling history are of utmost importance. Shanghai is immersed in Europeanization, with a strong mercantile atmosphere and a penchant for pleasure. If one enters a poor capital city and lives the simple lives of most compatriots, one will not be able to indulge in decadence and extravagance even if one wants to. Nanjing is where the National Government is located, the political center. Politics itself is education. Being immersed in it day and night, one can naturally become accustomed to a democratic demeanor and understand the difficulties of national policy. Moreover, Nanjing is located by the Yangtze River, with vast city walls and expansive territory, a central location, and convenient transportation. Under the circumstances of "the Southeast being a land of wealth and the Jiangzhe region being a repository of culture," there are plenty of opportunities to freely expand and build education.

The education of the capital is the most difficult to manage, but in reality, it is also the easiest. To realize the central position of educational undertakings cannot be borne by the local government alone, but it also cannot be managed solely by the central government. Success can only be achieved through close cooperation between the two. Large-scale educational institutions such as planetariums, aquariums, libraries, museums, art institutes, and colleges should all be managed by the central government. General social education and school education should, of course, be the responsibility of the local government. However, local tax revenue is limited. As it stands now, taking Nanjing's entire revenue to maintain the current monthly education expenditure of over 480 million yuan is already a desperate situation. How can one talk about improvement, betterment, or development? A large subsidy from the national treasury is essential. In fact, the target audience of Nanjing's education is not truly Nanjing natives. Not to mention anything else, the children of central government employees account for a large number, with origins all over the country. It is only right that the central government should contribute money. Otherwise, expecting the horse to run well without feeding it is not how things work.

According to the director's report: there are currently 116 national schools, 1020 classes, with approximately 61,200 students; 32 private primary schools, approximately 165 classes, with 900 students. In reality, 216 schools and 2420 classes are needed. The three-year budget requires 49,788,500,480 yuan. The city has 364,869 illiterate people, requiring 5,400 elementary adult classes and elementary women's classes, and 6,400 advanced classes. The three-year budget requires a total of 8,921,182,240 yuan. The city has approximately 50,000 children aged two to under six. Assuming one-third of them attend school, 1223 nursery classes and infant classes are needed, requiring a budget of 19,109,025,680 yuan over three years. There are eleven junior high schools with 240 classes, and nine high schools with 108 classes. The three-year budget requires a total of 15,575,924,480 yuan. In addition, adding the costs of early childhood education institutions, vocational schools, research, and administration, it is impossible to manage without over 38.6 billion yuan.

Considering the reliability and variability of the estimated figures, we feel that it is better to underestimate than to overestimate. Population, currency value, market conditions, and school fees are all problems. We are very interested in this plan because it is national in scope and has exemplary value. It is worth discussing. The plan involves more material aspects and fewer spiritual aspects. By spiritual, we mean philosophy, we mean ideals. Nanjing has its commonality, its individuality, and even more so, its uniqueness. Of course, education must be practical to avoid becoming empty talk. However, education should have a profound philosophy and far-reaching ideals that are adapted to the local conditions, so that it can guide the implementation of activities to the highest level.

The emphasis on creating preschools for children is truly commendable. This is where education is progressing. Before the war, out of the world's 700 million people, there were 14 million children over the age of five who did not have compulsory education laws. There were 350 million people who had laws but failed to implement them. Countries that require compulsory education for children under five include Romania and Belgium, where 66% of children aged three to six attend school, France (52%), Switzerland (50%), and Italy (30%). The United States has 500,000 kindergartens. Nursery schools only numbered twelve in 1932, but two years later, they jumped to 3,000. We do not know how many there are now. In the plan, is the distinction between infant classes and nursery classes the same as the distinction between daycares and kindergartens? Because infant schools are schools for the same age group, although the former is favored by the British and the latter is commonly used in the United States, there is no real difference. Furthermore, if classes can be changed into independent institutions, etc., then it would be the best approach. The teachers for this type of education should be specially trained in childcare, which is beyond the capabilities of general teachers.

The number of middle schools planned within three years is still too few. If a new education district can be created, the number of middle school students should be greatly increased. The duration of compulsory education in various countries has largely exceeded primary education and progressed to the secondary education stage. England has extended it to fifteen years old and plans to raise it to sixteen. France is fourteen years old. When the Soviet Union began its third five-year plan, it planned to popularize ten years of compulsory education in cities. Japan also changed compulsory education from six years to nine years starting in 1941. All of these circumstances provide favorable conditions for the popularization of secondary education. Opening the doors of secondary education will naturally absorb a large number of commoner children. We should focus on popularizing secondary education, keeping in mind Winston Churchill's words: "The future world belongs to the races that have received higher education. Only they can master the tools of new science."

Recreational parks and convalescent schools are indeed urgently needed, and they should not be limited to one type. Simple open-air schools, forest schools, summer camps, and holiday camps can all be established economically. Home economics schools are too important for women. The school's emphasis on "public health" should be changed to "various health," because prenatal care for pregnant women, hygiene for infants and children, and nutrition are more essential and practical than public health in the home. Teacher training should focus on life education and skills education, so that teaching is learning. Every primary school teacher should be able to teach physical education, conduct health education, make specimens, and repair electric lights and radios. Moral cultivation is especially indispensable in today's world where people's hearts are easily corrupted. Xunzi's "Self-Cultivation" says, "The teacher uses his body as a model of correctness and values self-stability." The "Encouragement of Learning" also says, "Therefore, power and profit cannot sway him, the masses cannot move him, and the world cannot shake him. Live according to this and die according to this." Only in this way can one be called a teacher. As for supervision, one cannot rely entirely on educational inspectors or central schools. Principals must absolutely take more responsibility. Principals should spend 70% of their time supervising. Selecting principals for the nation's children is, of course, a solemn and serious matter, but simplifying administration and allowing principals to spend less time running to the education authorities and more time in the classrooms may not be a revolutionary thing for education.

### Zhejiang Military Control District Headquarters Telegraphic Order: Strictly Prohibit Maltreatment of Conscripted Strong Laborers; Binding and Escorting Causes Distress to the People

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] The Zhejiang Military Control District Headquarters recently telegraphed all counties and cities, stating: Recently, various townships and towns have been sending strong laborers to the county, some of whom are being bound with hemp rope, with pistols drawn, escorted before and behind, as if they were major criminals. It has been repeatedly ordered that the conscription and escort of strong laborers must be treated with respect and that binding is strictly prohibited. However, such situations still occur recently, even escalating, with individuals tied together in a string, driven under armed guard, resembling prisoners. The people are distressed. Years of conscription propaganda have been swept away. This hinders the future and is deeply abhorrent. Hereafter, if such situations occur again, once verified, the escorting personnel will be severely punished according to the law. If the supervising authorities at all levels are unaware, they will also be severely punished.

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] The exemption and deferment review for Hangzhou's strong laborers was completed on the afternoon of the 4th. The Military Affairs Section of the Municipal Government has marked the names of those approved for exemption and deferment in the national militia rosters and strong laborer rosters sent by the various Bao offices. The strong laborers to be drawn by lot have been numbered and will be drawn at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th in the Municipal Government Auditorium, presided over by the Mayor and Conscription Officer.

[Our newspaper, Pinghu] Regarding this county's temporary conscription for the 34th year, the provincial order stipulates the drawing of 353 eligible strong laborers. In addition to the 120 volunteer soldiers who were successively conscripted from various townships and towns, inspected, and accepted by personnel sent by the Jiaxing National Control District, there is still a shortage of 233 strong laborers. On the 6th, the county government solemnly held a public lottery ceremony in the county government auditorium. County Magistrate Zhong personally presided over the ceremony until 10:00 p.m., when all the drawn lots were sequenced and all the numbering was completed. The official drawing was held on the 7th.

[Our newspaper, Chuansha] The settlement allowance for this county's conscripted strong laborers has been issued by the higher authorities, totaling 20,000 yuan per person. It is learned that the county government has sent personnel to various townships and towns to distribute the allowance by name in conjunction with the township and town heads.

### Winter Defense Implemented in Siming Mountain; Jiangnan Suppression Campaign Completed; Garrison Headquarters Rewards and Punishes Commanders

[Yuyao] Since Commander Zheng returned to the Siming Mountain Pacification Headquarters, he has attached great importance to the suppression campaign. Chief of Military Affairs Section Zhang has personally led subordinates to search the mountains and forests several times. The banditry in the mountainous area has now been slightly suppressed. Commander Zheng, in order to prevent bandits from becoming active during the winter season, has implemented winter defense since the 1st. The troops' stationing has been further tightened, and patrols are dispatched to the mountains and forests at night.

[Ningbo] Siming Pacification Headquarters Commander Zheng Xiaoyin went from Liangnong to Zhiling in the rain on the afternoon of the 29th of last month. That night, he stayed at the Nanfeng Township Office. The next day, he convened a discussion meeting with the leaders of the Zhejiang Security Corps and local township and Bao heads to discuss the suppression issue in detail. Because the climate in Siming Mountain is cold and it has snowed, and transportation is quite inconvenient, the supply of staple and non-staple foods for the troops is facing difficulties. For this reason, the headquarters remains stationed in Liangnong and will not advance to Zhiling for the time being.

[Our newspaper, Suzhou] The suppression work in the Jiangnan area has now been largely completed. The Capital Garrison Headquarters has rewarded those who have contributed. Yangcheng Suppression District Commander Ma Shigong has been awarded a major merit. Parachute Corps Third Battalion Commander Guo Zhichi, Fourth Battalion Commander Liu Zheng, Ninth Company Commander Gu Weijun, Fifteenth Company Commander Yang Chunbai, Seventeenth Company Commander Zhou Yiqun, Nineteenth Company Commander Ma Xincan, Fifteenth Platoon Commander Yin Sheng, and Xicheng Joint Defense District Commander Kong Qinggui have each been awarded a merit. Pudong Joint Defense District Commander Xu Quan, Chief of Staff Chen Ang, and Headquarters Intelligence Section Chief Han Kai have been commended. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Area Suppression Commander Lü Shiyang has been reprimanded.

### Suspension of Lake Tai Inspection; Mao Sen Arrives in Shanghai

Investigating the Jiangwan Arsenal Explosion

[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 8th] General Mao Sen, Chief of Staff of the Wuxi Command Post, stayed overnight in Mu Du on the evening of the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Liu Hongde, Deputy Commander of the Lake Tai Suppression District, he sailed to Xukou by boat to inspect the terrain of Lake Tai. He originally intended to go deeper into the water area, but due to a telegram ordering him to investigate the Jiangwan Arsenal explosion, he changed his plans and returned to Suzhou at 12:00, taking a special train to Shanghai on the Qiantang.

### Pinghu Reduces the Number of Townships by Two-Thirds

### Shanghai-Songjiang Boundary Dispute

Songjiang Deputy Speaker Provides Opinions

[Our newspaper, Songjiang] A boundary dispute has occurred between Xin Zhuang and other places in this county and Shanghai. After a joint survey by two members of the Ministry of Interior and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, County Magistrate Xu, Shanghai representatives, the Songjiang Senate, and the County Party Headquarters, Deputy Speaker Zhang Huanzhi of the Provisional Senate specially provided a written opinion for the survey's reference: (1) Before the war, Xin Zhuang, Qi Bao, and part of Chang Qiao belonged to the Third District of Songjiang. The enemy and puppet regime arbitrarily changed the administrative divisions for the purpose of undermining our administrative areas and facilitating the Qingxiang campaign. Now that they have been recovered, they should be under the jurisdiction of Songjiang. (2) Although it was planned before the war that part of Da Qiao would be under the jurisdiction of Shanghai, this was originally aimed at the concessions. Now that all the concessions have been recovered, the Greater Shanghai Plan is clearly not suitable for the current needs. (3) The Greater Shanghai Plan was never implemented until 1937, which shows that it could not be implemented at that time. Now that the concessions have been recovered and Shanghai has expanded considerably, there is no need to expand further. (4) Even if the Greater Shanghai Plan is to be implemented, it should be delineated by the Ministry of Interior of the Executive Yuan. Since there is no previous document, the Executive Yuan should not arbitrarily overstep and cause disputes and difficulties in the exercise of administrative power, in accordance with the principle that the Executive Yuan should not arbitrarily overstep and cause disputes and difficulties in the exercise of administrative power.

### Status of Highways and Bridges in Jiangsu Province, North and South of the Yangtze River

[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang] Since the restoration a year ago, there has been little systematic reporting on the overall situation of highways in Jiangsu Province, both north and south of the Yangtze River. The reporter, in view of the great concern of all parties on this matter, specially visited Mr. Zong Zhou, the chief of the engineering section of the Provincial Highway Bureau, and had a long talk with him for more than an hour. The status of highways and bridges in both the south and north of the Yangtze River is summarized below:

South of the Yangtze River

From Jurong to Wujin, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Taicang, and Shanghai, the matter is being handled in two stages. The bridges in the section from Jurong to Wujin are badly damaged, with more than thirty bridges in total. However, traffic can still pass through with difficulty. All bridges are planned to be rebuilt with concrete surfaces. The section from Jiangyin to Wuxi is very good. From Jurong to Zhenjiang, there are six bridges, the longest of which is more than 50 meters. Construction on two bridges, about 20 meters long, is currently underway. The other four bridges are planned to be rebuilt as permanent structures. From Zhenjiang to Wujin, there are a total of 22 bridges, totaling 210 meters. It is now planned to make 17 of the bridges permanent structures, and construction will begin soon. The other five bridges will be made of wood. From Wujin to Jiangyin, there are a total of 13 bridges, which were originally wooden bridges and have been severely damaged. Currently, it is very difficult for vehicles to pass through. Due to funding constraints, it is planned to rebuild the entire surface with wood. The section from Jiangyin to Wujin is operated by a private business, and the road maintenance work is good under the supervision of the bureau. From Wuxi to Suzhou, Kunshan, and Taicang, work is currently underway to actively repair the roads. Construction on five bridges from Wuxi to Shanren Bridge, with a total length of 74 meters, will begin. The repair of all bridge surfaces can be completed within the next ten days. There are two bridges between Suzhou and Kunshan, totaling 96 meters in length, and construction has now begun and can be completed in a short period of time. There are nine bridges between Kunshan and Taicang, totaling about 100 meters in length. Construction on five of the bridges has already begun. The road surface from Jurong to Zhenjiang is also being prepared for reconstruction. In the area from Jintan to Tianwangsi and Lishui, there are a total of 19 bridges, which currently need to be rebuilt from scratch. The materials have been prepared and construction will begin soon, and they will be repaired within two or three months. There are three bridges between Wujin and Caoqiao, and construction will begin soon. According to Chief of the Engineering Section Liu, Jiangsu suffered enormous damage during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. In light of Jiangsu's current economic environment, projects can only be carried out one by one. Given that Jiangsu Province has a network of rivers, the urgent needs must be considered and projects must be carried out accordingly.

North of the Yangtze River

From Pukou to Liuhe, Yizheng, Yangzhou, Taixing, Nantong, and Lvsigang, these areas originally belonged to national highways. In the past, in order to cooperate with the advancement of military vehicles, the bureau organized emergency repair teams to repair the damaged bridges and road surfaces along the way. Due to military considerations, speed was prioritized, and quality was difficult to ensure. Recently, the section from Taixing to Jingjiang and Shizhuang has not yet been opened due to the ongoing military operations. In addition, from Nantong to Rudong and Haian, from Haian to Xiannv Temple in Taixian County, and then from Taixian to the port, there are more than a dozen bridges between Taixing and Huangqiao, and construction will begin soon. There are a total of three bridges from Xiannv Temple to Shiying, and construction has now begun and can be completed in a short period of time. Finally, according to him, the highways and bridges in northern Jiangsu are still far from ideal.

### Fish Theft Leads to Murder in Luodian

[Special dispatch from Luodian by this newspaper] On the night of the 6th, Gu Jinrong, Ma Amao, Jin Amao, Tao Xiaodi, and others, ten farmers from Maqiao Township, Luodian, brought fishing gear to the Bailai Alley area to steal fish from the fish ponds raised by Jin Xin, Qian Zhenting, Wang Xingsheng, and other local farmers. That night, Qian Zhenting and Wang Xingsheng were on night watch and saw someone stealing fish. They immediately stepped forward to stop them, but Wang Xingsheng was beaten. Qian was shocked and ran back to sound the gong and gather a crowd to search for the thieves. As a result, Tao Xiaodi and Wang Xingsheng both fell into the water and drowned. Except for Jin Amao, Ma Amao, and one other, who were captured, the rest escaped. The township head then sent them to the Xuhang Police Station, which transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The trial opened on the 6th. Witness Wang Xirong was subpoenaed, and all the defendants were brought to court. According to Gu Lingrong's statement, he is 35 years old, from Shishan, fishes for a living, and lives in Taojia Village, Maqiao. He went to Bailai Alley to fish that night. Because the pond had no markings, he did not know that it contained farmed fish, resulting in accidental fishing. About half an hour later, Qian Zhenting and 20-30 others came after them with hoes and carrying poles. They fled north, but Tao Xiaodi and Wang Xingsheng both drowned. According to Qian Zhenting, Wang Xingsheng was on night watch that night and was choked, and there were also injuries on his neck, indicating that he was beaten to death and pushed into the river. Judge Zhou said that the case involved murder and would be investigated further before the trial.

### Quzhou Cigarette Industry Collapses

[Special dispatch from Quzhou by this newspaper] Since the widespread sale of machine-made cigarettes from Shanghai and Hangzhou, the handmade cigarette industry in the county has not only suffered poor business but also the sales prices are far out of proportion with various commodity prices. The various factories have been trying hard to maintain their operations, hoping that business in each season would improve. Since the beginning of winter, this hope has vanished. As a result, Xin'an, Dale, Quancheng, and three other companies have already closed down one after another because they could not maintain their operations. The remaining five companies, including Zhedong, are also in danger and may close at any time.

### Anhui Province Holds Regional Accounting and Political Conferences; Hefei-Pukou Highway Rerouted and Construction Accelerated

[Special dispatch from Hefei by this newspaper] The Hefei-Pukou Highway, which runs directly from the temporary provincial capital of Anhui to Yudu, starts in Hefei, passes through Guhe and Quanjiao, and ends at Jiangxia in Chuxian and finally ends in Pukou. However, because there are two major faults between Quanjiao and Jiangxia, the repair project requires a large amount of funds. In order to save financial resources, the Highway Bureau now plans to reroute the highway from Xujiadian in Quanjiao County, through Jieshou, Wuyi, and Xige in Chuxian, to Pukou. The project is easier and the length is the same. Construction is currently being accelerated in order to open the road as soon as possible. It is reported that after the road is opened, it will be possible to reach Nanjing from Hefei within six hours, without having to detour through Bengbu or Wuhu.

### Suzhou County Magistrate Replaced; Construction Departments of Six Counties, Including Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changshu, Changed to Bureaus; Ministry of Interior Sends Personnel to Suzhou to Inspect Police Administration

[Special dispatch from Suzhou, 8th of this month by this newspaper] Lu Jianhua, the county magistrate of Suzhou, has been transferred to the province for other assignments as decided by the 73rd Provincial Committee meeting. Shen Chenglong, director of the Provincial Finance Department, will take over the vacancy. Shen is a qualified county magistrate from Central University and will take office in Suzhou soon.

[Special dispatch from Suzhou, 8th of this month by this newspaper] In order to understand the police administration of various provinces and cities, the Police General Administration of the Ministry of Interior has dispatched officers to Taiwan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai for inspection. Commissioner Liu Guoxian, after completing his inspection tasks in Wuhu and other places, arrived in Zhenjiang a few days ago. Accompanied by He Chaoran, police administration supervisor of the Department of Civil Affairs, he went to Wuxi and other counties. He arrived in Suzhou at around 4 p.m. on the 8th and stayed at the Lexiang Hotel. He met with reporters from this newspaper and made the following remarks: China's police administration has always been characterized by each department acting on its own, without unified management, guidance, and control, which has greatly affected the progress of police efficiency. In the future, the implementation of party and government policies and the maintenance of local security will depend entirely on the police. Therefore, the police have a very important task. In order to adapt to this trend, the Ministry of Interior has decided to formulate police regulations to seek unified management and control. Therefore, it has dispatched officers to various places for inspection. The task is to examine the current police administration system in various provinces and cities, to prepare to eliminate the dross and retain the essence, learn from each other's strengths, and create an ideal and perfect new police regulation. I was dispatched to Jiangsu and Anhui provinces and have visited Hefei, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Mingguang, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, and other places. The observation results show that police funding is too low, resulting in substandard facilities. The Ministry of Interior will plan to improve this. It is learned that Liu will stay in Suzhou for about two or three days before going to Kunshan.

### How to Eliminate Second-Hand Landlords

The city is facing a housing shortage, and the government is actively planning and the city council is working hard to explore thorough solutions. I deeply admire their concern for the people's livelihood. As I am not familiar with the law, I will discuss it based on my observations.

Before the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions in China, the Shanghai Municipal Council had the names of second-hand landlords and third-hand tenants because citizens of all walks of life were mixed together, with several families in one room, for the convenience of management (such as tax collection). At that time, rents were not high, and second-hand landlords did not pay attention to subletting profits, so they could maintain stability for a long time. When the city was occupied by Japanese invaders, the old practice was still followed, with the first-hand landlord serving as the head of the household, responsible for monitoring the third-hand tenants to prevent reactionaries. In addition, the number of refugees arriving in Shanghai increased daily, and rents gradually increased with the cost of living. With few houses and many people, the second-hand landlords took advantage of their power to make profits. They built attics on the upper floors, houses on the rooftops, sheds at the bottom of the alleys, and rented out the living rooms and kitchens at high rents, demanding exorbitant key money and petty rents in every possible way. However, the beneficiaries of this were the second-hand landlords, and the property owners had no right to interfere. Soon after, the enemy puppets limited the profits of the second-hand landlords to 20% of the original rent. Fearing their power, they slightly restrained themselves. Although the rent could not be completely restricted, there were few disputes because the increase was not much. However, they still demanded key money and petty rents as before. After the victory, the government knew the people's suffering and promulgated the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Regulations on December 5, 1945. Article 11, Paragraph 5 states: "If the lessee (second-hand landlord) sublets the house without making improvements and the rent charged exceeds 30% of the original rent, the lessor (i.e., the property owner) has the right to terminate the lease." (According to me, the government believes that the profits of second-hand landlords include subsidies for housing tax, repairs, and electricity expenses, but second-hand landlords never bear these expenses. Looking at those who seek profit from their capital, even their shockingly high secret interest rates are only 15%. Second-hand landlords can get a profit of 30% without spending a penny. "30% is equal to a secret interest rate of 30%." They are still not satisfied. Even if it is reduced to 5%, it is still higher than the bank's current deposit rate.) Therefore, property owners should implement the law to relieve the suffering of third-hand tenants and open up avenues for rent increases. (If third-hand tenants are not subject to the heavy exploitation of second-hand landlords, it seems easier for property owners to increase rents.) Abandoning this path, the opportunity is manipulated by the second-hand landlords, who regard the law as a dead letter and ignore it. In my observations, there are indeed some who can adapt to the environment, not greedy for this legal profit, and share expenses equally with third-hand tenants, but they are as rare as phoenix feathers. Those who do not comply with the law and only seek profit are numerous. (They account for more than 90% and do not bear the responsibility for taxes, electricity, or repairs.) The rent charged for the sublet part exceeds 100%, 200%, or even 500 or 600 times the original rent, which is truly shocking. Therefore, property owners call for rent increases because they cannot balance their income and expenditure, and third-hand tenants seek rent reductions because they cannot afford it. Only the second-hand landlords see the incompetence of the property owners and act boldly. They collect high rents and demand huge key money, operating freely and smoothly. Those who can gain without labor in society and enjoy high profits are only the modernized second-hand landlords. However, this is also due to the loss of power by the property owners.

According to China's household registration law, each household is responsible for itself. The city's household registration survey and re-registration have been completed. It is no longer like the concession and enemy puppet era, which wanted second-hand landlords to be leaders and bear any responsibility. Therefore, second-hand landlords have no status in the government or the people (third-hand tenants). The housing rental dispute is not the fault of the property owner or the third-hand tenant, but is caused by the second-hand landlord's hoarding and profiteering, which obstructs it. Therefore, if the second-hand landlords are not eliminated, the housing rental dispute cannot be resolved. The power to hold the package rental right must be revoked immediately, which is not only necessary but also an essential element in reducing the living expenses of citizens. I have drafted my humble opinions in my spare time:

(1) Rents need to be corrected urgently. Second-hand landlords must issue rent tickets as property owners do. (Rent tickets can be divided into two types: lease and sublease. The rent ticket should indicate the road, lane, number, district, Bao-Jia household, and the monthly rent amount, as well as the name of the lessee. It should be produced and sold by the management agency.) Their profit should be limited to 5%, and the management agency should strictly stipulate penalties. The management agency should create a rent survey form and entrust the Bao-Jia to issue it to the second-hand landlords (not issued to those who do not sublet). They should be required to fill it out separately with the third-hand tenants and then have it stamped by the property owner (to check whether the amount filled in by the second-hand landlord is consistent with the amount on the property owner's rent ticket). Then, they should be sent to the Bao-Jia to be forwarded to the management agency for review. (This form should be filled out once and then refilled within 10 days after each rent adjustment.) If their profits exceed the regulations, the competent agency should immediately notify the property owner to terminate their lease right and manage it directly, but they should still be allowed to rent. In addition to returning the rent collected in excess, they should also be punished according to the amount of the excess. Third-hand tenants who falsely report should also be punished.

(2) Private key money should be strictly prohibited. According to the report on August 10, 1946, "Article 4 of the two housing rental regulations states that 'The lessor shall not collect key money or petty rent in any name other than rent. If violated, the committee may order the lessor to return the illegal fees after verification, and may also impose a fine on the lessor.'" In terms of both reason and law, the lessor should be punished. (The lessor mentioned in the regulations may include both property owners and second-hand landlords.) However, there are very few old empty houses in the city. Property owners only collect key money for new houses, which is rare, and the government is encouraging construction because of the housing shortage, so this is another issue. Generally, those who sublet are second-hand landlords (i.e., lessees). The key money is all in gold bars and cash. How can it be verified? Moreover, after the sublessor leaves, they disappear without a trace. Whom can you pursue? Therefore, the penalty must focus on the sublessee or be jointly punished with the sublessor. If the sublessor cannot be summoned, the sublessee should be ordered to track them down within a time limit. If they fail to track them down within the time limit, the sublessee should be jointly and severally liable. However, if the property owner or agent receives a transfer fee and does not report it, then even if there are regulations, they are useless. Therefore, the way to stop it is not in penalties, but in notarization.

Anyone, whether a second-hand landlord or a third-hand tenant, who wants to move out of the house with their family, must apply for a move-out 15 days in advance and send a letter reporting the confirmed date of the move-out to the Bao-Jia, and the Bao-Jia shall notify the property owner or second-hand landlord to cancel the lease at the relevant office. (If it is a second-hand landlord moving out, the property owner will directly manage it.) At the same time, the property owner or second-hand landlord should announce the vacancy in advance (stating the number of empty rooms, area, deposit, rent amount, address, and location of the relevant Bao-Jia office). If there are people who want to rent, they can first find a guarantor (i.e., a rent guarantor) and register together at the relevant Bao-Tian office (the rental right will be given to the first registered person). Handle the lease (the lease and housing registration book should be produced and sold by the management agency and announced within a time limit. Private leases are invalid after the time limit). Go to the property owner or second-hand landlord to pay the fee and complete the lease procedures. And they must apply for moving in according to the Bao-Tian regulations before they can move in. (According to me, the sale of farmland and houses in the countryside is notarized by the Bao-Jia, and a corresponding handling fee is charged. Although the Bao-Jia system in the city has been completed, more than half of them are unable to proceed due to economic difficulties. Now, why not imitate it to enrich the Bao-Jia funds.) And if the staff who handle housing rentals privately solicit money, they will be investigated according to the law after verification. (According to me, since the vacancy is announced, the renter will naturally be unwilling to spend extra money. The staff who handle rentals will also not be able to force them to pay fees. With heavy supervision, even if you want to bribe, I am afraid that no one will accept it.)

(3) Management should be simple. If the property owner directly manages it and finds it troublesome to make too many rent tickets and collect rent, then in addition to the deposit and guarantor, tenants can be required to use a chain guarantee method, monthly rotating representatives to collect rent and pay it to the property owner themselves. If the house is vacant, they are also responsible for helping to find tenants. If self-payment is not appropriate, or if someone is hired to handle it, a material fee and a handling fee for rent collection can be added. I think that since the tenants are exempt from the heavy exploitation of the second-hand landlords, there is no reason why they would not agree. And when the housing shortage is solved in the future, there will be no second-hand landlord obstacles. It will never happen that the whole house is empty, which is also beneficial to the property owner. (Zhi Dao)

### Lewis Considers the Overall National Interest; US Coal Miners' Strike Ends; Preparing to Negotiate New Contract with Government and Mine Owners; Truman Temporarily Cancels Broadcast

[United Press International, Washington, 7th] United Mine Workers President Lewis today suddenly ended the bituminous coal miners' strike, yielding to the actions the Supreme Court and the President were about to take. Lewis has notified 400,000 miners to immediately return to work in accordance with the wages and other conditions stipulated in the government contract, and has requested negotiations for a new contract. The 17-day-long strike, once it ends, will give the precarious US economy a chance to breathe. Lewis hastily summoned reporters, and in his usual dramatic style, read the notice to the miners, announcing the immediate resumption of work, for a period of at least until March of next year. Lewis stated beforehand that he would personally read the notice to the miners, so that all reporters would know that "This is entirely of my own volition today, out of good faith. As for the motivation, it is purely speculation. Some philosophers have said that pursuing motivation is the most elusive thing in the world."

However, two facts are quite obvious: (1) Truman's broadcast address seemed to bypass Lewis and appeal directly to the miners, and at the same time, news was spreading that some mining industries had already resumed work. (2) Lewis's contempt of court case has been appealed to the Supreme Court, and if the Supreme Court upholds the original verdict, the Mine Workers Union will continue to be in contempt of court, with the possibility of heavier penalties. Three hours before Lewis announced the cancellation of the strike, lawyers from both the government and the union secretly met with Supreme Court Chief Justice Vinson.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] Since the US coal mine strike began, New York City and 21 states across the country have implemented electricity conservation measures, reducing lighting, and the entire country was plunged into a dim scene. After Mine Workers Union President Lewis announced the end of the strike this afternoon, nationwide lighting restrictions were lifted. The Mayor of New York announced that Broadway Avenue could once again be brightly lit, and the Civilian Production Administration also ordered the governors of 21 states to immediately cancel the lighting restrictions. At the same time, restrictions on railway freight and passenger transport have been lifted, and coal export orders can also be cancelled.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] President Truman had originally scheduled a broadcast address for the 8th to directly call on the miners to return to work, but since the strike suddenly ended this afternoon, the President's speech was temporarily cancelled. This morning, the White House spokesman still said that the President was busy preparing for his speech and had no time to see guests.

[United Press International, Washington, 7th] It is particularly coincidental that Lewis ended the strike on the fifth anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. The news of the end of the strike was announced at 2:00 PM, and the news of the Pearl Harbor attack also began to spread at 2:00 PM on December 7, 1941. Lewis announced that the reason for taking this action was to allow the Supreme Court to freely deliberate, free from the influence of public pressure caused by the economic crisis. Lewis requested to negotiate a new contract with the government or mine owners in accordance with the Supreme Court's ruling.

Europe is Greatly Excited

[United Press International, London, 7th] The news of the end of the US coal mine strike has greatly excited Europe. The impact of the strike was such that it brought US exports of food, fuel, and machinery to Europe to a standstill. The UK has warned of reduced food rations, and most people in Germany are in a state of semi-starvation, fearing further reductions in rations.

### German Question Begins Discussion; US and Soviet Union Each Offer Proposals; Appointing Dedicated Representatives to Listen to the Views of Other Countries; Opinions on Limiting Occupation Troop Levels Remain Divided

[Reuters, New York, 7th] The Four Foreign Ministers today discussed two major issues related to the German question, namely, appointing dedicated representatives to deliberate on the German question between this Foreign Ministers Conference and the next, and to listen to the opinions of other countries. Each Foreign Minister offered opinions on how to discuss the German question. Molotov and the other three Foreign Ministers disagreed on whether to establish a dedicated representatives committee immediately to listen to opinions, or to wait until after the next Foreign Ministers Conference is held. Byrnes and Bevin both believed that smaller countries were dissatisfied because they were only allowed to express their views after the Foreign Ministers Conference had established basic resolutions when discussing treaties with German vassal states. Therefore, if Molotov's suggestion is accepted this time, allowing dedicated representatives to listen to the views of other countries only after obtaining instructions from the Foreign Ministers Conference, it would inevitably invite the same dissatisfaction from other countries. Foreign Minister Bevin had to leave early to go to Washington, so today's talks did not reach an agreement on the issue of appointing a dedicated representatives committee and will continue to be discussed on Monday.

US Suggestions

Byrnes's proposed recommendation for the next Foreign Ministers Conference is as follows: (1) The Foreign Ministers Conference should appoint dedicated representatives to deliberate on the German question. (2) Before the dedicated representatives establish any resolutions at the Foreign Ministers Conference, they should listen to the views of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Luxembourg, and other countries willing to express their views, as a preliminary statement before the Foreign Ministers Conference formally consults with the countries. (3) The Berlin Allied Control Council should submit reports to the Foreign Ministers Conference on the following points: (A) The form and scope of the German interim government, (B) Various issues related to the future political economy of Germany under the Allied Control Council. (4) Treaty with Austria. (5) Limiting the number of occupation troops stationed in Europe. (6) The timing and location of the next conference. The agenda for the next conference should include: (A) The future borders of Germany, including the disposition of the Saar region, (B) The continued disarmament of Germany. The United States suggests using treaties and other necessary measures to regulate Germany's future economic and military control, (C) Establishing central institutions, (D) The German interim government, (E) An overview of the Treaty with Germany, (F) Treaty with Austria, (G) Limiting the number of occupation troops, (H) Other agreed-upon matters.

Soviet Suggestions

Molotov's proposed recommendations are as follows: (1) The next Foreign Ministers Conference should discuss the Treaty with Germany and Austria (he did not indicate a date but suggested during the discussion that it be held in Moscow in the second half of February). (2) The agenda for the conference should be: (A) The Berlin Allied Control Council's report on the work done since the Potsdam Conference on disarmament, implementation of democratic and economic principles, and reparations, etc. (B) The central administrative institutions of Germany and issues related to the future German government. (C) The preparation of the German Peace Treaty, discussion procedures, appointment of dedicated representatives, and the basic instructions issued by the Foreign Ministers Conference to the representatives. (D) The preparation of the Treaty with Austria. (E) The liquidation of Prussia, with a report submitted by the Allied Control Council. (F) The report of the Coal Mine Experts Committee. (G) Please ask the Allied Control Council to submit reports on all items on the agenda two weeks before the next Foreign Ministers Conference is convened.

During the discussion, Byrnes expressed his willingness to agree to include the Coal Mine Experts Report and the liquidation of Prussia on the agenda. The US and Soviet drafts are largely the same, with the only exception being the issue of limiting occupation troops. Byrnes's recommendation on limiting the number of occupation troops in Europe stated that, in order to facilitate the restoration of peace in Europe, the allied forces stationed in Europe should have numerical limitations after the treaties with German vassal states are signed. Byrnes advocated that, starting from April 1 of next year, the maximum number of troops stationed in Europe should be as follows: In Germany, the US military should not exceed 140,000, the British military 140,000, the French military 70,000, and the Soviet military 200,000. In Austria, the US, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France should each not exceed 20,000. The Soviet Union may also station 20,000 in Poland, 5,000 in Hungary, and 5,000 in Romania.

[Reuters, Bern, Switzerland, 7th] The Director of Information of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Grosz, stated here that the Polish government will soon submit its views on the German question to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Disarmament Committee Encounters Difficulties

The Crux Remains the Veto Power

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] The disarmament committee has been stalled today due to the issue of the independence of the arms control agency. Soviet representative Vyshinsky insisted that the two control agencies should operate directly under the Security Council and be subject to the veto power provisions. US representative Connally insisted that the control agencies should be independent. The Soviet Union had originally agreed not to use the veto power within the control agencies, but insisted that the veto power should apply when any event is considered by the Security Council. After four hours of debate on this issue, it was referred to the drafting committee for review, and a report will be submitted on the 9th.

### UN General Assembly Debates India's Complaint; Lengthy Duration Exceeds Expectations

[United Press International, New York, 8th] The United Nations General Assembly's discussion on Saturday of India's complaint against South Africa's mistreatment of Indian nationals lasted longer than expected and has not yet reached a conclusion, causing Britain's attempt to seek General Assembly approval for international inspection to investigate whether military reports from various countries are accurate to be postponed until Sunday for discussion. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov only arrived at Flushing Meadow to attend the General Assembly in the evening with his three main aides, at which time the British side had already announced its new move to propose the above-mentioned proposal. India's complaint is expected to have a long debate, and Molotov proposed a resolution stating that this complaint cannot be debated to the end at the Saturday night's General Assembly.

### Pacific Typhoon Approaches the Philippines

[United Press International, Manila, 7th] The weather station reported today that a Pacific typhoon is intensifying and heading towards the central Philippines. The typhoon is currently moving northeast to 135 miles east of northern Mindanao Island.

### US Reaffirms Policy Toward Spain; Refuses to Sever Ties with Franco; Political Committee of the General Assembly Passes Resolution; Barring It from Participating in Any UN Agency

[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 8th Radio Broadcast: US Representative Connally solemnly declared today at a meeting of the Political Committee that the United States will never sever diplomatic relations with Franco under any circumstances, nor will it support economic sanctions against Spain.

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 7th] The subcommittee of the Political Committee of the General Assembly has passed the US-amended proposal, urging the United Nations General Assembly to recommend that the Franco government not participate in institutions established by or related to United Nations agencies, and not allow the government to participate in meetings or other activities of United Nations agencies or their affiliated institutions, until a new government acceptable to Spain is established.

Madrid Protests

[Central News Agency, Madrid, 7th United Press] The Franco Cabinet issued a public protest to protest the action of the Political Committee's subcommittee of the General Assembly condemning the Franco regime, and reiterated Spain's determination to protect its independence and complete non-interference from foreign countries. The protest was issued after a regular cabinet meeting at 4:30 AM.

### Tito Asks Britain Not to Accommodate King Peter

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] Well-informed political sources have recently stated that Yugoslav Premier Marshal Tito has already requested the British government to refuse King Peter of South's right to reside in British territory. The Yugoslav court will declare King Peter a war criminal, and it is widely believed that Marshal Tito has also made the same request to France and Switzerland, but monarchists of South have not been able to confirm these rumors. Diplomats believe that when the British government replies to Marshal Tito, it will explain that political refugees from various countries traditionally have the right to reside in the United Kingdom.

### China Proposes to the General Assembly to Permanently Ban Japan from Manufacturing Poisons; Establishing an International Drug Control Agency in the Far East

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 7th] The Narcotics Committee established by the United Nations Economic and Social Council met today to discuss ways to permanently ban Japan from manufacturing poisons to prevent it from poisoning the people of the East again. Chinese Representative Dr. Xie proposed establishing an international narcotics warehouse in the Far East, under the control of the United Nations, but allowing the manufacture and distribution of narcotics. If Japan wants to import narcotics, it must go through this warehouse, and this point must be included in the future peace treaty with Japan. The Egyptian representative proposed a supplementary proposal, advocating the establishment of another warehouse in other locations, especially the Near East. The US representative also proposed establishing an international agency, with a special charter drafted by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The Dutch representative expressed his opinion, opposing the above-mentioned plans, advocating only setting up a United Nations supervisory office on Japanese territory to supervise the import of narcotics. Countries producing narcotics can transport narcotics into Japan if they obtain a license from the supervisory office. The Chinese representative agreed with the opinions of Egypt and the United States, but did not agree with the proposal of the Netherlands, believing that it was not enough to effectively resist the scourge of drugs.

### London Round Table Conference Fails; British Troops Do Not Intend to Withdraw from India

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] After the Anglo-Indian-Muslim Round Table Conference was declared a failure, it was recently reported by British military sources that unless India has sufficient troops to protect its borders and prevent any aggression, the British troops cannot withdraw from India. British troops must be able to land in India in an emergency, without waiting for the results of negotiations between the British and Indian governments. British political sources said that the British troops will not withdraw from India until the National Assembly has been convened to protect the rights of all elements of all ethnic groups in India. Britain sincerely hopes that India and the Muslim community can reach an agreement, but the rights of other minorities should be protected once the British troops withdraw. The Conservative Party will submit this issue to the House of Commons for discussion. As for the issue of Indian Christians, it is bound to receive even more attention, because the Archbishop of York (one of the highest authorities in the Church of England) has protested that the time is not yet ripe for British troops to withdraw from India. The House of Commons is now scheduled to discuss the Indian issue next week, possibly on the 21st of this month.

[Reuters, Shrirampur, East Bengal, 7th] Gandhi told Indian religious leaders here that he will stay in the Noakhali district even if it means death, even if all Hindus have gone elsewhere, he will still stay here alone. Now he is in the flames, and he will not go elsewhere until the fire is extinguished.

### Bevin Arrives in Washington

Arab Tribes Oppose Partition Plan

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin came here from New York today and will use the weekend to talk to President Truman about the achievements he and Byrnes have made in negotiating the Palestine issue. Authorities said that Truman fully agrees with Byrnes's statement yesterday that the United States is prepared to support the next London Palestine Conference if it gives equal consideration to the recommendations of all parties. After meeting with Jewish representatives in New York, Bevin and Byrnes are convinced that "the World Zionist Congress held in Switzerland will support the division of the Palestine region." What is currently unclear is only the attitude of the Arab plan towards the London Conference.

[Central News Agency, London, 7th United Press] A spokesman for the Arab Office said today that the Arab countries and the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee will refuse to hold a round table conference with Jewish nationalists to discuss the future of Palestine, and will refuse to conduct bilateral discussions with the British side on any partition plan. The spokesman also expressed regret that the United States has decided to send representatives to the Palestine Conference, which is scheduled to reopen in January next year.

### Britain Sponsors Iranian Military Action; Order to Attack Azerbaijan Province Awaits Issuance; Rumors from the Soviet Side that Greek Troops Have Arrived in Southern Iran

[Reuters, London, 7th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain, like the United States, supports the Iranian government's right to send troops into Azerbaijan Province.

[United Press International, Tehran, 7th] It is expected that Iranian King Pahlavi will order the central government army to enter Azerbaijan Province within five hours today. This delay is due to the fact that the King has not yet signed the order.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Moscow Radio cited a report in the Iranian Safar newspaper as saying that a large number of Greek troops have arrived in Khuzestan, southern Iran, at the invitation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. This agency asked the authorities of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company about this matter, but the latter declined to comment.

### Martial Law Declared in Several Areas

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 7th] Officials recently announced that martial law has been declared in southern Azerbaijan Province due to the major disturbances caused by the Shasavan people's opposition to the democratic movement in Azerbaijan Province. In the Caspian provinces, there were also conflicts due to the Iranian National Army forcing workers to hand over weapons. Two workers were injured and it is said that martial law has also been declared there. In addition, in southeastern Azerbaijan Province, a bridge on the highway from Zanjan City to Ahar Mina has been captured by the Iranian National Army from the Azerbaijan Provincial Army.

### Parliamentary Elections Postponed Again

### Greece Organizes Civil Militia to Fight Guerrillas

British Administration of Dodecanese Islands Transferred to Greece

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] A correspondent for the News Chronicle in Athens recently telegraphed that Greek Army Chief of Staff General Spiliotopoulos had previously discussed the issue of Greece organizing a civil militia with the British authorities when he was in London. Later, British Army Chief of Staff General Montgomery came to Athens and also discussed this issue. As a result, it was decided that Greece would organize a civil militia to fight the guerrillas. As for the policy adopted by the British government, it is to assist Greece in controlling the entire country without the intervention of British troops.

[Reuters, Athens, 7th] Deputy Prime Minister Gonatas said that the British military authorities on the Dodecanese Islands have begun to transfer the administration of the islands to Greek officials. Greece has not yet sent police to take over the actual reception until after the Treaty with Italy is signed. The British authorities plan to complete the transfer of administrative power before January.

### Controlling Narcotics Drugs; Draft International Convention; Old Covenants of the International Era No Longer Apply

[Central News Agency] The United Nations Narcotics Committee began its first meeting in New York on November 18 to discuss various international issues related to banning smoking and drugs. China has sent Zhang Pengchun, Liu Jinxuan, and Shi Siming as representatives to attend. According to the Ministry of the Interior: The various international smoking ban covenants and agreements of the League of Nations era are no longer adapted to current needs. Based on years of drug enforcement experience and taking into account the current actual situation, the Ministry has drafted 33 articles of the "Draft Convention on the Control of Narcotics Drugs," and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval, and instructed the Chinese delegation to submit it to the conference for discussion and decision on implementation. The original text of the draft convention is extracted below.

### Full Text of Our Draft Proposal

(Article 27) If there is abuse of narcotic drugs within the territory or territories of the contracting states, it should be periodically eliminated, and those engaged in planting, transporting, and selling should be ordered to change their professions.

(Article 28) Regarding the suppression of illegal abuse of narcotic drugs, the contracting states should adopt the same measures regardless of the nationality of the residents; and should strictly order their nationals residing abroad to comply with the control laws and regulations.

(Article 29) If a contracting state violates the control matters personally determined by this convention and hinders other countries, the United Nations Narcotic Drug Control Agency shall handle it appropriately.

### French Senate Holds Runoff Election, People's Republican Party Position May Be Strengthened

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] France is scheduled to elect 300 of the 315 senators of the Senate tomorrow by 89,000 recently elected electors. This election is inevitably another competition between the Communist Party and the People's Republican Party. The Communist Party claims that it can win 60 to 70 seats out of the 300 seats, while the People's Republican Party believes that the right-wing parties in some provinces will abandon their candidates and elect the People's Republican Party, so the latter is expected to win more seats than the Communist Party. The election will begin at 8 am and end at 4 pm, and the results will not be known until late at night.

### Stalin's Illness, the Mystery Remains Unsolved

Soviet Embassy in the UK Solemnly Denies

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in London, 8th] The Soviet Embassy in the UK today solemnly denied the British newspapers' reports that Stalin had died or was about to die. It is claimed that Mr. Stalin is still as healthy as usual.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] Today, all London newspapers published prominently the rumor that Soviet leader Stalin was seriously ill, but none of the newspapers could responsibly explain where Mr. Stalin fell ill and what disease he suffered from. However, Mr. Stalin has not participated in any official activities in Moscow or other locations for a considerable period of time. This fact has been noted and commented on by the newspapers. The "Sunday Chronicle" inquired by telephone to the Soviet Embassy last night, requesting confirmation or denial of the rumor of the death of the Soviet leader. The official who answered the phone said: He heard the rumor, but could not confirm it.

### Fifteen-Story Building Filled with the Smell of Burning Flesh, American Hotel Fire, Over 100 People Buried in the Flames

[Associated Press, Atlanta, Georgia, 7th] A fire broke out in the 15-story Winecoff Hotel on Peachtree Street in downtown Atlanta before dawn this morning. At least 120 of the 285 guests were buried in the flames. Men, women, and children screamed in terror, or were burned to death, or fell to their deaths, or died of suffocation. At least 100 people were injured. The fire started on the third or fourth floor and quickly spread upward via the escalators and elevators, trapping the guests on the upper floors in the flames. Most people stood on the balconies, unable to be rescued in time, and jumped down at risk. Some fell into the nets held by the fire department, but the nets were released due to the excessive force of the fall from a high place. Some residents closed their doors tightly to prevent smoke and fire from entering, and were spared from the disaster. Others used sheets to tie ropes and descended along the windows. A woman jumped from the balcony on the sixth floor, fell into a black alley and died. After the fire was extinguished, a visit inside revealed that the bodies above the third floor were scattered everywhere, the beds and furniture were burned, and the air was filled with the strong smell of burning flesh.

### Eisenhower Straightforwardly Denies Atomic Bombs Leaving the Country, Future War is "Super Blitzkrieg"

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] When Chief of Staff of the Army Eisenhower met with the press today, someone asked whether the recent statement by US representative to the UN Connally that Britain and Canada knew the secrets of the atomic bomb was true. After hesitating for a long time, Eisenhower replied that the United States had never transported atomic bombs or their materials to the United Kingdom or other countries. However, Eisenhower did not comment on whether Britain and Canada could build atomic bombs themselves. Eisenhower outlined the terror that a new war would bring to the world, saying that armed conflicts in the coming years would be a large-scale struggle for long-distance controlled weapons, which could destroy industrial centers in an instant. Before reaching this "super blitzkrieg era," it is the duty of the General Staff to prepare for any eventuality. The US General Staff has established special departments, headed by scientists, and all plans are conceived by them. If the United Nations does not eliminate the terror of this kind of hellish war, then all countries will have to evacuate and cover up all their industrial centers to avoid being destroyed by a single blow.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] American reporter Pearson reiterated today that some atomic bombs have indeed been transported to storage in northern Britain, but Britain does not have detonators, so they cannot be detonated. As for not transporting detonators to the UK, it may be to avoid the danger during air transport, or there may be other reasons.

### Explosions Continue at Jiangwan, Part of Stadium Collapses, Half of Entire Depot Destroyed, Losses Difficult to Estimate, Ten Transportation Soldiers Killed, Injured, or Missing, Commander Fu Reports to the Ministry of National Defense, Various Agencies Confer on Aftermath

[Report from this newspaper] The No. 1 Branch of the No. 2 Ordnance Depot of the Jiangwan Logistics Command Headquarters has been experiencing loud explosions day and night since the afternoon of the incident. Yesterday morning, the explosions could still be clearly heard in the city. Fu Wen, commander of the First Supply Zone, along with Deputy Chief of Staff Mao, went to the scene of the accident again at 9:30 a.m. yesterday to inspect. Mayor Wu Guobai and Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Wu also arrived for inspection one after another. Firefighters worked hard to rescue the situation. The explosions gradually subsided by the afternoon, as most of the shells in the depot had been detonated after a week of explosions. Only a small portion remained at the bottom layer, buried under bricks, wood, and miscellaneous items. When the temperature increased to a certain level, explosions continued intermittently. Firefighters, to avoid danger, dared not approach to clear the area. They could only use fire trucks to continuously pump water into the area to reduce the temperature and prevent the remaining ammunition from exploding due to heat.

### Patrol Around the Wall, Every Step a Fright

A reporter drove to the scene of the accident again at 2 p.m. yesterday to inspect. The weather was clear, the winter sun was warm, and everything near the warehouse had returned to normal. The cordon had also been completely removed. Except for the shattered glass windows, no serious damage was seen to the surrounding civilian houses. The barracks of the Second Air Force Squadron were a few dozen steps away from the explosion site. The roof was pierced by shrapnel in two places, and all the glass windows in the room were shattered. Many shrapnel also landed on the hygiene squadron of the Logistics Department on Guohua Road.

The warehouse

The location of the warehouse is the former municipal stadium, which is an oval building. The destroyed part is about half of the entire depot, which is the semi-circular building from the south entrance of Humin Road to the east gate of Guohua Road Stadium. It is reported that a huge amount of ammunition is still stored in the northern part of the depot. Fortunately, the wind was blowing southwest when the explosion started the day before yesterday, so it did not spread, which was a great stroke of luck. The main entrance of the destroyed area has become ruins and broken walls, which is extremely desolate. The surrounding wall on the right has collapsed, and the stands have also been broken and separated. There is a wire mesh barrier in front of the gate. From a distance, white smoke can still be seen rising from the rubble. Suddenly, another loud bang was heard, and another shell exploded. The reporter patrolled around the wall and heard two more explosions. However, the explosive force was not great, there was no fire, only thick smoke was seen. The reporter then found several pieces of shrapnel on the ground nearby, one of which was engraved with the words "Showa 15th Year" (1940).

### More Than Ten Escaped Wounded Soldiers, Strictly Investigated

The cause of the explosion, according to soldiers near the warehouse where the accident occurred, was that during the transportation of grenades, a warehouse soldier shouted "Dinner is ready!" at noon. The porters, hearing the call for dinner, were absent-minded and arbitrarily dumped the entire box of grenades they were carrying, which collided with the ground and caused a major disaster. As for the rumors that there were other complicated reasons for the explosion and that suspects had been captured, they could not be confirmed. The reporter repeatedly inquired from the Logistics Command Headquarters, which still stated that it was caused by the explosion of grenades. The more than ten warehouse soldiers who escaped at the time were personally interrogated by the commander of the First Supply Zone yesterday afternoon, and the interrogation was still continuing late into the night.

Mao Sen Ordered to Come to Shanghai to Investigate

The sound of the explosion could still be heard from time to time until 1 a.m. this morning. The military and police agencies in the city are currently discussing the aftermath. Commander Fu of the Supply Zone is continuing to investigate the truth of the incident and has reported the details to the Ministry of National Defense for instructions. It is reported that the Capital Garrison Command has sent Director Mao Sen to Shanghai last night to assist in the investigation.

It Will Not Be Possible to Enter for Five or Six Days

It is still impossible to estimate how much military ordnance has been destroyed in this incident. It will take at least five or six days before it can be entered, as there are fears that there may still be some unexploded bombs.

### Depot Chief Missing, His Wife Cries to Everyone

The number of casualties in the Jiangwan explosion case is rumored to be more than 130 warehouse soldiers whose whereabouts are unknown. According to reporters' confirmation from the Logistics Command Headquarters, this is inaccurate. It is said that there is a company of warehouse soldiers stationed in the depot, but because there is not enough dormitory space in the depot, some soldiers are billeted in another barracks a considerable distance from the explosion site. The incident occurred at noon, and two platoons of soldiers were already eating in the barracks at that time. Therefore, there was only one platoon of soldiers near the explosion site, and most of them had escaped because the shells exploded gradually. It has now been confirmed that one transportation soldier was killed, four were injured, and five were missing. In addition, several porters must have died. There were also several soldiers from nearby troops who were injured during the rescue or by stray bullets. As for the depot chief, Wang Renshan, his whereabouts are still unknown. It is feared that it will not be possible to determine whether he has been buried in the bomb crater until the explosion site has been cleared. However, his wife cried next to the stadium yesterday, saying that her husband must have died.

### Huddling in the Northwest Wind: A Stray Child is Rescued - The Relief Center for Child Refugees and the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Child Welfare Division Rescue Over 200 During Shanghai's First Cold Snap

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] As the first cold snap hit Shanghai, Zhou Zuwang, the director of the Relief Center for Child Refugees, and the head of the Child Welfare Division of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Shanghai branch, drove a large truck out into the desolate streets and alleys after midnight to collect stray children huddling in the northwest wind.

Under bridges, at the foot of walls, beside cars, in alleyways, in garbage cans... these were their shelters. Wrapped in a straw mat, they struggled against the bitter wind all night! Unable to endure it, they would simply die silently, and no one would know.

Over five nights, people rescued more than two hundred children (not including those found already lifeless and sent to the Pushan Villa). These many unfortunate children, upon hearing that they could find shelter from the wind and rain in the Relief Center, knelt and repeatedly kowtowed in gratitude.

Most of the children were barely alive when they were brought to the Relief Center. They had to be completely doused with hot water to gradually revive. Then, they were given something to eat, a bath, their hair was shaved, and they were dressed in the center's uniform. Immediately, they became tidy, clean, energetic, smiling children!

A month ago, when the child refugees who had been trained at the center paraded and presented a flag to the city government, Mayor Wu repeatedly said to them with tears in his eyes: "The nation has failed you! The nation has failed you!" After Mrs. Cripps visited the Relief Center, she was deeply moved and immediately promised to raise funds in England for a school and a factory for them!

What should we do? The number of over two hundred is truly too small. When the second cold snap hits Shanghai, how many innocent children will freeze to death on the streets! (The picture shows many stray children after being rescued.)

### Bao Huaguo Arrives in Shanghai on Official Business to Discuss Industrial and Mining Inspection Work

Bao Huaguo, Director of the Industrial and Mining Inspection Department of the Accounting and Statistics Department, arrived in Shanghai on official business. This reporter specifically inquired about the situation of the Shanghai branch. I was told that the Shanghai branch has already been preparing an office location, which has been fixed at 308 Wuchang Road, and will actively promote the work after the funding is approved. When asked how the future inspectors will be trained, it was said that the training of inspectors is also in the plan. It is intended to recruit graduates from civil engineering or mechanical engineering and other departments of universities at home and abroad after the funding is approved, and train them to take on this task. The reporter also asked what impact the implementation of industrial and mining inspections would have on industry. It was said that industrial and mining inspections are active and are pre-emptive work, not passive preventive work. This work is still in its infancy in our country, and all countries in Europe and the United States have this system.

### The Newspaper Staff Association Holds a Farewell Dinner for Outgoing and Incoming Directors and Supervisors

### Improvement of Overseas Chinese Treatment after the Tanjong Malim Incident

Chen Derong, consultant to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, recently returned to Shanghai from Kuala Lumpur. According to reports, since the Tanjong Malim massacre, the British side has improved the treatment of local overseas Chinese. In addition, the Communist Party had organized the so-called "Kuala Lumpur Communist Party Central Local Committee" in the area and carried out extensive activities. It is reported that the British side has expressed strong opposition to this name and has recently changed it to the "Office" organization, but the British side is still paying close attention to its various activities.

### Gunfire on Zhongzheng East Road: Police Fight with Bandits in Huangpu District - Gang of Thieves Rob Cotton Weaving Factory at Gunpoint - Employee Returning Home Suspects Something and Reports to Police, Who Surround the Factory - Stolen Goods Recovered, Three Thieves Escape, Two Thieves Captured

[Report from This Newspaper] At about 6:50 p.m. yesterday, five thieves broke into the Xinsheng Cotton Weaving Factory at 312 Zhongzheng East Road through the back door. One was carrying a grenade, one had a semi-automatic weapon, and one held a pistol. Two of them were guarding the back door, while the other three broke into the accounting room, threatening with guns. They first snatched a gold ring from the accountant's hand, and then found 1.2 million legal currency on the accounting table, which they placed in a travel bag and handed to a lookout thief. As the other thieves were preparing to go upstairs to loot other items, an employee of the factory returned from outside. As soon as he reached the alley at the back door, he saw two people lingering near the door. Realizing that they were not good people, he went out and reported to the Huangpu Branch across the street. After receiving the report, Deputy Chief Du Wang personally led the section chief Li Yinmin and all the plainclothes police officers to rush to surround the area, arresting the two thieves guarding the back door and recovering the stolen goods. The three thieves in the house heard the police arriving and climbed onto the roof. Fearing that the police would follow and arrest them, they fired fifteen shots first. The police also returned five shots. After a standoff of about ten minutes, the three thieves fled west. The thieves crossed the roofs to the sun deck on the upper floor of 32 Detai & Co., and when they climbed onto the stove room, they were detained by the old steward Zhang Rijin. Who knew that the thief was extremely cunning and falsely claimed to be a police officer arresting thieves. Zhang saw that his clothes were neat and tidy and believed him to be true, so he released him. The thief then left calmly. The two thieves who were arrested were taken to the police station for interrogation. According to their confessions, they were Zhang Shaochuan and Yuan Rong. Zhang had previously robbed the Freedom Army three times and had been detained in the branch, with a record on file. The police are currently tracking down the three accomplices who escaped.

### Five U.S. Congressmen Left Shanghai Yesterday - They Greatly Praised "Meng Meinu" After Watching It

Isaac, Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, and House Representatives Herley and Mansfield, arrived in Shanghai from Beiping on the afternoon of the 6th to inspect U.S. military cemeteries in the Pacific. Yesterday morning, they left Shanghai to go to Iwo Jima. The night before their departure, Mayor Wu and Admiral Kirk accompanied them to the Nanjing Grand Theater to watch the musical drama "Meng Jiangnu." The stage and audience were extremely excited, and the performance that night was particularly brilliant. The five Congressmen praised it highly. It is reported that Huang Renlin, the director of the Lizi Society, said that Meng Jiangnu intended to perform in the United States, and they unanimously expressed their welcome. At the end of the entire play, the five Congressmen and Admiral Kirk, Mayor Wu, and others happily left.

### Relief Supplies Transported to Communist-Controlled Areas - Wanmin Ship Left Shanghai Yesterday

Wang Shiliang, director of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Yantai Office, returned to Shanghai from Yantai in late last month to plan the third shipment of relief supplies to Yantai. Yesterday morning, the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's transport ship Wanmin left Shanghai for Yantai, carrying 1,500 tons of supplies to be used for relief in the Communist-controlled areas. The fourth shipment of supplies will also be carried out within this week.

### Conversion of Pedicabs to Three-Wheelers - Extension Granted for Uncompleted Conversions

Five Items Approved by the City Government

The city's Pedicab Business Association previously petitioned the city government because the conversion of pedicabs to single-seat three-wheelers that were eliminated this year was rushed and the frame sizes did not meet the regulations. It is now known that the city government has responded to the five requests previously made by the industry one by one as follows:

(1) Regarding the request for an extension of the revocation of the licenses of the eliminated pedicabs due to insufficient materials and equipment for the conversion of vehicles, out of consideration for compassion, an appropriate extension will be granted if the assembly has already started but is not completed. This does not mean that an extension is granted to all converted vehicles in general. (2) The center point of the three-wheeler must still use a double center. The government will not allow any flexibility in this regard for the sake of driving safety. (3) The 64-inch maximum length of the frame center refers to the already-made frame. The existing frames that exceed 60 inches but do not exceed 64 inches will be allowed if they have been verified by the Public Works Bureau. Those that have not been made must be manufactured according to the specified dimensions. If there are indeed difficulties, the manufacturers can always contact the Public Works Bureau for consultation. (4) Regarding the guarantee that no new vehicle licenses will be issued, the city's Public Works Bureau had already issued a notice on July 5 to stop the registration of new three-wheelers, so there is no need to discuss it. (5) Regarding the crackdown on unlicensed vehicles, it is the police局's regular job to investigate and deal with unlicensed vehicles, and the局has already been cracking down on them at any time.

### Repair Damaged Roads - Increase Traffic Routes - Active Planning - Prosperity in Nanshi

Regarding the prosperity of Nanshi and the restoration of the pre-war city appearance, the Public Utilities Bureau and the Public Works Bureau have discussed and formulated detailed measures. It is reported that in addition to the Public Works Bureau actively repairing the damaged roads in Nanshi, the Public Utilities Bureau will increase traffic routes, transportation, and street lights in Nanshi. At present, there are few buses on Zhonghua Road and the Republic of China Road Ring Road, and passengers are extremely crowded. The bureau is now planning to increase the number of vehicles, which will be implemented after the vehicles of the Materials Supply Bureau arrive. Secondly, the section from Jiangbian Brick Guji Ferry to Nanyang Bridge, passing through the bustling areas of Xiejiao Tangjia Fuxing East Road, etc., will be added to the bus service. Recently, the Outer Nanshi Road is being repaired by the Public Works Bureau, and once it is repaired, the Public Utilities Bureau also intends to purchase more buses to run on the route. It is currently planned to start from the Dongchang Road Ferry Terminal, go south through Nanmatou, pass Guohuo Road, turn north through Chezhan Road, and enter Zhonghua Road to Nanyang Bridge. In addition, it is planned to install street lights in all streets of Nanshi to restore the pre-war situation.

### Civil Servants Unable to Make Winter Clothes - Most Clothing Stores are in a Slump

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Not long after winter began, there have already been two cold snaps in Shanghai. According to the observatory's forecast, there will be a third cold snap in the next few days, and this one will last longer than the previous two. This news feels like an unspeakable threat to people who don't have winter clothes, and they are worrying about how to get through these cold days. Most small civil servants are locked in their offices all day, and in addition to planning how to eat a bowl of rice a day, they also have to arrange a few winter clothes for their families to keep out the cold. Looking at the published cost-of-living index, clothing is still at the top. It costs more than 200,000 yuan to make even the most ordinary woolen coat. Some people think they can buy a used piece of clothing at a second-hand store or buy an American ready-made item at a joint market and alter it. However, the labor is too expensive, and the labor cost of altering a used piece of clothing is more than the price of the original clothing, so people scold the owners of clothing stores in private.

But the owners of clothing stores complain a lot, saying that it is already very difficult to keep a store open, especially in this sluggish year. The money they earn includes endless hardships and tears. This year's business is more sluggish than before the war. The cost of domestic raw materials is high and the quality is poor, there are few sources of foreign goods, and the wages of tailors increase at any time. In addition to what the boss should earn, they also have to bear the cost of food and salaries for the employees and all necessary operating expenses, so many clothing stores have already dismissed half of their staff, feeling that they have no business to do after eating. There are also some who have to lower their wages to accommodate customers, and after receiving business, apprentices are used to replace the positions of senior tailors, resulting in the customers' clothes being ruined, so they have to redo them or refund the deposit.

What makes the boss most headache and have to perfunctorily deal with is the fact that some "superiors" in the territory who are related to the business often unreasonably demand price reductions, at least 15% off. The boss really doesn't want to, but still has to say "please help." This is really a bitter pill to swallow, an unspeakable pain.

### Support Labor Organizations - Promote Labor-Management Coordination - Minister Gu Discusses Labor Policy

Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang arrived in Shanghai yesterday to attend the National Seafarers' Congress. He also hosted a banquet for all the seafarers' representatives at 6 p.m. yesterday, inviting Special Commissioner Yang, Secretary-General Xie, and others to accompany him. After the banquet, he met with reporters and said: "Our current task should be to support labor organizations, improve the lives of workers, raise the status of workers, promote labor-management coordination, and improve labor efficiency. Today's Chinese workers should strive to consolidate national unity and maintain production." When asked about his opinion on the request of workers in various factories in the city for year-end bonuses, Gu said: "Regarding the issue of year-end bonuses, although there was this practice in the past, the difficulties faced by various manufacturers are also a fact. I have discussed this with Mayor Wu, and the city government will formulate a method to decide separately. In short, labor and management must understand and sympathize with each other."

### The Leather Industry is Under Heavy Pressure - Most are in a State of Semi-Stagnation - Twenty-Six Companies Bankrupt, Thousands of Workers Unemployed

According to people in the leather goods manufacturing industry: There are more than 350 small and medium-sized leather goods manufacturing factories in Shanghai. Last month, 26 of them went bankrupt due to the pressure of high-interest loans and were unable to support themselves. As the end of the year approaches, it is expected that a small half of the leather goods factories will not be able to get through it safely. The reasons are: (1) Plastic leather goods are dumped on the market and are filled with the market. Because of their cheap prices and good quality, domestic leather goods cannot compete with them. (2) High-interest loans have reached 30%, increasing production costs, and the products are not sold, resulting in sluggish turnover. (3) Wages are increasing, and workers' meals are rising with prices. (4) Transportation from other places is difficult, and the original sales areas before the war cannot be unblocked, and the purchasing power of the local area is weak. It is reported that most of the leather goods manufacturing factories are currently in a state of semi-stagnation, with only a dozen workers making large leather suitcases to maintain the situation. As for small leather goods, the production rate is high and the supply exceeds the demand, so thousands of workers have been suspended. At this time of winter, they all have the risk of not being able to keep warm and fed.

### Shanghai Nursery to Expand

The Shanghai Nursery at 114 Zhongzheng South Second Road has a beautiful environment and good facilities, and pays great attention to children's nutrition and physical and mental education. Recently, in response to the demands of working women from all walks of life, the nursery plans to expand its site and will recruit day and night childcare from next month.

### Two Car Accidents Injure Pedestrians

[Report from This Newspaper] At 6:20 p.m. yesterday, in front of the Great New Company on Nanjing Road, a young woman named Xiong Zhuang was hit in the foot by car number 50763. The driver of the accident, Qu Pincheng, was taken to the police station by the traffic police for questioning. At 7 p.m., a bus (car number 217) at the intersection of Republic of China Road and Fangbang Road injured Zhou Taoren (20 years old, from Zhenjiang, a tailor) due to careless driving.

### Shanghai's Fur Trade

The fur production areas are in the north, with Tianjin and Beijing as the central hubs for the fur trade. Many businesses in Shanghai also engage in the fur trade, commonly known as fur trading companies. Currently, companies like "Tian Fa Xiang" and "Da Ji Cheng" are considered major players, mostly concentrated around Henan Road. The number of fur stores, large and small, has dwindled to just eleven, a two-thirds decrease compared to pre-war times. Additionally, there are fur businesses that wholesale grain. Large fashion stores like "Hong Xiang" also sell fur items, but these are primarily ready-made coats. As for the fur shops operated by many foreign merchants, they are mainly located along Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Avenue Joffre, catering primarily to foreign customers.

Fur is categorized into two groups based on its origin: "West Pass" and "North Pass." West Pass furs come from the Shaanxi and Gansu regions, while North Pass furs come from the Northeast and the Jehol, Chahar, and northern Hebei areas, with Zhangjiakou serving as their distribution center. All furs in Shanghai are brought in by fur merchants. These traveling fur merchants are called "fur guests" and act as intermediaries between the fur companies and the production areas. Every year, as the autumn winds begin, they purchase furs in the production areas and set off south in groups. By the time they arrive in Jiangnan, the autumn season is not yet deep, and the fur business is just starting to pick up. Upon arriving in Shanghai, the fur guests immediately seek out their regular customers, lodging with fur companies. The fur companies generally host them with banquets. After the goods arrive by cart, a date is set to gather the heads of all the fur companies to view the samples and determine the price levels. Once the goods are sold, they prepare to return north as the spring breeze blows. When they depart, they obtain advance payments from the fur companies, often amounting to tens of thousands. They use this money to purchase goods in the production areas, so their transportation relies entirely on trust.

The fur trade is a seasonal business. The operating period is only three months in the winter. The success or failure of the entire year's business depends on these three months. Those who want to add new fur garments usually prepare before the Lunar New Year. Once the New Year is over, no matter how chilling the late spring, few people inquire about furs. Some also engage in selling summer cloth fans and other items during the summer. Since the War of Resistance, fur supplies have been disrupted. Since the victory, the war in Zhangjiakou has prevented the flow of goods. Coupled with the sluggish market, how many people can afford new fur coats costing hundreds of thousands or even millions?

Currently, most furs are made into women's coats, with men's long robes accounting for less than one-tenth. The most popular are badger fur, cat fur, white-fronted muskrat, and sheepskin. Men's robes are mostly made of white sheepskin, gray squirrel, and fox fur, with prices ranging from 200,000 to over 1 million. More expensive yellow weasel fur, black fox, gray-backed squirrel, and leopard skin are all priced at over 1 to 2 million, and their sales are very limited. As for rare sable, everyone treats it as an antique, buying and selling it at prices reaching tens of millions.

### Random Notes on Fur

— Special Article from This Newspaper

The Siberian cold wave has swept into Shanghai. In the cold northwest wind, winter fur garments have become the seasonal attire. Women don fox or gray-backed squirrel coats, fully displaying their noble status. But how would they know the hardships of the hunters patrolling the ice and snow? It must be known that a coat worth a thousand pieces of gold cannot be made from the fur of a single fox!

People in the hunting and fishing era knew that animal skins were excellent for keeping warm. As society evolved, fur clothing became the exclusive domain of the nobility. In the past imperial era, fur coats could not be worn casually. There was a saying: "First-rank officials wear black fox, second-rank officials wear sable, third- and fourth-rank officials wear black otter." People of a certain class were only allowed to wear a certain type of fur. Wearing something above one's rank was not only ridiculed by society but also forbidden by law. However, after the influence of Western fashion spread eastward, more men began to wear Western suits, or even silk and cotton robes if not wearing Western suits. Women disliked fur coats for being too bulky, obscuring their slender figures, and disliked wearing them even more. Fur clothing, once considered a luxurious garment, was abandoned by everyone. It was not until recent years, when women began to wear fur coats, that fur clothing, favored by beauties, slightly recovered its former status.

Because fur clothing has been regarded as a treasure among clothes throughout the ages (pictured is a Persian lamb coat popular in the United States and Britain), those engaged in the fur trade have always made a threefold profit. During the years when no one wore fur coats, the fur trade plummeted. In the past, valuable fur items were treasured as heirlooms, but now they are considered a joke. Fortunately, women's fur coats are popular, so even though they may lose in one area, they gain in another, but it is still not as prosperous as in its heyday. To remedy the crisis, the focus should be on exports.

### Large Exports of Sheepskin, Nearly Ten Million Pieces Sold Overseas Annually

China is one of the world's sheep-raising countries, and sheepskin is a major export. Nearly ten million pieces are sold overseas each year, providing a small contribution to balancing international payments. The Northeast and Mongolia are vast plains, natural pastures with a large number of cattle and sheep. Sichuan Province in the south has a particularly rich output. This sheepskin is concentrated in Zhangjiakou and Hankou, and exported from Tianjin and Shanghai.

The production process of sheepskin is divided into four steps: (1) slaughtering, (2) skinning, (3) trimming, and (4) drying. Sheep are usually killed by hitting their heads with an iron hammer to make them lose consciousness, then cutting their throats to release the blood. Some also tie the sheep to a wooden board and kill them, called "tied slaughter," which easily contaminates the fur, resulting in inferior boards. In Sichuan and Shaanxi, there is a method of killing running sheep. The slaughterer rides on the sheep's back, uses his hand to lift the sheep's head, stabs its throat with a knife, then releases it. The sheep runs and jumps, blood flowing all over the ground, until it is exhausted and dies, a very tragic scene.

Once the sheep is killed, it must be skinned. The skill of skinning varies greatly, significantly affecting the quality of the leather. Purely using a knife to skin often damages the leather. The skinning method in Neijiang and Chengdu is the most ingenious. One side is massaged with fists, while the other side is pulled with hands, using as little force as possible. When skinning, avoid separating the head from the body, and the neck should not be narrower than five centimeters, because the United States welcomes whole sheepskins.

The peeled sheepskin still needs to be trimmed before drying. All the fat, meat layer, mud, ash, etc., remaining on the leather must be removed. The skin on the knees should be completely removed, and the protruding area on the head should be minimized and also trimmed. When trimming, do not damage the leather or leave knife marks on the skin. Also, do not wash with water. Washing with water will remove the oily luster, and the fur will become stiff and astringent, becoming a "water-soaked board."

Sheepskin is dried, partly by wind and partly by sunlight, to perfect the fur. Generally, companies that buy sheepskin have "drying grounds." When it rains, they place the skins in "air-drying yards." Some also bake the skins with fire because they are in a hurry to deliver the goods, called "fire pit boards." Generally, sheepskin slaughtered and skinned in the production area is dried and transported to the distribution center, where it is trimmed and re-dried to ensure that the leather meets export standards.

In the Jiaxing, Wuxing, Changxing, and Pinghu areas of Zhejiang, a small lambskin is produced, and the annual export volume is also not small. Farmers in the area generally raise two or three sheep. Pregnant ewes are sold when they are full-term, or lambs are sold after the ewes give birth, which is also one of the farmers' side businesses. Small lambskin is divided into two types: fetal and belly-peeled. The former is skinned from newborn lambs, while the latter involves killing pregnant ewes, taking out the fetal lambs, and skinning them, which is extremely cruel. Slaughtering fetal lambs is prohibited, but merchants are driven by profit and disregard the restrictions. Those who prohibit do so, while those who kill do so regardless.

Exported sheepskin is all raw hide. The largest market is the United States, but there are also sales in the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, and India. Prices vary depending on the thickness of the base, the length of the fur tips, and the brightness of the color. Currently, there are more than ten companies in Shanghai engaged in sheepskin exports. From January to September this year, 1,106,279 sheepskins were exported in nine months, worth a total of 2,956,710,000 legal currency.

### Three Movements of Fur Clothing: Hunting, Breeding, Production

Hunting is the first step in obtaining fur. Farmers in the northwest and northeast valleys engage in hunting as a side business. Every year, when the autumn is high and the horses are fat, it is the time for hunting. Hunters carry hunting dogs and go into the mountains in groups. They first burn dry grass to deprive the wild animals of hiding places, and then surround and attack them. Experienced hunters have ample knowledge of animals. They know which kind of wild animals lurk in which area, which kind of wild animals come out at what time, and they can also observe the hoof prints left on the soil to know the whereabouts of the wild animals. They are resolute and brave, and very careful, spending the cold winter in deep mountains and forests. Hunters mostly shoot animals with earth guns, but they also use other methods depending on the habits of the animals. For example, they set nets to catch gray squirrels, and one net can catch hundreds of them. Hunting is supposed to have time and area regulations, and one should not be greedy. However, Chinese hunters do not pay attention to this, so the animals are caught less and less. Those that have not grown up have small skins and short fur, and the quality is reduced. Some rare wild animals are hunted indiscriminately, even to the point of extinction. Earth gun shooting is more likely to damage the quality of the fur, so there are so-called "inferior boards." All of this should be noted.

Wild animals are difficult to catch, and their reproduction is left to nature. They cannot be hunted wantonly, so joyful enclosures for artificial breeding have been established. However, wild animals raised in cages not only cannot reproduce, but their fur color and luster are also not as good as those grown naturally. Therefore, large pastures must be used, imitating the layout of the wilderness and mountains for raising them, which is no different from the natural environment. Recently, after scientific improvement, there are also several animals that can be raised in cages. Therefore, after the prevalence of artificial breeding methods, the output of fur from many precious animals can be greatly increased. The breeding of fur animals began with rabbit farming in Germany. Rabbits are domestic animals and are easier to raise. The United States was the first to artificially breed wild animals. Alaska was originally a good fur-producing area. Because fur imports increased day by day, farms were established there to try to raise mink, and the output increased greatly in a few years. Mink fur was originally yellow-brown. The genetic principle was changed, and artificial mating was used, so new species were produced. Among them, pure white and dark blue are more popular in the market.

The vast forests of Siberia are full of wild animal tracks. Russian fur has long been famous in Europe. The glossy gray squirrel and the light and warm sable are all treasured by the world. After the success of artificial animal breeding in the United States, the Soviet Union followed suit. In various parts of Siberia, all areas suitable for animal life have been turned into animal breeding gardens, either capturing young animals and raising them to help them grow, or using artificial methods to breed them. Especially on the coast near the Arctic Ocean, farms are set up to raise sea dogs, which can compete with the mink of Alaska. Looking at other countries, they are becoming more and more advanced, while Chinese hunters only know how to catch animals and do not know how to protect the source of wealth. Once the wild animals disappear, where will they get their fur? This is really a short-sighted strategy of killing the chicken to get the eggs.

Hunters obtain wild animals, peel off their skins, and carry them to the market for sale. In the Zhangjiakou and Baotou areas, teams of camels and carts are loaded with smelly animal skins, all obtained by the hard work of the hunters. There are many fur workshops there that make fur goods to supply the fur merchants from the mainland. The scale of the fur workshops is very small, and everything is made by hand. After buying the raw hides, they first scrape off the rotten meat attached to the inside of the leather, and then treat it with saltpeter and tidy it up, which is considered complete. The smell of raw hides and saltpeter mixed in the fur workshop is very irritating. It is said that workers in fur workshops rarely live past the age of fifty, because the foul smell destroys their lives. A fur coat cannot be made from a single animal skin. This cutting and matching work is not an easy task. The density of the fur, the length of the fur tips, and the color and luster must be very similar before they can be matched into a fur coat. At the same time, the size and number of pieces will affect the price. The completion of a fur coat really takes a lot of effort, which is something that people who wear fur coats would not think of.

The traditional method of leather making easily damages the color and luster of the fur. In the past, some of the leather goods exported by China were refined overseas and re-imported into China. In one turn of the hand, the profits were unknown. Now, after the development of artificial breeding in the United States, the export of raw hides has decreased, and the import of refined fur has increased, further causing the industry to plummet. I don't know how to save this decline in the future?

### Various Kinds of Fur Clothing

China is worthy of being a country with vast land and abundant resources. Even the types of fur clothing, from the tigers and leopards of the tropics to the sables and foxes of the frigid zone, have products. When you choose to buy fur, the shop assistants will tell you like a family treasure.

Sable fur is a treasure among fur goods. In the past, not only could sable fur coats not be worn casually, but even a sable fur hat was a very precious thing given by the emperor. It is said that wearing a sable fur coat and standing in the wind and snow is warmer than being indoors, which is why it is so precious. Sable is a very small carnivorous animal, two feet and five inches long, with short ears and a pointed snout, shaped like a rat, with yellow-black fur with purple, and pure white ones called silver sable, and black ones called purple sable. It is produced in the Dunhua and Yanji areas of eastern Liaoning, and in the Mudanling and Sanxing areas, and the ones produced in the Harba Ridge are the best. It lives in the forest during the day and comes out at night to find black rats and other animals to eat. Hunters stand in the forest, hold their breath and shoot it quietly. The fur of one sable is not even a foot square. It takes sixty sables to make a fur coat, which is so difficult to obtain. A sable fur coat currently costs six or seven million.

Fox Fur

Fox fur is also a top-grade product. Its ability to keep out the cold and warm the body is slightly inferior to sable, but its lightness and softness are similar to sable. Foxes are produced in the north and are relatively common animals, three or four feet long, shaped like dogs but slightly thinner, with reddish-yellow fur. They are cunning and suspicious, live in holes in the forest, and hide during the day and come out at night. They are found in the Sanxing area of Jilin in the northeast and the Kulun area of Mongolia. There are many varieties, and the prices vary greatly. The most popular on the market is the black fox, which is the most precious, with pure black fur, followed by yellow fox and white fox, which are also top-grade products. The former has thicker fur tips, yellow and bright color, and the latter has pure white fur, fine, soft and shiny. Other popular ones include red fox, black otter fox, and the Geshan fox south of the Great Wall, and the Xilu fox of Shaanxi and Gansu. The lowest quality is the grass fox, produced in the Wenzhou and Taizhou areas of Zhejiang. The price of a fox fur coat ranges from two or three million for the expensive ones to forty or fifty thousand for the grass fox. The fur of the fox armpit is white and is collected to make a fur coat, which is the lightest and warmest, so it is also a famous product. History says that Lord Mengchang had a white fox fur coat worth a thousand pieces of gold, which shows how precious it was.

Rat Fur

Rat fur is also a top-grade fur, no less than fox fur. Rats are common animals, but rats whose fur can be made into fur coats are not the ones we usually see. The "Shuowen" says: "The ... rat comes from the Dingling Hu, and its fur can be made into a fur coat." This is the commonly known gray squirrel, which is produced in the fields of Heilongjiang and Jilin, and the ones produced near the Xing'an Mountains and Nenjiang are even better. The fur is thick, blackish-blue, and the abdomen is white. Making fur coats with it results in a black background with white spots. Today, women make coats, disliking the white spots, and only take the back, called the gray back, which is more expensive than the ones made from the whole sheet. A gray back coat currently costs around three million.

There is also a silver rat, whose fur is pure white, and its fur can also be made into fur coats. Silver rats are produced in Outer Mongolia and Siberia, and are slightly larger than gray squirrels, with dense fur that is white and shiny. The sales of silver rats are not as popular as gray squirrels. In the past, they were only used as decorations on clothes - called "wind vents". Western women, however, like silver rats and like to use silver rats to make wedding dresses, taking their purity. Most of the rabbits on the market are made of silver rats, but the fur color is not as good.

Currently, a white-fronted muskrat is popular on the market. It is also a type of rat fur produced in the Jiang, Zhe, Wan, and Gan areas, with gray color and hairy fur, with a white fur bottom, more than one foot long. In the past, it was sold exclusively to the United Kingdom and the United States for making women's coats. In recent years, many domestic women have also used it, and a coat costs from hundreds of thousands to more than one million.

Sheepskin

Sheepskin should be listed as a second-class product in fur goods. In fact, the fur color and quality of sheepskin vary greatly, and the prices are also very different. Sheepskin is mainly made of sheep, and lambskin is light and tender, so it is better. In the Zhehu area, fetal sheep are slaughtered to obtain their skins, which is a side business for farmers. The ones produced in the Shaanxi and Gansu areas are black fur, called black purple lamb, and their price is even more expensive. The provinces of Yu, Lu, Yan, and Jin like to slaughter newborn lambs, called slippery skins, which are used exclusively for making mattress pads, and the price is not cheap.

Sheep are mostly slaughtered in winter, taking their long fur and velvet. The best quality is called Nan skin, with curly hair about three inches long, which is smooth when turned over, shiny, soft and light. The ones produced in the Gansu, Shaanxi, Qing, and Ning areas are the best. A Nan skin robe is worth two or three hundred thousand. There is also a type called Chongtan, whose fur is thick and has no bottom velvet, so it is second to Nan skin.

Qing sheep are produced in Gansu, with white fur and greenish roots, fine, long and soft. Pearl skin is sheepskin with short and curly fur, with thick velvet, named for its pearl-like appearance, and is also produced in the Shaanxi and Gansu areas. Both are top-grade products of sheepskin.

Yellow Weasel Skin

Yellow weasel skin is produced in various parts of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. After winter, farmers catch and slaughter them. The fur is yellow. The ones produced in Jiangxi Province are the deepest, and the ones produced in Shandong Province are the lightest. The male ones have abundant fur and thin leather, and the female ones have thick leather and fine fur tips. In the past, they were exported to foreign countries in large numbers every year. During the war, foreign sales were cut off, and the Tianjin and Shanghai leather factories carried out self-nitrification and self-dyeing, making leather coats, which were very popular with women.

Lynx Skin

Lynx skin is also extremely precious. A coat costs two million. The Lynx is an aquatic animal, shaped like a civet cat, with long fur all over its body, light gray on the back, and white on the chest and abdomen, interspersed with black round spots, forming a grape shape. Produced in Tibet and the northeast, the ones produced in Mongolia are the best, the ones produced in the northeast are slightly yellow, so the quality is slightly lower, and the ones produced in Tibet have fine fur and no strength, even less. The finished fur has shoulders. There are separate parts for the thighs and legs. There are also those made by mixing several whole lynxes, inlaid with the front and back sleeves into six strips, called "six ridge spines". The armpits are made of the skin of the chest and abdomen and are the most valuable.

Otter

Otters are shaped like weasels, more than three feet long, with flat heads, large eyes, short limbs, and webbed feet. They live in holes in the water and eat fish. The whole body is covered with fine, long hair. In summer, it is black, and in winter, it is slightly red. Its skin can also be made into a fur coat. There are river otters, Guan otters, and Tibetan otters. River otters are produced in Xiang, Shu, Yunnan, and Guizhou. The river otters in Baoqing, Hunan are the best. Guan otters are produced in the northeast, with firm fur and very short tips. Tibetan otters refer to products from Tibet, with extremely thick hair, six or seven minutes long, and are the top grade of otter skin.

Elk

Elk is a type of wild dog, with long fur and thick velvet, brownish-black, and is a good product for keeping out the cold. Many are produced in the northeast, as well as Yuqian, Changhua in Zhejiang, and Liyang and Jintan in Jiangsu. There are also sales in the UK and the US.

Tiger, Leopard and Rabbit Skin

The skin of tigers and leopards is a decorative item in the beds and sofas of wealthy families, and some are used to make clothes. Tigers and leopards are produced in mountainous areas. The Jiangda Mountains and Mudanling in the northeast, and the provinces of Dian, Qian, Chuan, and Kang in the southwest are all producing areas. However, they are difficult to catch, so the output is very small. The market is often filled with mountain cat skin, which is lighter in color, but the black spots are quite similar.

Rabbit skin is divided into domestic rabbits and wild rabbits. The wild rabbits produced in the northeast are the best, with slightly ... fur, about three inches long, extremely soft, and the ones produced in Nenjiang are even better. There are also wild rabbits in the lakes and marshes of Jiang, Zhe, and Wan, with fur that is reed-colored, and are only sold overseas for making hats, and rarely for making fur coats. Domestic rabbits take those with pure white fur and are special products of Sichuan. The output of other provinces is very small and is mainly for export, with an annual export of about 2 million sheets.

### Year-End Approaching, Manufacturers' Crisis Deepening, Eagerly Hoping for Government Relief

[Reported by This Newspaper] Recently, due to the oppression of high-interest loans and the dumping of foreign goods, general industry and commerce have been severely affected. Expenditures have increased, and business has been sluggish. Rumors of bankruptcy and liquidation are often heard. As the year-end approaches, the crisis deepens. This reporter specially visited a prominent leader of the industrial and commercial circles in this city. According to him, the difficulties faced by industry and commerce in this city are well-known facts. Since the municipal chamber of commerce sent representatives to Beijing in July to petition, the suffering they have endured has been exposed to society, openly appealing for help. Later, the municipal council also sent a petition delegation to Beijing. At the beginning of last month, the National Federation of Commerce and Industry held a meeting in Beijing, with more concrete demands. As far as I know, except for a few cotton yarn weaving factories, most manufacturers in Shanghai are struggling to maintain operations. The current precarious situation is only the beginning. If the government does not provide practical assistance before the New Year, I am afraid that most of them will be stranded. It is estimated that there are 300,000 workers in the factories of this city. In addition to the workers in state-owned and private yarn factories, who account for one-third, if other factories close down, a large number of workers will immediately suffer unemployment, which will have a significant impact on social stability. Recalling a few months ago, only a few thousand laid-off workers rioted in the municipal government due to lack of work. This time, the unemployment of stallholders has also caused a huge wave. If a large number of workers are unemployed at the end of the year, the public will be agitated, and the order of Shanghai will be even more unimaginable. In addition, the debt settlement problem after the closure of factories is also a major social event. Currently, most manufacturers rely on high-interest loans to maintain their operations. This funding does not come from banks but is borrowed from all levels of society. If widespread stagnation occurs, it will cause a chain reaction, involving a wide range of people. Therefore, for the sake of social stability, I deeply feel that industry and commerce cannot be allowed to collapse. I hope that the government can plan countermeasures as soon as possible and quickly release low-interest loans to allow them to turn around and avoid bankruptcy, so that social stability can be preserved.

### Ten Reasons for the Rise in Gold Prices Analyzed by an Observer

[Reported by This Newspaper] Gold prices have been rising steadily, with new highs seen every day. According to an analysis by an observer, the reasons are nothing more than the following ten points. (1) Recently, gold prices in various regions have been trending strongly. Taking Hong Kong gold prices as an example, if calculated at the current Hong Kong exchange rate, it is equivalent to 3.45 million. Gold prices in Tianjin, for example, have also reached 3.2 million. (2) After foreign merchants transport goods to Shanghai for sale, most of them like to use the proceeds to purchase gold and return to their hometown. (3) The situation is unstable, and it is rumored that all taxes and donations in the "liberated areas" of the Communist army must be paid in gold. (4) The rumor that foreign exchange will be adjusted again is still brewing. (5) In the past, holders of large amounts of US dollars, now that the revised import trade regulations have been promulgated, US dollars may lose their effectiveness, so they are rushing to exchange dollars for gold. (6) The trend of loan interest rates has been gradually unstable recently due to the impact of the sluggish economy. And the degree to which gold prices have risen is no less than the interest earned, so they are withdrawing loans and buying gold to protect themselves. (7) The trend of currency is still inflation. (8) The amount of gold sold by the Central Bank is not large, so it has failed to control the gold market. (9) The stock market has been consolidating for a long time and is lifeless, so the funds in the stock market have also turned to gold. (10) Small money houses have also started to engage in gold trading, and it is not uncommon for them to trade fifty or one hundred bars at a time. Moreover, they have started gold futures trading, and general speculators are flocking to it.

### Lack of Coal Briquette Raw Materials, Mud Coal Briquettes Revived

During the enemy-puppet period, due to the interruption of coal dust supply, coal merchants in this city mixed mud into coal dust to make coal briquettes and sold them indiscriminately in the market. It is recently learned that due to the sudden increase in coal briquette prices and the shortage of coal dust, these coal briquettes containing a large amount of mud have reappeared on the market. Some coal merchants are taking the opportunity to repeat the old tune, indiscriminately manufacturing and supplying them to the market. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention.

### Northeast Soybean Exports Expected to Increase Next Year

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] According to an announcement here: Soybean exports from the nine provinces of Northeast China will reach 220,000 tons next year. This was only 10,000 tons in 1946. The British trade delegation to China is currently inspecting China and hopes to purchase a large quantity of soybeans for the manufacture of artificial cheese.

### United States Purchases Silk, First Batch is 50,000 Pieces, But Purchase Price is Only 70% of Our City Price

[Report from this newspaper] It was recently reported that the United States will purchase 200,000 pieces of silk from China through the introduction of Sino-American Industrial Corporation. The reporter recently inquired about this information from the authorities of Sino-American Corporation and relevant parties. It is learned that this negotiation is still in progress. The first batch of purchases by the United States is 50,000 pieces, and the purchase price they are willing to pay is only 70% of the market price in our country. Silk factories are now requesting the Central Trust Bureau to sell the raw silk purchased by the Bureau to various weaving factories at a cost price of US$6.50 per pound, so as to reduce the cost of silk and meet the needs of the United States. At the same time, it is pointed out that the sales of raw silk in the United States are very sluggish due to the competition from Japanese silk. It is better to process and manufacture it. Furthermore, exporting the best quality raw silk to foreign countries and using inferior silk for weaving silk in our own country will cause the domestically produced silk to lose its overseas market, which is not a good policy. It is now learned that after repeated requests, the Central Trust Bureau has agreed to supply raw silk at a low price. Each piece of silk requires 16 pounds of silk, and the estimated supply is very large. The silk industry in this city is waiting for the results of the negotiations in the United States. Once the contract is signed, a meeting will be held to discuss the allocation of production volume to each factory. According to relevant people, some factories with smaller equipment may not be able to undertake the production due to technical reasons. At the same time, it is hoped that the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau can supply raw materials in the fastest possible steps, so that the factories can start production and overcome the crisis before being forced to collapse by high-interest loans.

### Ministry of Finance Prevents Capital Flight, Prohibits Establishing Banks Abroad, Those Without Approval Must Withdraw Within Five Days

The outflow of funds from our country is quite serious. The reasons are: the domestic situation is unstable, the industry and commerce are in recession, and the taxes are heavy. Therefore, people who have no national concept and only seek personal gain are engaged in transferring their private property abroad. According to financial circles, the funds flowing into Hong Kong alone have reached more than 3 million yuan. At the same time, more than 40 shops and factories run by Chinese industrialists and businessmen have been approved by the Hong Kong authorities. The government authorities have paid attention to the development of this matter. The Ministry of Finance's first step is to ban domestic financial institutions from establishing branches abroad without prior approval. It has already ordered the Shanghai Bankers' Association to inform its members that if there is any of the above situation, they should immediately cancel and report to the Ministry within five days of receiving the document. If there is any delay, they will be severely punished once they are found out. The Banking and Currency Association has notified the respective banks and firms to comply with the order.

### Salted Fish Also Purchased from the United States, Fishery Organizations Prepare to Form an Aquatic Education Promotion Association

The current winter season is a prosperous period for the fishery market. The fishery industry in this city recently ordered more than 50 tons of salted fish from the United States to meet the needs of this city and surrounding areas. They will arrive in Shanghai in mid-month successively. These fish are all in barrels, and the price per ton is 54,000 yuan in legal tender at the legal exchange rate. Upon arrival, the fish will be sold by the joint office of the National Fisheries Corporation. In order to increase the production of fresh and salted fish in our country, the four fishery companies of Jiangzhe, China, Southeast, and Jiangsu have departed to the Shengsi Islands and near Chongming Island to catch hairtail, and will return by the middle of the first month of next year. At present, the daily sales of fish in the fishery market and the 16th Pier are 500,000 catties, or 250 tons. The fishing technology in our country is far from meeting the required quantity. Therefore, the National Fisheries Corporation has prepared to form the National Aquatic Education Promotion Association to promote fishery education.

Moreover, the font of the genuine banknote number is thicker and smaller, while the font of the counterfeit banknote number is longer and thinner. The English letters at the beginning of the counterfeit banknote number are mostly "BE". There is not much difference on the reverse of the banknote.

### Minister of Economic Affairs Comes to Shanghai to Discuss Countermeasures to Crack Down on the Black Market for Cotton Yarn

The Textile Control Commission has repeatedly discussed countermeasures to crack down on the black market for cotton yarn in this city, but it has not yet achieved significant results. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Wenwu is paying close attention to this issue and is scheduled to invite important representatives and experts from the textile industry in Shanghai this afternoon to hold a discussion and exchange opinions in order to obtain an appropriate solution. It is also heard that Minister Wang's visit is not related to the issue of foreign exchange settlement for US cotton, as this matter should be considered by President Song and a final decision should be made, and the members of the Textile Control Commission have agreed on the principles.

### Commodity Inspection Work Gradually Decreases Recently

[Report from this newspaper] Since the victory and restoration, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, under the leadership of Director Cai Wuji, has been actively engaged in commodity inspection, intending to examine the quality of commodities and increase the credibility of our country's commodities in the international market. At the beginning of the victory, there were many commodities accumulated in the country waiting to be shipped overseas, and those who sent them to the bureau for inspection due to cost prices were very enthusiastic. The bureau felt very burdened when it was restored. In recent months, most of the commodities accumulated in the country have been shipped overseas, and domestic products are mostly unwilling to export due to costs and foreign exchange issues. Except for commodities operated by the state, very few merchants send them to the bureau for inspection. The commodity inspection bureau divides commodity inspection into five offices: (1) Agricultural Products Inspection Office, including beans and tea, (2) Livestock Products Inspection Office, including bristles, casings, ham, wool, etc., (3) Chemical Products Inspection Office, including fertilizers and vegetable oils, (4) Plant Pest Inspection Office, including vegetables and fruits, (5) Silk Inspection Office, including silkworm seeds and raw silk. In addition, a general affairs office is set up to manage the internal organization. The inspection steps vary according to the type and quality of the commodity. Large beans inspection focuses on adulterants, tea is judged by color, aroma, and taste, livestock products are judged by their quality, freshness, and age, chemical products are examined for their component content, plant pests are judged by whether they are disinfected and corroded, and silkworm seeds and raw silk focus on quality and weight, or present sample inspections, or dismantle inspections, always ensuring that the credit of our country's commodities is not affected after export. The entire procedure is: apply for inspection, fill in the application form, after investigation and review, those who are qualified will be issued a permit, and only with the permit can they declare customs.

### China Farmers Bank to Hold Shengsi Islands Fishery Loans

[Report from this newspaper] The Shengsi Islands are the richest fish-producing area along the coast of Jiangsu Province, especially hairtail. It is learned that the Shanghai Branch of the Farmers Bank of China is holding material loans in order to regulate the finances of fishermen in the area. When capturing hairtail, a pair of fishing boats often cooperate. Therefore, this loan is based on a pair of boats as a unit, and the principle is to issue a loan of 1 million yuan worth of materials per unit. It is reported that each unit of materials includes eight stones of rice, and daily necessities for fishermen such as cigarettes, pig blood, and wine.

In addition, the branch will hold a three-day agricultural loan discussion meeting from today to the 9th. Participating units include representatives from the 22 county and city offices under the jurisdiction of the branch. Wang Botian, manager of the branch, will serve as chairman. It is reported that the meeting will not only review the past agricultural loan situation in the jurisdiction area, but also plan future agricultural loan plans.

### Amidst Brisk Sales of Glass Stockings, the Knitting Industry is in Peril

The knitting factories in this city, which have been struggling to support themselves for several months, are now facing a crisis due to the brisk sales of American knitted goods. According to the reporter, more than a dozen have already closed down. According to those familiar with the inside story, in the past, the industry's products were mainly sold to other cities. Due to the internal turmoil in the past year, the transportation has been sluggish, making it impossible to produce in large quantities. If the factory reduces workers and lowers wages, the labor side will not understand and will easily cause labor disputes. Although it was possible to barely support in the first half of the year, since July, due to the continuous arrival of American "Nylon" glass stockings, the domestic knitting market has been almost seized, leading to a slump in the knitting industry. It is expected that by the end of this year, at least one-third will declare liquidation.

Commodity Explanation

### Acids and Alkalis

— Zhang Bo'an

Recently, in the raw material market, acids and alkalis have simultaneously triggered a violent surge. The majority of this is speculation, and a small part is actual sales.

The development of a country's industry and me, can also be said to be the strength of the country. Just look at the ratio of the use of acids and alkalis, and you can tell. If the consumption of acids is greater than that of alkalis, then that country must be a strong country; conversely, if the consumption of alkalis is greater than that of acids, it must be a weak country. But in China, acids and alkalis have no place to use their abilities, so there is no talk of industry. However, the clever Chinese take acids and alkalis as speculative objects, which is also a unique style.

Acids and alkalis are the most important intermediate compounds in industry, so all industries cannot do without acids and alkalis.

The largest acid factory in our country is Kaicheng in this city. It has not been heard of producing after the war. Although Yongli also produces sulfuric acid, it can only supply the ammonium sulfate produced by itself. Therefore, the current acid manufacturing industry can be said to be unknown. As for alkali produced in our country, only Yongli manufactures soda ash. Before the war, Yongli also made caustic soda. Because the degree was slightly different and the color was red, it could not compete with Yuepai (Moon Brand). Now there is no caustic soda produced.

Speaking of Bu Neimen's Yuepai (Moon Brand) alkali, it can be said to have dominated the whole of China before the war. Its stock was very abundant. From the perspective of Shanghai, from the outbreak of the Pacific War until the victory, there were still 35,000 barrels in stock, which was enough for three years of consumption. This really makes you feel the greatness of the British merchants' dumping power. Before and after the victory, the price of caustic soda was 30 to 40 million yuan per barrel. After 200 yuan per share, the price per barrel was only 130 to 140,000 yuan. By this time last year, the price fluctuated greatly, and some were more than 30 yuan higher. At the highest, it simply did not talk about the value of legal tender, but replaced it with 12 taels of red silver per barrel. Later, when American merchants began to order goods, the order price was 120,000 yuan per ton, and 300 kilograms per barrel, which was only 40,000 yuan. By January of this year, the goods had arrived in port, but because the American manufacturers had never used them, there was no way to know what the quality was like, and there were very few risk takers for the first order. After the first batch of goods arrived, users were satisfied after using them, so the merchants in this city ordered a large number of goods. By March and April of this year, all orders were transferred to Shanghai via Manila, totaling as many as 50,000 to 60,000 tons. Therefore, the price fell from 1 million yuan per barrel to 180,000 yuan per barrel, but the price of American goods was always 50 to 60,000 yuan lower than that of Yuepai (Moon Brand) per barrel.

Since the American loan of caustic soda has overwhelmed the market, and actual sales are also very small, although there are small fluctuations sometimes, they will still return to their original position soon. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the price per barrel was 420 to 430,000 yuan.

Since the United States and the Philippines banned the export of caustic soda in July, the price in this city has not skyrocketed due to abundant inventory. Actual sales are not very large, and few customers come to handle it. Although the United States and the Philippines banned exports, the goods transferred from Hong Kong are still coming in continuously. Although the number is not large, they are sold as soon as they arrive, and the inventory has not been exhausted. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the source of goods in Hong Kong was scarce due to the impact of the American seamen's strike, and there were also customers moving to handle it. The price rose slowly, and by the end of October, it had reached 800,000 yuan per barrel. Later, because the northern gang came to Shanghai to search for purchases, the dyeing and weaving factories in this city also happened to absorb a large number of American caustic soda at this time, totaling 2,000 to 3,000 barrels. According to the inventory in this city, there is not much emptiness, but because the price has risen quickly, speculators have been greedy, stirring up trouble and spreading empty sales. The market price has soared from 800,000 yuan to 1.3 million yuan. Then, due to the stagnation of actual sales, the price once again fell back to 1.1 million to 1.15 million yuan per barrel, but the speculators have not lost their ambition. At the same time, the multiple they have absorbed will inevitably collapse if they rush out. They have repeatedly hyped it up, and the daily increase has reached 400 to 500,000 yuan. The highest has reached 2.4 million yuan per barrel. However, the general users believe that more than 200 foreign shipments will arrive this month, and the number of shipments of caustic soda to Shanghai is also not small. Therefore, except for those who need it, they purchase a small amount, and it is expected that the surge can be suppressed.

Following caustic soda, the second type is triacid - sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid - which has also risen sharply, especially sulfuric acid, the rise is particularly strong. Because with sulfuric acid, there are two acids, which can be repackaged. Sulfuric acid is extremely scarce in the market, so there is no large amount of transactions. I won't go into details here. There is also a kind called carbolic acid, which suddenly rose in price tenfold overnight. Carbolic acid is produced when coal tar is distilled to 1750c, and is an important compound for medicine and dyes.

Sulfuric acid 31,462 1,263,981

### Ministry of Education Orders Provinces and Cities to Appropriately Allocate a Large Number of Instruments to Middle Schools, 868 Sets of Physics Experiment Instruments, 177 Sets of Chemistry Demonstration Instruments

[Report from Nanjing, 8th] The Ministry of Education ordered a large number of physics and chemistry instruments for secondary schools from the Academia Sinica in the 25th year. Later, due to the outbreak of war, some of them were transported and distributed to secondary schools in Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places in the 28th year. Most of them were stored in Xiangxing Company, a British merchant in Shanghai. At the end of the war last autumn, the Ministry of Education, together with the Academia Sinica, negotiated with the British merchant, and the Ministry paid the rent and insurance costs for storage over the years. The Ministry entrusted the Academia Sinica to take out all the instruments, including: 865 sets of physics experiment instruments for junior high schools, 40 sets of chemistry demonstration instruments for senior high schools, and 137 sets of chemistry demonstration instruments for junior high schools, totaling 1,042 sets.

### National Textbook Supply Problem in Spring, Director Wu Yan'yin Gave Practical Instructions

[Report from this newspaper] National primary and secondary school textbooks were once rumored to be opened, so the Seven-League Supply Office did not dare to print them boldly and intended to wait and see, which will affect the spring supply. Upon hearing this, the Ministry of Education specially sent Director Wu Yan'yin of the National Education Department and Section Chief Wei Bingxin to Shanghai a few days ago to give instructions on the textbook supply problem for the spring season of the Seven-League Office. The Seven-League Office held a meeting at Fuhualou yesterday (8th) at noon and welcomed Director Wu Yan'yin and Section Chief Wei Bingxin. First, Wu Bingchang, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Seven-League Office, gave a welcome speech, followed by Director Wu and Section Chief Wei, who delivered speeches one after another and gave practical instructions, saying that the Seven-League Office had made special contributions to the supply of textbooks during the war and hoped that it would now fully supply the spring textbooks in accordance with the contract. The Ministry of Education has recently issued an order to all provinces and cities to strictly prohibit piracy, so the Seven-League is even more responsible and must print a large number of them as soon as possible and distribute them to various places as soon as possible. All Shanghai autumn sales stock books can be loaded and transported first. The paper illustrations and binding should be exquisite. The Four-League loans cannot be used for other purposes. The original professor's books must also be published as soon as possible. External piracy, regardless of the background, should be banned uniformly, but if there are unscrupulous elements within each family who steal and print, they should be severely punished in accordance with the contract. All old textbooks approved by each family that have been published in various subjects in the national edition, such as elementary school Chinese, common sense, arithmetic, etc., are not allowed to be sold again in accordance with the regulations, so that the supply situation can reach a perfect state. Subsequently, Gu Shusen, Zhang Yiqu, Li Bojia, Ye Suzhong, and others expressed their opinions separately. They all believed that since the Ministry of Education has given instructions on the spring supply plan and maintained the original intention, they should actively print and transport them, indicating that all the instructions have been accepted. The revised version of the professor's book, the first to fourth volumes of elementary school national common sense, has recently been submitted by the Translation and Compilation Office and will be printed immediately. Efforts have been made to print the textbooks using a reel machine. The loan is still audited by the Four-League, and there will be no misappropriation. The two sides exchanged many opinions, which was quite harmonious. It is heard that Director Wu and others will stay in Shanghai for one or two days and then return to Beijing.

Jiaotong University students were overjoyed. After three minutes, Jiaotong University got a corner kick. Wang Hongshu sent a high ball, which landed in the penalty area. Deng Jingtong jumped up and scored the first goal. The cheers of the Jiaotong University cheerleaders and the double-barreled firecrackers resounded through the sky. The two sides continued to fight. At 27 minutes, Chen Shaoyuan of Jiaotong University passed a high ball from the left side of the goal to the right side of the goal. Wang Hongshu chased up and continued to attack, scoring another goal. In the first half, Jiaotong University took the lead with a score of 2-0.

Taking Advantage of the Situation, He Scored Three Goals in a Row

After a break, St. John's regained its morale and launched frequent attacks, but lacked strategy, and the shooting power was too soft, and Qin Dingxin easily caught every shot. After five minutes, Chen Shaoyuan of Jiaotong University dribbled the ball straight in from the left, almost going out of bounds. The audience was lamenting it, but unexpectedly Liu Jing hooked the ball back, passed in front of the goal, and Wang Hongshu flew up and kicked the ball into the goal.

Penalty Kick Avoids Complete Defeat

Jiaotong University led 3-0, and the sound of firecrackers was loud. Jiaotong University had an absolute advantage, so it took more defensive positions, and the two sides became a seesaw situation. After more than 30 minutes of fierce battle, in the last two minutes, Shen Chongdong of Jiaotong University committed a handball in the penalty area, and St. John's got a good opportunity for a penalty kick. Zhu Dehui shot and scored, pulling back a goal. When the kickoff was made in the midfield again, only a few seconds were left, and the game ended. St. John's was lucky to avoid a shutout.

The Cheerleaders Had Very Good Order Yesterday

Judging from the situation of both sides in yesterday's game, the coordination was poor. In terms of personal skills, Jiaotong University players were more skilled than St. John's. In terms of momentum, Jiaotong University was far superior to St. John's. St. John's had no fewer opportunities to attack the goal than Jiaotong University, but the shooting was too poor, and all efforts were in vain, which was due to lack of practice. The poor coordination is a common problem for university football teams, which is believed to be gradually improved. Jiaotong University's defenders are tall and strong, the goalkeeper Tai Dingxin is experienced, and the skillful dribbling of He Zeng and Liu Longxing is its advantage, but the left wing is too weak, and the goalkeeper likes to rush out to take the ball, which is not stable enough. Yesterday, the Jiaotong University cheerleaders had very good order. It is hoped that Jiaotong University will not cause disputes again due to past misunderstandings when playing against Fudan University. This is a deep expectation.

### Group A Football: Second Round, Donghua Wins Over Longjie Again Yesterday, 6-1, Young Players Concede Five Goals in the Second Half

In the second round of the Group A football league between Donghua and Longjie, Donghua continued to maintain its winning record with a 6-1 victory over Longjie at Yiyuan at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. In the first half, Longjie defended strongly, and Donghua failed to score repeatedly, resulting in a 1-1 draw. In the second half, Longjie's defense was repeatedly broken, Donghua's offensive was great, and they scored five goals in a row. As a result, the young phoenixes were no match for the old generals, and Donghua won by a large margin of 6-1.

1-1 Draw

More than 4,000 spectators attended Yiyuan, and the situation was very grand. Jiang Yinseng executed the referee, and the whistle sounded to start the game. Longjie attacked first, but was blocked by Han Longhai. Ming Zhe lobbed the ball high to the center, and Longhai rushed up. Wu Kaimin was unprepared, and the ball went into the net. Donghua took the lead with a score of 1-0, only one minute away from the start of the game. Longjie counterattacked, and Jin Lusheng went deep alone. Bang Lun rushed out and collided with each other. The ball was saved by Bang Lun, turning danger into safety. Donghua counterattacked, and Han Longhai rushed again. Sheng Peter left his post without authorization. Fortunately, Zhao Chengfang cleared the siege. After 20 minutes, Gu Dirong was injured and left the field. Wang Lin came on as a substitute. Not long after, Longhai was also injured, but he returned to the field after a short rest. Seven minutes before the end of the first half, Long Bo committed a handball in the penalty area. Gao Xiuqing took the penalty and scored, tying the score for Longjie.

Scored Five Goals in a Row

After a break, the two teams reunited. Donghua attacked. After eight minutes, Youliang headed the ball over, and the iron leg shot the goal from fourteen yards away, scoring a goal. Donghua took the lead again with a score of 2-1. Not long after, Youliang scored another goal, making the score 3-1. At that time, Longjie still tried to cheer up, but Donghua was impeccable. After ten minutes, A Sun headed the ball, Longhai added a kick, and the ball went into Longjie's net, making the score 4-1. Longjie was frustrated and at a loss. Ten minutes before the end of the game, Lin Shaojun was planted by the referee at the twelve-yard marker. A Sun took the penalty and bounced the ball out of bounds. It was not too much. In the last six minutes, Lin Wen came on as a substitute for Chen Mingzhe. Longhai broke through three levels again, making the score 6-1.

Civil Affairs Briefing

### The Judicial Yuan Unifies the Doubt About the Concubine's Son as the Head of the Family, and the Ministry of Interior Elects the Municipal Government to Investigate the Registration of the Son Born by the Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law

The Ministry of Interior approved the request of the Shaanxi Provincial Government to explain the case where the wife of Tian wanted to establish the son of the concubine as the head of the family. How should the title and identity registration of this head of the family for the wife of a certain A and her biological mother be filled out? After being submitted to the Executive Yuan and transferred to the Judicial Yuan for unified interpretation, it was reopened: "The unanimous interpretation of the Law Conference has been resolved by this court. If a certain A dies in a certain year, leaving a wife, a concubine, and a son born to the concubine, if there are no other relatives in the family, and both the wife and concubine recommend the son born to the concubine to be the head of the family, who has been raised by a certain A, then according to Article 1124 of the Civil Code, the son born to the concubine is the head of the family, and the wife of a certain A is the direct relative of the head of the family by marriage, and the concubine of a certain A is the mother of the head of the family," and so on. In addition, how should the household registration of the son born by the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law be handled, and it was explained that, "The son born to a certain A's daughter-in-law during the continuation of the marriage relationship with a certain A's son should be regarded as a legitimate son of a certain A's son according to Article 1063 of the Civil Code before a certain A's son files a lawsuit to deny it and obtains a final judgment. Even if this son is born by a certain A and his daughter-in-law's adultery, he cannot be recognized by a certain A. After a certain A's son files a lawsuit to deny it and obtains a final judgment, and is recognized by a certain A, he cannot be regarded as a legitimate son of a certain A according to Paragraph 1 of Article 1065 of the Civil Code," and so on. The Ministry of Interior has separately telegraphed the municipal government to investigate and ordered it to inform.

### The Northwest Corner of Jiangxi (One)

— Special Dispatch from Nanchang by Our Correspondent Liu Zao

The northwest corner of Jiangxi—north of the Gan-Zhe National Highway and west of the Nanze Railway—including Anyi, Fengxin, Jing’an, Yongxiu, Wuning, Dean, Xingzi, Jiujiang, Ruichang, and the Guling area perched on the shores of Poyang Lake, was the main battlefield of the Jiangxi war zone during the war. The people of this area tasted the horrors of war and became a “disabled” zone. The reporter had a good opportunity this time to travel throughout the counties and towns, and go deep into the people, to see the real situation of the countryside after the war and the difficulties of the people's lives.

We crossed the broken and floating Fengchuan River pontoon bridge and stepped onto the sandy land to the north. We still saw a new Anyi market street. This was a place where the enemy drove people from the south bank during the occupation, designated as a place for "people's transactions." Now it is the only market in Anyi town, where there is still grain, groceries, and bamboo and wood businesses, maintaining the original form of a rural market. The fashion of Nanchang and Jiujiang is rarely seen here.

The wind and lewd operas have swept through Anyi. People's minds and times have been invaded by these bad habits. Some of the gambling games are controlled by local bullies, and some are colluding and sheltering them. If the spoils are not evenly distributed, those who deserve to die still die. The Cao Men gambling bust case is a manifestation of collusion and protection. At that time, some of the gamblers, business people, and men and women watching the opera who were caught managed to escape, while others formed an inseparable bond with the police team that caught the gamblers. The bright carbide lamps on the stage were taken down and hung on the big trees beside the road, providing light for the robbers. Gold rings and customs gold certificates were all stuffed into their pockets. With a "get out," they escaped the law. The opera goers and gamblers who had no money were taken into custody.

### Not Even a Chicken or Duck Left at Ya Ji Long

Anyi is the hometown of General Xiong Shihui. His ancestral home is Ya Ji Tang in Shiyan Township, Anyi County. When Xiong Shihui was in charge, someone suggested that Ya Ji Long be designated as a township experimental zone. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the provincial government officially renamed the original Wanbu Township as Shiyan District, and established a separate institution to carry out rural construction experiments. It was at this time that Ya Ji Long, Xiong's ancestral home, put on the cloak of a rural experiment—all the village houses were rebuilt in a new style, with farms and schools... Although it was not as good as Zhengding in Hebei, it was considered the place that "produced the chairman" in the countryside of Jiangxi. What is the experimental zone like now? Apart from finding the term "experimental township" in the archives of Anyi, you can't find a single chicken or duck on the pile of rubble in Ya Ji Long—the new countryside and new business have been completely destroyed by the enemy!

The county seat of Anyi is still shrouded in desolation and dilapidation. The original urban area is desolate. Apart from a county government building built by the enemy and puppets, it is difficult to find a few complete houses. People who have returned to their homes want to rebuild their old businesses, but they can't raise funds, and they can only sigh in vain!

### Jing’an: A Full View of a Sweet Tangerine Orchard

Jing’an is a sweet tangerine orchard. Approaching the town, there is an endless red and green landscape. Going to any family, tangerines are the best treat for guests. The annual production income is tens of millions of yuan, which helps the rural economy a lot. It is a pity that the owners of the tangerine orchards do not pay much attention to replanting and cultivation. If we want to support the income of this special product in the future, we must improve it. There is a family named Shu who started by planting a tangerine orchard, and this year their income is in the millions. The joys of life are all in the tangerine orchard. The Shu family is a large clan in Jing’an. The current population of the county is 60,000, and the Shu family accounts for more than two-tenths of it. They have family rules, family laws, and ancestral instructions. People are honest and simple, and customs are good. If there are unruly people in the clan, family laws will make them obey. Not only is the Shu family educated by ancestral instructions, but it also has a moral influence in the society of Jing’an. Therefore, there are few treacherous and cunning villains in the locality, and there are not often desperate bandits. They all work happily and live in peace. This is a happy land compared to the northwest region. People from outside are mostly infatuated with the "beautiful scenery" of Jing’an. The ancestor of the Shu family was one of those who came there to start a business.

Superstition in gods and Buddhas is a phenomenon that is not easy to eliminate in the rural society at this stage. The people of Jing’an have been hurt by "superstitious beliefs." A family with a painful illness begged the Buddha for medicine, but as a result, they had no money to buy medicine, and the patient hanged himself. They go to ask the gods when they are sick, and they also go to ask the gods when they lack children. When the fields are dry and there are minor family matters, … everything that is considered unsatisfactory or unsolvable is sought from the gods. Therefore, "strange gods and Buddhas" are everywhere in the rural areas of Jing’an. However, given the simplicity of social facilities and county administration, what better way is there to solve the difficulties for the villagers? For example, when you are sick, you should see a doctor, but the health center does not even have a grain of quinine, and it is difficult to find a drop of red potion. If their hope is not placed on the shoulders of the "omnipotent god," who will find a solution for them?

### A Snapshot of Fengxin County: A Museum of Corpses

When we stepped onto the large stone bridge over the Fengchuan River on the outskirts of Fengxin, we thought of the power and conspiracy of Zhang Xun, the warlord of the Beiyang government. These two stone bridges—called the Upper Bridge and the Lower Bridge by the locals—were built by Zhang Xun. The engineering was quite grand, but the bridge piers and bridge decks were damaged during the war. Now, due to financial constraints, it is impossible to restore them to their original state. Only wooden stakes and planks are used to maintain traffic on both sides of the Fengjiang River.

The county seat of Juxin was destroyed by the enemy, and the loss of houses reached more than 95 percent. The weeds and towering trees fully reveal its wounds. The original county government now only has a broken wall left. The urban area has become a ruin, and the newly emerging market is also on the south bank of the Fengjiang River. The local people not only believe in gods, but also pay attention to "feng shui." Stepping into the boundary of Fengxin County, in the countryside overgrown with grass and weeds, we saw countless low houses like land temples. At that time, we thought that they were the residences of people who had returned after the war, but upon closer inspection, there were no doors or windows. The four walls were sealed up. What was in the low houses was corpses. Some of them had been placed in coffins for hundreds of years, and some of them had the deceased's official titles and ages painted on the walls. After investigation, we learned that the descendants of the deceased were waiting to choose a burial site in order to beg for the prosperity of future generations. Under this kind of superstitious "feng shui," the low houses connected with tiles and eaves are museums of corpses, which makes the living feel terrible and the dead cannot be buried in peace, becoming a special snapshot in the society of Fengxin.

The former county magistrate of Fengxin, Wang Bangfan, first put Zhang Ren, the director of the economic and tax office who was responsible for handling the handover procedures, in jail for custody. Later, Zhang Ren was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the court for his involvement in the silver vault digging case, so no one was responsible for handling the handover. Wang Bangfan is now being dismissed and monitored by Xiong, the current magistrate, for "winter defense protection." Under this kind of stalled handover situation, some people are "exonerating" Wang Bangfan, while others are praising Xiong, the current magistrate. In Fengxin, we saw a farce of officialdom—dangerous and cunning.

### Local Gentry Exploitation Makes Yongxiu People Suffer

During the war, the fighting between the enemy and us on both sides of the Xiujiang River made the people of Yongxiu suffer. The current county government and a street running from east to west with less than 50 empty shops fully show that the people of Yongxiu are struggling on the hunger line. There, not only are there no bookstores or newspapers, but even a slightly better piece of mao bian paper cannot be bought. The only commodity in the shops is oil, salt, and groceries. Even one rice store cannot be seen. The residents have to rush to buy rice at the "midday market," like a charge, because of hunger and poverty!

The power of the local gentry is quite large. The factions of Wang and Er have endless disputes. For the sake of a small official position, they may cause armed conflicts. The election of county councilors is an example.

The poor and helpless people in the barren land on the edge of death are not only oppressed by life, but also constantly exploited by the gentry, almost to the point of despair. The income they have earned from hard work all year round has to supply the local government's donations, apportionments, and the gentry's "invitations to wine" and "gambling," … countless kinds of "demands" and "gifts." The money from the autumn harvest is squandered under the control of these exploitations, and there is nothing left.

Tujia Port is the essence of Yongxiu. The Naxun Grand Iron Bridge spanning the Xiujiang River is still intact, but the shops near the railway station have been destroyed by the war and nothing is left! On the streets of Tujia Port, we can see some of the bad habits of society everywhere—prostitution, gambling, and brothels.

### Travelers Feel Cold on the Yongwu Road

The county seat of Yongxiu is excessively eastward. The mountainous area in the western part of the county is a "turbulent land" in northern Jiangxi today. On the highway from Yongxiu to Wuning, in the valley near Baicha, there are some unemployed soldiers and scattered soldiers, hanging the official titles of adjutants and platoon leaders, forcing buying and selling, and committing all kinds of evil deeds. These "old bosses" are the source of the bandits. They not only rob passing guests—taking out their wallets and robbing goods—but sometimes even the bride's dowry is "forcibly borrowed." They even have the guts to rob and plunder, and then sit leisurely in the Baicha tavern, drinking and eating their fill, safe and sound.

On the eve of our arrival in Baicha, the local people spent the night in the open air to avoid the police and bandits. Even when the large team escorting us arrived in Baicha, the bandit information was still heard from the mountain behind, only one mile away. Their evil forces are not only on the mountainous Yongwu Road, but also extend to Wucheng downstream of the Xiujiang River and along the Nantao Highway. It is said that the recent car robbery cases near Zhanggongdu were the new business of these "old bosses." In terms of waterways, they force the people to pack their goods on boats and provide bodyguard-style transportation, otherwise, this road is "impassable." Especially large gangs of wood merchants have to pay homage to the "old boss," otherwise they will make you cry and laugh.

The number of them in this area is only a hundred or so. Fortunately, they have no political background. They are just a gang of bandits who often harass the water and land transportation lines. There are only 50 or 60 of them. Their guns are not complete, but the local armed forces of Yongxiu County have more than 200 guns. Their current strength is several times that of the bandits. Because they are scattered in four townships, they cannot be used in a concentrated manner. Some places are even being calculated by the bandits.

The local people said: "If you have ten thousand gold, someone will come to greet you in the dead of night." This is a true picture of the public security on the Yongwu Road.

### British Quakers' Friendship Organization in China: FAU in Henan

Disbanded and Reorganized into a Friendship Service Team; Headquarters to Move from Zhengzhou to Shanghai; Second Day Dispatch; Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Fan Shiqin in Zhengzhou

There is a kind of Quaker in England who fundamentally oppose war and call themselves pacifists. When Hitler declared war on England in 1939, these British Quakers, in their religious beliefs, should oppose war, and in their national laws, should participate in war, which made them scratch their heads in difficulty. As a result, they organized a Friends Ambulance Unit (FAU), so that on the one hand, they could be worthy of God, and on the other hand, they could be worthy of the country.

Purpose of Work

As far back as when Spain and France joined forces to fight England, when the United States had not yet completely separated from England, the King of England levied military expenses from the Quakers in the United States. Those Quakers also opposed war and could not oppose the King's orders, so they paid the money, only saying that it was "dedicated to the King," but never asked how the money was used. One day, because the King of England had no gunpowder, he asked those Quakers for money. The Quakers paid the money, saying that it was for the government to buy food, which was tacitly understood.

The FAU existed in World War I, and 1939 was the second organization. Their purpose: to relieve people who have suffered from the scourge of war. Their work has been in Europe, the Near East, Africa, India, and all the way to China.

Coming to China

They came to China in 1941. For the first four years, they worked in the southwestern provinces. Their headquarters were initially in Lianshan, and later moved to Chongqing. The medicines imported by the FAU were quite considerable. At one point, 90 percent of the medicines used by civilians were thanks to their import. Their medical teams and surgical mobile medical teams cooperated with the Chinese Red Cross and worked in hospitals in Yunnan and the border areas of India and Myanmar, such as Lianshan and Tengchong, which had been supported by them. In the counties south of Guizhou, they treated civilians and did other relief work.

Going Deep into Henan

The FAU ended in June this year, but they are still continuing their work in China, which is not because China is still in the scourge of war. When the war ended last year, they wanted to concentrate their efforts and serve for a period of time in the most severely affected areas, so they chose to go to Henan. Their headquarters moved from Chongqing to Zhengzhou. They took over some church hospitals in Zhengzhou, Weihui, and Anyang, and helped them recover until they were able to support themselves. Several medical teams serve in various parts of Henan, mainly to deal with black fever, because this disease is particularly prevalent in Henan. Among them, 15 hospitals have added various medical equipment with their help, and opened a training class for medical engineering, with 15 students selected from various hospitals to receive training, so that they can install generators, repair telephones, and install other small equipment.

In the Yellow River Flood Area

In the Yellow River flood area of Zhongmu, a rural reconstruction plan was implemented, which was particularly meaningful. Knitting, animal husbandry, and consumer cooperatives were organized, and clinics and schools were established. The relief milk and clothing of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) were distributed by them, veterinary demonstration work was in progress, and an agricultural cultivation center was also being established. They also provided welfare assistance to the workers who repaired the Yellow River breach. The medical supplies of the International Relief Committee were also continuously transported from their staff in Chongqing. They have offices in Shanghai, Hankou, and Kaifeng. The FAU has a total of 800 people, most of whom are British. In China, there are 121: 54 British, 27 Americans, 14 Canadians, 10 New Zealanders, and 16 Chinese. In addition to those who are dispatched to work in Guangshan, Anyang, Weihui, Zhongmu, etc., there are 10 people who specialize in studying the treatment of black fever, and 12 people who are dispatched to the International Relief Committee, the China Industrial Cooperatives Association, and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) to assist in their work.

Source of Funding

The source of their funding is mainly supplied by the United China Relief, as well as the American Friends Service Committee, the Canadian War Relief Fund for China, and the recent assistance from the British government. Their medicines and relief supplies are supplied by the American Red Cross and the U.S. military. Food, clothing, and mechanical equipment are allocated to them from the surplus materials of the U.S. military.

This time, Mrs. Cripps specially came to Zhengzhou because the FAU was here. She also went to Zhongmu once to see their work in rural reconstruction in the Yellow River flood area.

Promote Cooperation

Mr. Livling of the FAU is the chairman. He said that they were very moved by the Chinese people's forbearance and resilience in the face of difficulties and hardships. The Chinese people who work with them and those who have been in contact with them have established friendly relations with them. Although there are differences in language and customs, they believe that they can cooperate and achieve great things. They believe that their contribution to the Chinese people is too necessary, but they also feel that it is too limited, but they hope that the understanding between the people of the East and the West can promote a part of it.

Speaking of their difficulties, they are the same as what other people feel, that is, the traffic situation in China is too bad, and the currency is too unstable, which makes them worry about the development of hospitals and the difficulty of general budget preparation.

Headquarters Move Eastward

The FAU is a wartime organization. They have decided to conclude at the end of March next year, but a Friends Service Unit will replace it. The headquarters of the FAU will be moved from Zhengzhou to Shanghai at the beginning of this month. In the future, they will have a fairly long period of work, and the scope is not limited to Henan. The FAU will become the FSW.

The FAU is considered in England to be "conscientious objectors," and they can now be called "conscientious peacemakers" by others.

### Water Conservancy Projects in Zhejiang

— Mao Qi

In the past, water conservancy in Zhejiang Province mainly focused on seawall projects, followed by farmland water conservancy. During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to cooperate with the food production increase plan, it actively built farmland water conservancy projects. In the past eight years, it has been promoted in various counties in southern Zhejiang and has achieved considerable results. After the restoration, the repair of seawall projects and the construction of farmland water conservancy projects are both important and planned to be carried out at the same time. The progress of the project from January to October of this year is briefly described as follows for the reference of our fellow villagers living in Beijing and Shanghai who are concerned about the economic construction of our province:

Qiantang Seawall Project

The seawalls on the north and south banks of the Qiantang River are the barrier for the farmland and houses in the counties of western Zhejiang and the counties of Xiaoshao in eastern Zhejiang. They were in disrepair during the war, and many were collapsed, especially the Bapu area of Haining and the Wenjia Dam Chenfu Zihao were the most dangerous. The recent rush repair situation is briefly described as follows:

In the 33rd and 34th years of the Republic (1944 and 1945), the Haining County Government organized a rush repair project office to rush to block the breaches near Bapu. However, due to the poor environment at that time, it was not easy to purchase materials, so only the firewood embankments were rushed to repair to defend against the tide, which was not a long-term solution.

After the restoration, two engineers were sent to survey along the embankment and prepare a plan for the restoration project on both sides, and drafted an estimate of 6 billion yuan for the urgently needed part and 6.3 billion yuan for the crucial part, and reported to the central government, requesting an appropriation for the project.

At the beginning of this year, the central government approved the 62 million yuan for the rush repair of the seawall submitted in the 33rd year of the Republic. When the money arrived in the province, 56 million yuan was allocated to the north bank for rush repair, and on January 5th, local people were invited to discuss the organization of the Qiantang River North Bank Seawall Emergency Rush Repair Committee and Project Office to carry out the selective rush repair. Another 6 million yuan was handed over to the Xiaoshan County Government to establish the South Bank Seawall Rush Repair Project Office to carry out the rush repair of the Wenjia Dam Chenfu Zihao breach. Due to limited funds and rainy weather, the project could not be carried out. From the start of construction in February to mid-April, the north bank completed more than 4,700 cubic meters of earth filling of the stone embankment, 2,756 meters of stone facing, purchased and transported more than 18,000 pieces of wood to the construction site, and transported 1,400 bundles of wood. The south bank also only completed the embankment surface finishing project.

In late April, the central government approved 6 billion yuan for the urgently needed part of the project, of which 2 billion yuan was allocated by the central government, 2 billion yuan was allocated by the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch Office, and the remaining 2 billion yuan was raised locally. And first allocated 1 billion yuan, when arriving in the province, due to the approaching autumn tide, in order to complete the rush repair of all the breaches in a short period of time, it was necessary to merge and reorganize the original institutions on both sides to achieve the effect of the arm and finger. Therefore, on April 27, the heads of the provincial party, government and public opinion organs were invited to discuss and decide to organize the Zhejiang Province Seawall Project Emergency Rush Repair Committee and the Zhejiang Province Seawall Emergency Rush Repair Temporary Project Office to coordinate the handling, and to set up project offices in sections according to the original plan of the Water Conservancy Bureau to divide the three sections of Hanghai, Yanping, Shaoshao, and to carry out construction separately. From May 1st to the end of August, all the rush repair projects that were planned were completed, using a total of 24,892 wooden piles, 80,500 bundles of wood, 2,000 hemp bags, 900 cubic meters of rubble, and 2,000 bags of cement, with a total of more than 144,000 workdays, and a cost of more than 470 million yuan and 910 tons of flour.

On July 13, in accordance with the order of the central government, the Zhejiang Province Embankment Works Committee was established, and on August 1, the Zhejiang Province Qiantang River Seawall Project Bureau was established to continue the rush repair and repair the permanent stone embankment project. The original emergency rush repair committee and temporary project office were both closed.

Handling Flood Control Projects

The main rivers in this province have been in disrepair for many years, with silted riverbeds and collapsed embankments. In addition, excessive felling of mountain forests has lost the function of regulating rainwater. Due to the active increase in production and the cultivation of miscellaneous grains during the war to supply food for the people, there was no time to limit it. Once it rained, mountain floods often broke out and flooded into disasters. This summer, the counties along the Jinhua River and Pujiang River were flooded with fields and crops, which affected the autumn harvest. In addition to issuing a notice to all counties to strictly implement afforestation and forest protection and to limit the cultivation of terraced fields to avoid topsoil erosion and silting of the riverbed, it is also planned to carry out flood control projects during the winter slack season. The planned rivers for flood control and their required funds are listed below:

(Zi) The emergency flood control project of the Cao'e River has been surveyed and designed by the Water Conservancy Bureau and completed. The estimated cost of the project is more than 23.1 billion yuan and 4.94 million yuan. The surveying team is still being sent to continue detailed measurement for the design of a fundamental plan.

(Chou) Flood control projects for the East and West Tiaoxi Rivers and South and North Lakes have been surveyed. It is necessary to build three dams in the East Tiaoxi, one each in the South Tiaoxi and Middle Tiaoxi, and one control gate each in the South and North Lakes, and to raise and thicken their four bureau dikes. The estimated cost is 3.6 billion yuan. The Water Conservancy Bureau has set up a surveying team to go to the site for measurement.

Weekly Forum

### Re-discussing "Our Proposed Local System"

— Kong Dachong

My article "Our Proposed Local System" was published in this newspaper on November 30th. However, due to space limitations, it was not exhaustive. Now, I will supplement and explain it further. When we talk about local political systems, we cannot abandon local autonomy. Local autonomy is a Western system with its consistent theories. If we do not clearly understand these theories and draft regulations accordingly, we will inevitably create a mismatch.

What aligns with the fundamental theories of local autonomy? We must start from the beginning. We might as well report on several points already commonly understood by Western people. These are commonplace in the West. However, judging by some local autonomy regulations enacted after the Republic of China, they might still be novel introductions in China.

First, what is local autonomy? A local political system does not necessarily have to be autonomous. If foreigners rule, there is a colonial local system. If the military governs, there is a military-controlled local system. If one party is in power, there is a party-led local system. In non-democratic countries, the local system is a vertical form of bureaucratic governance. The modern trend focuses only on democracy. A democratic local political system is local autonomy. "Local" is horizontal because several "locals" can exist simultaneously. It is also vertical because within one "local," there can be other "locals." What is "autonomy"? "Autonomy" is managing one's own affairs. One's own affairs are what Mr. Sun Yat-sen called "the affairs of the people." Therefore, we arrive at the definition of local autonomy: "Local autonomy" is a way for residents within a defined area to organize legal entities and manage all resident affairs within the scope of the law. If local autonomy lacked the condition "within the scope of the law," it would be a democratic country, meaning local autonomy with sovereignty.

Second, to implement local autonomy, units must first be defined. Every country that implements local autonomy first legally defines local units. Local units are divided into basic units and hierarchical units. For example, under a province is a county, and under a county are cities, townships, and towns. Cities, townships, and towns are basic local units because there are no other local units below them. Conversely, provinces and counties are hierarchical local units because provinces have counties and cities under them, and counties have cities, townships, and towns under them. Baojia (neighborhood watch system) is not a local unit; it is merely the cell that makes up a city, township, or town.

Third, the organization of local units is the local government's agencies in that locality. They are not entirely local autonomous governments. For example: (1) branches of the central government in the locality; (2) agents of the central government—the provincial government in a province and the county government in a county. Agents possess the powers of the central government. (3) representatives of the central government, representatives are responsible for handling specified matters on behalf of the central government, such as the provincial government constructing an airport within the province under the order of the central government.

Therefore, the so-called local government includes three bodies: one is the local autonomous government, the second is the body of agents of the central government, and the third is the body of representatives of the central government (and all higher-level governments). The first type qualifies as a local principal, while the second and third types qualify as representatives of the central government. In countries that have not yet implemented local autonomy, local governments at all levels only possess the qualifications of representatives of the central government. In other words, they are branches of the central government.

Fourth, what does a local autonomous government do? A local autonomous government should manage all matters concerning the residents. All political, economic, and cultural matters related to the lives of residents in the locality can be managed by the local autonomous government. This is its business, or function, or power. In administrative terms, it is local autonomous administration. Opposite to local autonomous administration is national administration, which is the management of matters concerning all the people by the central government and its agents. When both sides manage the same things, a division naturally occurs. In countries ruled by law, national administration and local autonomous administration are clearly separated.

From this, we also know that the popular "local administration" actually includes three items: (1) the administration of agents of the central government (i.e., a part of national administration in the locality); (2) the administration of representatives of the central government (and all higher-level governments) (also a part of national administration in the locality); (3) local autonomous administration (referred to as autonomous administration). After local autonomous administration is assigned to the local autonomous government, if there are hierarchical units in the local autonomous government, a reasonable distribution should be made through legislative procedures. However, one principle is that hierarchical units should be assigned fewer tasks, while basic units should be assigned more. The reason is simple: basic units have a direct and close relationship with the residents. Since the purpose of an autonomous organization is to manage all matters concerning the residents, it is most practical and effective to have the autonomous organization closest to the residents manage it.

Fifth, administrative orders and autonomous supervision. The identities of provinces and counties are different from those of cities, townships, and towns. Provinces and counties are both agents and representatives of the central government, and autonomous organizations. The authority of this agency includes supervising lower-level local autonomy. Cities, townships, and towns are both agents and representatives of the central government and autonomous organizations. The authority of this agency does not include supervising lower-level local autonomy. The central government can use administrative orders to direct provincial and municipal governments, but the target of the order is the agent or representative of the central government. The provincial government can use administrative orders to direct county and municipal governments, and the target is also the agent of the central government. The same applies to counties and townships. However, a provincial government with the nature of an autonomous organization has no subordinate relationship with county and municipal governments and, of course, has no right to direct them. A county government with the nature of an autonomous organization has no right to direct the affairs of township offices. Therefore, provincial, municipal, and county governments and township offices with the nature of autonomous organizations are not directed by anyone but are only supervised by the central government or its agents. Autonomous organizations are directly responsible to the residents.

Sixth, after the budgets, national tax sources, and autonomous tax sources of local governments are divided, the national tax sources are levied and used by the central government, and the autonomous tax sources are levied and used by the local autonomous governments. The budget of provincial local governments must be divided into two types: (1) the central government's agency and representative departments, which are a part of the national budget and have nothing to do with local residents; (2) the autonomous departments, which collect autonomous taxes and use them for local autonomous administration. Higher-level supervisory bodies only have the right to approve. As for how to collect and spend, how to use, and how to audit the final accounts, it is all the affair of the autonomous organization itself, and higher-level supervisory bodies do not need to interfere.

Seventh, centralism and decentralization. From the above analysis, from the perspective of local autonomy, we can determine the meaning of centralism and decentralization: (1) Centralism: A, many national administrative matters; B, fewer local autonomous administrative heads and local autonomous legislators are elected; C, strong supervision of local autonomy or even intervention; D, many national tax sources. (2) Decentralization: A, many local autonomous administrative matters; B, more local autonomous administrative heads and local autonomous legislators are elected; C, weak supervision of local autonomy; D, many autonomous tax sources.

Eighth, what happens when the central government and local autonomous governments dispute power? Regarding this point, in the United Kingdom and the United States, it is a matter for ordinary courts. In continental countries and other countries ruled by law, it is mostly resolved by administrative courts. Higher-level supervisory bodies cannot make decisions on such disputes by order because they are the central government. How can the central government arbitrate disputes in which it is a party?

Ninth, what governing powers do local autonomous governments have? They have: (1) executive power; (2) legislative power; (3) judicial power. However, judicial power only exists under the local autonomy system in the United States. The continental system and the systems of other countries in the world do not allow judicial power within the scope of local autonomy.

Tenth, how do local autonomous governments coordinate and exercise executive and legislative powers? In general, there are three types: (1) separation of executive and legislative institutions; (2) a mixed executive and legislative system; (3) the manager system.

Eleventh, what is the head of a local autonomous government? This certainly varies from country to country. In summary, it is nothing more than: (1) the head of the executive body; (2) the head of the executive body and the head of the legislative body; (3) the head of a mixed executive and legislative body; (4) a head standing side by side with other executive heads—such as some cities in the United States; (5) (no head)—such as counties in the United States.

Twelfth, what is the council of a local autonomous government? In summary, it is nothing more than: (1) of a legislative nature; (2) of a legislative and executive nature; (3) of an advisory nature (its resolutions are not binding on the executive body).

Thirteenth, the relationship between central and autonomous institutions. After the provincial, municipal, county governments and township offices are separated into two institutions—the heads have dual identities. In the capacity of agents and representatives of the central government, they are representatives of the central government, accept the command of the central government, use the funds of the central government, and are absolutely responsible to the central government. In addition, they represent the central government in supervising lower-level local autonomy (except for cities, townships, and towns).

But in the autonomous institution, they are public servants of the locality, complying with the resolutions of the autonomous institution, using autonomous funds, and being supervised by higher-level institutions, absolutely responsible to the voters.

The above thirteen points are the basic theories of local autonomy. Based on these basic theories, let's look at our local system:

First, Units. (1) Province—Whether a province is a local unit is, in fact, in flux. (2) City (city under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan and city under the jurisdiction of the province)—In fact, it is recognized as an independent local unit. (3) Administrative Inspectorate District—In fact, it is not recognized as a local unit, but it is not explicitly stipulated as an agent of the central government (and province). (4) County—Confirmed as a local unit. (5) District—Whether it is a local unit is unclear. (6) Township—Not fully recognized as a local unit. (7) Bao (neighborhood)—Seems to be recognized as a local unit.

Second, Organization. According to the current situation, the institutions that handle national administration and the autonomous organizations that handle local autonomous administration are not divided. Lower-level governments blindly accept unlimited supervision from higher-level governments. In fact, supervisory power and command power are inseparable. Lower-level governments do whatever the upper level orders. Moreover, the heads of the executive bodies are consistently appointed. Although there are councils at all levels and bao citizens' assemblies, they are, in fact, of an advisory nature. Third, Business. National administration and local autonomous administration have never been divided. Because they have not been divided, the central government seems to manage everything that provinces, cities, counties, townships, and towns can also manage. In fact, the central government seizes power from the provinces and cities. Whenever there is a profit to be made or something easy to handle, the central government often seizes it from the provinces and cities. Provinces are helpless against the central government and, in turn, seize what counties and cities under provincial jurisdiction manage. Finally, it reaches the townships. Townships are units that are exploited at every level. Therefore, townships have no local autonomous administrative matters to handle. In fact, all they handle are national administrative matters that the county government cannot handle, such as urging the collection of grain and raising national debt. Provinces, cities, counties, townships, and towns have never had strict and accurate budgets. Occasionally, there are some that are mostly drafted by higher-level governments. The use of the budget almost entirely depends on the orders of higher-level governments.

Regarding tax sources, the previously divided two-level system was not strictly implemented. The currently divided three-level system also places the tax burden heavily on the central government.

From the above three points, we can draw a conclusion about the current Chinese local political system. The current Chinese local system is, in fact, not autonomous but is an extremely centralized bureaucratic governance. However, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference on the draft constitution place the focus on the province and stipulate that the provincial governor be elected. This view tends toward extreme local decentralization. If the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are followed, China will inevitably have a central government like that of the Spring and Autumn period and the distorted states of America in a few years. Implementing this system in China is truly dangerous. Not leaning toward centralism nor leaning toward decentralization is truly "Our Proposed Local System."

### Nationals and National Products

— Lin Han

The editors of this publication once used "Using National Products is Most Glorious" as a slogan to awaken national awareness. Purchasing and using national products is a glorious act of patriotism. To ensure that domestic industries stand firm, that the country does not become a consumer market for foreign countries, and that the blood and sweat of the people are not absorbed and devoured by the great powers, we must, as a principle, purchase and use national products. With what I know, I will briefly elaborate on this.

Reviewing the statistics of import and export goods for the past six months, we cannot help but shudder. Foreign goods are pouring in like a tide, while export goods are as rare as phoenix feathers. The numbers in the deficit are truly staggering! Previously, what we considered the most reliable capital for competing in foreign markets, such as tung oil, tea, and silk, is now unprofitable due to high costs, leading to hesitation and an inability to obtain foreign exchange. If this continues, what can we do except borrow to fill the imbalance of imports and exports? From the perspective of domestic industries, due to domestic political instability, the inability to restore transportation, soaring prices, and excessive imports, products cannot be exported, resulting in most factories being on the verge of unsustainable difficulties. In addition, the Chinese people wholeheartedly worship foreign goods, considering using foreign goods to be fashionable and noble, causing valuable foreign exchange to be wasted in vain, and striking a blow to domestic industries, whose sales are bleak. The most serious consequence is the total collapse of domestic industries and the total collapse of the national economy.

In fact, although foreign goods have the merits of being cheap and of good quality, many are not as good as their reputation. The main reason they are popular is the foreign brand labeled "USA" or "British Made." Moreover, the foreign goods that flood the market are mostly unnecessary items such as decorations, entertainment products, and food products, which are most attractive, leading people to extravagance and waste without realizing it, and further generating a psychology of despising and looking down on national products. Although the prices of national products are extremely low and suitable for the economic capabilities of ordinary people, they are gradually becoming unwanted. Originally, the target market for national products was the cities and vast rural areas. If we can grasp this only large market that can absorb national products, then national products will naturally sell well, and domestic industries will naturally prosper. However, at present, the rehabilitation has not been completed, and transportation is obstructed. National products that are produced from factories can only be sold locally to temporarily maintain them until the environment improves and they can be expanded. Take Shanghai as an example. Shanghai is the industrial center of the country, with the highest density, the largest quantity, and the most types. At present, most of this industry also uses Shanghai as a consumer market. However, Shanghai is also the main port for foreign ships to unload goods, and Shanghai citizens are also the first to become the targets of foreign goods sales. In this way, if foreign goods want to seize the Shanghai market, coupled with the citizens' psychology of worshiping foreign goods, the fragile domestic industry will be placed in a position of being on its last breath and having no foothold.

The Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Association once launched a campaign to use national products, calling on the people to purchase and use national products as much as possible under the premise of not violating economic principles, in order to correct the psychology of extravagance, fashion, and arrogance, to encourage domestic industries in spirit, and to give domestic industries the vitality to continue and overcome serious crises in substance, so that they can sprout and grow after the environment improves. This is worthy of deep reflection by patriotic people!

I remember that when I first arrived in Shanghai, I heard a citizen say something that was absolutely true. That is, before the victory, Japanese expatriates lived mostly in Hongkou, where they had their stores selling Japanese goods shipped from Japan. At that time, the Japanese housewives living in the former French Concession area often took a soy sauce bottle in the morning, took the tram to Hongkou to buy domestic soy sauce. It is said that they did not do it because there were no soy sauce shops near their homes or because Chinese soy sauce was not good and did not suit their taste, but because they believed that if domestic goods were available, they should buy domestic goods first. This is a very small thing, but it is very meaningful and valuable. This spirit is worthy of our emulation.

### The Origin of Industrial Rationalization

— Shao Qiu

Industrial rationalization is "scientific management." The United States, an advanced industrial country, noticed this early. In 1920, the American Industrial Association initiated a joint public-private "Waste Elimination Movement," specifically conducting detailed surveys on six major industries: clothing, printing, construction, textiles, shoemaking, and metals. The purpose of the survey was to save on some of the waste that occurred in the incomplete industrial organizations (i.e., current industrial organizations are prone to speculation and overproduction), labor mobility, labor-management conflicts, interruptions in fuel and power supply, seasonal changes in the supply and demand of goods and production, the lack of standardization of product sizes, and production processes and raw material handling.

According to the published survey reports, the proportion of waste that can be eliminated is 64% for the clothing industry, 58% for the printing industry, 53% for the construction industry, 49% for the textile industry, 41% for the shoemaking industry, and 29% for the metal industry, with an average of 49% for all American industries.

As for the Waste Elimination Movement, it was implemented in an organized manner based on the eleven guidelines determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The eleven guidelines are described below:

1. Eliminate waste in railway transportation, and actively seek policies to utilize appropriate equipment and better methods.

2. In order to economically transport large quantities of scattered goods, the transportation links between inland rivers must be greatly improved.

3. Implement nationwide electrification to achieve great savings in fuel, power, and labor.

4. Efforts should be made to alleviate the seasonal unemployment caused by the economic cycle and find appropriate means and methods.

5. The government's statistical work must be improved, and statistics on production, sales, inventory, and prices should be collected both domestically and abroad in order to eliminate commercial risks and suppress speculative buying and selling based on reckless predictions.

6. The need for and supply of labor in construction projects, the coal mining industry, and other industries change significantly due to seasonal prosperity and idleness, and efforts should be made to reduce this.

7. Standardize the formats, sizes, and shapes of commodities to eliminate waste in manufacturing and sales. At the same time, manufacturing methods, freight bills, bills of lading, etc. should be changed to a fixed format.

8. In order to discover labor savings and more advanced manufacturing and sales methods, scientific research institutions for industrial economics should be developed.

9. In order to reduce the waste associated with the sale of agricultural products, implement a joint sales method and improve the equipment of agricultural product loading and unloading docks.

10. In order to save litigation costs, a commercial arbitration system should be developed.

11. Labor-management coordination should be used to eliminate the waste caused by disputes between the two parties.

After the Industrial Rationalization Movement was launched, the United States implemented it most vigorously. From the perspective of the comprehensive progress of production capacity of the entire American industry, it had increased to 98.2% in 1938 and to 110.9% in 1940.

### Water Gate Used in a Canadian Paper Mill

It is said that there are many water gates like this in the Quebec area. On the one hand, it adjusts the water level and transports the wood used for paper making to the workshop, and on the other hand, it can also be used as motive power. (Photo taken and sent by the New York Times)

United States

### Factory Health Facilities

— Jia Ling

The health of workers is directly related to productivity, so health facilities in factories cannot be ignored. The statistics of health facilities in 1,237 factories in New Jersey, which were investigated by the U.S. Industrial Health Office last year, are translated and excerpted below for the reference of the industry.

These 1,000+ factories have a total of 674,106 workers. Among them, the steel, chemical, and machinery industries are the largest in scale, and the transportation, electrical, and chemical industries employ the most workers. Factories with more than 1,000 employees account for one-tenth of the total, and factories with less than 250 employees account for two-thirds. The ratio of the total number of male and female workers is about two to one (two male workers to one female worker).

(1) Factory Doctors—176 factories, accounting for 14% of the total, have doctors who are stationed in the factory or come to the factory for several hours of consultation every day.

(2) Nurses—There are 364 factories that employ nurses, accounting for 30% of the total.

Large and large-scale factories employ doctors and nurses, while small factories do not have these facilities. Therefore, the number of workers who can receive free medical care accounts for 60% to 80% of the total. Among the total of 977 nurses in the factories, about 80% are graduates of formal nursing schools, and the rest are mostly non-graduates who only work as nurses.

(3) Physical Examination—About one-third of the factories (35%) have all workers undergo physical examinations, one-eighth of the factories have some workers undergo examinations, and most of the others do not conduct physical examinations.

(4) Pharmacies—Factories with one or more rooms used as pharmacies account for two-thirds of the total.

### The Unemployed in the United States

— Fei Jiao

Six Million People Receive Government Subsidies

The unemployment situation in the United States has become a mystery due to the contradictory figures released. The contradictory figures are—

According to estimates by the "Bureau of the Census," there were 2.71 million people in the country looking for jobs in February of this year. This estimate is based on a survey of 25,000 households.

Other government agencies reported that during the same period, a total of 3.5 million people across the country received unemployment subsidies because they did not have suitable jobs, of which 1.281 million were veterans.

The difference between these two statistics is 800,000. Taking other factors into account, the actual difference may be even greater. Therefore, the unemployment situation in the United States is roughly as follows.

Of the veterans who have recently retired, 2 million have not yet entered the "labor market." Some of them are choosing a career, some are on vacation, and some are vacationing. If these 2 million people are added to the previous 3.5 million people, then the number of people in the United States receiving unemployment benefits will total 5.5 million.

Only three out of about five unemployed workers in the United States are eligible to receive unemployment benefits. Others are not eligible for benefits because they have worked for too few years or for other reasons. Some workers will have their benefits canceled next year. In this way, the actual number of unemployed will increase by another 500,000 compared to the existing statistics.

Therefore, we can say that the total number of unemployed workers in the United States is currently 6 million.

### General Introduction to Business Management

— Xu Baiyi

(1) Male and Female Workers

Regarding the length of service between male and female workers, statistics in the United States show that the longest period a male worker stays in a factory is twenty to thirty years, while for female workers, the longest is five to eight years. This is because some female workers are unwilling to continue working after marriage. From this perspective, it seems female workers are inferior to male workers. However, in fact, female workers also have their advantages. A male worker often likes to change his occupation, sometimes several times a year. A female worker, on the other hand, can steadily work for three to four years. Therefore, employing female workers also has its benefits, although it requires a longer training period.

(2) Overtime and Night Work

In many factories, due to the heavy workload, daytime workers cannot cope. Therefore, there are two solutions: one is for daytime workers to work overtime at night, and the other is to hire another group of workers to do night work. However, most workers prefer daytime work. If it were not for income reasons, they would not be willing to work at night. If there are two shifts of workers in a factory, many workers would hope to work during the day. But from the perspective of a manufacturer, if the goods produced are indeed needed in the market, then using both day and night shifts is more cost-effective. Usually, wages for night work are higher than those for day work, but the expected output for night work can be less than that for day work because working at night is not as easy as during the day. Also, due to the negligence of supervision, many damaged goods are often produced at night. Therefore, to avoid damage and improve work efficiency, there should be perfect supervision methods during night work.

(3) Workers' Interest in the Enterprise

In the past, employing workers was solely based on the perspective of the enterprise organization, without considering the interests of the workers. Now, the focus should shift, and the welfare of the workers should also be taken into account. In an enterprise organization, whether one is a shareholder, director, staff member, or worker, everyone hopes that the management can operate effectively and generate profits. After profits are obtained, they hope that these profits can be distributed to everyone, and workers should also enjoy a portion of these profits. When workers receive these benefits, they will naturally develop an interest in the factory they serve and work hard. This method has always been practiced in Chinese enterprises, but the only question is the amount of distribution.

Another method is to solicit workers' opinions so that they can also contribute to improvements in the manufacturing process. In general, a committee can be established, such as a welfare committee, with funding from a portion of each worker's monthly salary as membership fees, and additional funds allocated by the enterprise organization to enrich the funds. In addition to handling various welfare activities, this committee can also accept workers' suggestions for work improvement. After receiving the suggestions, they should be carefully considered, and if they can be implemented and proven successful, the workers should be given appropriate compensation. This can make them develop an interest in the enterprise organization. The closer the relationship and the stronger the emotional ties between workers and the enterprise organization, the more work efficiency can be improved. This kind of psychological construction should be considered.

The "riveting" of various parts of trains has now been gradually completely changed to "welding."

The United States now has approximately 31,000 miles of railroad with steel rails weighing 130 pounds per yard; fifty years ago, the heaviest steel rail weighed 80 pounds per yard.

Spring and Autumn

### Facing the Rainy Season—Notes from a Trip to Yunnan—Part 1

— Lin Yongquan

Due to the introduction of a fellow traveler, and due to the beautiful name—Cui Lake's enchanting allure; upon arriving here, I first chose a temporary residence in a small lakeside hotel—the Cui Lake Hotel. Wanting to admire more of the lake's objects and borrowing the lake's beautiful ambiance and verdant color to cleanse the dust of the journey—mostly spiritual; I rented a room on the third floor that could overlook two directions. "Look!" When, driven by a kind of insatiable and even more curious desire, I hurriedly opened all the windows; I couldn't help but shout like this, often shouting like this.

Outside the window, along the long street, along the road paved purely with stone slabs—East Cui Lake Road. Across the road is the Cui Lake's verdant lawn; the Cui Lake's deep green water; the Cui Lake's soft green weeping willows draped on both sides of the road; and each pavilion and islet that mutually reflect these hues of green; bridge arches and bay embankments are all displayed before your eyes, looming before your eyes.

Because it is the normal rainy season—summer here is called the rainy season, and winter is called the windy season—so I often admire the rainy scenery on the lake. Often, on a clear sunny day, suddenly from an unknown wisp of cloud, a long stream of rain pours down. The dazzling sunlight, however, shines like a mirror from all around. The even rain threads clearly slant towards the ground. Even from an unknown place in the sky, a team of small wind musicians is summoned, cheerfully blowing the clouds away; shifting the rain's vault, and the clouds gradually turn black, forming a large mass, like a black curtain, like a black mountain range with many trees. The rain falls in a fluttering, playful, sometimes urgent, sometimes intermittent manner.

Pedestrians are often ambushed by the rain. When you occasionally feel a gust of wind blowing and many pedestrians are running hurriedly, you know that the rain is coming. Similarly, every running person will naturally shout with passion: "The rain is coming! The rain is coming!" But the swift raindrops have already fallen without hesitation like shooting stars on their hair, foreheads, and rain-soaked clothes. But sometimes, when they run to their door, to a place to shelter from the rain, panting and congratulating themselves on avoiding the rain, the cloud formation in the sky has just dissipated and disappeared. The hot sun shines again on the earth. They busily wipe away the raindrops and then wipe away the sweat.

Sometimes, a thin cloud, with the assistance of a bustling wind group, immediately spreads into a sky-covering haze, and passionate rain falls; affectionate rain; large-scale rain, almost like rain at night, causes the ground to converge into countless rivers and swamps, isolating the countryside from the city.

Especially on moonlit nights, under the pure, bright moonlight, a large strand of clear, silvery rain money often hangs down. Like a sparse curtain, like rows of slender willow branches in the misty spring morning, hiding garden pavilions and terraces, the difference being that there is also the sound of rustling and gurgling, often giving those who enjoy the rain on moonlit nights endless and wonderful imaginations.

The summer here is so lovely, so lively, and so changeable! "Have you ever been here? Have you ever been greeted by the coolness of the hot summer here?"

### Midday Meal

— Geng Yu

One autumn afternoon, two guests came to Mei Fang's house: one was her aunt, and the other was her aunt's daughter, Hui Fang. They were wearing makeup and dressed fashionably. The cousins, who usually didn't interact much, initially looked at each other, but then, following the conversation between their mothers and aunts, they somehow started talking about small things. Then, they shook hands, put their arms around each other's shoulders, and looked and played outside together, becoming very intimate. Mei Fang even led them to visit a nearby small school, becoming as close as could be.

"The school there has bigger school buildings, and the classrooms aren't as comfortable as ours!" Hui Fang said when they returned from the school.

"Well, do you have a playground?"

"We don't need a playground."

They both boasted about how good their own schools were, but neither of them had thought that there was a more beautiful place than their own schools. The aunt wanted to discuss her daughter's admission problem with her brother-in-law.

Brother-in-law! Mei Fang's father was a teacher. In ordinary times, "scholars are useless," and no matter how noble a teacher's character or how profound his learning, it was still not easy for him to be respected. Now, perhaps it was the turning of the tide. Although teachers continue to endure painful lives, they are gradually being respected in spirit. "Isn't that so? Most schools are very crowded this semester. Hui Fang hasn't chosen a school yet..." Hui Fang's mother ran excitedly to her sister's house.

When it was time for lunch, the brother-in-law returned from a nearby school. Hearing that his niece wanted to enroll, he readily agreed to find a way to arrange it for her. At the same time, because it was inconvenient to go back and forth, she wanted to have lunch at the school. In principle, this midday meal should be eaten at her sister's house, but it wasn't just for a day or two. Hui Fang's mother was embarrassed to bring it up, but finally talked about this issue.

"There are people who have lunch at the school, but the food is really bland. I'm afraid she won't be used to it," the sister said frankly, thinking of the facts.

"Then, can she eat with her uncle? We'll pay for the meal at the same rate as the school. Fortunately, it's just one more person, Hui Fang," Hui Fang's mother thought that her brother-in-law could agree.

"No, it's not a matter of money. To be honest, we don't have servants here, and we're really too busy. Sometimes when it's windy or raining, no one goes to the market to buy fresh vegetables. We rely on some dried vegetables at mealtimes. How can a child eat that?" The brother-in-law knew Hui Fang's family's living situation and was afraid that he wouldn't have good things for Hui Fang to eat, making others laugh.

"..." Hui Fang's mother didn't expect that her words would be rejected and was speechless for a moment. Her mouth was a little dazed. She thought to herself: "It's really hard to figure out the psychology of scholars. They always talk in a hesitant way!"

The brother-in-law knew that Hui Fang's mother was angry and thought: "Since we are relatives, if I refuse outright, the neighbors may gossip." So he said to Hui Fang's mother: "Let's do this. It's hot now, so she can eat at our house. When the weather cools down, we'll think of another way."

"Okay, we'll pay for the meals in the same way." After the matter was discussed and a result was reached, Hui Fang's mother thought on the way home: "Respect teachers, respect teachers! We've all become as proud as upstarts because of the teachers. It turns out they're still so poor!"

The next day, Mei Fang's mother went to the market to buy groceries, and Hui Fang started having lunch at her uncle's house. It was the first meal that she was paying for. Hui Fang looked around the table and felt that the dishes were simpler than yesterday's. Naturally, yesterday was a guest meal, and today it was a home-style meal. However, although it was a home-style meal, after Hui Fang joined, this home-style meal was different from usual.

The uncle thought: "Even if it's a home-style meal, I should teach the children the rules of eating." He sat at the head of the table, his wife sat on the left, Mei Fang was older and sat on the right, and he asked Hui Fang to sit at the foot of the table. Hui Fang saw that her uncle's attitude was different from yesterday's. She thought: "I'm paying for the meal. Could it be that my cousin is my uncle's biological daughter?" She got angry.

The dishes were two meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and a soup. The soup was in the middle, and the two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes were diagonally opposite each other, arranged very evenly. The yellow croaker was considered the best dish. Before her uncle could pick up his chopsticks, Hui Fang had already set her sights on it. She raised her small hand and reached far to eat the yellow croaker exclusively, as if she wanted to stuff it all into her stomach in one bite. The uncle never advocated that children move the dishes they like to eat and was embarrassed to speak out, he just looked at her, glaring at her, but Hui Fang didn't care. "We're paying for it," she thought.

On the third day, the aunt didn't go to the market because there were still some of the two yellow croakers she had bought yesterday, mixed with some garden vegetables, which was enough to make up the dishes on the table. However, Hui Fang's taste buds were very sensitive. As soon as she tasted it, she felt that the yellow croaker wasn't freshly cooked. She whispered in Mei Fang's ear, but Mei Fang couldn't hear it, so she didn't say anything. The aunt understood what she meant, but there was nothing she could do. Because the dishes didn't suit her taste, Hui Fang ate one less bowl of rice. The uncle said: "Eating shouldn't be too much or too little. Having a fixed amount for each meal is a good hygienic habit." She didn't understand what her uncle meant and thought that her uncle was saying that she ate too much. "We're paying for it," she thought.

On Saturday afternoon, Mei Fang followed Hui Fang to her aunt's house to play. The aunt said: "Mei Fang! Good! Come eat a meal at our house. Although we're poor, we don't care about eating more or less." Mei Fang didn't understand what her aunt meant, but she understood that there seemed to be a hidden barb in her words.

"Mei Fang! When you eat, you give the stinky yellow croaker to the guests and ask them to sit at the end of the table. After all, you scholars pay attention to etiquette!" The aunt thought that Mei Fang didn't understand, so she simply revealed it plainly.

Mei Fang didn't know how to answer, so she let her aunt say it herself. After finishing dinner, she bid farewell to her aunt and returned home. As soon as she got home, she told her mother what her aunt had said. Her mother was also angry, but because they were close relatives, she didn't express it and let Mei Fang say it herself.

Saturday evening was the uncle's leisure time. As soon as he heard these words, his pleasant face immediately turned serious.

"Mei Fang! Who told you to go to their house?" Mei Fang didn't answer. The uncle paced back and forth in the room.

On Monday morning, Mei Fang's mother went to the market again to prepare her niece's midday meal. Her idea was that face was the most important thing. Since her younger sister had this kind of thinking, she had to endure as much as possible so that they wouldn't laugh at her. That noon, the dishes had been arranged comfortably. Mei Fang's mother brought up a dish of preserved grapes that her uncle liked to eat and then shrank back. The uncle said:

"Preserved grapes? Very good, why are you taking them back?"

"If Hui Fang sees them, won't she say they're stinky again?" Mei Fang's mother said.

"What are you afraid of! In wealth, act according to wealth; in poverty, act according to poverty. If you want to eat good things, go to a restaurant every day!" The uncle seemed to have some complaints.

"Aren't the dishes good today?" Mei Fang also interjected.

"Children shouldn't talk too much. We eat fish and meat, and you also eat fish and meat; we chew on vegetable roots, and you also chew on vegetable roots. What's the point of carrying words back and forth and stirring up trouble?" The uncle interrupted Mei Fang's words and stared at her fiercely. Hui Fang also stole a glance at her uncle, feeling the majesty of her uncle's eyes. She wanted to speak, but was a little afraid, and finally finished the meal in silence. As she was leaving, she said softly to her aunt:

"Mom said that we can afford a maid. Starting tomorrow, we'll have the maid deliver meals to eat every day. I won't come here to eat anymore." After speaking, she ran to school. Mei Fang's mother felt relieved and also felt an nameless pain.

One Friday a month later was the anniversary of the grandmother's death. Because the grandmother had no sons, the sacrificial rites were all handled by her daughters. That day, Mei Fang's mother enshrined the grandmother's portrait. After she and Hui Fang bowed, she also went to school to call Hui Fang. Hui Fang didn't know what was happening and ran over excitedly. When she saw the grandmother's picture, she stared blankly. She thought:

"This kind and amiable old lady is my grandmother! Why is Mei Fang's house also enshrining her?"

"Hui Fang! You should pay your respects to your grandmother! It turns out that you and Mei Fang have the same grandmother!" Mei Fang's mother explained.

After Hui Fang stood at attention and bowed to her grandmother's portrait, she retreated step by step, wanting to return to school.

"Hui Fang! You should have lunch here today!"

Hui Fang looked at her grandmother's portrait, her legs naturally stopped, and her eyes also unconsciously became wet.

Fang Dike (Van Dyck 1599—1641) was a student of Rubens. At the age of thirty, he was hired by the British government as a court painter, creating many portraits and can be called an excellent painter of Flanders. The style is gentle and simple, which can also be seen in this simple quick sketch. (Lion)

### On "Metaphor" from an Aesthetic Point of View

— Shusun Ru

Mr. Zang Kejia, in his article "Metaphor in Literary Works," cited many vivid and interesting examples, illustrating the importance of metaphor in literary works. This article is certainly not only, as Mr. Zang said, "a little useful" for those who "call butterflies sisters and greet the moon as an older sister, degrading the value of metaphor too much." For young people engaged in literary creation, it is indeed a compass.

Metaphor, in rhetoric and in the technique of literary creation, does have its important place, but from the aesthetic point of view, "metaphor" is an ambiguously meaningful term. The general understanding of metaphor only extends to the experiential and common-sense meanings, failing to analyze and study it theoretically and scientifically.

II

Let's look at the examples cited by Mr. Zang: "Hands like tender scallions, skin like condensed fat" is a metaphor, which uses one thing to express another thing; "As if someone owes you two hundred coins" is a metaphor, which uses a fact to express an expression; "Using the thumb and forefinger of the left and right hands to make a circle" is a metaphor, which uses a hand gesture to express something in the mind. Regardless of what these examples use to express what, they all use something that is commonly known to express a specific thing seen in someone's mind (an image in the mind produced by intuition).

Everyone has his own life history and personality, so he will inevitably have different mental images for the same thing. For example, for the common intuition of time, to you it is "time flies like an arrow," to him it is "time flies like a white colt passing through a crack," and to another person who is often alone, it is "days are like years."

Metaphor is the expression of mental images, which is the expression of intuition.

III

Why use metaphor?

It is to have a clearer intuition and mental image (that is, expression), especially to make one's intuition and mental image infect others (that is, communication).

And the purpose of literary works is to express and communicate. Therefore, the task of metaphor is also the task of literary creation. Metaphor is literary creation. To talk about metaphor is to talk about the basic principles of literary creation, that is, to talk about the entirety of literary creation.

The play "Sunrise" (by Cao Yu) is a literary work and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes the dark side of urban life. The poem "The Black Hand of Sin" (by Zang Kejia) is a literary work and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes the true face of corrupt religion. In terms of extension, the greatness of metaphor can reach this extent.

"Flower" is a single word and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes an organ of a plant. "Pain" is a noun and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes a special feeling that a living thing has due to a certain stimulus. "Just like a river of spring water flowing eastward" is a sentence and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes the nature and quantity of an emotion. In terms of extension, the smallness of metaphor can reach this extent.

In terms of extension, literary works and metaphor naturally cannot be the same, but in terms of connotation, literary works are metaphor, and metaphor is literary works. There can be no difference between the two.

IV

Metaphor can also be replaced by "imagery." To express something with imagery is to express it with metaphor. "Have you seen how those who catch chickens at night grab the chicken by the feet? They are caught like that." This is an image-based technique and also a metaphor technique. Metaphor can also be replaced by "typicality." Ah Q is a typical character and also cannot not be a metaphor. He metaphorically describes the entirety of Chinese people who are similar to this type.

Metaphor, imagery, typicality—this series of commonly used terms in literary theory are just one-sided views of literary works. From a certain aspect, a literary work is a metaphor, is imagery, is typicality, but from the whole, it is nothing more than expression and communication.

It is not useless to study the one-sided nature of literary works, but if one is limited to this one-sided study, one will inevitably fall into error. The blind men "feeling the plate and examining the candle" are mistaken in their one-sided observations. Therefore, when we study the aspect of "metaphor," we must not neglect the study of the whole, and we must not neglect the most basic "expression" and "communication."

### A Drop of Blood for Every Inch of Our Land 117

— Ye Jingfeng

He Jian bowed three times, performing the ritual, and then, according to Japanese custom, offered a few words of greeting before accepting the book. He held it in his hands, and it turned out that what Jinshu had just recited at length was precisely Volume Six of the "National Language," where Duke Huan of Qi and Guan Zhong discussed their plans for invading the south, attacking the north, conquering the east, and pacifying the west. The "boom ji jiao" and so on were simply "Duke Huan said," and so on. Why did he choose this particular passage to recite? The intention was likely to tell the elder statesmen that their current all-out invasion, their preparation to conquer the world, was based on the aggressive policies of Duke Huan of Qi, one of the "Five Hegemons," as recorded in the classics. Now that Pingzi had not been captured, he could only let He Jian relay the message.

They wanted to convey their invasion plans to the elder statesmen; did they still fear that no one would officially speak on their behalf? This illustrates that all Japanese actions are "deceptive." His gesture could be considered a minor self-inflicted hardship tactic or a "using frankness to deceive gentlemen" strategy, making an open discussion more effective than direct lobbying. Moreover, since Saionji was elderly and an independent figure, knowing that someone was spreading the word that their group could still uphold the teachings of the classics would be enough to satisfy him without requiring him to take matters too seriously.

He Jian read the entire passage word by word. Although he understood the general meaning, his lack of effort in studying classical Chinese meant that he didn't recognize a large number of characters, and the writing was so ancient and concise that it was like "a Shandong man eating wheat in winter" – incomprehensible. At the time, he could only explain to Jinwei that the writing in the book was ancient and profound, and he could only understand a general meaning. Upon hearing this, Jinwei even mimicked the gestures of characters in ancient dramas, stroking his whiskers and laughing heartily. The word "stroking" isn't quite appropriate here, as his small "Ren Dan" mustache was too short to stroke; he could only make a stroking expression.

"He Jian-kun," he finally glanced at He Jian, "To truly walk the path of a soldier, one must read the 'Sacred Texts' to achieve greatness!... I know you are a useful talent, so I offer this sincere advice: While establishing merit and building a career, you must also study more books of sages;... Like me, who am now occupied with 'ten thousand matters daily,' I still find time to recite one or two chapters of the Sacred Texts every day. This is one method, as Mencius said, 'to nourish my vast, righteous spirit.'"…

I can only briefly record a few of Jinwei's words here. In reality, what He Jian heard that day was more than a hundred times as much. He babbled on for half an hour, and most of the phrases he used were in classical Chinese. The so-called classical Chinese was the ancient style of language transported from China before the Tang and Song dynasties, a Japanese-style ancient language with countless empty words like "zhi hu ye zhe" added to show off his literary knowledge. After this dramatic scene played out, he then asked He Jian when he returned from the mainland, why he returned, and why he wanted to join the Black Dragon Society, and so on. Finally, he got to the main point, instructing He Jian to describe truthfully what happened that night at the "Xinlv" dance hall when he met Pingzi.

He Jian was a clever and alert character. Hearing Jinwei's tone, he already knew that his every move in the dance hall and Pingzi's questions and answers must have been investigated and recorded. When answering, he absolutely couldn't lie, nor could he add or subtract a single word. He hid the secret of the cigarette case and the telegram in the car, and told everything else that happened, start to finish. However, he was very surprised at how powerful these German fifth columnists were. Thinking back, his words and actions with Pingzi seemed absolutely cautious, and he seemed to have been constantly vigilant, and no one had come near him within a possible distance.

While He Jian was speaking, Jinwei closed his eyes to rest and listened attentively. After He Jian finished speaking, Jinwei simply gestured, beckoning a concubine to come over and whispering a sentence. The concubine immediately turned and went to the side of the gallery. A few minutes later, she brought out a stack of documents and offered them to Jinwei. Jinwei took them, flipped through a few pages, and then had the concubine hand the documents to He Jian. At the same time, he said to He Jian, "You are an honest and alert young man, and you didn't deceive me. That's commendable. However, according to this report, the small paper in the cigarette case had no visible writing on it. It was written with special ink. According to this newly added report, the shape of the paper has changed, and there are traces of active pencil writing, which does not resemble Nakamura Pingzi's handwriting. The pencil's ink color and thickness are exactly the same as those used by the Department. How do you explain this problem? Moreover, the words on the paper don't seem to have any deep meaning. Did you forge them?... You should first read these reports carefully and then answer truthfully!"

### Three Poems

— Shusun Ruying

November

Last night, November strolled in

A slight chill pressed down on the withered branches

A northern wind blows the day white

A stone beach chokes the upper reaches of the Yangtze River

Rainy Night

The owl's cry in the middle of the night awakens deep thoughts

Nightmares block out the eyes of nostalgia

Light the candle that has not been extinguished for long

Listen to the cold rain falling sadly in the courtyard

A Distant View

One expanse of clear water is the calm sea

Two white sails are floating clouds in the sky

Behind the mountain hangs a bright rainbow

A faint tenderness rises in the human heart

Free Talk

### Fighting

— Shaofu

Life is unstable, prices are rising daily, the political situation needs to be clarified, and the flames of war have not ceased in various places. More than a year has passed since the victory. In such a situation, everyone is distressed and irritable, inevitably suffering from liver fire and a bad temper. The prevalence of fighting can be said to have good reason.

As for the all-out martial arts battles on the sports field, they were already common before the war, which is truly a shameful page in the history of Chinese sports. Foreigners value sportsmanship, while we must have a fight to settle things. This kind of sporting event is better replaced by simple brawls, why still use ball games as a facade?

In the Shanghai Seven University Football League, on the first day, Fudan played against Hujiang, and a scene of mixed punches and umbrellas occurred. Whether the competition will continue is yet to be seen. If it does, players and spectators alike will probably have to wear full steel helmets and armor, otherwise, a head-bashing disaster will be hard to avoid.

The purpose of a ball game is to exercise, to strengthen the body. Winning and losing are not the goal, and they shouldn't be valued above all else. If everyone could recognize this, these unpleasant events would not happen again. In fact, everyone understands this principle, but no one is willing to be indifferent to winning or losing, and the desire to win naturally often leads to transgressions.

Shanghai is the focus of national attention. Can the Seven Universities especially restrain themselves in this regard and demonstrate morality on the playing field, setting an example for other places?

Living Drama

### So That's How It Is

— An

In a Route 15 trolleybus, a sharp voice suddenly cried out.

"Pickpocket! Touching pockets!"

The person shouting was an apprentice, about eighteen or nineteen years old.

"What are you talking about? Little rascal, looking for a slap in the face!"

The person who said this was a man in his thirties or forties, wearing a woolen overcoat and jodhpurs, tall and with a fierce look on his face.

"You still want to deny it? The bill has already been taken out by you. I grabbed your hand. You still want to deny it?"

"Get out of here with your nonsense, or I'll slap you!" The man raised his hand, making a gesture as if to hit someone.

At this point, everyone on the bus noticed the two of them.

"These pickpockets are really hateful, specializing in touching people's pockets when there are many people," a young man said.

At this time, a young man in a suit pointed at the man and asked:

"What business do you do? What's your name?"

"It's none of your business. Who are you? What gives you the right to question me?" the man replied.

"Why can't I question you? What business do you do?" The man in the suit took a step forward, pressing the question harder.

"I... I sell leather. I'm in the leather business," the man began to answer hesitantly.

"Do you have an ID card? Take it out and let's see."

"I forgot... I forgot to bring it."

"Let's go to the station." The young man in the suit grabbed the man by the collar, and then turned around and asked the apprentice:

"How much money do you have in your pocket?"

"About sixty or seventy thousand."

At this moment, the trolleybus had arrived at the Longmen Road station and stopped. The ticket seller casually opened the door.

"Let's go to the station. Let's go to the station." The young man in the suit, grabbing the man by the collar, also said to the apprentice:

"You come along too. Is there anyone willing to be a witness? Come along too!"

Everyone on the bus looked at each other. No one answered, and there was not a sound.

The young man in the suit took the man and the apprentice off the bus together. I also got off the bus because I had reached my destination.

At this time, the young man in the suit was still aggressive, pulling the man and the apprentice-like person closely behind him.

After walking a few steps, the man twisted his body and said:

"Third Brother, that's enough! My hand hurts."

The young man in the suit looked behind him and let go. And the apprentice took a step forward, and the three walked in a row.

I felt strange and followed them, walking east.

Before long, I saw two people in front, running very fast, and seeing the three of them, they greeted them, saying:

"Business is good today, very successful."

At the same time, the five walked together. I recognized them: the two people were the ones who had just been cursing the pickpocket on the trolleybus.

Thinking carefully, it turned out that all five of them were scoundrels, staging an amusing drama on the trolleybus, deliberately creating a scene to attract the attention of passengers, and taking the opportunity to pick pockets.

So that's how it is. The methods are getting more and more sophisticated!

### Liu Zhaodi and Xie Yibing in "Iron Bones and an Ice Heart"

### The Origin of "Ah San"

— Hu Deling

On page 6 of the December 2nd edition of Shen Bao, there was a feature article on police administration in the winter defense, which included a passage stating that the former Indian constables were all burly men with full beards and red turbans, which contrasted with their brown-black skin... "Ah San" became a synonym for Indian constables, but its origin is unknown.

As far as the author knows, the reason why Indian constables are called "Ah San" or "Red-Headed Ah San" is that in the past, during the concession era, police stations were commonly called patrol rooms, and the head of the Indian constables was usually a Western police officer of British nationality. They spoke to the Indian constables in English, and the first sentence they often used was "I say..." meaning "Hey"—a way to get someone's attention before starting a conversation. In the early days, when English was not very common, the average citizen living in the concession did not know English, and when they heard Western police officers talking to Indian constables, the opening was always "I say," and they mistakenly thought it was the Indian constable's name. The sound of "I say" was similar to "Ah San," so the rumor spread, and everyone called the Indian constables "Ah San."

Now that the concessions have been recovered and police power unified, Indian constables and Vietnamese constables of different nationalities have resigned one after another. The name "Ah San" for Indian constables has also become a historical term.

Shanghai Cross-Section

### The Organization of Beggars 10

— Huang Jiamo

Mr. Nanguo

Western bands are a new product that has come east with the wind. Shanghai families inevitably use both Chinese and Western bands for weddings and funerals. Because Chinese music is mostly silk and bamboo music, while Western music has a majestic sound, it creates a very lively atmosphere when mixed together in red and white ceremonial processions, even if it is incongruous. This is considered quite satisfactory to extravagant families. Last month, there were many Western bands available for hire at any time. They all had the same uniforms and hats, which is where they were neater than Chinese bands. As for whether the played melodies were "pleasant to the ear," no one cared.

Because wedding and funeral ceremonies had to be scheduled on auspicious days, everyone needed Western bands on the same auspicious day, suddenly creating a sense of being overwhelmed. The people in the bands embraced the philosophy of "accepting all comers." After accepting business, they realized that the number of people was limited and difficult to distribute. Therefore, they had a wild idea to divide the original two bands into three, and the missing members were filled by recruiting old beggar brothers to play the sheng, thus expanding the original three bands into five, and the original four bands into six. Usually, each band had eight or nine members, but now they used a basic team of six people as a band, with the two or three missing members being filled by beggars. Later, this trend became increasingly popular, and a portion of the beggar gangs actually specialized in this kind of temporary short-term work. These people had to be young, well-built, and neat, certainly not the ragged beggars that we imagine. So when they put on the band uniforms, they could actually pass as real band members, and they were given various nondescript instruments to join the procession, and naturally no one could see the flaw.

The performance of this farce was naturally a complete money-making scam. The families holding the ceremonies paid according to the number of people in the band, and hiring beggars could be paid a smaller price. The profit in the middle naturally went to the band leader, and these young beggars, although they followed the band all year round, never had the chance to learn a musical skill. They are forever "Mr. Nanguo," and thinking of this kind of life is really boring enough. Those who work in this field in the gang are called "bai pao." Those who work as "bai pao" have intermittent short-term work, with many days of idleness, so their lives are very destitute. But they rely on it to avoid freezing and starving, and there is no other way to go. It is a pity to give it up, so they bear their seven-foot bodies and can be considered the pitiful insects of the beggar gang!

### "Flying into a Rage" Isn't Real

— Yu Qiang

"Flying into a rage" has become an extremely common adjective. But who has ever seen a human's hair stand on end due to emotional excitement? Scientifically speaking, "flying into a rage" is just an adjective. In fact, an angry dog or cat really can have its fur stand on end. But this is an automatic action, because around the roots of their fur, there is a small circle of involuntary muscles (that is, muscles whose activity cannot be controlled by the animal itself, such as the muscles of the human heart, stomach, etc., all belong to this category). When they are angry or frightened, the amount of adrenal secretions in the blood increases, stimulating the involuntary muscles under the hair roots to contract, so their fur stands on end. The roots of human hair do not have this kind of muscle, so they cannot perform "flying into a rage." But human hair can occasionally stand up, which is the result of static electricity, but this situation is very rare.

The hair on the top of the head has no vitality, the part with vitality is the hair root buried one-eighth of an inch under the scalp. So if you want to make your hair grow better, it is ineffective to put effort into the hair on the head. You must find a way to promote the health and vitality of the hair roots.

The lifespan of hair averages four to seven years. When the glands around the hair roots stop working, the life of that hair ends. But the glands will soon reactivate and regrow a new hair to replace it. If the glands permanently stop working, then an unsightly bald spot is created.

Some people believe that shaving makes hair grow faster, and some people believe that shaving is one of the causes of baldness—their "evidence" being that women rarely go bald, while many men do. This is because men shave too many times in their lives, while women rarely have the opportunity to cut off their hair. People with this misconception have not understood that the part that controls hair growth is the hair root, not the exposed hair. Shaving naturally does not affect the hair root, so the growth or death of hair is unrelated to haircuts. As for male baldness, in addition to the aforementioned reason of gland cessation, there is also a hereditary cause. Baldness is a hereditary factor, and like color blindness, it belongs to sex-linked inheritance. Men are twice as likely to inherit baldness as women, so there are more bald men than women.

Chinese unofficial history records that when Wu Zixu passed the Zhaoguan Pass, his hair turned completely white in one night due to worry. This is of course an exaggerated description. But worry can affect hair growth. Worry affects overall health and can cause endocrine glands to be blocked, affecting hair growth. Similarly, worry can also make hair gradually gray.

Many legends about ghosts and monsters say that after a person dies, their hair and beard can still continue to grow. This rumor is untrue. Once a person dies, all tissues in the body immediately and completely stop functioning. The heart is the first to stop, and other parts of the body may be delayed for half an hour or a little longer, but it is very brief. Sometimes, after a person dies, they are not put in a coffin for several days. At this time, we do see that the dead person's beard seems to be a little longer than when they were dying. In fact, this is an illusion. Due to the contraction of the dead person's muscles and skin, the beard appears particularly prominent, thus creating the illusion that it is "a little longer."

A scene from the movie "Waterloo Bridge"

### A Sigh

— WW

I don't need to be enfeoffed as a marquis of ten thousand households, I just want a basket full of gold bars. When a certain official takes office, like the first character in a Chinese play, he first shows "integrity," then "selflessness," and then "serving the country." Once the demonstration is over, it is taken back and put aside, and when the mask is removed, the truth is revealed. Uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces... even the wet nurse's son are placed in positions one after another. Public affairs are handled "publicly," and everything goes smoothly. The official once said to his relatives: "If I get rich, you will all get rich," truly a heartfelt sentiment.

### An Ounce of Gold, Four Ounces of Fortune

— Su Kangshi

The price of gold is jumping again, and the resulting consequences will naturally stimulate prices again!

In the ancient Chinese proverb, it is said: "An ounce of gold, four ounces of fortune." This describes how "precious" gold is. Only people with good fortune can "store gold" and "wear gold jewelry." On the contrary, people without good fortune will have the myth of "carrying gold turning into copper," so the status of gold is indeed noble!

But in this year after victory, various prices are jumping, and gold, as the leader, has not gone as crazy as prices. So before victory, an ounce of gold was still "valued," but in this year, an ounce of gold is not enough to buy even a suit, especially since rickshaw pullers and amahs are wearing extremely large rings and jewelry. So the ancient proverb "an ounce of gold, four ounces of fortune" has long been "broken" in this year!

Shanghai's speculative market, doing gold, stocks, public bonds, food, is able to stir up waves at any time and place, indeed having a unique ability. However, this year's speculative market uniquely feels that gold is dull and tasteless, which cannot but be attributed to the official suppression of sales. However, the general prices, mainly "food and clothing," have risen crazily, but there is no way to "resist" them, so the price of gold and the price of goods cannot obtain the "ratio" of pre-war.

Now, because of the frequent wars, the high prices, insufficient production, sluggish sales, the abundance of floating capital, and the devaluation of the legal tender, under all these factors, in the minds of the public, gold is still considered too cheap. Under the concept that "saving money and goods is not as good as saving gold," how can gold not cause a purchasing craze? Although there are "sales" and "suppression," the "attribution" is simply the trend that "the price of gold and the price of goods are not balanced"!

But the most terrible thing is that after the price of gold jumps, the "prices" will follow in the string, which really makes people feel very headache. The masses, the common people, are really like the pilgrims who have been caught with the golden hoop, the more they struggle, the tighter it gets, and their heads hurt so much that they are about to explode!

### Poor Sigh

— He Ge

A pair of pants and a rope, two sleeves empty, cold and icy; even three-foot-tall children laugh at me! All four elements are empty, repaying a life. With no way to go, I pretend to be a public teacher, ending up putting on airs in an old robe. I find satisfaction in seven holes and eight cracks, salvaging garbage to relieve suffering!

### Feeling

— Fang Wen

Near the Liuhe Pagoda, in the Qinwang Mountains, the roar of tigers was heard at night, alarming the residents. Now, teachers and students of Zhijiang University are trying to capture them to eliminate the tiger threat.

Students of the Biology Department of Sichuan University, in order to study the national treasure, have not only telegraphed the Wenchuan County Government to step up the capture of pandas, but have also specially built panda residences, sweeping and preparing to welcome the arrival of national guests.

The tigers of Hangzhou and the pandas of Wenchuan, although one is a pest and the other is a treasure, are united in that they cannot spend their leisurely years in the mountains again.

Low Key

### Fortune and Misfortune

— Mao Ying

The stall vendor movement has made people uneasy. Thugs are lawless, destroying the glass windows of shops everywhere, causing glass merchants to take the "opportunity" to raise prices, doubling and redoubling them. The victimized store owner says: this is an unexpected "loss," and the glass merchant says: this is an unexpected "gain"! There are many such accidents in Shanghai!

### Not Worthy of Blame

— Fang Lai

State-owned enterprises compete with the people for profit, and criticism is often added to the theory. In fact, democratic politics should take the will of the people as its will. Today, the Chinese people mostly aspire to make a fortune, and the government should follow the will of the people, taking making a fortune as a national policy, emulating the legacy of Tao Zhu, diligently seeking profit, and developing together with the people, which is no less than democratic politics, so why is it worthy of blame?

### The British Flag

— Jiesheng

In the Shenzhen incident, the British army actually "crossed the border," "beat people indiscriminately," and "swept with machine guns indiscriminately," while Hong Kong Governor and Commander-in-Chief Fisting replied, "The soldier did not receive an order to fire at the time, and only accidentally touched the trigger." We already admire the British army's strict adherence to orders, but we still have to ask the general: Was the "indiscriminate sweeping" caused by one mistake after another?

The British soldier said: "One hundred yards from the British border is considered British territory!" That's right, after "crossing the border," these one hundred yards are a "fait accompli," and outside the "border" there is still one hundred yards. One hundred yards, one hundred yards... Thus, the flag of the British Empire will never fall day or night.

### Same Winter Clothes

— Fei Ran

One radio station reported that a fashion company has women's coats made of American wolf fur for 40 to 50 million yuan each, while another radio station reported donating sets of cotton clothes and socks to refugees for 25,000 yuan per set.

### Extremely Terrible!

— Suo Bei

Nothing is more immoral than dangling people's appetites, especially when the appetites being dangled are those of public teachers!

This "wool blanket" empty soup is really dangling enough! In addition to laughing and crying, we cannot help but scold the distribution authorities: extremely terrible!
