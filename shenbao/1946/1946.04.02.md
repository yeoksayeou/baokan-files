### Chairman Chiang's Political Address at the People's Political Council: Elaborating on the Government's Post-War Measures and Emphasizing the Importance of Sino-Soviet Cooperation

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] The People's Political Council held its 18th meeting on the morning of the 1st. Chairman Chiang personally attended at 11:15 AM, stepping onto the podium amidst enthusiastic applause from the entire body, to deliver an address reporting on the government's important measures after the end of the war of resistance. He explained in detail the government's policies and handling of (1) the Northeast problem, (2) the Yining problem, and (3) the draft constitution problem. The Chairman first apologized to the Council members for his inability to attend meetings regularly and discuss matters with them over the past two weeks. He then stated that the government's important measures and goals in the six months since the end of the war of resistance have been to strive for domestic peace and stability, and to jointly seek world peace and security. After recounting important measures such as the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, and the formulation of a basic plan for reorganizing the armed forces, the Chairman explained the government's policies and handling of the Northeast problem, the Yining problem, and the draft constitution problem respectively, speaking for one hour and five minutes. After his address, Councilor Luo Xia Tian and others proposed a motion to endorse Chairman Chiang's report, which was put to a vote by the Chairman and passed. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. At 7:30 PM in the evening, the Chairman hosted a banquet for all the Council members at the Military Affairs Commission auditorium, expressing his high praise.

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 1st] In his address to the People's Political Council on the 1st, Chairman Chiang forcefully stated that Sino-Soviet cooperation is a fundamental principle for the happiness of the Far East and the entire world. He said: The Soviet Union desires peace as much as China does, and will therefore abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and its annexes, which form the basis for cooperation between the two countries.

Soviet Union Orders Troops Stationed in Northeast to Directly Negotiate with Us on Handover

Chairman Chiang stated: In its response to the Soviet Union's note regarding the withdrawal of troops, the National Government has requested the Soviet side to specify the locations from which Soviet troops will withdraw and to assist the National Army in carrying out the takeover work. He said that the Soviet Union has instructed the Northeast Soviet Military Headquarters to directly consult with General Dong Yianping on handover matters. Chairman Chiang forcefully stated that there must be no political issues in the Northeast, and pointed out that political parties or individuals who create political issues to satisfy their own interests are hindering the takeover work and increasing diplomatic difficulties. When reporting on the Ghulja Incident in early November 1944, the Chairman admitted that the situation had been extremely serious for a time. The safety of Dihua was under great threat last year. To resolve this issue, the government sent General Zhang Zhizhong to Xinjiang. As a result of discussions, an agreement including eleven points was largely reached. He pointed out that Xinjiang has close geographical and economic relations with the Soviet Union, and it is therefore important to maintain friendly relations with both Xinjiang and the Soviet Union at the same time. However, he agreed that according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Xinjiang is an integral part of China's internal affairs, and the Soviet Union will not interfere.

No Legal System Can Replace the Constitution Drafted by the National Assembly

Chairman Chiang continued, saying that the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang believed that the four resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference contradicted the constitution. He said: The Political Consultative Conference stipulated that if the Legislative Yuan loses confidence in the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan may tender its resignation or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, but the Premier of the Executive Yuan may not request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan more than once. The Second Plenary Session suggested that the Executive Yuan should not be responsible to the Legislative Yuan, nor should it have the power to request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan. The Communist Party has also designated members of the party to participate in the government, and has not submitted the names of National Assembly representatives to the National Assembly. Chairman Chiang expressed his regret for this. He continued: "The Communist Party's suggestion to abolish the Provisional Constitution and organize a new government of all parties and factions has surprised us. No legal system can replace the constitution passed by the National Assembly. The agreement to expand the existing government, which was established by the Political Consultative Conference, is tantamount to overthrowing the existing government." Chairman Chiang thanked President Truman for sending Special Envoy Marshall to China, in order to promote China's peace and unity.

Afterwards, the meeting proceeded smoothly, passing a total of 30 financial and economic proposals, 21 military and national defense proposals, and one resolution on the military report.

Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, he held his last press conference before returning home in the Construction Building, accompanied by Major General Medrick, the successor to the commander of the US military training in China.

US Military Headquarters to be Abolished Next Month

General Wedemeyer said that the US military headquarters in the China Theater will be officially abolished on May 1st, but after the abolition, there will still be some personnel remaining in China. Their main tasks can be divided into five categories: (1) Disposing of the remaining US military materials, (2) Assisting China in completing the repatriation of Japanese troops and expatriates, and transporting Chinese troops and military equipment, (3) Assisting the Chinese government in training troops and providing advisory services, (4) Assisting Special Envoy Marshall in mediating the Communist Party issue in Beiping, (5) Handling US military post-war affairs, such as organizing graves and searching for missing US military personnel.

The work of US military repatriation in the China area began in October 1944. The number of US military personnel has decreased from a peak of 65,000 to 6,000. After the US military personnel continue to withdraw in April, there will only be 5,000 US military personnel remaining in the China area, and all combat teams will be withdrawn. At the same time, the number of US Marine Corps has also decreased from 53,000 to 34,000, and will continue to decrease.

Officers and soldiers who are not qualified to withdraw will be assigned to other work.

Assisting in the Withdrawal of Japanese Troops in the Northeast

Regarding dispatching to the Northeast to carry out mediation, US military personnel have already departed and will soon be able to take on the work of withdrawing Japanese troops. As for searching for missing US military personnel in the Northeast, it is currently only being carried out within the areas under the jurisdiction of the Chinese army. If the area expands, the scope of the US military search will also expand accordingly. In addition to assisting Special Envoy Marshall, many air force personnel are needed to handle post-war affairs. Not only to train the Chinese Air Force, but also to assist China National Aviation Corporation. There are still 300 or 400 US military officers coming to China. They are specialized and experienced and will contribute to the training work. The US military personnel in Chongqing will also be completely disbanded on May 1st after the government returns to the capital. There are currently several hundred people who need to assist the US embassy in relocating.

Lieutenant General Gillon to Succeed as Commander

After the US military headquarters in the China Theater is closed, it will be renamed the US Army Command in China. After General Wedemeyer leaves China, his mission will be succeeded by Lieutenant General Gillon. After May 1st, it will be changed to the Commander-in-Chief of the US Army in China, but General Gillon represents Special Envoy Marshall and must work in Beiping and cannot come to Shanghai often. The US military tasks in Shanghai will be handled by Deputy Commander Major General Medrick. General McCrook is preparing for the US military advisory group in Nanjing, which has not yet started work. In addition, Lieutenant Colonel Carter, the head of the US military headquarters' press liaison group, has returned to Shanghai and was specifically introduced by General Wedemeyer during the session.

He said that this medal is shared by the US military and expresses gratitude for the achievements of US military officers and soldiers in the past 18 months.

### Soviet Union Still Shows No Sign of Reply; UN Security Council Remains Pessimistic; Gromyko Continues to Remain Silent; Soviet Diplomatic Courier Flies to the US Carrying Important Official Documents

[United Press, New York, 31st]: The Security Council has been adjourned for two days. There is no new indication as to whether the Soviet Union will respond to the United Nations' request for the Soviet and Iranian governments to explain the truth about the Soviet troop withdrawal negotiations. Therefore, the optimistic attitude of the Security Council representatives has diminished today. Soviet Ambassador Gromyko continues to remain silent, refusing to make any comments to reporters, but when reporters asked whether he had received instructions from the Kremlin, Gromyko replied: "I, like other representatives, am in constant contact with my government." He did not indicate any action by the Soviet government. Security Council representatives hope that the Soviet and Iranian governments will reply soon, so that the Council can obtain assurances of Soviet troop withdrawal, and the Soviet demand for Iranian concessions can be eased. At the same time, Gromyko can re-attend the Council meeting on Wednesday. According to the Iranian Ambassador to the United States, although the talk of Soviet troop withdrawal is rampant, Soviet troops are still stationed in areas such as Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Gorgan, and Khorasan.

[Associated Press, New York, 31st]: The United Nations Security Council is now in the stage of collecting reports. Its second step will be to determine whether the presence of Soviet troops in Iran constitutes a "threat to peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression." If it has to take this decision, the Council will encounter a major test. However, if the Soviet Union can provide satisfactory assurances, declaring that its troops will unconditionally withdraw from Iran, then the Council can avoid taking this step. If the Soviet Union does not provide assurances, then the Council will request the submission of reports again, otherwise it will proceed in accordance with Article 39 of the United Nations Charter. That article stipulates that the Security Council must determine whether peace has been threatened or broken, and then decide how to deal with it.

[Associated Press, New York, 1st]: Iran and the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship on February 26, 1921. During this discussion of the Soviet-Iranian dispute by the United Nations Security Council, this treaty may be suddenly submitted as evidence before the discussion is completed.

[Reuters, Shannon Airport, Ireland, 1st]: Two Soviet diplomatic couriers who passed through here for the first time departed for Washington yesterday morning. According to them, they were carrying extremely important official documents, so they refused to disembark when the plane was refueling. The plane was a special flight from Moscow, and had stopped in Berlin and Paris. It is widely believed that they are senior Soviet diplomatic couriers traveling on official business.

[Associated Press, New York, 31st]: The Special Committee of the United Nations Security Council has passed the rules of procedure for the Security Council, which is the main work for the representatives of various countries this weekend. When discussing the Iran issue on Friday, Soviet Representative Gromyko refused to attend.

He summarized the useful knowledge to be explored in this test into six categories, as follows: (1) The biological reaction of radiation, (2) Geological data constituting ocean coral islands, (3) Tests of the strength of ships, (4) The reaction of aircraft to atomic bomb explosions, (5) Accurate measurement of the effects of atomic bomb explosions, (6) Knowledge about controlling atomic energy.

### Development of Atomic Weapons Means Future Wars Will be Terrible

Mountbatten Issues Warning

[Reuters, London, 1st]: Admiral Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, traveled from Sydney to New Zealand last night and broadcast on Australian radio, stating that the destructive power of future wars will be even greater. Although military personnel do not need to provide opinions on world politics during peacetime, warning of the terribleness of future wars is also permissible. Even in the past, World War I was more dangerous than any previous war, and World War II was even worse than World War I, so future wars will inevitably be even more terrible and will become a global war. With the development of long-range rockets and atomic energy, controlled by radio, the extent of destruction can be imagined.

### Lava Flows From Japanese Sakurajima Volcano

Villagers Say It Is Caused By Offending Heaven

[Associated Press, Tokyo Dispatch]: The Sakurajima Volcano in southern Japan has been spewing ash smoke and rocks for 22 days. The lava is boiling, half a mile wide and two and a half miles long, and continues to flow down the slope towards the small village of Kurokami at a rate of three or four feet per hour. It will soon flow into Kagoshima Bay, and may solidify into a narrow path connecting Sakurajima to the Kyushu mainland. The above is a report from our news photographer, Taisorio, who made aerial observations from a Navy plane. Common old villagers believe that Japan's defeat angered the gods, so the volcano erupted.

### New Inventions Emerge Daily; Alloy Light Emitting Body Compares with the Sun and Moon; Radar Guided Missiles Possess Astonishing Power; Infrared Electric Eyes Can See in the Dark

[Reuters, New York, Day 1] Several new scientific inventions have recently been announced here. One is a new light emitting body invented by Western Union Telegraph Company, the light emitted by which is said to be half that of sunlight. The light emitting body that has already been manufactured is made of alloy and has a diameter of only three thousandths of an inch. The entire light bulb is only the size of the smallest vacuum tube in an ordinary household radio, and the light it emits is one-sixteenth of that of sunlight. When observing it, one must wear the darkest sunglasses to avoid eye damage. Another new invention is a radar-guided bomb nicknamed "Bat," which is twelve feet long and ten feet wide, with a radar device weighing only two hundred pounds installed at its nose. The bomb stores half a ton of explosives. When used, it is carried by a mother ship to a location closer to the target and released. Guided by the radar on the bomb, it can automatically search for ships on the sea surface and sink them. During the later stages of the Pacific War, American aircraft used this amazing new weapon to sink many enemy ships. Another invention is an infrared electric eye, which can observe the situation within ten to fifteen miles in the dark. It is invented by applying the principle of absorbing infrared rays. Therefore, any object that emits heat, such as trains, cars, airplanes, and human bodies, can be observed using these electric eyes. Other new inventions include air exchangers in submarines, methods for manufacturing high explosives, and mosquito repellents. Using these mosquito repellents, mosquitoes will avoid them for six hours.

Editorial

### Economic Recovery and Labor Strikes

Currently, both the government and the public are concerned about China's economic recovery, especially whether the industrial construction will quickly yield results. China's industrial construction, in the eyes of advanced Western countries, is truly "a promising younger generation," so why are we now raising questions like "is there hope?" It's quite simple. Because currently, some authorities do not seem to genuinely regard encouraging production as a priority, and sometimes, intentionally or unintentionally, they hinder or damage production. Economic recovery is the preliminary work for large-scale national economic construction, and the primary meaning of this preliminary economic recovery is production. However, nowadays, production is only mentioned verbally by most people and not actually valued. As a result, economic recovery has suffered a tremendous setback – it can even be said that Chinese industry will suffer a fatal blow in its infancy!

Throughout history, Chinese and foreign works on economics are numerous, but the most concise and important words are the four sentences from the "Great Learning": "Produce in abundance, consume sparingly; work diligently, spend freely." We are now in the aftermath of a great war, with military expenses just subsiding and wounds still unhealed. Although victory has been seven months, transportation is not yet fully open, and order is not yet fully established. The strange phenomenon of factories closing in the rear and being sealed off at the front has not improved much to this day. Prices are high, life is unstable, and labor strikes are erupting everywhere, especially in Shanghai, like an epidemic. In this situation, strikes and slowdowns are seen as commonplace, which is far removed from the famous saying "work diligently." As a result, existing factories will close down, emerging industries will stall, and the lives of laborers will become even more unstable. A wave of unemployment will follow the wave of strikes, inevitably contradicting the instruction "produce in abundance." On the other hand, despite the slowdowns or strikes during work and the poverty after unemployment, food still needs to be eaten, and clothes still need to be worn. Not only that, but every month, eating and clothing must be done according to the "cost of living index." Thus, there are "many" who only consume and "more" who need relief. Individuals are poor, society is poorer, and the nation is especially poor. If at this time we all believe that since peace has arrived, people should enjoy themselves, regardless of the production situation, and without making efforts to increase production, but only know how to demand the restoration of our pre-war consumption standards (which is the meaning of demanding wages according to the cost of living index), thinking that this is satisfactory, then China's immature industry will inevitably be damaged by those with this mentality, and in the end, everyone will perish together?

The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee passed a financial and economic sub-proposal, clearly stating: "Whether in economics or finance, to address the symptoms and the root causes, the general principle should be to increase production. The phenomena of factories being sealed off at the front and停工ing in the rear in the past must not be allowed to exist again, causing workers to lose their jobs and society to be unstable." Now, half a month has passed since the closing of the Second Plenary Session. How much progress has actually been made? Judging from the manifestations of all parties, financial capital is still gambling on stocks and bonds, and floating capital is still rampant outside the financial circles, without being guided to the proper use. The bad phenomenon of usury is still "increasingly severe," transportation and transportation are still not smooth, raw materials and all prices still cannot be stabilized, fuel is still not fully supplied due to excessive control, and power is said to be reaching a point where it cannot bear any more burden (which is equivalent to saying that the power cannot be supplied to the resuming factories). All these indicate that production is still full of thorns, making people hesitate. Not only that, but recently, the soaring prices have stimulated the turmoil in the lives of laborers, and the wave of slowdowns and strikes is smooth, with wages and prices almost racing to increase, adding a new obstacle to production. For the sake of the future of industry, for the sake of the lives of laborers, and for the sake of the country's entire economic construction, we cannot help but point out that the disease of the entire economic world is now very serious.

The meeting on the last day of the Second Plenary Session passed the emergency measures for accelerating economic recovery proposed by President Song, stipulating that labor-capital disputes should be mediated and arbitrated by the government, and no slowdowns or strikes should be allowed without authorization. If arbitration fails, the government may take over the operating enterprise. As for the employees of state-owned enterprises, they are regarded as civil servants and are not allowed to strike. Mayor Qian of Shanghai recently also announced four principles for handling labor-capital disputes: (1) State-owned enterprises shall not slow down or strike; (2) Strikes and slowdowns should be banned if they have not gone through legal procedures; (3) Demands that cannot be accepted by China's current production situation should be rejected; (4) Illegal and excessive actions should be sanctioned. It can be seen that the central and local authorities have seen this major crisis hindering production in the sound of economic recovery and want to make some remedies. We would like to point out some questionable points in the recent handling of labor strike incidents, hoping that the authorities will quickly make reasonable corrections, otherwise, it will invisibly damage the lifeline of economic recovery.

First, employees' wages can use the cost of living index as a discretionary reference to stabilize their lives, but they should not be absolutely based on the cost of living index, so that factories exceed their ability to bear. At present, people across the country who rely on wages for a living, except for a very small part of the people in Shanghai, have never received wages absolutely according to the cost of living index. Especially soldiers and civil servants and teachers, who are strong pillars of the war of resistance, but what is their income? Even with the recent adjustment of salary increases, those with a base salary of 100 yuan can only get 65,000 yuan, which is equivalent to 650 times before the war. The higher the salary level, the smaller the multiple. The lives of soldiers are even more unattainable. The government has the power to issue currency, and banknotes can be printed at will. It also has a monopoly business in its hands, but it still does not dare to issue wages to employees based on the cost of living index. How can it first force private enterprises to issue 1,845 times in January and 2,754 times in March? It must be known that employees' wages should be increased to the point where they can stabilize their lives, but at the same time, the general production situation should be taken into account to see if the strength can bear it. We already have a cost of living index as a reference on one hand, but what is the production index of our various agricultural, industrial, and mining industries? The government only knows how to urge everyone to restore the pre-war consumption level, but it has not considered that the social production capacity at this time has absolutely not restored the pre-war production level (let alone increase production). This kind of caring for the past without considering the future will inevitably lead to an irreversible ending. Because the factory's expenses have increased, and the production is not enough to match it, in addition to raising prices to survive, there is only "open the door and be lucky!" According to the former, prices and wages chase each other, and wages may still not catch up with prices, which is only obvious to employees in front of them; according to the latter, factories close down, and employees lose their jobs, so how can they receive wages according to the cost of living index? In any case, it is unfavorable to both the factory and the employees.

Second, employees' pre-war wages should be based on their respective positions and should not have rigid general regulations. Because each person's job is different, and the salary they receive is also different. Since the cost of living index is used as a reference, the current wages should be formulated according to their respective positions and with reference to the proportion. Then, follow the treatment methods of civil servants and teachers and adjust them every three months. If you must force a minimum amount for the pre-war wages of a business first, and then multiply it according to this, then the so-called minimum amount is actually equal to creating something out of nothing. Moreover, when the investigation is not clear enough, casually determining this pre-war salary will increase the base salary to a certain extent, which is nominally helping laborers, but in fact, it increases the factory's unreasonable additional burden, and eventually, it will not be able to bear it and close down. Laborers will suffer the pain of unemployment, and the country will also suffer the damage of economic decline.

Third, equal pay for equal work should not be widely cited and become equal pay for equal industry. Originally, the term equal pay for equal work refers to male and female workers. If they do the same work, they should get the same remuneration. It does not mean that workers in the same industry must receive the same wages. For workers, the nature of work has different classifications, the technical skills have different levels, and the length of service has different lengths. Even workers in the same factory have no reason to have completely the same salaries. For factories, the capital has different sizes, and the business has different booms and slumps. Each factory in the same industry can only be roughly similar, but it cannot be the same without any difference. If you indiscriminately use the term "equal pay for equal work" in a confused manner, thinking that if you eat in a certain industry, you must take a certain kind of salary, then should the waiters of the Waldorf Hotel receive the same wages as the tea houses of the Lao Gao Sheng Zhan class? Everything in the world is beyond reason. If it is not reasonable, and you want to promote it forcibly, you will inevitably run into a wall and then stop. By the time the method runs into a wall, the future of industry will be unimaginable.

At present, everyone is anxiously looking forward to economic recovery, and even more so to economic construction. We must remember that the first thing is to make factories open their doors, and the second is to make employees stable, so we should be very careful not to let the unlimited epidemic of labor strikes spread, causing employees to clamor for strikes and slowdowns every day, and factories to prepare for closing down and shutting down every day. We must recognize this premise and not take the wrong path, so that the country's economic recovery work will not suffer a fatal blow.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Convenes Various Guilds to Hold a Discussion Meeting; Discuss How to Cope with the Industrial Crisis; The Chamber of Commerce Will Submit Five Points of Advice on Labor Strikes to the Government

[Report from this Newspaper] In response to the requests of the woolen textile industry and other guilds, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially convened various industrial guilds in the city at its meeting room at 3 p.m. yesterday to hold a discussion meeting. More than 20 representatives from various industrial guilds attended, chaired by Jin Runxiang, the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce. He briefly stated that there are three motivations for today's meeting:

(1) In the past, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce served both industry and commerce, but now it is proposed to establish an Industrial Committee separately to meet the needs of the industrial community. (2) Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received an official letter from the Bureau of Social Affairs, roughly stating that it is organizing a consumer cooperative for employees of various factories in the city. It has convened preparatory meetings three times, and the second preparatory meeting decided that the Chamber of Commerce should be the natural standing preparatory committee member of the preparatory committee, and invited the various industrial guilds in the city to jointly nominate 20 preparatory committee members to promote preparatory matters. (3) In recent years, labor strikes have been rampant, and various factories have been the first to bear the brunt. A reasonable solution should be sought to prevent labor strikes from deteriorating. Then, Yan Eji, the secretary-general of the Chamber of Commerce, reported the contents of the letters from the Bureau of Social Affairs and the woolen textile industry guild. Representatives from the woolen textile industry guild, the handkerchief weaving industry guild, the electrical machinery weaving industry guild, etc., spoke one after another, expressing their heartfelt words on the current industrial crisis and the handling of labor strikes in various industries. Luo Qinghua and Wang Xianqing, members of the Municipal Party Headquarters, also spoke one after another, analyzing many of the difficulties. The discussion meeting lasted until 7:30 p.m. before it came to an end. The main points are summarized as follows: Regarding

Labor Strike Issues

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce will send a letter to the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs, suggesting five points: (1) The base salary of each factory should be based on the pre-war level and then calculated according to the monthly cost of living index. (2) Before mediating labor-capital disputes, the employer should be consulted first to investigate the actual situation. (3) Please pay attention to the discipline when the competent authorities mediate, for example, the number of representatives from both sides should be equal when attending negotiations. (4) The labor side shall not interfere with the factory's handling or regulations of its own administrative affairs. (5) The handling of labor strikes should be based on the four principles announced by Mayor Qian on March 25. In addition, there are also

Scattered Suggestions

Many include: (1) Submit a request to the Four Joint Offices to issue low-interest loans for a six-month period. (2) Submit a request to the military and police authorities to reissue an announcement that strikes and slowdowns must go through legal procedures, otherwise they will be banned. (3) Establish an Industrial Committee organization under the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and regularly invite the press to report the current difficulties of the industrial community. (4) Submit a request to the Fuel Management Committee to follow the method of allocating par fuel to state-owned industries and give the same preferential treatment to private industries. (5) Save imports as much as possible to protect domestic industry. (6) Improve the current tax system to reduce the production cost of the industrial community. (7) Please prepare a report on the current difficulties, crises, and production conditions of each industrial guild so that it can be submitted to the relevant parties for reference. (8) Please invite the responsible persons of various labor movement groups to discuss the industrial crisis sincerely in order to save it.

### Recurring Labor Strikes: Over Seventy Factories in the Third District Machinery Industry Resume Work; Bathhouse Industry Also Resumes Operations

Labor-management disputes in over 150 factories in the Third District machinery industry of this city have shown improvement after several mediations by the Social Affairs Bureau. Over seventy companies have now resumed work. The industry's labor union is making every effort to persuade the remaining factories to resume operations quickly. Workers in various factories also hope for an early resolution. Yesterday afternoon, they sent a delegation of over 120 representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for a swift resolution. Negotiations between the two parties regarding wage adjustments are also gradually nearing an agreement. Furthermore, the labor strike in the bathhouse industry is still awaiting mediation, but it was decided to resume work across the board today.

Foreign News Agencies

The Chinese employees of this city's commercial news agencies, including British Reuters, American Associated Press, and United Press, experienced a labor dispute yesterday. Reuters' employee base salary for February was originally 41,160 yuan, but the total salary for March was only 45,000 yuan. The Associated Press originally promised a base salary of 45 yuan for March, but suddenly reversed the agreement and changed it to 22 to 25 yuan. The labor side demanded to maintain the original salary, calculated based on the cost of living index. Yesterday, posters were put up throughout the city to expand publicity, and a written request was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.

### Second and Third General Meetings of the Municipal Provisional Assembly: Councilors Raise Numerous Questions, Two Bureau Chiefs Respond Separately with Enthusiasm

[Report from this newspaper] The second general meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Provisional Assembly began yesterday morning at 9:15 AM, concurrently holding a memorial week. Twenty-nine members attended, with seven more arriving later. The Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, then reported on the work of the Public Works Bureau (report highlights recorded separately). During the report, Director Zhao used both Chinese and English specialized terms in his explanation, but Councilor Yong Xiangyun stood up and requested that the Director not use English.

Improvements in Water Accumulation

After the report was completed, the councilors raised questions one after another. Councilor Feng Zhenqi stood up and said: I live in West Shanghai. Although there has been continuous rain recently, there is still a lot of water accumulation, but it has improved compared to the past. The hard work of the Public Works Bureau deserves admiration. He also expressed his agreement with the bureau's collection of benefit fees and issuance of municipal bonds to supplement funding, but hoped for a detailed explanation.

Hou Junren said: The banks of the Suzhou River and the Beixinjing area often suffer from floods, causing severe damage to farmers' fields. The Public Works Bureau should quickly take remedial measures. Cao Jun proposed that the work of the Public Works Bureau is entirely focused on the urban area, neglecting the suburbs. He hoped that the bureau would also take care of the suburbs in the future. At the same time, when building public housing, priority should be given to helping the most severely affected citizens, especially those in areas such as Dachang and the Hua Flying Field, whose homes were destroyed by the enemy to build airports, leaving a large number of people displaced. Shen expressed that the report of the Public Works Bureau was still insufficient and asked the Director to provide a detailed explanation of the plan, and not to gloss over the past due to economic difficulties.

Rushing to Create a Budget

Pan Xulun contributed his opinion: The Public Works Bureau must submit a concrete plan to this Provisional Assembly, divided into a three-year or five-year plan, and urgently estimate the budget. After this assembly makes a decision, it should be implemented as soon as possible. Shui Xiangyun believed that the dredging of underground sewers was not sufficient. What about the workers' treatment, accommodation, and other issues? In addition to Western people's names for roads, he hoped to avoid changes, and at the same time, should do more publicity to make it easier for people to remember. In addition, the roads should be widened to benefit pedestrians, and it was suggested that the municipal government should expand the budget of the Public Works Bureau. Ye Fenghu requested a rapid solution to the housing shortage. Dilapidated public ditches in the alleys should be repaired quickly to improve sanitation. Xu Yongzuo recalled his previous inquiry about the demolition of houses on North Zhejiang Road and requested a response. Furthermore, the work of the Public Works Bureau only focuses on the surface and is impractical, only repairing roads traveled by important people, while neglecting the roads on both sides. In addition, the Mayor's report on the Public Works Bureau's expenses differed from the Director's report by 300 million. Why is there such a discrepancy? The Public Works Bureau's expenses account for one-seventh of the city's total, which is too little. Tong Chuantian first asked why the hundreds of acres of land encircled by the silk weaving network in Zhabei have not been demolished? The Shanghai Sea Dike is dangerous, and taking responsibility for building it is a matter of urgent priority. Shen Chunhui expressed that each bureau should have a detailed report on the work plan from September of last year to this year.

Bureau Director's Response

Director Zhao immediately responded: (1) Urban planning and project funding have all been planned and are available for everyone to refer to and discuss. (2) Suburban projects have been carried out to the best of our ability, but are really limited by funding and cannot be expanded. (3) To dredge the ditches and canals, private individuals must gather together to find ways, and the Bureau has promoted this method. (4) Widening Zhejiang Road is intended to expand north-south traffic. Now that citizens are requesting a delay in demolition, the municipal government authorities can be asked to reconsider. (5) The housing shortage is due to insufficient funding and materials. Other issues will be answered in writing. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM. The chairman received a written proposal stating that several councilors opposed tea and refreshments in order to save money. It was passed by the entire body to cancel them.

Third General Meeting

At 3:30 PM, the third general meeting continued, but only 26 people attended initially. Councilor Wang Yansong temporarily moved that the number of attendees at the meeting was too small and requested a restriction. Wang Genzhong moved that each bureau be asked to give an oral report, limited to a maximum of one hour, and that their written reports should be distributed the day before so that they could be read in detail in the evening. Then, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zengjue, attended to report (report highlights recorded separately). After a ten-minute break, the councilors raised questions: Xu Yongzuo believed that the street lights were still too dim, especially when walking on rainy days, which was very inconvenient. He hoped to restore them to the situation in July 1937 as soon as possible. Some citizens criticized that the enemy and puppet vehicle licenses were being handled by someone, and an investigation should be requested. Fu Tongxian also felt the same way. Ye Fenghu said: "4" and "5" series telephone lines should best be moved to the "1" and "9" districts to solve the inconvenience for users in those areas. The Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation also felt inconvenient to call, can there be improvement mechanisms and technical measures? And hope to expand the north-south bus lines in the shortest period of time, and there should also be a detailed explanation of the principle of unified public utilities. Pan Xulun found that the director's report only focused on the technical aspects, and did not include financial and budget matters. The tram price can be increased to 200 yuan, so that may be able to increase the number of vehicles, in order to avoid congestion.

Telephone Black Market

Zhao Banfu said: The traffic company lacks tires the most, can the government come forward to purchase them from the US military authorities on its behalf? It has also been heard that a black market has been discovered for the widespread installation of telephones. Telephones in the Nanshi area are particularly unclear. Calling twice makes you sweat! He also felt that resting for three hours during the meeting was too time-consuming. Lu Enhu pointed out that if the water pipes are not repaired, the landlord will restrict the water usage time, which will not only cause disputes between tenants but also waste materials. Telephone names do not match reality, and repairs are not satisfactory. What are the plans to improve?

Suburban Transportation

Xu Shihao hoped that the Public Utilities Bureau's regulations would be reviewed as soon as possible. US military trucks are overloaded, damaging the road surface and should be prohibited. Cao Jun requested the increase of commercial public bus companies. Hou Junren took into account the inconvenience of suburban villagers transporting vegetables and food, and methods should be found to expand the routes and allocate vehicles.

Responding to Various Points

Director Zhao immediately answered one by one: (1) I feel very sorry for the omissions in the financial and regulatory announcements. A public utilities monthly magazine will be issued tomorrow, with various regulations published in installments, for reference. (2) Since the Public Utilities Bureau was taken over, very little money has been received, and most of it has been spent on ferries and public buses. (3) Adjusting vehicle prices must be done in accordance with central regulations and cannot be done arbitrarily. However, on the one hand, the burden on citizens must be taken care of, and on the other hand, the company should not be allowed to suffer losses. Only 50 of the 100 public buses received can be pieced together. (4) Regarding the issue of increasing vehicles, it is estimated that the British company will increase 210 vehicles in the shortest period of time. Preliminary negotiations have also been conducted with commercial bus companies to allow them to operate suburban vegetable transportation. (5) Tire matters have been requested from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to handle on their behalf. (6) Regarding the matter of license handling, we are making every effort to investigate. If it is found that any staff member is suspected, they will be immediately sent to the police station for investigation and suspended from their duties. (7) There are not enough telephone operators, making it difficult to get through immediately. In the future, it is planned to set up a separate exchange for lines used by agencies so that internal calls do not have to go through external lines. (8) Appropriate measures will be taken to repair water pipes. (9) It is expected that street lights will gradually be restored within the next year. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Today, the Health Bureau will report in the morning, the Education Bureau will report in the afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau will report on the morning of the 3rd, and the first group review meeting will be exchanged on the morning of the 4th.

Also, Councilors Zhu Su and Lu Huimin exchanged views with local women's groups at 583 Tao'erfeis Road at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss women's issues that should be raised by the assembly. At 7:00 PM last night, they also held a reception at the Central Western Restaurant to release several proposals to local newspaper reporters.

### Please Consider the Tenants of Chun Yuan Li

[Report from this newspaper] Over 100 members of the Chun Yuan Li Tenants Association in Nanshi, representing over 600 tenants in the entire alley, gathered at the entrance of the Provisional Assembly at 111 Nanchang Road at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning to petition because the landlord wanted to demolish the houses and forcibly relocate them. The person in charge of the Assembly promised to discuss the matter with the relevant authorities and kept the petition.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Ship: Hai Yi Arrives Yesterday; Qi Mei Scheduled to Be Received This Morning

(Report from this newspaper) New ships ordered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from the United States have continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Hai Zhong arrived on the 29th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, the Hai Yi also arrived. The names of these ships were named in Chinese in the United States and were flying the national flag. The Hai Zhong was renamed Zhen Mei and was originally scheduled to be received yesterday morning. Due to procedural issues, it was changed to be officially received this morning. Captain Zhu Wenbing, Chief Officer Lu Le, Chief Engineer Qu Gongxin, and others boarded the ship this morning to take over. Since the national flag was already flying, it was not changed. At the time of the takeover, Tan Ju, General Manager Xu Xueyu, and Shipping Department Director Huang, etc., will all personally come to the ship to preside. The Hai Yi, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, should normally be renamed Shen Kai. After the goods are unloaded, the takeover will be completed on schedule. The other new ships have already started their journey from the United States to Shanghai.

### Old Goods Dealers on Qiujiang Road Secretly Buy Items from Japanese Nationals: Confiscated After Being Discovered by the Military Police Department

[Report from this newspaper] The stalls that buy old goods along Sichuan North Road and Qiujiang Road are densely packed, generating substantial profits. Recently, more than ten stalls specializing in buying old goods secretly purchased various items from Japanese nationals at low prices, such as woodenware, clothing, furniture, etc., and stored them in the empty houses next door to the Xieji Appraisal Store at 522 Qiujiang Road, waiting for the price to rise before reselling them. However, there are regulations prohibiting the private buying and selling of items from Japanese nationals. The authorities had long had regulations in place, and they were eventually discovered by the Third Independent Battalion of the Military Police. Yesterday morning, they dispatched troops to search the address and seized a large number of Japanese furniture, stored in several empty houses. They then used many military trucks to transport the items to the headquarters for confiscation.

### Two Bureau Chiefs Attend Assembly to Report: Aiming to Build the Entire City; Promoting the Enterprise-ization of Public Utilities

The Shanghai Municipal Provisional Assembly held its second meeting yesterday. The Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, attended to report on the public works situation. The main points are excerpted as follows:

Public Works Bureau Report

There are eight areas of operational implementation: roads, ditches, housing, parks, bridges, docks, rivers, and seawalls, all aiming to build the entire city.

Repairing and dredging ditches and rivers: The city has approximately 430,000 meters of rainwater drainage pipes, of which one-quarter have been dredged. There are approximately 110,000 meters of sewage drainage pipes, of which more than one-third have been dredged. More than 24,300 cubic meters of silt have been removed, so there is less water accumulation in West Shanghai than last year. We are currently planning to demolish shantytowns in order to expand the dredging of rivers and canals.

Repairing roads, bridges, and docks: The city has 1,000 kilometers of roads, with 340,000 square meters of road surface that needs to be repaired. Approximately 40,000 square meters of sidewalks have been repaired, and a portion of new road surfaces and sidewalks have been built. There are 222 bridges, of which 10 have been repaired and 7 are being repaired. There are 35 docks, of which 24 have been repaired and one is being repaired. In addition, there are many docks that do not need repair, urgently need repair, and cannot be repaired.

Building public housing: Last winter, we surveyed and designed four original public housing villages for restoration, with an estimated cost of 350 million yuan at the time. However, due to funding difficulties, construction could not begin. We are currently in negotiations. We are also planning to build 12 new villages.

Renovating the north-south trunk roads: Based in Huangpu District, we will expand north and south, planning to connect Zhabei to the old city center area and Nanshi to Longhua and Caobing.

Designing ditches in West Shanghai and the entire city plan: Divided into two categories: palliative and fundamental. Palliative work includes: (1) clearing ditches, (2) clearing rivers, (3) adding floodgates and building dams, and (4) appropriately raising several sections of the road surface. Fundamental work includes designing and building structures, dredging rivers, and forming a flood control committee to preside over it. The urban plan has repeatedly convened technical symposiums, formed a plan outline, and submitted it to the city government for guidance.

City seawalls: The total length is 114,000 meters, and the sea walls account for 28 kilometers. They have been severely damaged in the past eight years. We have sent staff to investigate in detail and formulate a plan. However, the cost is huge. We are currently planning to take emergency measures and organize an engineering team to prepare for construction.

City parks open to the public: There are 13 parks. As of the end of February, there were more than 1.755 million visitors (excluding those who do not sell tickets). There are 2,744 trees planted along the roads.

There are 30 vegetable markets, with 10,000 fixed stalls. If 8,000 more are needed, we plan to expand the existing vegetable markets and build 10 new ones.

There are also eight areas of preparation or basic work: planning, surveying, inspecting, scaling, documentation, personnel, funding, and materials, all aimed at assisting the implementation of operations. Inspection has been implemented gradually, and norms can be compiled and published soon. Documentation will be simplified, and a system of tiered responsibility is currently being tested. In terms of regulations, a special Regulations Consolidation Committee has been formed to consolidate and formulate regulations, and the first compilation has already been published. The bureau's expenses, as of the current date, total 1.373890464 billion yuan in national currency, including 22 million yuan in repatriation expenses, 288,270,000 yuan in recurring expenses and living allowances, 292,520,000 yuan in recurring expenses for affiliated agencies, and 771,109,0509 yuan in project expenses. Recurring expenses include wages and allowances for regular workers, but funding is limited for various urgent and important projects. As for material supply, it is a prerequisite for all projects. As of now, according to the Materials Department report, the value of building materials received from the Third Front Army and the enemy and puppet regimes is 310,388,960 yuan. The conclusion of the latest report states: The prerequisite for all material construction lies in funding and materials. Therefore, whether the promotion of public works in this city will be effective in the future will depend on the adequacy and readiness of funding and materials. Building materials have been purchased separately from abroad. The sources of funding for municipal engineering projects, in addition to general tax revenue, are the collection of project benefit fees and the issuance of municipal bonds, so as to take from the people and use for the people.

Public Utilities Bureau Report

At the third general meeting in the afternoon, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Huijue, attended and reported. The main points are as follows:

Water Supply: There are currently five units. After the takeover, we stepped up efforts to increase the water supply, removed restrictions, improved water quality, replaced all the filter sand in the pools, transported a large number of alum from Wenzhou, ordered a large amount of liquid gas, filled 20 public wells, and reorganized water pipes and water meters. In the future, the water supply zones will be redrawn. Water plants can be freely invested in by the people. The British Shanghai Waterworks Company will expire next year, and the Shanghai Water and Electricity Company will expire in 1950. At that time, the municipal government will carefully decide on the management methods.

Electricity: There are six units. First, we should remedy the coal shortage, then increase power generation, prevent electricity theft, remove restrictions, expand industrial electricity use, and unify citywide electricity prices. The price for small users within 10 degrees is 12 yuan per degree. In the future, it is planned to be jointly organized by various companies in Shanghai and operated in an enterprise manner. The central government will be in charge of setting up the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau.

Gas: The supply has been relaxed from 12 degrees per household to 45 degrees. The Wusong Gas Plant has been restored, and the establishment of the Shanghai Urban Gas Company is planned.

Land Transportation: Improving tram transportation. There were 28 lines before the war, and 19 lines have been restored, with 381 vehicles running.

Ten public buses have been repaired, with a total of 41 running. There are currently 5 small train locomotives and 19 passenger and freight cars. A total of 10,529 motorized vehicles and 135,496 non-motorized vehicles have been approved for registration. All vehicles used by the National Army or Allied forces must display a unified license plate. Traffic order has been changed to one-way traffic lines in sections. It is also planned to prohibit rickshaws from operating on Fuzhou Road from Henan Road to Zhongzheng East Road during designated hours. The trolley wires on Nanjing Road will also be removed to facilitate the operation of public buses in the future.

Water Transportation: Ferries have been repaired, with 6 available for use, and docks have been repaired to restore routes. A total of 1,401 ships have been registered. In the future, a municipal ferry company is planned to be established.

Telephone: As of now, Shanghai Telephone Company has approximately 60,000 subscriber lines, 87,000 subscriber telephones, and 16 million calls per month. In the future, it is planned to remove and relocate a portion of the "4" and "5" series lines to the urban area for use. Within five years, the plan is to increase to 140,000 numbers.

Streetlights: Before the war, there were 22,183 streetlights and 1,092 traffic lights. Currently, there are 8,228 streetlights and 932 traffic lights. It is planned that only the old city area can be expanded to 6,000 within this year.

In short, the future plan is to address both the symptoms and the root causes, so that all public utilities can be "rationalized," "enterprised," and "popularized" in order to realize Shanghai as a modern city in the world.

### Case of Murder of American Pilot: Defense Lawyer Discovers New Evidence; Claims That What Sawada Did May Not Be His Responsibility; New Development in This Case, Retrial This Morning

The Japanese Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru and others, accused by the US military of murdering an American pilot, continued to be tried by the US military court yesterday. The defendant's defense lawyers, Lieutenant Colonel Bortney and Captain Huaru, personally went to Tokyo several weeks ago to collect defense evidence. It is said that they personally met with the principal of a school in Tokyo who stated that students died because of the American bombing, and brought back broken glass as evidence. Subsequently, they presented the former Japanese Minister of the Army's notes and the former Commander of the China Expeditionary Army, Tian Junliu's testimony to the court. Tojo and Tian Junliu are both imprisoned, but they personally wrote oaths proving Sawada Shigeru's innocence. They also stated that everything he did was due to orders from Tokyo, and also stated that Sawada Shigeru was a wise gentleman, and everything he did was directly instructed by Tokyo, so the fact that he judged the American pilots had nothing to do with Sawada Shigeru. The defendant's defense lawyer also summoned two witnesses from Tokyo to exonerate the defendants. According to those in charge of the case, there will be new developments in the case. It is feared that it will not be possible to conclude it for a while, and a retrial will be held this morning.

### Western Customs: Chinese People Compete to Imitate; April Fool's Day is Full of Jokes

According to Western customs, yesterday was the annual April Fool's Day. People in this city, both Chinese and foreign, are finally free from the disasters caused by the long-term war and are gradually moving towards a life full of hope and happiness. On this festive day, their excitement is particularly strong, so they could not avoid following the customs.

Yesterday, a certain newspaper in this city first published the news that General Feng Yuxiang and Mr. Guo Moruo and others had jointly flown to Shanghai. Friends of Feng and Guo inquired in various directions after seeing the news, only to learn that the news was an "April Fool's" news item. In another case, a certain gentleman instructed someone to notify his friends by phone yesterday that he had been crushed to death by a car. Everyone who received the call rushed to various places to prepare for the funeral. When they arrived, they saw that their friend was indeed alive and well, and they couldn't help but laugh. There are countless such things of fooling oneself and others, but according to reports from various parties, fortunately, no events have occurred that have caused trouble because of this.

### Slanting Xu Road Dye Factory Robbed – One Wounded Thief Escapes

[Our Reporter] Shao Maotang, the owner of Yu Yi Dye Factory at 1622 Slanting Xu Road in the southern city, woke up around 3:00 AM yesterday. Upon hearing voices from the rear, he roused the staff to investigate. In the back shed, they discovered that several packages of dyed yarn had been stolen, approximately four small packages. Shortly after, they heard knocking on the outer door, which was opened by his eldest son, Chengbing. Two men entered, one claiming to be a police officer from the police station, and the other holding a package of dyed yarn, pretending to be a thief. They inquired whether any dyed yarn had been stolen. Chengbing, believing them to be genuine, did not suspect anything and invited them inside. Unexpectedly, the two men immediately threatened and intimidated them, confining the factory staff in one room. At that moment, more than ten other bandits entered, stormed upstairs into the storage room, and looted fifty-one packages of cotton yarn. During this time, Shao's second son, Shanrong, seized an opportunity to exit through a side door and reported the incident to a guard post at Fenglin Bridge, who then telephoned the Changshu Branch Bureau. Criminal Investigation Squad Inspector Sun Danggeng, Police Chief Xu Shirong, Sergeant Wang Jikui, and several reserve police officers, heavily armed, rushed to the scene with the victim. Upon arrival, Shanrong knocked on the glass window. The unarmed bandits had already taken the stolen goods inside, leaving only one person with a gun. Hearing the knocking, the gunman fled towards the side door. The officers gave chase, but due to the extreme darkness, they only saw a black shadow ahead. They pursued him to Slanting Xu Road, where he fled east into a small lane, reaching the Damu Bridge area, Lane 261. The bandit scaled a wall to escape. The police continued their relentless pursuit. The bandit attempted to fire his weapon to resist arrest, but the bullet jammed. The officers then fired two shots, one hitting him in the abdomen. Despite being wounded, the bandit fled, reaching a horizontal lane and entering the kitchen of a two-unit bungalow. He pushed a hole through the wall and escaped through the hole, disappearing without a trace. At dawn, the bandit's gun was found hidden in a crevice in the mud wall, covered with woolen cloth. The officers returned to the bureau. Around 9:00 AM, Squad Leader Zhang Canguang, accompanied by Inspector Lang Tuanbin from the Pingyin Bridge Police Station, led officers to continue the search. At around 3:30 PM, they discovered the stolen goods, a total of fifty-six small packages, in a grass shed north of Xiaomu Bridge, and brought them to the branch bureau for safekeeping, while intensifying the search for the fleeing bandits.

### Large Volumes of UNRRA Supplies Arrive – Over Sixty Sealed Warehouses Must Be Emptied – Enemy and Puppet Assets Worth Tens of Millions of Yuan to Be Auctioned After Approval by Military Police

[Our Reporter] In light of the inability to store the large volumes of supplies successively arriving in Shanghai from UNRRA and the US military, the Enemy and Puppet Industries Handling Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Regions has taken emergency measures starting yesterday, requiring the emptying of sealed warehouses along the riverfront, including Zhaoshangju North Wharf, Central Wharf, Yongxing Warehouse, Jinliyuan Dock, Gonghexing Dock, Dalai Dock, Taigu Dock, and other large and small warehouses, totaling over sixty. Regarding the handling of the supplies, aside from a small portion auctioned by the bureau through customs, the bureau will take a step-by-step auction of each warehouse, thus it is predicted that prices will continue to fall.

[Our Reporter] Jiang Gongmei, the former Shanghai Military Police Commander, seized a large number of enemy and puppet assets during his tenure. The Investigation Team of the Handling Bureau successively discovered a large amount of fabrics, Western medicine, and tires in the Ronghua Warehouse on Jiangxi Road; sugar, oil, and kapok in the Huatong Warehouse at No. 8 the Bund; and frozen meat in the Maotai Refrigeration Warehouse at the Sixteenth Embankment. The estimated value is tens of millions of yuan, and the 23rd Military Police Regiment is guarding them. After approval by the Chongqing Military Police Headquarters, the bureau will auction the goods.

Furthermore, since its establishment, the Investigation Team has discovered over 2,200 cases of enemy and puppet assets by the end of last month, all of which have been submitted to the Handling Bureau for separate processing.

Business News

### Bulls Take Profits, Hua Stocks Fall Across the Board, Only Xiangtai Foreign Firm Rises in Foreign Stocks

Hua stocks saw profit-taking by bulls. At first, the "counterparty" firms continued to respond as usual, but the appetites of the big Sichuan and Hunan "gangs" were enormous, and they gradually sold off. Securities firms sensed a strong downward momentum and soon felt overwhelmed. When the "counterparty" firms were no longer able to absorb the excess volume, they stopped bidding. A scene of panic selling ensued. Yong Yarn fell from 5,650 yuan, Meiya from 4,600 yuan, and Jingfu from 450 yuan. Yong Yarn fell to 4,750 yuan, Meiya to 1,750 yuan, and Jingfu to 375 yuan. The market stabilized slightly after a low at noon. Other less popular stocks, as well as established stocks, followed suit, with those that had risen the most falling the hardest. Those keen on stock speculation should take this as a warning. At noon closing, stocks fell by more than 10% across the board compared to last Saturday. In reality, while yarn factories are profitable, other industries lag far behind. Labor unrest is increasing, foreign goods are flooding in, costs are rising day by day, and inventories are difficult to match imported goods. Although the bubble is getting bigger, it cannot escape the Earth's gravity and fly straight into the distance. If President Song can fulfill his promise to sell all stored materials, credit will inevitably tighten. At that time, those who are bullish on stocks for speculative purposes will become long-term owners. After noon, bids were slightly lower. Among foreign stocks, only Xiangtai Timber Firm rose due to news of its dissolution. It is generally speculated that the firm's assets are sufficient to fully cover the par value in US dollars. The stock jumped by 20%, with few sellers and many buyers. Other stocks, affected by the general downward trend, showed weakness from the start. As a result, Huide Iron and Steel fell by 0.5%, while the rest fell by more than 10%.

Type C Bonds Plunge

The government bond market also collapsed yesterday. Type C bonds opened at 3,460 yuan, immediately pressured by profit-taking. The overall trend was unfavorable, and there were no buyers. The price broke through six major levels, falling to 2,820 yuan. The market stabilized slightly after a low at noon, ending the day down more than 500 yuan compared to last Saturday. Other bonds fell by 180 to 280 yuan.

### Speculative Activity Ceases, Hong Kong Dollar Bills Weaken, US Dollars Also Decline Slightly

Foreign exchange US dollars generally weakened due to pressure from gold prices, but there was underlying strength due to arbitrage activity involving the purchase of dollars with gold. The market opened around 1,920 yuan, and the price briefly fell below 1,870 yuan at noon, before recovering slightly. The final price was around 1,890 yuan, a slight decrease of 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollar bills were also oversupplied, with old bills falling by 15 yuan and new bills, due to the cessation of activity by speculative gangs, weakening and falling sharply by 20 to 25 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were at 435 yuan and Robis at 535 yuan, both selling prices.

### Oil Prices Fall by Over 4,000 Yuan, Rice, Noodles, and Beans Also Weaken, Raw Peanuts See Activity from Foreign Firms

Yesterday's rice market, despite strong sentiment due to the cloudy weather, was unable to rise due to the continuous arrival of goods downstream. The market was stable in the morning but weak in the afternoon, remaining mediocre. Baimi (white rice) was stable at 100 yuan, but there were few buyers. The price of flour from UNRRA, although sales have ceased, continued to fall slightly by 200 yuan due to sluggish sales in other ports and the local market. The oil market continued to weaken, falling by over 4,000 yuan due to the arrival of goods from various sources and a large shipment of rice and goods from Qingdao. Soybean cakes also fell slightly by 200-300 yuan, and bran fell by 100-200 yuan. Soybeans declined again by 500-600 yuan due to abundant arrivals from various ports and poor sales. Corn was sluggish, falling by 1,000 yuan. Sesame was stable, but raw peanuts saw activity from foreign firms, and because local nut shops have resumed operations, retail sales are smooth, and prices have risen by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Cottonseed cakes and vegetable cakes were unchanged.

### Guangdong Gang Stops Purchasing, Yarn Market Languishes

Yesterday's yarn market entered a slump again. Due to the Guangdong gang's purchasing reaching a temporary saturation point, there was little demand. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell to 1.15 million, a decrease of 80,000-90,000 yuan compared to last weekend. Other smaller 20-count yarns also fell by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Only local buyers made occasional purchases. At noon, Textile Construction (紡建) offered a large quantity of yarn, with 42-count and above double-ply yarns marked down by tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. In particular, 60-count "Yanghe" single yarn was priced at 3.3 million, a decrease of 650,000 yuan compared to the previous period, but purchasing was still not active.

The local raw cotton market was flat, but trading was active again due to purchases by Textile Construction. However, the price was determined by Zhu's sales, resulting in smooth sales but flat prices. Textile Construction acquired 3,900 bales of Midttlingen and Brazilian cotton, and Nantong Dasheng also acquired 200 bales of Midttlingen cotton.

### Foreign Exchange Commission Doubled – Approved by the Central Bank

This was approved by the designated Chinese and foreign banks handling foreign exchange and by the Central Bank.

### Black Tea Stems Have Sales

With Mingqian Longjing tea (a highly prized green tea harvested before the Qingming Festival) about to be released, tea merchants are becoming less active in trading aged varieties. Those who have made profits are eager to sell, resulting in large-scale unloading and a sharp decline in market sentiment. As a result, prices have fallen by more than 4,000 yuan per dan compared to last week. As for the long-dormant black tea stems, also known as "fragrant Suzhou tea," demand from Suzhou merchants suddenly increased at this opportune time, with substantial buying. However, market sentiment remains weak.

### Sellers Arrive in an Endless Stream, Gold Prices Steadily Decline

Yesterday, the gold market was extraordinarily sluggish, with a sense of desperation. Although the Bank of China's allocation price remained unchanged, rumors spread that it was secretly selling at a discounted price, leading to speculation that the exchange rate against the US dollar was being suppressed to 600 yuan per ten taels. Holders unanimously liquidated their positions, and operators, facing an overwhelming supply, were unable to accommodate all sellers. As a result, the market collapsed. How quickly everything has changed! It is evident that human intervention is at play. If the authorities adopt restrictive measures instead of laissez-faire policies, fragile speculators will likely comply. The market opened with offers to sell at 1.52 million yuan, but quickly broke through the 1.5 million yuan mark. Sellers continued to arrive, leading to despair in the gold market. Operators struggled to cope, and holders became even more panicked. With this selling pressure, the market plummeted to 1.41 million yuan in the afternoon before rebounding slightly to around 1.45 million yuan, a decrease of 45,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Gold ornaments fell to 158,000 yuan before recovering to 160,000 yuan.

Furthermore, the American firm Hengxin Foreign Firm has recently shipped many kinds of dyes, and the prices are also low. It is said that Indanthrene dyes are also arriving.

Since the joyous sound of victory firecrackers, the people of the rear have slowly been able to see Shanghai newspapers. Because their paper is clean and white, and the printing is clear and bright, everyone who reads them praises them. In Shanghai, they only sell for 30 yuan a copy, but in Kunming they sell for 200 yuan, and in Baoshan they are worth 400 yuan, with demand exceeding supply. Everyone greatly hopes for an opportunity to fly to Shanghai in a day. However, reality often contradicts desires; one wants to go east, but ends up going west. For this reporter to cross the Nu River again is something quite unexpected.

Oil Pipeline

At 9:00 AM on the 10th, two jeeps left Dali. In less than an hour, they passed the scenic Yangbi County. They traveled 20 kilometers uphill to Dabo, then downhill to Huanglian Shu, crossing the Tiesizhu at an altitude of 2350 meters. At 2:00 PM, they arrived at Yongping County, rested for an hour, and continued, crossing the Maizhuang Ya Kou at an altitude of 2532 meters. From there, they descended 30 kilometers to the Lancang River, crossed the Gongguo Bridge, and traveled 20 kilometers along the river, turning west to Wayaopu. As darkness approached, they traveled another 56 kilometers to reach Baoshan. Along the way, they saw dozens of American military transport stations and oil pipeline stations. Speaking of the oil pipeline, it has now been destroyed. This world-famous oil pipeline crossed the world-famous Hump to reach China, with a pump station set up every 30 kilometers. I remember an American officer telling me that one gallon of gasoline transported from India to Zhan Yi cost five US dollars. Calculated at the current value, that's worth 75,000 yuan, demonstrating the cost of gasoline at that time. This oil pipeline could only be operated by the government; commercial firms and private individuals absolutely could not manage it. Regarding southwest industry and transportation, the oil transport relied entirely on Haiphong in Vietnam. We hope that Haiphong will become a free port and that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway will be jointly managed, which would be greatly beneficial to the prosperity of the southwest. There is also news that four American commercial firms are organizing a company to transport gasoline from India to Burma, using the existing oil pipeline to import it into Yunnan Province. We are very eager for this news, as the price of oil in Yunnan Province has already reached 250,000 yuan per barrel (53 gallons). If there are no more oil import points, southwest transportation will be greatly threatened. As for the oil pipeline machinery being left idle for a long time, even with soldiers guarding it, it will soon turn into scrap metal. We hope the authorities will not only focus on the recovery of coastal areas but also remember the prosperity of the southwestern provinces for national rejuvenation. This is something that should be paid special attention to.

Baoshan

It was already dark when we arrived in Baoshan. The jeep headlights often illuminated two small red lights moving slowly on the road or crossing it and heading into the mountain gullies. Around 8:00 PM, we arrived in Baoshan.

According to legend, Baoshan is the former residence of Meng Huo. The historical sites of Zhuge Liang capturing Meng Huo five times and Zhuge's camp can still be found. About seven-tenths of the houses in the city were destroyed during the war, and approximately 2,000 people were killed in the bombings. It is said that a batch of vehicles belonging to returning overseas Chinese were stopped outside the city and bombed even more severely. We will never forget this blood debt. Later, Baoshan became a counter-offensive base. Large numbers of troops arrived, and many Americans came as well. An airfield was built, and restaurants and theaters were opened. In the spring of last year, when the Burma Road was opened, hundreds of American military transport vehicles arrived every day. Baoshan became a lodging station, exhibiting an abnormal prosperity and transforming into a temporary modern city.

Nu River

At 8:00 AM on the 12th, I continued my journey. From Xiaguan to Baoshan, it is 259 kilometers. From Baoshan to Huitong Bridge, it is 90 kilometers. After climbing over a mountain, we descended to the Nu River. The Nu River, also known as the Salween River, does not rage in winter. A green ribbon of water slowly flows southward, and the sandy beaches contrast with the green water, making it particularly clear. I can tell you that when the Nu River rages during the rainy season. As a reporter, I returned to the rear from Xiangda in mid-September the year before last, crossing at a ferry crossing called "Hanguai Ferry." The night before, it rained all night. Early in the morning, I ran to the riverbank and boarded a leather pirogue, venturing to cross. In an instant, we were hundreds of meters away. Livestock, thatched huts, and even corpses rushed down from upstream, rolling down the river. The distance between the two banks had doubled due to the rising water. The earth-yellow water reflected the dense forest thousands of feet high. It was truly awe-inspiring. I will never forget that day of "crossing the Nu River in a pirogue in the wind and rain." (The troops that crossed the Nu River forcefully all used rubber boats.) Huitong Bridge is a large bridge on the Yunnan-Burma Road and the only bridge over the Nu River. It is said that initially, a merchant whose name I have forgotten, who often did business in Burma, felt the inconvenience of crossing the river and made a lifelong commitment to building a Huitong Bridge. Iron chains hung in the air above the Huitong Bridge, with wooden planks laid on top. People and horses crossed the bridge, swaying precariously. In 1940, when the Yunnan-Burma Road was built, a modern iron cable bridge was rebuilt, which could be crossed by cars. In 1941, when the Japanese invaded, we destroyed the bridge and held out against the enemy across the river for more than two years. It was not until the counter-offensive the year before last that it was rebuilt under the leadership of American engineers in just a few dozen days. It was both sturdy and fast.

Song Mountain

After crossing the Huitong Bridge, there was a 90-kilometer uphill climb. If one were to walk, it might take three days to reach the summit. Forty kilometers uphill is a place called Lameng, with a few houses, which is a street in the middle of the mountain. Beyond Lameng is Song Mountain. When Song Mountain is mentioned, perhaps everyone in the rear knows that the bloody battle of Song Mountain is an indelible page in the history of the war against Japan. As the jeep spiraled upwards, everyone talked about the battle history of Song Mountain. We passed the cemetery of fallen officers and soldiers of the National Army, stopped the car, and deeply paid our respects to them. Their heroic spirits will be immortal along with the famous mountain. The jeep climbed to the highest peak, the weather became colder, and everyone's heart felt equally cold. Amidst the dense shell craters, I remembered the shells that hit Youfa one day, and now I still see five or six indigenous people.

Longling

We stepped on the land where every inch was fought for, and we saw bloodstains on every inch of land. From Song Mountain to Longling, it is a three-hour jeep ride. We arrived in Longling at 3:00 PM. Longling was also a place where the enemy stubbornly defended, and the entire county seat was destroyed. The current street is entirely made up of newly built houses.

Mangshi

After passing Nantian Dou, we saw the Tongguo Garden. Down below is Mangshi City. The climate in Mangshi is particularly warm, the bamboo is evergreen year-round, and the banyan trees grow tall, with people living under the trees. Entering Mangshi is like entering a Burmese-Yunnan landscape. Most of the residents are Baiyi, and their clothing and language are different from ours, as are their customs. Their chieftain is very young. There is a deputy named Fang Keguang, who is in his forties, and people call him Deputy Fang the Third. When the Japanese came, it is said that he was a prisoner. When the Japanese retreated, he escaped. But according to the current Deputy Fang the Fourth, Fang Keguang was a traitor who collaborated with the enemy. It is unknown who was collaborating and who was patriotic. In short, everyone collaborated when the enemy came, and everyone became patriotic when the enemy left. The chieftain's yamen, Yufeng Garden, was formerly the enemy's headquarters and is now the regimental headquarters of the garrison. After being renovated, the garden is full of lush flowers and trees. Camellias and cannas are in bloom. At noon, even wearing a woolen sweater, one still feels hot, showing the unique climate of Mangshi.

Deputy Fang told me that there are now twelve Zhongzheng Elementary Schools and that there is adequate funding. He plans to use 20,000 baskets of rice husks to run a Zhongzheng Elementary School. The teachers' salary is 400 silver dollars per year, equivalent to 400,000 yuan in national currency. I visited their Zhongzheng Elementary School in Xin Jie and saw a few simple buildings, with desks, chairs, and benches in fairly good order. The teachers are Han Chinese, and the curriculum does not include Yi language. I hope there will be some instruction in Baiyi language. The Baiyi language is the written language passed down by Yi monks, but this written language is not sufficient. I also heard Deputy Fang say that before the war, the Baiyi were unwilling to attend school, and each family had to pay money to get a child to study. After the Japanese came, the Baiyi suffered all kinds of abuse from the enemy. China finally won the war, and now every family is willing to send their children to school voluntarily. Now, we must preserve the Baiyi language of the Baiyi and hope that they receive the same education, enjoy equal rights with us Han people in law, and fulfill the same obligations, unlike the Japanese who forced the Baiyi to become cannon fodder.

Deputy Fang has a son who is sixteen years old this year. He attended the Overseas Chinese Middle School in Burma and Yunnan for a year. He wears Western clothes, is handsome, and is not much different from our Suzhou young masters. I advised him to go to Kunming to study soon and not waste his youth at home.

Tengchong

From Mangshi, turning towards Longling, there is a northwest branch road, about 80 kilometers, which leads directly to Tengchong. Tengchong is a famous border city. We knew it when we were elementary school students. It is an important stronghold in the extreme southwest of our country. The Anglo-Chinese treaty opened it as a commercial port, but there was a consulate without any British residents. Today, Tengchong is an empty city. During the counter-offensive in 1944, the battle for Tengchong lasted forty evenings before the enemy was completely annihilated. Tengchong had the most heavily fortified enemy defenses, and we were also the first to conquer it. Some say it was due to the great fortune of Commander-in-Chief Huo. Indeed, Commander-in-Chief Huo has an auspicious appearance, and everyone acknowledges that he is a lucky general for the country. Outside Tengchong City, in Niulipu, on a small knoll at the foot of Laifeng Mountain, lie the ashes of more than 5,000 people. This is the National Cemetery Park, also known as the cemetery for the fallen soldiers in the counter-offensive of Tengchong. In front of the tomb's memorial hall, there are four large characters: "碧血千秋" (Eternal Loyalty), with the inscription "Written by Chiang Kai-shek, Inscribed by Li Genyuan, Supervisor of Yunnan and Guizhou." As we walked into the National Cemetery Park and saw these four characters, thinking of the person who wrote them, the person who inscribed them, and the people who were buried there, we couldn't help but feel a sense of solemn respect. A hundred meters from the memorial hall is a small tomb inscribed with the two large characters "倭塚" (Japanese Tomb). It is said that the ashes of more than 300 enemies are buried inside. Today, standing in front of the martyrs' tombs for a long time, one wonders what these wandering souls feel, having died and having spirits. There is a memorial碑 of Commander-in-Chief Huo on the tomb, which reads:

The walls of Tengchong are thick and strong, surrounded by rivers, locking the borders of the Yu area and inherently dangerous. The Japanese pirates entrenched themselves for two years, densely defending it, with clear holes, tunnels running horizontally and vertically, and transportation fortresses with gun emplacements. Scattered like stars, our army took advantage of the air force's bombing on August 2nd, bravely climbing the city walls, advancing one after another, with the momentum of a tide, completely destroying the fortresses on the city walls, entering the urban area from three sides. The ferocious enemy continued to fight stubbornly, relying on strong fortifications and street houses, fighting inch by inch, engaging in fierce battles everywhere, with smoke obscuring the sun and rain of bullets filling the sky. Engaging in hand-to-hand combat, blood flying, it lasted for more than forty days and nights until September 10th when the enemy was completely annihilated… Our officers and soldiers, with the fearless spirit of the revolution, moved by the gratitude of the leader's virtues, endured hunger and cold, risked danger and overcame difficulties, faced death and entered life, advancing without retreat, fighting ten times and deciding ten times, pressing forward again and again, and finally being able to destroy the strongholds, sweep away the thieves, promote national prestige, reverse the battle situation, remove obstacles to international transportation, create the first victory in the counter-offensive, and make the enemy's court lament a miserable defeat, with allies praising their courage. All these glorious results of the battle are truly a gem of the revolution.

The battle was too great. Our counter-offensive on the Burma-Yunnan Road was not an easy task. Some people say that we have not fought the enemy for eight years. I wonder what new thoughts these gentlemen would have if they went to Tengchong to see it. Equally famous with Tengchong is Mr. Li Genyuan, who is from Tengchong. It is unexpected that such a great figure came from the remote area of Tengchong. He is sixty-seven years old this year, wears a cloth robe and a cloth coat, and is in very good spirits and health. The reporter felt honored to talk with him. Here are fragments of his conversation: People think I am eighty or ninety years old, but in fact, I am only in my sixties. In total, I spent eight years in Japan, sixteen years in Suzhou, and eight years in the rear during the war. In the early years of the Republic of China, I was the second division commander in Yunnan Province, only thirty years old. I opened the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) for the first time in Japan with Prime Minister Katsura. Now, there are only six of us alive. For the sake of the revolution, Ju Juesheng once fled to my home, and my father hosted him twice. I have loved revolution since I was a child. In order to oppose the schoolteacher increasing his salary, I even sat in a detention cell in Yongchang Prefecture for a few days. This traitor Chen Zuomin, I told Gu Mozhi in Suzhou that he should have been killed long ago. When Mr. Li said the word "kill," his eyebrows still retained the vigor of his youth because Mr. Li, as a division commander, killed hundreds of people in Dali, which was recorded in the local annals. The reporter then asked: When will Mr. Li return to Suzhou? Ah! This April, perhaps! The reporter agreed to meet Mr. Li in Suzhou this April. He is a senior statesman of our country, a politician of a generation.

Equally famous with Li Yin Gong is Mr. Jin Tingchen, who is already ninety-seven years old this year. He can eat, walk, and live like a normal person. His house is full of descendants, and he still manages household affairs. When the enemy occupied Tengchong, the old gentleman went to Kunming. After Tengchong was recovered, he returned. Judging by this gentleman's health, living to be one hundred years old is not a problem. The reporter once talked with him and asked him the secret to longevity. He said: Eat four meals a day and have not been close to women since I was thirty years old. This proves that his innate endowment was thick and his postnatal care was good. This is the secret to longevity.

In just ten days, I completed my record of crossing the Nu River again. I write this to tell the old folks in Shanghai.

### Tens of Thousands of Refugees in Zhenjiang

— This Newspaper, Zhenjiang Dispatch, 29th, Tao Tao Reports

Currently, the number of refugees concentrated in Zhenjiang is approximately several hundred thousand. This huge figure comes from a survey conducted by various county associations of northern Jiangsu natives living in Zhenjiang. The refugees in Zhenjiang include those from the following counties: Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Huaicheng, Huaiyin, as well as Lianshui, Siyang, and even Feng, Pei, Xiao, and Dang. Places like Yancheng, Zaoning, Dongtai, and the five major prefectures of Yangzhou, Taizhou, Tongzhou, Xuzhou, and Haizhou also contribute a portion, but the number is generally not as high as in Zhenjiang.

Refugees Coming in Droves, An Endless Stream

The current number cannot be considered final, as groups continue to arrive in an endless stream. Why are they fleeing in such desperation? Naturally, they have a compelling reason to do so. Who doesn't understand that "home is best, hardship awaits outside"? Moreover, coming here doesn't guarantee solutions or relief. In this situation, some are acting voluntarily, while others are compelled (referring to fear of being drafted). Comparatively, these two reasons are balanced in number. However, in reality, those compelled fare better because they are mostly from rural areas and can do manual labor. It's unlike the former group, primarily intellectuals, who are reluctant to shed their long gowns and cannot engage in manual labor. Truly, they are "useless scholars."

Morning Prayers to Zhang Liang, Evening Prayers to Han Xin

Early in the morning, they are busy buying large pancakes. By noon and evening, they are preoccupied with how to get a meal. Small eateries announce they are full. It's pitiful that those who once lived in comfort now share tables with laborers and peddlers. As for lodging, those with connections force their way into accommodations because they cannot afford inns. Some refugees, having no relatives, band together to "live in temples." Although they must pay rent, it's more affordable than renting a house. When they have free time, besides wandering the streets, they are busy writing letters or filling out resumes, "praying to Zhang Liang, worshipping Han Xin," hoping to find a place to settle. In this situation, they are undoubtedly sharing the same plight. There are countless stories of heroism and tragedy. What they fear most is falling ill. However, it seems Heaven is pushing them along a slippery path. Since the beginning of spring, it has been mostly overcast and rainy. Often, they are soaked to the bone for a single meal. Beset by internal worries and external attacks, their bodies are not made of iron. Few can avoid appearing gaunt and haggard. Enduring such suffering and inhuman conditions, why don't they simply go back home?

Three-Category Struggle, Continuing Until Depleted

What is the situation back home? According to those who have come, they are engaged in mutual harassment, conducting a "three-category struggle."

What is the "three-category struggle"? The first is "assets." Anyone with assets is targeted for struggle until they are completely depleted. The second is "reputation." Anyone with a slight reputation is eligible for struggle. The third is "qualifications," presumably referring to past service. If the individuals in these three categories flee, their families are targeted. Twenty percent of the proceeds from the struggle go to the combatants, and the rest is confiscated. The families of those who flee are all labeled as fugitives, expelled, and their property confiscated. Covertly, the masses are incited to harass each other. Struggle committees are dispatched to various counties to implement this policy, enacting the tragedy of "one family crying is better than an entire road crying." With such conditions at home, who dares to say "I shall return"? They can only resign themselves to their fate, figuring things out as they go. But one cannot live on what one has forever, especially when one has nothing.

Ironclad Facts, Blood-Stained Documents

The associations of northern Jiangsu natives living in Zhenjiang, recognizing the grave situation if this continues, have jointly appealed in writing, stained with blood, to the Central Government, the Provincial Government, and the Su-Ning Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, requesting assistance. The original document states: "The relief work guidelines of the Su-Ning Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration prioritize the elderly, the weak, and the disabled. Future relief efforts will be implemented according to this standard. While this standard is truly perfect in areas where military and political orders are unified and follows a consistent and unchanging method, what is the actual situation in northern Jiangsu today? Northern Jiangsu counties have long been occupied by bandits, who use them as their nests. They wield military power, behaving entirely like bandits. They are politically independent, creating a separatist situation. They spare no effort in capturing landlords, gentry, intellectuals, young men and women, etc., determined to assimilate them without exception. If persuasion fails, they resort to threats. If threats are ineffective, they impose blockades. If blockades fail, they inflict punishment.

Eliminate Struggle, Relieve the Refugees

"Consequently, the people of northern Jiangsu are trapped in dire straits, unable to escape. They willingly abandon their homes and livelihoods, fleeing en masse. Parents, siblings, wives, and children are scattered, each fending for themselves. Often, they flee under the moonlight, mostly escaping in the dead of night, with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Many walk barefoot and hungry. They are not without property, but they cannot carry it. Even if they have counterfeit currency, it is unusable in other places. Moreover, after they flee, their families are isolated, unable to provide assistance. Barely escaping the clutches of the bandits, they face exposure and hardship. The misery of their inhuman lives is no different from that of the elderly, weak, and disabled. However, their determination to hate the bandits and their fervor to trust the government surpass even theirs. Therefore, based on morality, hardship, and urgency, relieving these refugees is the most pressing task. It is like a family whose children suffer unexpected misfortune due to their love for their parents and siblings. The parents and siblings would naturally feel profound pity and concern. The current situation of the refugees is like that of the children, and the position of the government is like that of the parents and siblings. Considering that these refugees came for the sake of their principles, whether they receive relief or not, they have no complaints or demands. However, there is a fear that if they are not provided with continued assistance during this difficult and perilous time at the beginning of national recovery, the lives of the refugees will be at stake, and the people's sentiments will be affected. We believe that the wise and benevolent government officials will recognize this and not blame the urgency of our words. As representatives, our responsibilities and obligations are undeniable. Having knowledge of this, we dare not remain silent. Having spoken, we dare not withhold anything. Therefore, we jointly submit this petition, presenting the plight on their behalf, hoping that it will be reviewed and approved. We request that the refugees from various northern Jiangsu counties who have fled from the bandits be designated as an important target for relief, to be provided with continuous assistance, to cultivate the nation's strength, and to stabilize the people's hearts, which is truly what we rely on."

Six Requests, Hoping for Resolution

In addition to this petition, there are six requests to be fulfilled according to regulations: 1. Request that the actual situation in northern Jiangsu be reported to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which will then explain to the Allied nations the need to change the established relief guidelines, focusing on the current urgent needs of the northern Jiangsu refugees. 2. Request that a fixed amount of flour be distributed to the refugees each month. 3. Request the distribution of clothing. 4. Request the establishment of temporary clinics in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taizhou, Tongzhou, Xuzhou, and Haizhou to provide widespread medical treatment to the refugees. 5. Request that continued relief be provided to the ongoing stream of refugees from various counties in the spring, after the winter relief has ended, to provide assistance. 6. Request that the original allocation of three bags of flour for each adult and one and a half bags for each child during the three-month winter relief period be fulfilled. In reality, only 14 catties were received by adults and 7 catties by children in the first phase. In the second phase, adults received 28 catties, and children received 14 catties, totaling only 42 catties for adults, less than one bag, and 20 catties for children, less than half a bag. Only one-third of the original amount was received. Please reallocate the remaining flour according to the original regulations.

### Fifteenth Session of the Political Consultative Conference Passes Resolution on Education Report

During the fifteenth session of the Political Consultative Conference on the 30th, a resolution on the education report was passed. The original text is as follows:

The members of this conference, having read the work report of the Ministry of Education, note that the Ministry has established a second five-year plan for national education, aiming to ensure its widespread implementation. For secondary education, the Ministry intends to establish secondary normal schools and vocational schools in proportion, aiming for balanced development. For higher education, the Ministry is paying attention to the geographical distribution of specialized schools and above, aiming to avoid favoring one region. This demonstrates the meticulous planning of the education authorities. We respectfully present the following observations after reading the report:

(A) National Education

(1) The universalization of national education cannot be achieved overnight. Parents and elder brothers of school-age children do not wish their children to be excluded from education. However, in extremely poor families, children must work to support their clothing and food. Wu Xun is a prime example of this. In the future, at least the existing budget of 10.6 billion yuan for public expenses should be maintained. Furthermore, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Local Autonomy Begins" law, extremely poor students should be provided with books, meals, clothing, and other expenses so that the plan to universalize national education within five years can be truly realized. This matter should be planned for as soon as possible.

(2) Regarding the treatment of primary school teachers, the report states, "It has been stipulated in the revised Regulations on the Appointment, Treatment Guarantee, and Further Education of National School Teachers and Staff that the standard should be three times the cost of food, clothing, and shelter for an individual in the local area." If this can be done, it will surely allow teachers to focus on teaching. However, according to what we know, very few teachers and staff today can maintain even their most basic living expenses, let alone three times that amount. We hope that this can be remedied as soon as possible so that the goal of three times the amount does not become an empty promise.

(3) Currently, textbooks are nationally mandated, and external editing is not allowed. The textbooks that are compiled are not necessarily better than those previously vetted by merchants. Furthermore, the supply is often delayed, causing children nationwide to be without books to read. This method should be abolished immediately. However, bookstores should be allowed to temporarily print pre-war textbooks that have been vetted. Afterwards, they should still be allowed to openly compete, with vetting by the Ministry, to ensure quality.

(4) Currently, textbooks are printed by seven major bookstores. This is acceptable in areas with convenient transportation, but in remote provinces, the seven major bookstores may not have branches, or their distribution network may not reach those areas. We believe that this should be opened up so that the education bureau and bookstores can also reprint textbooks.

(5) Mass education centers, adult supplementary education, etc., should mobilize the power of the masses to promote education. If officials continue to promote education and the baojia system continues to handle it, it will be ineffective. The Ministry of Education should draft new methods.

(B) Secondary Education

(1) According to the Ministry of Education's recent statistics, there are 769 secondary schools nationwide with 802,163 students, and 498 normal schools with 130,995 students. The number of normal school students is much smaller than that of secondary school students. However, the report states that it aims to increase the number of normal school students by 500,000 within five years. This is likely to be difficult to achieve. It seems appropriate to add normal school departments to secondary schools as much as possible to ensure that the needs of national education for teachers are met.

(2) Due to the destruction by enemy puppets and other troops, the books and instruments of various secondary schools have mostly disappeared. For the sake of relief, schools should be allowed to temporarily use the facilities of other schools nearby. Strict methods should be established for compensating for damage during borrowing to prevent abuses. A school with relatively little destruction should be selected as a supply center. In the provincial capitals, science experiment centers should be established to facilitate teaching. Further development should be planned when resources are abundant in the future.

(3) The equipment of vocational schools is of utmost importance. The state should make every effort to enrich them and establish close ties with factories to provide opportunities for practical training.

(4) The seriousness of youth dropping out of school is no less than during the War of Resistance. To help secondary school students, more public funding should be provided so that displaced students can be accommodated. The quota for attracting out-of-school youth stipulated by the Ministry of Education is too small. It is said that there are only 20,000 places. In reality, there are more than 10,000 out-of-school youth who have fled from a single province. Therefore, this quota should be expanded urgently.

(5) After the domestic economic situation stabilizes, in addition to providing public funding to normal school students and vocational school students, secondary schools can establish scholarship quotas to select outstanding students from poor families who cannot afford to attend school.

(C) Higher Education

(1) Scientific research is related to people's livelihood and national defense. In recent years, scientific progress has entered the new age of atomic energy, which is particularly astonishing. If China does not quickly seek effective methods to promote scientific research, it will not be able to meet the requirements of this new era and will forever be a backward country. Currently, advanced scientific countries spend 1% of their total national budget on scientific research each year. Only with such ample funding can ideal achievements be expected. At present, universities and research institutes in China are facing extremely difficult financial situations, which leads to a lack of talent and equipment, creating a situation of being nominally established but lacking real substance. The education authorities should urgently petition the central government to allocate 10 billion yuan of national currency for this year's scientific recovery and development expenses, and increase it year by year to reach 1% of the total national budget. (Chongqing Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 31st, continuation to be published.)

### Impressions of Shanyin

In the minds of outsiders, Shaoxing is not known as the ancient capital of the Yue kingdom or the hometown of literati and righteous people. Instead, it is associated with a series of familiar terms like "Shaoxing wine," "Shaoxing opera," and "Shaoxing advisors," which circulate among the common people. However, the intellectual class has a different perception. From their knowledge of history and geography, they know Shanyin, Kuaiji, the King of Yue, Lu Xun, and other more sophisticated terms. Geographically, it also holds a strategic position on the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway.

Stinking Ditches, Garbage Piles

In our imagination, Shaoxing is a modern, elegant Jiangnan city. However, imagination and reality are often separated by a vast distance. After arriving in Shaoxing, my first impression was: boats traveling in stinking ditches, open-air toilets on both banks, and garbage piles displayed very publicly, standing like small mountains on the roadside. Apart from one or two roads that look relatively decent on the outside, the rest are houses and streets as filthy and dirty as stinking ditches and garbage piles. Another impression is the presence of thin and impoverished children on the streets and alleys, extending their dreadful hands to beg. There are also elderly women unable to make a living, emitting miserable cries of hunger and cold in the biting north wind.

Yue King's Terrace, Broken Tiles

From the Yue King's Terrace, one can get a bird's-eye view of the entire city and the scenery of the suburbs. The houses in the city are irregular buildings. In the suburbs, the crisscrossing rivers, intersecting fields, undulating hills, interwoven lakes, and extended villages give this Jiangnan suburb a splendid new look.

Adjacent to the Yue King's Terrace, a pile of dilapidated tiles and rubble from a distant age remains. Although there are no signs indicating that this was the palace of the King of Yue, we can determine from the towering city walls and magnificent foundations that this was once the place where Goujian tasted bitterness and endured hardship. We cannot help but feel infinite admiration for this man who fostered growth, taught lessons, and sought revenge and redemption.

Wind and Rain Pavilion, Remembering the Female Knight-Errant

Opposite the Yue King's Terrace, on the hillside, there is a hexagonal pavilion that has been damaged.

From the couplet above, "Twenty years of green blood, return my rivers and mountains, thinking of the past"; "A corner of a solitary pavilion, melancholy people in the wind and rain send poetic souls!", we can determine that this is the Wind and Rain Pavilion built to commemorate Qiu Jin. The monument to the female knight-errant Qiu Jin is located in Xuantingkou in the city. It is said that this is where the outstanding woman died on June 5th, five years before the revolutionary era. Recalling the hardships of the revolutionary creation, how can we not dedicate a little effort to nation-building?

Lu Xun Town, Empty Sign

Lu Xun's home is a curiosity in Shaoxing. We also made a visit. It is said that it is now the local court. We lingered in "Three Flavors Study" for a long time. Unexpectedly, in the hometown of a great literary figure, it is impossible to find anything worth commemorating. Although there is also an empty sign for Lu Xun Town, it is so empty!

Shaoxing Wine, Local Opera

Why is Shaoxing wine so famous? According to local friends, it is because the water from the Shanyin River has a unique taste. Shaoxing winemakers cannot brew wine like this elsewhere. If you don't believe it, you can compare the water from Shanyin and Kuaiji. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to do such an experiment.

The several opera troupes in Shaoxing City do not seem to have as many Shaoxing opera roles as those from other places. The antiquity of the stage and the simplicity of the equipment almost make us unable to believe that this is the entertainment venue of a modern city.

Bagua City, Many Scholars

As for Shaoxing advisors, that is a product of the past. However, it is undeniable that the number of talented people in Shaoxing, especially literati, is simply impossible to calculate. It is said that this is also because Shaoxing is a Bagua (Eight Trigrams) city, which is naturally close to superstition and not believable.

What makes people feel extremely emotional is that other countries are making atomic bombs, while most residents of Shaoxing are still making tin foil.

Shaoxing City now has six towns. The names of the towns are prefixed with the names of modern celebrities such as Tang Gong, Cheng Zhang, Xi Lin, Qiu Jin, Yuan Pei, and Lu Xun. It is said that the population is 250,000. However, there are many poor and desperate characters like Ah Q, Old Shuan, Runtu, Kong Yiji, Hua Da Ma, Xianglin's Wife, and Aunt Shan Si, pursuing light and longing for happiness. I extend my most sincere blessings to them!

### Central Anhui Construction: The First Sound. Repairing Over Two Hundred Li of River Embankments, Mobilizing a Total of Three Million Laborers, Adopting a Competitive Approach to the Work

The Wuwei County river embankment, extending from Qinggang Temple in the north to Tangjiawan in the south, spans over two hundred li and serves as the lifeline for the seven counties of Shu, Lu, Wu, Chao, He, and Han. However, due to years of neglect since the War of Resistance, the area near Gujia Mill has been eroded by the river current, leading to the collapse of the embankment foot and cracks in the embankment body, threatening its collapse. After the Wuwei County government moved its offices to the county town, County Magistrate You and local gentry, recognizing the danger of the embankment, submitted a proposal to the provincial government to establish a County Embankment Workers' Union to handle the embankment repair work. They also consulted with water conservancy experts and inspected the embankment carefully. Furthermore, the Provincial Water Conservancy Department and the Anhui Relief Branch successively sent personnel for on-site surveys, estimating a total soil requirement of over 1.76 million cubic meters, with a completion deadline set for April 26th. To ensure the solidity of the project and its completion on schedule, a General Embankment Works Office was established at Tangjiagou, in coordination with the Supervision Team stationed by the Tang Branch Office. The entire embankment was divided into six sections: Zhanjia Mill, Yaojiagou, Niwen, Xinba, Wangci, and Jiji, each with an Embankment Works Office to cooperate with the Supervision Team, supply station, and flour station in supervising embankment work, verifying quantities, and distributing flour. Medical clinics were also established in Tanggou, Xinba, and Gujia Mill, fully equipped. The regulations for conscripting laborers, distributing work relief flour, and rewards and punishments are recorded below:

(A) Labor Conscription: (1) Beneficiary Laborers. For official embankments: one conscripted laborer plus one additional laborer, totaling two laborers. For private embankments: one conscripted laborer plus two additional laborers, totaling three laborers. (2) Obligatory Laborers: 220 laborers from each township (exempting townships outside the river embankment, but not those on the embankment surface). The county government will dispatch personnel to supervise and verify the work.

(B) Organization: (1) Official Embankments: For the allotted laborers, each village elects one person to be the company commander and one person to be the company deputy commander. The current year's village head serves as the platoon leader, and the allotted laborers elect one person to be the platoon deputy commander. (2) Private Embankments: The current year's village head serves as the platoon leader, and the allotted laborers elect one person to be the platoon deputy commander. (3) Obligatory Laborers: Each township establishes a company, with the township head as the company commander. Each bao establishes a platoon, with the bao head as the platoon leader. Each jia establishes a squad, with the jia head as the squad leader. (4) Company and platoon deputy commanders are to be filled by impartial local individuals recommended by each township and bao. (5) The county establishes an Engineering General Team, with the county magistrate concurrently serving as the general team commander. The district establishes a brigade, with the district head as the brigade commander. All company and platoon units of beneficiary and obligatory laborers, according to the original administrative divisions, are to be commanded and managed by the brigade commander under the orders of the general team commander.

(C) Equipment: (1) Each laborer is to bring their own lodging shelter, cooking utensils for salt, oil, firewood, and vegetables, and prepare twenty days' worth of rice to cover their food. (2) Every ten laborers are to bring eight bamboo baskets and four hoes. (3) Each platoon is to prepare two red cloth flags, to be erected at both ends of the work area during construction for starting, eating, and dismissing laborers.

(D) Work Relief: (1) The Anhui Relief Branch will provide one jin of flour per cubic meter. Every five days, the platoon deputy commander will prepare a register of laborers' fingerprints based on the volume of earthwork estimated by the branch office and directly collect and distribute the flour from the designated distribution point. (2) The Anhui Branch will directly pay for the transportation costs of the flour from the waterway to the distribution point. (3) The method of implementation will be based on the volume of earthwork measured by the Anhui Branch. The county will divide the construction sections based on the number of laborers in the company or platoon, set up marker posts, and construct according to the specifications. Any instances of underreporting quantities or using inferior soil will be severely punished.

(E) Rewards and Punishments: (1) The current embankment repair will adopt a competitive approach, with the county government providing rewards and punishments based on performance. (2) Staff at all levels with excellent performance will be awarded flags, medals, and reported to the province for preferential commendation. (3) Laborers with excellent performance will be awarded certificates by the county government. (4) Staff at all levels who are ineffective in their work, as well as laborers who are negligent, will be severely punished by the county government in accordance with the reward and punishment measures promulgated by the higher authorities.

### On the Lock of Fame and the Tether of Profit

—

In the past, some ladies in our country who had a detached outlook and did not covet fame and fortune used the phrase "the lock of fame and the tether of profit" to describe the prison and fetters that fame and profit imposed on a person. They wanted us to break free from the constraints of fame and profit.

Striving for fame and greed for profit are very bad for both society and the individual. Those who blindly pursue fame sometimes only know to follow trends for the sake of reputation, valuing vanity over practicality and favoring superficial embellishments over actual achievements. It is even worse when people engage in infighting to compete for fame or deprive others of their benefits. In society, there are many people who admire false reputations and do not work hard in their own actual work. They only know to spend their days running around the homes of the powerful and entering the gates of the prominent, fearing to be behind others in currying favor and meticulously planning their path to advancement. Such people are not only harmful to society but also waste their energy for nothing. Because fame and reality are inherently linked, even if one believes they have gained a considerable social status without practical work performance, it can only be described as a false reputation, not a true one. Genuine reputation cannot be obtained by force. Reputation gained through seeking fame and fishing for praise is not reputation but rather a disgrace. Plato said, "Accepting fame that we do not deserve only defiles our character." Those who are frantic for fame and do not pursue practicality actually destroy their own reputation first!

As for profit, that is something everyone desires. In society, countless people have caused disputes due to greed for profit. The harmony between individuals has been destroyed by this word "profit," and the entire society has become chaotic, making it impossible for everyone to live in peace. If the trend of speculation and hoarding is not stopped, then social order cannot be stabilized for a day, and national morality cannot be improved for a day. The emergence of selfishness stems from "self-interest." Because of self-interest, one naturally disregards the interests of others and does not adopt legitimate methods of earning profit. One is intent on hoarding and speculating, oppressing others, and being oppressed by others. If I have goods in hand, I can win over you. If I have money in hand, I am a living god of wealth, ignoring everything else. In this way, I exploit you, and you exploit me. Whoever has the goods wins, and whoever has the money has the means. This is truly what Mencius said: "When superiors and inferiors contend for profit, the state is in danger!"

Seeking fame and seeking profit seem to be two different things, but in reality, there is also a close connection between them. Purely seeking fame or purely seeking profit is actually rare. Seeking fame originally carries the purpose of seeking profit. Originally, seeking fame should lead to "name and reality matching," but most people hope for "name leading to reality." Some even misunderstand the meaning of "name leading to reality," believing that "reality arriving" is another way of saying gaining profit. Furthermore, many people regard seeking fame as a means of seeking profit, believing that once they have fame, how can there not be profit to be gained? Of course, there are also some people who are obsessed with profit, calculating every penny, believing that once they have obtained profit, fame will surely follow. This is probably because high officials and generous salaries can be obtained at a considerable price. Moreover, in the minds of those "money worshippers," they believe that money can move gods, money can manipulate everything, and control everything, let alone a person's fame? But what they should consider is that true reputation is the spiritual wealth of one's own academic character, thought, and experience, obtained without seeking it. Without going through arduous labor (physical or intellectual), even if one believes they have achieved the so-called goal of "both fame and fortune," they can at most gain people's trust for a time, but will eventually fail. Moreover, false reputation cannot focus on people, and profit obtained without one's own labor cannot escape the name of theft. Profit must be obtained justly, which is a definite principle. Obtaining ill-gotten gains is really no different from theft. The loss in character and the loss in standing are far greater than the ill-gotten gains.

High-minded scholars who are indifferent to fame and profit have seen through the cage that fame and profit create for people (or it can be said that people cage themselves), and thus use "the lock of fame and the tether of profit" to suggest that people should not be bound by them, lest they lose their nature and cause endless troubles. Their views are naturally very correct. If we can clearly recognize fame and profit, we will certainly not be confused by the turbid "world." However, it may not be possible for a person to completely abandon the concept of fame and profit. I believe that there are very few people in the world who can truly not be bound by the lock of fame and the tether of profit. Even in the past, when human life was very simple and there was no need for you to compete with me, how many people could truly regard wealth and honor as floating clouds? The fisherman's life that Zheng Banqiao yearned for, asking us to follow along, is impossible unless time is turned back. In today's materialistic and civilized modern society, we fundamentally cannot and do not need to envy the lives of the so-called "high-minded scholars" and "recluses" of the past. But at the same time, we cannot but pursue a reasonable spiritual life, giving our souls a place of comfort. There is no need to learn from woodcutters and fishermen, and even less need to envy those ancient high-minded scholars and recluses. It is enough to have a new understanding of fame and profit.

According to the research of psychologists, since birth, humans have a need to satisfy desires. Some scholars say that desire is a human instinct, something that is innate. Let's leave that aside for now, but it is a fact that human desires and needs increase with the degree of growth and development. The more complex the social environment, the greater the desires and needs for life. In any case, we cannot live apart from society. Even people who live on isolated islands still have their desires and needs. If the minimum standard of living cannot be maintained, and the minimum material desires cannot be satisfied, you cannot teach people to be content with simplicity. With prices so high at present, the lives of ordinary people are extremely difficult. It is simply impossible to talk about living the tranquil and leisurely life of Tao Yuanming, "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence." If the rural economy is broken and social structures are shaken, no matter how much you love rural life, it will not allow your heart a single day of peace. The main reason is that the nature of ancient agricultural society and modern agricultural society has changed. As for finding a county magistrate like Tao Yuanming who "does not bow his waist for five pecks of rice," it is even more impossible.

We do not need to force ourselves to get rid of fame and profit, but only need to guide the concepts of fame and profit into reasonable and appropriate paths. Let's talk about fame. Liking fame and seeking fame cannot be considered bad things, only whether the pursuit is appropriate or not. The ancients said, "After the Three Dynasties, there was fear of not liking fame." Lincoln also said, "A person who truly likes fame will surely love fame and will definitely not easily tarnish his own name." It can be seen that people who truly like fame are ambitious. Based on their liking of fame, they can demonstrate their self-love and self-respect, unwilling to fall into mediocrity. Utilizing the human instinct to like fame can also stimulate a person's ambition and encourage a person's progress. However, one point must be clearly recognized: liking fame is pursuing deserved honor, not merely comparable to pursuing false reputation. People who love honor must have very high and great ideals in life, and they value the word "character" very highly. External praise, if it is truly deserved, can of course be accepted with peace of mind, but one should never listen to the flattery and adulation of the vulgar. Unless there is something in one's academics or career that deserves people's admiration, one should never be complacent about gaining a false reputation. Such a person who loves fame must be able to respect themselves and respect others. Loving fame in this way, honor is gained without seeking it, and it can be said to be beneficial to both the individual and society, truly reaching a thorough understanding of the meaning of fame.

Next, let's talk about profit. Seeking profit is also not a bad thing. Profit that is earned is the price of mental and physical labor, and it is a right that we should enjoy as human beings. If we blindly despise profit, not only will we not be able to obtain the necessities of life, but we will also be abandoning the rights we should enjoy. Without the ability to enjoy rights, we cannot fulfill obligations. Profit can lead people to be accustomed to selfishness, even to the point of destroying their reputation and character, or even leading to their ruin. Profit can also bring people material and spiritual comfort, improve their lives, and benefit the public and society. It all depends on how we seek profit. Just as with seeking fame, we must not seek it through improper means. We must obtain it through legitimate means, distinguishing between the true meaning of profit and righteousness, using "righteousness" as the premise for seeking profit, and earning profit according to the amount of effort exerted, without any thoughts of luck or greed. In that case, one's character will not be corrupted. One should not be complacent about achievements in academics and career, but should be content with the profit one has earned. Of course, we must also be able to maintain the minimum standard of living.

### Labor-Capital Partnership

— Yang Xiyao

In recent months, prices in this city have risen sharply, causing serious and widespread labor unrest. One wave has barely subsided before another arises, affecting almost every industry. Labor and management have taken extreme positions, and the entire society has been shaken. Although the social authorities have tried their best to mediate and resolve the situation gradually, leading to a gradual return to calm, it is difficult to be overly optimistic about future labor-management disputes, as prices are still difficult to stabilize. For example, the current wage increases have reached a level where they can maintain the livelihood of workers given the current prices, so everyone is naturally content. However, if prices continue to rise, will there be another request for wage increases after a certain period of time? It is truly unimaginable to continue like this.

I believe that to fundamentally resolve labor unrest, it is better to change the salary system to one where the capitalist contributes capital as shares, and the laborer contributes labor as shares. Simply put, one side contributes money shares, and the other side contributes labor shares. The surplus profits are distributed according to the corresponding proportions. In this way, if prices rise, everyone's profits will increase, so they will naturally not be affected. Once prices fall, everyone's profits will also decrease. However, when prices fall, consumption will naturally decrease as well, so they will still not be affected. Moreover, in this way, the laborer, having a personal stake in the profits, will naturally be loyal to their duties. When laborers are loyal and dedicated, the business will naturally prosper. When the business is thriving, it will naturally also benefit the capitalist. This can further promote labor-capital cooperation.

As for how labor and capital should cooperate, how to coordinate conditions, and how to distribute profits, the two sides must discuss these matters themselves.

I have no knowledge of economics and no experience in industry and commerce, so what I have expressed is naturally a one-sided ideal. I do not know if this idea is reasonable. I hope experts will discuss it and await factual proof.

### Pudong Temple Fair

— Li Sheng

There are still many superstitious people in Pudong. After temporarily suspending the temple fair last year due to the bombings at Gao Temple and other places on Dongchang Road, they are planning to hold the temple fair again this spring. Although the local sub-bureau has issued public notices, how can it stop these ignorant people from believing in superstitions?

Although the temple fair is said to be for worshiping gods, most of it is controlled by hooligans who are fond of bravery and fighting. They hook hundred-pound incense burners onto their arms and run for several miles (resulting in many deaths). There are also obscene lyrics and ditties, such as "Eighteen Touches" and "Striking Flowers"! Does the god of heaven really love these tunes?

For the farmers who are planting crops, the temple fair is unlucky. Good wheat seedlings are trampled into withered grass by the people at the temple fair. The temple fair causes thousands upon thousands of men, women, and children to abandon their work, idling for several days.

During the temple fair, other than the monks and Taoists who are showing off the plaques of the patrons and the young punks who want to show off, no one else really benefits!

I hope the municipal authorities will strictly issue an order to prohibit it! Otherwise, on the one hand, it will further encourage superstition. On the other hand, after eight years of suffering and hardship for the people, if a temple fair is held, the amount of money wasted will be considerable, which will hinder the reconstruction of the region! Moreover, the temple fair is crowded, resulting in children being trampled, pickpockets and thieves, and arguments and teasing, all of which are detrimental to public order.

### Vacuum Blood Collection Device

— Shen Shi

When a doctor needs to draw blood from a patient's blood vessel for diagnostic tests, they use an ordinary intravenous syringe.

Recently, there has been a new type of vacuum blood collection device. The form is similar to the syringes we have seen. One end has a needle with a side opening, and on the manual suction side, it has been replaced with a rubber-sealed suction head that contains an automatically aligned vacuum storage tube.

This type of vacuum blood collection device can draw one cubic centimeter of blood in one second, which is several times faster than ordinary ones. When the blood draw is completed, it can automatically seal, so there is no risk of spilling blood or transmitting bacteria, and there is no need to add any anticoagulant drugs. Therefore, the blood drawing procedure is much simpler and safer than with current intravenous syringes.

### Sympathy

— Xiaoshan

The relationship between people is always reciprocal, not only in external "mutual assistance" but even more so in superficial "sympathy."

Some people think that mutual assistance is active and sympathy is passive, but this is not the case. People who are accustomed to helping others are not necessarily sympathetic to people; they may even be "unfeeling." Because without genuine sympathy, many acts of mutual assistance today fall into hypocrisy and deception.

People can have many external differences—status, education, lifestyle, age, race, even hobbies and interests. These can all be three-dimensional, but internally, they should be flattened out, and each other's hearts should be able to melt together at any time. But the current situation seems to be that the internal blockade is even greater than the external separation. The door to each person's heart is almost tightly closed. Some people even regard "maintaining a considerable distance" as a new form of worldly wisdom!

We attribute the reason for the closed heart doors not to the external separation relations but simply to the fact that people, out of some kind of fear, pride, suspicion, or just pure laziness, have abandoned their innate sympathy.

The one who tied the bell must untie it. Why not pick up this precious key and open the blocked heart door!

"Sympathy" does not mean "pity." Seeing a beggar on the brink of death, everyone will compassionately sigh. This is not enough "sympathy." On the contrary, it may be "arrogance!" Sympathy is to inject yourself and your genuine emotions into your relationship with others! It contains an unspeakable suitability, warmth, and the flavor of loveliness.

Sympathy is standing in the reality of others, understanding their emotions, and their goals, so that they feel a kind of practical "freshness," just like the blood that they themselves have grown.

Sympathy cannot be achieved simply with language and gestures, but by giving yourself to others unreservedly—genuinely giving yourself, not coldly and completely.

"Those who sympathize with people will receive sympathy!" Many fruits of sympathy make oneself feel an overflowing "vitality!" Because when another person's heart door opens for you, the manifestation of that "true feeling" is always shared mutually.

If humanity can learn internal sympathy, many formal "mutual assistance treaties" would not be habitually shattered and cease to exist.

### Non-Reflective Glasses

— Wu Daquan

People who wear glasses feel that the lenses sometimes have glare, making it difficult to see clearly. Recently, there has been a remedy. That is to coat the lens with a thin film of chemical substance. Although this film cannot prevent reflection, it has the effect of making the reflections cancel each other out. A camera lens coated with this thin film, even when shooting directly into the sun, will not result in blurry negatives.

### Reply to Readers

Wang Ming asks: The question was seen in yesterday's newspaper.

Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: Your wife is suffering from cervicitis. She needs to check her blood pressure and urine, and it is best to be treated in the hospital.

Weng Zhen asks: (1) What is the treatment for "deep bronchial shadow"? (2) What special medicines are available?

Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: There is no specific medicine for "deep bronchial shadow." It is advisable to rest, recuperate more, and calcium tablets and cough medicine can be used for symptomatic relief.

Jiang Wenbin asks: I am thirty-four years old this year. When I was twenty-three, I suffered from hemoptysis. At the age of thirty, the disease relapsed, and my constitution gradually weakened. The following autumn, after an X-ray examination, there were spots on both sides of the lungs, with the right side being more severe. According to the doctor, it is chronic pulmonary tuberculosis and there is no radical cure. I now request several points: (1) Is the special American medicine for lung disease "Streptomycin" or is there another medicine? (2) When will Chinese people have the opportunity to enjoy it? (3) In your opinion, Dr., what is the best method of treatment for my illness?

Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: There are many rumors about special American medicines for lung disease, but there are no documents in formal medical journals. If there are any, they only describe the experimental procedures in the experimental airspace and the effects of the theory. Therefore, you do not yet have the opportunity to enjoy it. Your condition must be first photographed with a Cox-light film or viewed with fluoroscopy before a decision can be made.

Shen Luchang asks: I am thirty-four years old this year and have suffered from premature ejaculation for fifteen or sixteen years. My body is weak. I have the following three points and would like to request a reply: (1) Is there any medicine that can cure this disease, and where can I buy it? (2) Is hospitalization effective, and how many days will it take? (3) Is the potency of the Prabha advertised in your newspaper reliable?

Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: (1) Taking nerve sedatives or phospholipid brain supplements is effective. (2) If you can calm your mind and recuperate yourself, you do not need to be hospitalized. (3) I am sorry that I cannot casually recommend medicines advertised in the newspaper.
