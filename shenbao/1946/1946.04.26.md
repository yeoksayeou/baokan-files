### Soon Departing for the Capital, Bidding Farewell to Sichuan Compatriots: Chairman Chiang Arrives in Chengdu from Chongqing, Central Government Ministers Continue to Arrive in the Capital

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chengdu, 25th] Chairman Chiang, aboard the Mei-Ling airplane, arrived safely at Chengdu's Taiping Temple Airport at 4:30 PM on the 25th. Sichuan Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Qun arrived with him. Yu Jishi, Director of the National Government Military Affairs Bureau, and over twenty others accompanied him. Xikang Provincial Government Chairman Liu Wenhui, Sichuan-Xikang Pacification Director Deng Xihou, Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters Director Huang Jilu, Military Academy Education Director Guan Linzheng, and others were all at the airport to greet him. It is reported that Chairman Chiang's visit is because Sichuan was the base for resistance against Japan, and Sichuan compatriots contributed more in terms of wealth and manpower during the war than any other place in the country. Now that the war has been won and the government is about to return to the capital, he has come to Chengdu specifically to bid farewell to the Sichuan compatriots, thereby expressing his intention to comfort and encourage them.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Central Organization Department Deputy Minister Yu Jingtan, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chairman Chen Shuren, and Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang arrived in the capital today from Chongqing aboard a special plane for the return to the capital. Central Party Headquarters Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng has rescheduled his flight to the capital for tomorrow. Organization Department Minister Chen Lifu is scheduled to arrive in the capital on the 27th, and Examination Yuan President Dai Jitao is scheduled to return to the capital on the 28th.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Hankou, 24th] Xue Dubi, Duan Xipeng, and Ye Xiufeng flew from Chongqing to the capital the day before yesterday via Hankou. Due to an airplane malfunction, they were stranded here for one day. They flew to the capital together this morning at 10:00 AM. Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yan Shenyu and others were also among those traveling with them.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Today, the returning-to-the-capital plane continued to carry eleven personnel from the Soviet Embassy and ten from the French Embassy. It is reported that Soviet Ambassador Petrov will delay his arrival in the capital because his residence in the capital has not yet been arranged. However, the ambassador to China, Delfour, is scheduled to arrive in the capital from Tianjin at the beginning of next month.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 25th] The joint office of the central party, government, and military organs remaining in Chongqing was established today at the Military Affairs Commission. The director of the office is Zhu Shaoliang, and the deputy directors are Xu Xiaoyan and Chen Kewen. From now on, personnel from the party, government, and military organs remaining in Chongqing will be under the unified command of this office. As soon as the central organs have completed their return to the capital, this office will be dissolved.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun and Minister of Food Xu Kan arrived in Shanghai by plane from the capital at 4:00 PM yesterday. This reporter met with Mr. Yu at the airport and immediately inquired about the progress of the Sino-American loan and the amount of the loan. Mr. Yu said with a smile that it was not yet time to disclose that. It is reported that Mr. Yu will stay in Shanghai for a short period of time to handle financial and fiscal affairs in this city. Those who arrived in Shanghai on the same plane as Mr. Yu and others yesterday included Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications, and Yu Shuming, General Manager of the Farmers Bank of China.

### Marshall to Fly to the Capital Soon; Future KMT-CCP Talks to be Held in the Capital

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Chongqing News: Marshall may fly to the capital on the 27th. The plane has already arrived in Chongqing to await him. Furthermore, this afternoon the Chongqing radio station inquired about the weather in Nanjing, leading to widespread rumors in the capital that Marshal Marshall would arrive in the capital at 4:00 PM this afternoon. It was later learned that this was not accurate, but according to General McClure, Marshall is indeed planning to fly to the capital on the 27th.

[United Press Dispatch from Chongqing, 25th] The government has notified the Chinese Communist Party that future meetings must be held in Nanjing. At the same time, Special Envoy Marshall continues to meet with leaders of various parties. This morning, he held talks with key figures from the Democratic League. However, the military three-person team will not meet in the coming days. Marshall and the other two members may travel to the capital at the end of this week and then hold a meeting. There is no news of progress in the talks from Marshall's side. He has asked someone to relay that he has no news to report to the press. A CCP spokesman said that he believes that even if an agreement is reached on resolving the Northeast problem, the communist forces that have already occupied Changchun and surrounded Harbin would "be unwilling to hand over the two cities to the central government." The CCP is still demanding a ceasefire in the Northeast as the price for negotiating political disputes related to government reorganization and troop reductions. If a ceasefire order is issued and the two armies maintain the status quo, then the CCP will have occupied one hundred districts in the Northeast, while the Nationalist army will only occupy twenty districts. The Nationalist Party wants to obtain the two cities of Harbin and Changchun, and the only way to do that is to send troops to seize them.

[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] It is widely rumored here that when Special Envoy Marshall holds another meeting with the KMT and CCP representatives, the National Government will especially seek to control certain areas of the Northeast militarily, but it must withdraw from Changchun and must not advance into Harbin and Longjiang (Qiqihar).

[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 24th] President Truman's special envoy to China, Marshall, has the primary task of stopping the fighting in the Northeast. His second task will be to advise both the KMT and the CCP to jointly abide by the resolutions passed by the Political Consultative Conference. According to news from Chongqing, the central government has agreed to postpone the National Assembly scheduled to be held in Nanjing on May 5, which is a major concession to the CCP. The situation has eased considerably, and it is reported that the central government is also prepared to compromise on the Northeast issue. If the CCP refuses to participate in the National Assembly, Marshall's plan will suffer a serious setback. The fact that Marshall is returning to his post with his wife this time shows that he intends to reside in China for a long time, and his determination to unite China and consolidate the foundation of peace can also be seen from this.

### Repairing the Yellow River Bridge

The Pinghan Railway Bureau is Going All Out

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Hankou, 25th] It is reported that the Pinghan Railway Bureau is currently concentrating its efforts on repairing the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The entire project will cost 60 million yuan, which has already been advanced by the railway bureau. The goal is to complete the project before the Yellow River floods. Furthermore, the overall repair project on the Yuehan Railway is continuing. The Wuchang to Qujiang section will officially resume train service on the first of next month (currently only temporary trains are running). The entire line is expected to be open to traffic before July 1.

### Shijiazhuang Decided to Change to a City

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Beiping, 25th] Shijiazhuang has decided to change its name to Shimen City. The first mayor will be Yin Wenchang. Yin has sent personnel to Shijiazhuang to actively make preparations.

### The Soviet Union Moves Machines Away from the Northeast; Worth 500 Million US Dollars; Yan'an Broadcasting Openly Attempts to Cover it Up; The Northeast Production Administration Formally Established in Shenyang

[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] According to estimates by American mining experts who have just returned to the capital from the Northeast, the Soviet Union has transported at least 500 million US dollars worth of machinery from the Northeast. It will take China at least two years to replace this machinery. The American experts represent a certain internationally renowned company and came to China to investigate mineral resources, reporting to the China Resources Committee. When they were in the southern part of the Nine Provinces of the East, they saw that the industrial areas had been dismantled and emptied. In Fushun alone, all the machinery had been dismantled and loaded onto trains, which were transported to Siberia, with a total of 2,200 train cars. Unless peace is restored in the Northeast, the vast area there will be of no value to China. Currently, transportation is extremely difficult due to the disruption caused by the war.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 25th] According to a Xinhua News Agency broadcast from Yan'an on the 21st, "There are more than 1,800 factories in the entire city of Shenyang, and all the equipment is intact and has not been damaged. It can be seen that the Kuomintang authorities' clamor that the Soviet army destroyed factories and transported away machinery is purely a fabrication." People in Shenyang who listened to this Yan'an broadcast were all extremely indignant, believing that the Yan'an side was truly dreaming in broad daylight and confusing black and white. The fact that the factories in Shenyang were moved away is an indisputable fact, known to both Chinese and foreigners. The United States, Britain, and other countries have even made representations to the Soviet Union about this matter. All the Chinese and foreign reporters who arrived in Shenyang, including reporters from Xinhua News Agency and Liberation Daily, have visited the factories in Tiexi and saw with their own eyes that only empty shells remained. Even the Soviet side has acknowledged this matter without attempting to cover it up. Unexpectedly, Yan'an openly covered up this matter, and its intentions can be imagined.

[Another Telegram] The Northeast Production Administration of the Economic Commission of the Northeast Administrative Headquarters was formally established in Shenyang on the morning of the 24th, and a council was established with Wang Jiazhen, acting deputy director of the Economic Commission, serving as the acting chairman of the council and director of the administration. Mr. Wang stated: (1) He hopes that the Northeast production plan can be coordinated with the inland. (2) The work of industrial recovery in the Northeast is arduous. After taking over, he hopes that all parties will maintain a spirit of perseverance and clear division of responsibilities, so that industry can not only recover but also flourish. (3) Japanese technicians will be utilized, and excellent domestic experts will be selected to complete the recovery plan in a short period of time.

### Zhejiang's Entire Railway Can Be Repaired Within the Month

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Quzhou, 25th] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is currently actively repairing the rails from Hangzhou to Zhuji and the two sections from Zhuzhou, Pingxiang, Nanchang, and Jiujiang. More than a dozen bridges on the Nanchang-Shangrao and Quzhou-Jinhua sections have been completely destroyed, making it difficult to repair them in a short period of time. The Jiangshan to Quzhou and Zhuji to Jinhua sections are easier to repair. There are still many sleepers, but rails are lacking. The central government has decided to repair all the railways in Zhejiang Province within the month.

### The Stamped Legal Tender of the Northeast Will Be Recalled Ahead of Schedule

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Beiping, 25th] The stamped legal tender issued by the Northeast Administrative Headquarters was previously decided by the Ministry of Finance to be recalled within eighteen months. The Northeast related parties have requested the Ministry of Finance to recall it within three to six months, which is said to have been approved.

### The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Unfolds Relief Work; Six Work Teams Established in Jiangsu Province; Relief Work in Hubei Province is Being Actively Strengthened

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 25th] In order to fully unfold relief work, the UNRRA Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch has decided that, in addition to directly handling relief work in the counties along the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, it will also establish six base work teams in various important areas to preside over relief matters. (1) The Xuzhou Team is in charge of the eight counties of Fengxian, Pei County, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Pi County, Tongshan, Suqian, and Suyu. (2) The Haizhou Team is in charge of the seven counties and cities of Yinyun, Donghai, Ganyu, Guannan, Lianshui, Shuyang, and Siyang. (3) The Taizhou Team is in charge of the six counties of Yancheng, Fuyang, Xinghua, Dongtai, Taizhou, and Jingjiang. (4) The Yangzhou Team is in charge of the six counties of Yangzhou, Huaiyin, Huaian, Gaoyou, Yizheng. (5) The Nantong Team is in charge of the five counties of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, Qidong, and Jingjiang. (6) The Shanghai Team is in charge of the ten counties of Shanghai, Songjiang, Nanhui, Qingpu, Jinshan, Fengxian, Baoshan, Chuansha, Jiading, and Chongming.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Hankou, 25th] This reporter interviewed Zhou Cangbai, Director of the Hubei Relief Branch, today. According to him, relief work in Hubei Province has recently been actively strengthened. Since May, 2,000 tons of goods have been shipped to Hankou daily, totaling 60,000 tons per month. In order to provide relief to the disaster areas in northern Hubei, it has been decided to use 150 trucks to transport goods to that area starting next month. As for goods shipped from Hankou to Hunan, 500 tons per day will also be reached starting in May, and there may be further increases in the future. In addition, this branch has loaned more than 6,000 tons of food and wages for dike repair to Hubei Province. Recently, there has been an outbreak of plague in Yichang, resulting in more than sixty deaths. In order to prevent the disaster from spreading, personnel have been dispatched to carry a large number of medicines for rescue. In the current situation, there is no shortage of goods shipped to Hankou. The difficulties are that there are too few warehouses, making storage difficult, and the freight from Hankou to various disaster areas requires 2 billion yuan per month, for which there is still no appropriate solution.

### National Government Order

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 25th] The National Government issued the following order on the 25th: Special Envoy and Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Peru, Bao Junjian, is hereby appointed as the Plenipotentiary Representative for the exchange of instruments of ratification of the Sino-Ecuadorian Treaty of Friendship. This order.

### Commander of Changchun (Part 2)

— Fang Ren, dispatched from Shenyang

If Changchun is like this, what about Harbin, the famous city on the Songhua River to the north, Qiqihar, where the Nenjiang Provincial Government is located, northwest of Harbin, and where the Nenjiang River flows through? Needless to say, the situation there is that they are surrounded by enemies on all sides. The chairmen and mayors can only mingle in the government offices they have taken over. Saying this is not being harsh, but the range of power of the mayors and chairmen who have only taken over the government offices is really not as great as that of a small bao chief or even a jia chief in some places in the mainland. According to people close to Songjiang Provincial Chairman Guan Jiyu and Harbin Mayor Yang Chuoan, both Guan and Yang had no hobbies in the past, but now they both like to smoke paper cigarettes, especially Guan Jiyu—he has always been a relatively reserved person. In that kind of environment, his inner feelings are probably felt most deeply by him personally, or perhaps only those around him who are also deeply mired in an unspeakable situation can understand a little of what it is like. The news between Harbin and Changchun is still relatively accessible. You can make a long-distance phone call, and if the line has not been damaged, even if there is often interference and a lot of noise during the call, especially when the two places are exchanging news, you can still hear some news in the blur. In addition, unless the train is occupied for military transport and no passenger tickets are sold, people from the north and south can always flow to each other, and they can eventually exchange some news through oral messages. Dehui and Shuangcheng indeed have teams of unknown origin that inspect passing pedestrians. But people always have ways, and the inspectors are not all shrewd and capable. But Qiqihar is different. Since the Nenjiang Provincial Government left Changchun on January 8 together with the Songjiang Provincial Government, after staying in Harbin for only a few days, Chairman Peng Jiqun led the receiving personnel to Qiqihar. The news there has always been felt to be closed off. People living in Changchun feel this way, and it is conceivable that people in various places in the mainland feel even more at a loss.

On the 29th, the reporter left Changchun out of necessity. Changchun was lonely, monotonous, lacking in vitality, suffocating, and showing considerable unrest. When the reporter left, in addition to the military delegation led by Chief Dong Yanping, who would be working in Harbin with Marshal Malinovsky, the number of people left there was extremely small. In terms of units: the person in charge of the Manchurian Coal Building was Major General Wu Shiyu, and the person in charge of the Changchun Municipal Government was Li Zhaojunmai, and the manager of the Changchun Branch of the Central Bank was Wei Mengling. Only Central News Agency reporter Liu Zhuzhou accompanied the reporter.

Wu Shiyu and Lai Bingquan are both old Jiangxi folks, one in charge of transportation and the other in charge of general affairs. When they returned to Changchun last December, almost all of these two aspects of work were undertaken by them. The Changchun Municipal Government and the Changchun Branch of the Central Bank were the twin spirits who pioneered the receiving work in various parts of the Northeast after the so-called deadlock in the Northeast was broken. They started receiving work on December 22 last year, and after the news spread, it made many frowning people happy and encouraged people in Shenyang, Harbin and other places to actively carry out receiving work. Mayor Zhao Junmai studied military affairs in the United States and served as the mayor of Hengyang in the past. When he was in Hengyang, it was during the famous Battle of Hengyang during the War of Resistance. Therefore, when the situation was urgent, he said that he did not feel unfamiliar with such a scene, and he could still command and deal with it when necessary. Manager Wei Mengling moved from the Manchurian Coal Building to the Central Bank a few days before the reporter left Changchun in order to stabilize the hearts of his staff and the citizens. Banks seemed to be particularly noticed when rumors were rampant. Therefore, rumors often used banks as material, and after Manager Wei moved into the bank, he expressed his determination, making the rumor-mongers feel bored themselves. The Central News Agency originally had three people working in Changchun. Photojournalist Xuan Wenjie transferred to work in Shenyang, so only reporters Liu Zhuzhou and Zhong Henian were left in Changchun. They printed and distributed news releases with typewriters, providing news to Changchun newspapers. Therefore, Changchun newspapers were not as disorganized as those in Harbin and other places, publishing news that was not news. Their office hours were always from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm, and the time when Changchun was most able to walk around everywhere was all in this period, and they almost all spent it in the office. Many people in Changchun learned to dance, but they had no time to go to those places. On the 29th, Zhong Jun Henian left Changchun on official business, and as a result, only Liu Jun Zhuzhou was fighting alone. Liu Jun was determined to persevere to the end. He expressed in a telegram to a friend in Shenyang that he was "willing to fight to the last bullet (paper bullet)."

On the third day after the reporter left Changchun, on the night of April 1, fighting broke out in the western suburbs of Changchun! The city lights suddenly went out again. Then the situation became more and more urgent day by day. The Soviet army withdrew from Changchun on the 14th. The future of Changchun remains to be seen, and only facts can answer it. With a feeling of nostalgia, the reporter wishes Changchun and the friends in Changchun well!

### Beijing Conscripts Japanese Prisoners of War for Service, Completing Six Suburban Highways

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] More than 12,000 Japanese prisoners of war who were conscripted for service in this city will be sent back to their country on May 1. This batch of Japanese prisoners of war belongs to the 40th Division of the enemy army. They have been conscripted for labor service since February of this year, and have completed six suburban highways including the Huanhu, Baiguoshan, Tai (pingmen)-Yao (huamen), Yao-Yan (zi)he (banmen), and Xia (guan)-Yan highways. The restoration project of the three main roads in the city, including Hanzhong, Mochou, and Guanghuamen (to the airport), a total of 44.1 kilometers, the construction of the American army parking lot and the army headquarters sewer project, and the Qin Huai River dredging project and many other places, except for the Qin Huai River, all projects have been completed.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau is currently preparing vehicles for the more than 12,000 Japanese prisoners of war who have been transported from various places and assembled in this city, and will transport them to Shanghai in batches starting on May 1.

### Zhao Jiaxiang Returns to Shenyang; It is Said that the Chairman is Concerned About the Current Situation in the Northeast and Instructs Him to Wait Quietly for a Solution Through Mediation

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Beiping, 25th] With the war in the Northeast raging fiercely between Sipingjie and Gongzhuling, Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Headquarters, flew to Shenyang by special plane on the morning of the 25th. Zhao said: After arriving in Chongqing, when he visited Chairman Chiang at noon on the 23rd, the Chairman inquired in detail about the situation in the Northeast, but did not express much about the military situation in the Northeast. The Chairman's intention is that the current situation in the Northeast should be waited for quietly to be resolved through mediation, and he instructed me to convey this intention to all the responsible persons in the Northeast and not to act rashly.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 25th] Zhao Jiaxiang flew to Shenyang from Beiping on the 25th. It is said that Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the situation in the Northeast and is extraordinarily concerned about the compatriots in the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] News from Beiping: The two armies of the KMT and the CCP have launched a fierce battle in Gongzhuling, north of Shenyang. The follow-up troops of the New First Army have arrived. The statement made by the Xinhua Branch of Beiping that the deputy commander of the 31st Division of the New First Army was injured is not accurate.

[Associated Press Dispatch from Beiping, 25th] Reports say that the "shock troops" of the New First Army broke through the strong defense line of the communist army in Gongzhuling and are advancing towards Changchun. They will arrive in Changchun within the next few days.

### Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen States Soviet Troops Should Withdraw from Dalian; Malinovsky Has Departed Harbin

[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen stated today that he earnestly hopes Soviet troops will withdraw from Dalian within this month. It is reported that he has no information regarding the situation in Dalian, and the withdrawal date for Soviet troops from Northeast China does not include Dalian. "However, Dalian is part of China's territory, and we hope that Soviet troops will withdraw from the entire Northeast region within the month, in accordance with their promises." As for Harbin, it has been lost to the Chinese Communists; "Communist troops are already inside the Harbin city area." Soviet troops are scheduled to withdraw from Harbin today, but as of this evening, the National Government has not yet learned whether Soviet troops have withdrawn as scheduled.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] Qualified Chinese and foreign sources stated today that the Soviet troops currently stationed in the southeastern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces are under the jurisdiction of the Red Army Supreme Command in North Korea and are not included in Marshal Malinovsky's plan to withdraw from the Northeast before the end of April. The same may be true of the Red Army troops stationed in Dalian. They know the precise boundaries of the so-called southeastern region of the Nine Eastern Provinces in detail. They also pointed out that the southeastern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces and Dalian are adjacent to the north bank of the Yalu River, which is the rear buffer zone for the Soviet troops stationed in Korea. It is said that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from this area depends on future Sino-Soviet negotiations.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] Today is the date for the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Harbin. However, since communicating with the area last night, no further telegrams have been received from Harbin as of now. It is still unknown whether Soviet troops have completely withdrawn. However, it is speculated that our military delegation may have left Harbin. Marshal Malinovsky left Harbin on the 24th, without the military delegation or local personnel accompanying him.

[Agence France-Presse, Shenyang, 25th] According to government officials who have retreated here, Communist troops have established political power in the villages near Harbin and have infiltrated the city several months ago. They are now preparing to take over the city's administration as soon as Soviet troops have completely withdrawn. Government troops are currently about 220 miles southwest of Harbin, in conflict with Communist troops in the Sipingjie area.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] Communist Party sources in Beiping predicted today that Harbin will be taken over by the Communist Party's "Self-Defense Army." Soviet troops are scheduled to begin withdrawing from Harbin today and are expected to complete the withdrawal roughly by tomorrow. Cities and outposts surrounding Harbin, including its modern major airfield, are already in the hands of Communist troops, but as of yesterday, nominal control still belonged to Soviet troops. Meanwhile, government takeover personnel in Qiqihar, in view of the possibility that Communist troops will immediately take over after the Soviet withdrawal, have gone to Werbin, preparing to transfer to Shenyang. Both Nationalist and Communist sources previously stated that Harbin Mayor Yang Chuo'an had reached a tentative gentleman's agreement with the Communist troops surrounding Harbin, whereby he would continue to serve as mayor, while the Communist Party would appoint a deputy mayor to jointly maintain peace and order in Harbin. Recent news has not revealed whether Yang is still adhering to this agreement, continuing to serve as mayor, or is seeking to leave Harbin, like other government officials.

### Mediation Department Encounters Difficulties; Executive Group's Work Comes to a Standstill

[This newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Niu Xianming, Deputy Chief of Staff on the government side of the Executive Headquarters, is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 26th, accompanied by Cai Zonglian, the newly appointed head of the Shenyang Central Group. It is said that the 31st Group of the Obstruction Prevention Department has gone to Yongnian to work. Rumors that the 31st Group has been dispatched to the Northeast are inaccurate, as the 30th Group is still in Shenyang as a reserve. Mu Weizhao Jiaxiang was originally the government leader of the Shenyang Central Group, but because Zhao is the Chief of Staff of the Security Commander's Office and is very busy, Cai Zonglian, who was newly transferred from Nanjing, has taken over.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] Government, Communist, and American personnel participating in the work of the Beiping Mediation Executive Headquarters, in separate talks with Associated Press reporters, all admitted that their mission to end the civil war and reorganize the army is currently impossible to advance. Approximately thirty executive groups are currently distributed throughout China, from Hainan Island in the south to Sipingjie in the north, but the Beiping Executive Headquarters is filled with an atmosphere of stagnation, awaiting developments in Chongqing. The major difficulties faced by the Executive Headquarters today are as follows: (1) The inability of Chongqing to stop new conflicts; (2) The paralysis of the executive groups sent to the Northeast; (3) The failure to reach an agreement on repairing the destroyed railways; (4) The inability to lift the sieges of many cities in North China. There are 633 American personnel in the Executive Headquarters, which may soon increase to about 1,000. At present, the Executive Headquarters hopes to obtain new life from the Chongqing leadership in order to complete its mission.

### Materials Construction Plan; Budget Drafted by Economic Council

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 25th] It is learned that the Supreme Economic Council has already drafted a budget of 22 billion in funds for the post-war five-year materials construction plan. It is said that two methods will be adopted for raising funds: (1) Foreign investment and loans; (2) Government and people's investment.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] National Assembly representatives who arrived in Nanjing today, after learning of the news published in the morning that the National Assembly had decided to postpone its opening, still came to the Social Service Center to register with hopeful hearts. Starting at 9:00 a.m., the first to register was He Bingru, a vocational representative from Shandong Province. The registration ended at 5:00 p.m., with Wang Xiyao, a representative from Shanxi, being the last to register. A total of 121 people registered for the day, with 108 completing the registration procedures. List of registered representatives (vocational representatives): He Bingru, Wan Huihou, Wang Linsheng, Sun Yichang, Liao Muliu, Zhu Huiqing, Pan Shenwu, He Jiantang, Sun Yuanshu, Tang Qiyu, Wang Shuhui, Yang Yifeng, Bai Guangren, Cao Chu, Du Xiufan, Huang Xingzhou, Mi Wenxiao, Ning Shi, Zhu Jingnong, Gu Chi, Li Gui, Chen Yongxin, Li Hongru, Hu Tingliang, Li Zhengmu, Ling Ziwei, Guo Jianying, Li Zi, Chen Xifang, Xu Xingcheng, Chen Kezhong, Ling Hongxun, Li Kehua, Chen Chou, Hu Dingan, etc., 35 people.

Regional representatives: Sun Mujia, Qi Zhihou, Ma Yuanfang, Liang Dong, Yang Youjiong, etc., 68 people. Total of 121 people. Those who arrived in Nanjing this afternoon and did not have time to complete the registration procedures include 21 representatives from Guangxi, 12 representatives from Jiangsu, and more than 20 representatives from other provinces. It is said that there are still dozens of representatives in Nanjing who have not yet registered.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The registration procedures for National Assembly representatives are extremely cautious. Forms are filled out, stamps are affixed, and signatures are made as many as five or six times. Documents are also submitted for verification, and photographs are checked before a silver circular badge, a red silk ribbon, and a pass with a photograph of the representative are obtained. Then, meal tickets, barber tickets, and bath tickets are collected. Each person can receive 90 meal tickets to eat at the restaurants designated by the conference, two meals per person per day, estimated to be usable for 45 days. After completing the registration procedures, representatives who do not intend to find their own accommodation can be picked up at any time by the 50 people at the conference's transportation reception station. There is talk that the conference will be postponed to May 15th or 20th. Therefore, many of the vocational representatives who have already registered plan to take time to go back and take care of official and personal matters, especially lawyers who are unwilling to sacrifice too much of their careers. Among the representatives who registered today, most were from Anhui Province. A total of 82 representatives arriving in Nanjing have gone to this newspaper's Nanjing office at 145 Yuping Road to subscribe to the newspaper.

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary of the National Assembly Preparatory Office, declared today that the office is currently actively carrying out preparatory work. The National Assembly may be held within three to five days after the originally scheduled opening date of May 5th. Most representatives have already registered.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] The results of the re-election of National Assembly representatives from Tianjin vocational groups are: Li Pinzhi and Jiang Mengpu from the Chamber of Commerce, Yuan Shihong and Chuan Xiushan from the Labor Union, and Zhu Youheng and Zhao Jingmin from the Farmers' Association, elected as official representatives.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 25th] Shen Ji and Wang Shangzhi, National Assembly representatives from overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, have arrived in Shanghai and will go to Nanjing within days. In addition, Wen Jupeng, National Assembly representative from Sumatra, and Lin Qingping and He Ruqun, National Assembly representatives from Singapore, will arrive in Hong Kong within days and transfer to Nanjing.

### Pan Gongzhan and Others Host National Assembly Representatives Staying in Shanghai; Soliciting Opinions on Postponing the National Assembly

In view of the approaching date of the National Assembly, Pan Gongzhan, a member of the Central Committee, Yang Xiaotian, Chairman of the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen, and Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, issued invitations to National Assembly representatives staying in Shanghai to hold a tea party at the New Life Club at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to foster relationships and solicit opinions on the draft constitution and various current issues. More than 20 National Assembly representatives staying in Shanghai, including He Yuanming, Wang Qizhang, Liu Zhidang, Hu Jing'an, Pan Bingqing, Niu Jingting, Ding Zhongying, Xi Yushu, Zhu Fengwei, Yu Huai'ren, Chen Guanying, Chen Chaoxiu, Tang Chengzong, Tang Qi, Wang Jiyi, Chen Tingrui, Zhu Zhaokui, Qin Liankui, Ye Xianggao, Wang Renlin, and Zhou Xuexiang, Zhu Xuefan, etc., were invited to attend. First, Yang Xiaotian and Wu Shaoshu delivered speeches explaining that the purpose of the reception was to solicit opinions on the draft constitution, because the draft constitution is the fundamental law of the future country. The National Assembly will have a very short session, and representatives must exchange opinions before the meeting in order to produce a perfect constitution. At the same time, they must also make more preparations for the agenda proposals. Although the conference has been postponed, the preparatory work must still be stepped up. The representatives then expressed their opinions, focusing on the postponement of the National Assembly. Xi Yushu believes that the government has been sincere in holding the National Assembly to implement constitutional government. The date of May 5th was decided last year and a formal notice has been issued. It is regrettable that it has been postponed again because a few parties have not submitted their list of representatives. Pan Gongzhan believes that although the National Assembly has been postponed, the date of the convening will not be too far away. We can go to Nanjing first to prepare for the meeting and focus on studying the draft constitution. In addition, Tang Qi, Wang Jiyi, Chen Guanying, and Liu Zhixun also expressed their opinions. Summarizing the opinions of all parties, they unanimously advocated inquiring with the Central Government in the name of the National Assembly Liaison Association as to why the meeting was postponed and when it would be held, and also expressed the hope that the Communist Party and the Democratic League and other minority parties would show sincerity in participating in the National Assembly. Finally, it was decided to submit the opinions expressed by everyone to the National Assembly Liaison Association for further discussion, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.

Changzhou

Seizure of Traitor Property Awaits Execution After Judgment: The handling of the legally seized property of Chinese traitors before a verdict is reached has garnered significant attention from local figures. The Procuratorate of the Local Court of this county recently received instructions from the Jiangsu High Procuratorate, which in turn received Directive No. 2002 of the Jing Zhi Xing Zi [Capital 指 刑 字] issued on April 10th of this year by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The directive stipulates that all legally seized property of Chinese traitors should be executed after a verdict of confiscation is finalized. Before execution, no one is allowed to use the property, unless there is a definite risk of loss or damage, in which case Articles 140, Paragraph 1, and 141 of the Criminal Procedure Law may be followed. Any unauthorized movement of the property will result in the executing agency bearing full responsibility. The directive emphasizes that the case is not yet finalized, and whether or not confiscation will occur is still pending a final decision. Furthermore, the inventory of the seized property has already been reported and may not be arbitrarily altered. If seized property is forcibly occupied or used by the military, and the executing agency is unable to prevent the loss, it should immediately provide the military unit's number, the name of its commanding officer, the circumstances of the loss, and detailed amounts, and report them for verification and instructions. Upon receiving the order, the Procuratorate has notified the Changzhou branch of the Jiangsu Bureau for Handling Enemy and Traitor Property accordingly.

Jiangyin

Military and Political Leaders Jointly Visit Cheng

Communist forces in northern Jiangsu have been very active recently, making counties in southern Jiangsu extremely important. Tang Enbo, Commander of the First Pacification District, and Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, arrived in Cheng by special train from Wuxi around 10:00 AM on the 22nd. Accompanying them were Song Shaojiao from the Pacification Supervision Group and Fang Zhinong, Secretary of the Provincial Government, among others. They first went to the regimental headquarters of the 237th Regiment of the 79th Division to listen to reports on military affairs from Division Commander Wen Li and Regimental Commander Hu Limin. Subsequently, Chairman Wang went to the county government. As County Magistrate Fang had gone to Jin Province, he was received by Secretary Sun Juncai and the heads of various departments. Chairman Wang then convened a meeting of personnel from various agencies and gave instructions. The main points included the need to establish security, improve the Baojia system, and purge undesirable elements in villages and towns, requiring joint guarantee certificates. Special attention should be paid to clearing up household registrations and requisitioning military grain. In the future, if there are quotas assigned, they must be fulfilled immediately, with the price paid at 13,000 yuan per shi [unit of dry volume]. Given the local financial difficulties, a locally adapted tax may be temporarily levied. In the future, local security should rely on the joint efforts of the Party, government, military, and people, and genuine assistance should be provided. After lunch, the two military and political leaders, Tang and Wang, took the Minquan warship to Jingjiang and Nantong counties in northern Jiangsu for inspection, providing instructions to military and political leaders. They may also make a trip to Changshu before returning separately to Zhenjiang and Wuxi.

Haining

A Record of the Tragic Murder of a Virtuous Monk

性照Xingzhao, the abbot of the Mituo Temple in Haining, usually devoted himself to Buddhist scriptures and practiced what he preached. Previously, he was ordered by County Magistrate Gu to establish a national primary school within the temple, serving as its principal and assisting in underground work. At the time, local thugs Wang Fuqing, Wu Tingchun, Zhang Guanrong, Zhao Changlin, and others colluded with enemy puppet secret agents to extort and blackmail, committing all sorts of evil deeds, and were quite incompatible with 性照Xingzhao. In July of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], they reported 性照Xingzhao's various anti-Japanese activities to the enemy special high command, leading to his arrest. He was released on bail thanks to the joint guarantee of various businesses in Xiashi. Wang Fuqing and his gang dared to collude with five or six thugs armed with weapons to surround and capture him at the Mituo Temple. Fortunately, 性照Xingzhao was out and escaped, and he was forced to take refuge at the Guanzong Temple in Ningbo. After the victory, he was ordered by County Magistrate Gu to return to the Mituo Temple. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 PM on that night, the thugs Wang Fuqing, Wang Tingchun, Zhang Guanrong, Zhao Changlin, Yu Furong, Wu Weiqin, Wu Weijun, and others, armed with handguns and sharp knives, swarmed into the temple. 性照Xingzhao was unable to escape and died amidst the chaos of blades. They hid the corpse, intending to cover up the crime. It has been more than half a year, and the county government has detained Wang Fuqing, but the other perpetrators remain at large, and the whereabouts of the corpse are still unknown.

Commentary

### The Path to Resolving Labor-Capital Disputes

— Pan Shihao

There are three elements of production: besides land, labor and capital are considered the main components. At a time when people's livelihoods are declining and construction is just beginning, the continuous unresolved labor-capital disputes are a misfortune for the production sector. These disputes mainly focus on wage issues, and various parties repeatedly encourage mutual understanding and coordination. However, both labor and capital hold firmly to their respective positions. One side claims that prices are soaring and wages are insufficient to cover expenses, while the other side claims that costs are too high and they cannot afford to bear the financial burden. Thus, those who advise continue to advise, and those who argue continue to argue. Therefore, the study of wage standards has indeed become a serious issue at present. Economists have a common saying that economic matters should be resolved with economic policies. The coordination of labor and capital, and the standards for wages, are essential elements of production and distribution theory. We can seek a path to resolve the matter through research.

Wages, also known as labor pay, should be determined by what number? Scholars have different opinions. Summarizing the main points, the following kinds can be obtained:

(1) Production Cost Theory: Proponents of this theory state that labor can increase the value of production by a certain amount, which can be used as the standard for wages. Since the value of production often changes due to market competition, wages must also rise and fall accordingly. In the United States today, both prices and wages are still under government control. Every time wages increase, the production index and product prices also increase accordingly, based on this theory. However, it must be noted that if government control is not strict enough, wages may not increase in equal proportion when profits greatly increase. Conversely, if profits fall, or even result in losses, laborers may not be able to concede accordingly, except by shutting down the business. Therefore, while the theory is beautiful, its practical implementation is quite difficult.

(2) Minimum Living Expenses Theory: There is an old so-called Iron Law of Wages, which states that as the population increases, wages decrease, and the income of laborers must fall to the point where they can barely maintain their minimum living expenses. This theory does not seem to correspond with the facts. According to the statistics of various countries, except for industrial decline and labor surplus, general wages are gradually increasing. However, when workers cannot maintain their minimum living standard, they will inevitably seek other livelihoods and cannot be content with their profession, which is only a matter of reason. Therefore, researchers of social policy often advocate that the government should provide additional relief to prevent them from becoming destitute. This responsibility cannot be borne by the production sector which is already fragmented.

(3) Fund Theory: Scholars have a so-called Wages Fund Theory, which refers to the total amount of labor pay that the production sector can afford to provide in a given society during a given period, which serves as the wage fund for all laborers. This is based on the same principle as the Production Cost Theory. Proponents of this theory often state that laborers who want to increase their wages should first reduce the number of people participating in labor. However, we should know that if there is no progress in labor technology, then the reduction in the number of people will result in a decline in production, and the labor fund will inevitably decrease accordingly. Labor unions may prevent the entry of new workers as a form of self-defense, but the result may not be beneficial.

(4) Marginal Utility Theory: Marginal Utility, states that each unit in the economy should maintain its corresponding differential profit. Therefore, consumers have a surplus (Consumer's Surplus), savers have a surplus (Saver's Surplus), and producers have a surplus (Producer's Surplus). According to this theory, both labor and capital should be able to maintain a corresponding surplus and obtain corresponding protection. However, this can only be said for industries that are running smoothly, and not for those that are losing money and reducing payments. If one wants to adjust this shortcoming, the government should levy heavy taxes on production businesses that have excessive profits, to prepare for relief for other industries or unemployed workers in the future. The government should also take measures to suppress entrepreneurs who are wasteful, to avoid infringing on the marginal benefits of laborers.

(5) Exploitation Theory: This is the so-called exploitation of surplus value of workers by capitalists (Exploitation Theory). Proponents of this theory state that the wages given to labor by capitalists are merely the residual amount after deducting the surplus value from the value of their production, their focus being on the capital side infringing on the labor side's margin. Orthodox economists also do not consider such behavior to be reasonable; researchers of social policy also advocate restricting capital to prevent this exploitation. During the war, the control of prices and wages by various countries aimed to achieve balance, so that both capital and labor could obtain corresponding distribution. Unfortunately, this kind of control method cannot be implemented with ease in countries where statistics are not complete enough and administration lacks efficiency.

(6) Monopoly Theory: The meaning of monopoly is close to monopolization (Monopoltheorie). Labor can also unite to suppress capital to raise wages. This kind of class monopoly will inevitably lead to class struggle. Therefore, there is also the so-called Power Principle. The business is to deal with the other party with force, coordination is not the question, further away from the standard that can be found economically, and it only causes disputes without regard to the development of the production business, which is not a proper method.

The above mentioned theories, except for the latter two, which come from hostile psychology and are not worth discussing, all emphasize the production business's capacity to bear the costs, and the measurement of its burden capacity takes the profit of the product as the object. In other words, the labor to obtain wages is to distribute the production product to the entrepreneur as a production property, and not to accept the entrepreneur's relief funds. This is the self-esteem that the labor side should have, and it is also the spirit of cooperation that the entrepreneur should have. Here we can find the standard of wages. Some say that the labor life should be gradually improved, so that the social livelihood can be stabilized, which is indeed worth admiring. However, at a time when international trade is smooth and world prices are gradually balanced, the price of production products has to be controlled by the market, so the burden of wages has to have a maximum limit. Exceeding this limit will make the market occupied, the industry overturned, and the social livelihood will inevitably suffer. Today's talk about wage standards focuses on pre-war wages, thinking that this is the base salary, which can be adjusted by referring to the cost of living index. I don't know that the current situation of the industry, except for a very few, has fallen many times more than before the war, so this can be used as a social policy, but it cannot be used as an economic production policy. Moreover, in terms of social policy, this responsibility cannot be supported by the fragile production industry alone. Furthermore, all production businesses that cannot afford better wages may be due to poor management policies, or due to poor production equipment, or due to uneconomical use of labor. The manufacturers should be aware of these situations and strive to improve, and not argue about wages in the current situation. As for the preciousness of labor, it is able to increase the value of the production product. If the technology is poor and the efficiency is too low, then the instinct is not exhausted, and it is not possible to simply seek the improvement of life. Therefore, both capital and labor should each rectify and seek progress, then the cooperation in production will be easy, and the dispute in distribution will be eliminated. In the advanced countries' labor management, the selection of employees and the criteria for dispatching matters are not afraid of labor costs, and they try their best to be cautious in advance. After they have been employed, the training of technology, the facilities of health care, and the rewards for excellent workers are not spared to improve them on a daily and monthly basis, so their production index and labor life advance together. Looking back at our country, when hiring, it is often too hasty, or sells favors, or greedy bargains. After taking office, they complain about the employer's lack of preferential treatment. The cooperation between the two sides is too insincere, so the wind blows and the grass moves, and the labor tide rises. I believe that the frequent occurrence of labor-capital disputes, its symptoms may be at this end. If you don't do your best from the root, but only expect the mediation of the authorities, this is truly abandoning the root and pursuing the tip.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Opened Yesterday; Molotov and Bevin Both Arrived; the Success or Failure of the Secret Conference Is of Great Importance

[Our dispatch] London, 25th (Broadcast): The Foreign Ministers' Conference opened in Paris at 4:00 PM today (midnight Shanghai time). Molotov arrived on time, and the agenda has been drafted by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The French diplomatic community is very optimistic about this conference.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th (United Press)]: The four-power foreign ministers held a conference in Paris today to break the stalemate between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain. The four foreign ministers will meet in secret at 4:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) in the Luxembourg Palace, a historical landmark in France, sitting around a table covered with green tablecloth. If the conference is successful, it should be able to draft the basic format of the peace treaty, and the results of the conference can also provide a blueprint for establishing future diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries. As for whether various issues can be fully agreed upon at that time, there is no optimistic hope. Based on the preliminary discussions at the four-power foreign deputies' conference held in London, the opinions among the countries are divided and far apart. These divided opinions may be difficult to compromise on certain issues.

[United Press, Paris, 24th]: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived here by plane from Berlin at 5:26 PM today to attend the Western Foreign Ministers' Conference. Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky accompanied him. US Secretary of State Byrnes had arrived earlier than Molotov.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th]: Foreign Minister Bevin took a "York" transport plane from Northolt Airport at 10:37 AM today and flew to Paris to attend the four-power foreign ministers' conference. Before leaving, he said: He did not know how long he would be abroad. The plane taken by Foreign Minister Bevin this time was the same one he took to attend the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference last year.

[United Press, Paris, 24th]: Today, according to sources close to the four parties, the Trieste dispute has actually reached an agreement, stipulating that the port facing the Adriatic Sea should remain in Italy, and its inland area should be ceded to Yugoslavia. This solution was agreed upon by the investigation team of the four foreign ministers' deputies' conference after conducting an on-site investigation and can be submitted to the four foreign ministers' conference for review.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th]: When the four foreign ministers hold the conference, the Austrian issue may be included in the agenda. The Dardanelles Strait issue, that is, the amendment of the Montreux Convention, or the Mediterranean issue related to the Italian peace treaty, may be discussed together. How to dispose of the Italian colonies will be resolved by the foreign ministers' conference and then submitted to the peace conference for a final decision.

### Plan to Investigate Spain Suddenly Opposed by France and Italy; Amendment Proposed to Limit Investigation Opportunities; Security Council Met Yesterday to Discuss

[United Press, New York, 25th]: Australia's plan for the United Nations to send an investigation team to Spain was suddenly opposed by France today, unexpectedly advocating limiting the opportunity for this investigation. At 3:00 PM today (4:00 AM Friday Shanghai time), the Security Council will reopen the debate on Australia's proposed plan to visit Spain for investigation. For most of the past 24 hours, there has been widespread belief that France is seeking an agreement in advance on the issue of amending Australia's proposal, and it is believed that Australia's proposal guarantees unanimous passage in the Security Council. However, it was revealed this morning that French representative Parodi had held secret talks with most of the representatives yesterday, trying to get all parties to support his proposed amendment. According to the amendment, the investigation team should be stationed in New York and all statements and documents related to the Spanish issue should be reviewed and processed in New York. The response to the French proposal was rapid. The Australian delegation is unwilling to make formal public criticisms, but diplomatic sources revealed that the Australian chief representative will vehemently oppose it. Some Security Council personnel believe that there are two reasons why France wants to keep the investigation team in New York, especially not wanting the team to enter French territory: (1) There are hundreds of thousands of Spanish Republicans in southern France; (2) Fearing that the various left-wing parties in France will exert pressure on the team, making it difficult for the French government.

### More Than 30,000 People Killed by Cars Annually in the United States

[United Press, Washington, 25th]: The United States has the highest number of car accident deaths, with 40,000 people dying in 1941. However, according to the estimates of the US Safety Council, if calculated based on the current car accident death rate, there will be 38,000 deaths under the wheels this year. President Truman has scheduled a national conference in Washington in May to discuss methods to prevent car accidents.

### Soviet Troops in Iranian Azerbaijan are Withdrawing; There are Still Many "Democratic Army" Members; Representatives of Azerbaijan Will Go to Tehran for Negotiations Within Days

[Our dispatch] London, 25th (Broadcast): Azerbaijan has scheduled to send a delegation to Tehran within one to two days to negotiate with the Iranian central government. A spokesman for the Iranian government said: The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Azerbaijan is progressing smoothly and is expected to be completed before May 6.

[Central News Agency, Tehran, 24th (United Press)]: According to British official sources: Soviet troops have all withdrawn from Tabriz, but most of the Soviet civilians have not yet withdrawn, and many soldiers in "Democratic Army" uniforms are walking the streets, all of whom cannot speak the Azerbaijani dialect. British and American officials have confirmed that the Soviet headquarters has been withdrawn, but it is not known whether the Soviet commander himself has withdrawn. Although the Soviet troops have withdrawn, the "Democratic Army" can still be seen in Tabriz and often conducts exercises and bombardments in the nearby mountains. Political figures believe that the withdrawal of Soviet troops cannot be fully completed before May 6, and there are still Soviet troops stationed in other parts of Azerbaijan. The Soviet headquarters has now apparently moved to an area near the Soviet border.

[United Press, Tehran, 25th]: The chieftain of a major Kurdish tribe last night criticized Qazi Muhammad, the leader of the Kurdish Independent Republic, saying that he is "surrounded by Soviet agents and listens only to Soviet orders in every move." The major tribes no longer support this independence movement. According to recent reports, the Soviet troops who withdrew from Miyandoab, an important thoroughfare in Kurdistan, have now returned to their original locations.

### Four-Party Negotiations Fail, Japanese Political Situation Chaotic

[Reconstruction Daily, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] After the collapse of the Shidehara Cabinet, the Japanese political situation remains chaotic today. Liberal Party Secretary-General Kono visited Socialist Party Secretary-General Katayama three times yesterday, but gained nothing due to the Socialist Party's firm stance. This morning, Kono visited Katayama again. As a result of the meeting, it was decided that according to the Socialist Party's new proposal, the issue of the next government will be negotiated jointly by the Liberal, Socialist, Cooperative, and Communist Parties.

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] The Socialist Party convened a joint meeting of representatives from the Liberal, Cooperative, and Communist parties this afternoon to discuss the formation of a cabinet. Although all parties were united in opposing Shidehara (President of the Progressive Party), internal disagreements over who should become prime minister led to no agreement being reached.

### British Dominion Prime Ministers' Conference Seeks Broad Basis for Cooperation; Disagreements on Rebuilding the British Imperial Cabinet

[United Press, London, 24th Dispatch] According to responsible sources tonight, the British Imperial Prime Ministers' Conference has decided that before any Pacific base is ceded to the United States, the defense policy of that area should be discussed with the United States.

[Central News Agency, London, 24th United Press Dispatch] Those who advocate for closer unity within the British Empire today expressed their welcome to the proposal of the New Zealand representative attending the British Dominion Conference. This proposal calls for the re-establishment of a "Imperial Cabinet" of twenty members, which will have the power to discuss British Imperial defense, trade tariffs, and special treatment, and submit its agreed reports to the British and Dominion parliaments. New Zealand and Australia enthusiastically support this proposal, while the support of the Union of South Africa is clearly problematic. South Africa opposes the establishment of such a British United Nations conference, as it may infringe upon its rights vis-à-vis London. The South African Parliament has always had the right to decide on neutrality in future wars. It is believed that the Canadian government largely agrees with South Africa's views. According to some sources, on the issue of control, South African Prime Minister Smuts insists on the principle of "Greater Africanism."

Two of the Soviet aircraft fired shots at the US aircraft, but did not hit it.

### Huge Quantities of Japanese Gold and Silver Ingots Buried at the Bottom of Tokyo Bay; US Military Builds Cofferdam to Begin Excavation

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] Japanese officials buried huge quantities of gold and silver ingots at the bottom of the sea next to a shipyard in Tokyo Bay last July. This treasure has now been discovered. The US Navy used several large pumps this afternoon to drain all the water from the side of the dock. US sailors, under the command of Moore, will begin clearing three to four feet of mud from the bottom of the dock tomorrow in order to excavate the treasure beneath. Divers have already recovered 134 gold and silver ingots during the construction of the cofferdam, about fifty feet from where Lieutenant Nelson recovered the first ingot a month ago. According to reports from Nelson and Japanese divers, two piles of gold and silver ingots were found, each ingot measuring twenty feet in length and width, stacked in the mud like paving stones. However, only one ingot has been recovered, which is said to contain silver. The person who led Nelson to the site was a Japanese informant who claimed that Japanese officials directed workers to throw the gold ingots into the water last July, and that he was one of the workers. Later, when some workers learned that what they had thrown was gold and silver, officials warned them not to reveal the secret, saying that the buried treasure was to be used to "build a great Japan." It is said that the gold ingots are worth about 30 billion Japanese yen, or about 2 billion US dollars. However, according to the information obtained by the US side, there is not that much. No fewer than several thousand gold ingots were thrown into the dock, carried on two trucks, but divers report that the ingots are scattered over a wide area, so it is speculated that even more ingots were thrown into the water, unseen by the informant.

### From the Old World to the New World: Miscellaneous Writings En Route Across the Atlantic

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing

The three thousand two hundred miles of sea journey across the Atlantic Ocean divides the Western world into two very different parts. After six years of arduous war, many are lamenting the "decline of Europe," and many young Europeans are looking forward to the other side of the ocean, where there is freedom, hope, and, most importantly, the material enjoyment that Westerners value most. When the William Mary Victory troopship I was on sailed out of the port of Le Havre, France, American veterans cheered, while young French boys and girls gazed at the last piece of land of the Old World, staring, silent, and finally smiling.

Many far-sighted international observers are worried about the future of France. On the ship, an American sergeant named Henry said very frankly: "Although I have never been to China, I know the situation in China is as chaotic as in France. However, I have never met a Chinese person who is not confident about China's future, and I have never met a Chinese person who is not proud to be Chinese. The French are not like that." I found proof of Henry's words the next day, and that was the young Frenchman, John Borah, who was traveling on the same ship as me and sleeping next to me.

John was a corporal in the French army, but "the life of a French soldier is worse than that of a rich man's dog." Therefore, after three years, John not only did not want to re-enlist, but he decided to leave France: "I can be a citizen of any country, why must I rely on France?" He also said: "If I cannot obtain American citizenship, I am determined to go to Australia. The Australian government has already requested two and a half million immigrants from Western European countries. I can speak English, so of course there is no problem!"

The American army distributed surplus military supplies on the ship. Like many other civilian passengers, John had more than a dozen chocolate bars, two cans of American peanuts, and two packs of cigarettes. He jumped up with excitement. In the evening, he put the peanuts next to his pillow, determined to eat them until he fell asleep. In the morning, as soon as he opened his eyes, he started eating peanuts again. He told me: "That's why I'm determined to leave France." I smiled and nodded.

France's poverty is now not only a problem for France itself, but also a very serious part of the European political problem. In last winter's provisional parliamentary elections, the Communist Party won the most votes. A reporter from the Paris Soir told me: "The reason why the Communist Party won the most votes is because women all voted for it." It is said that the French Communist Party's propaganda to women has been quite successful. They told the ladies and misses of Paris: Aren't you worried about not having meat, bread, silk stockings, or clothing? Elect the Communist Party, and the Communist Party will solve your difficulties! The reporter from the Paris Soir said: "This June, there will be elections for formal parliamentarians." He predicted that the Communist Party would definitely not win again.

Because my last trip to Paris was too rushed, I did not spend much effort studying the future elections in France. However, from any point of view, the current serious economic problems in France are enough to affect the entire European political situation. The US-France major loan has not yet been successful, and Leon Blum, the "founding father" of the Socialist Party, actually ran to Washington with his old life. If the loan is successful, the Gouin cabinet can continue, and the Socialist Party may still be able to be on good terms with everyone in the next election. If the loan fails, perhaps the situation in France will change drastically. However, according to insiders, the United States also needs a period of "wait-and-see," to observe what kind of evolution France itself will have in the future.

Because there is such a discrepancy, both sides of the New and Old Worlds are scattered with various terrible resentments. Moscow announced last month that it would supply France with 500,000 tons of wheat. The Communist Minister of Transportation exaggeratedly dispatched France's only two transport ships to the Black Sea to load the wheat. A small newspaper in Paris wrote humorously: "Is the price of each grain of wheat equivalent to a vote?" The French laughed when they saw it.

I asked many of the French civilian passengers on the ship. A banker stroked his beard and said, "The Communist Party will never win again. General de Gaulle will rise again sooner or later!" Another young Frenchman disagreed with these words. He said: "De Gaulle won't do, Gouin is an idiot, and Leon Blum himself is a big capitalist. His house is full of gold bars." I asked him if he had seen it with his own eyes? He stuck out his tongue, and after a long silence, said: "I heard others say it!"

France is truly a "naive" nation beyond belief. In French history, there has never been a national saint or hero. Many French people may admire Napoleon, but Napoleon was once rejected by the international community. In the era of Clemenceau, France once dominated the world, but the French said that if there had been no Clemenceau, there would have been no disaster in 1940. Many bronze statues in Paris, France, are of writers, poets, and musical masters. French stamps and banknotes are printed with French beauties. "A king will rise every five hundred years," but in French history, there has never been a "king."

The lack of a "king" in democratic politics has created a chaotic political situation in France. From World War I to World War II, the changes in the French cabinet were rare in any democratic country. De Gaulle wanted to change from the previous cabinet system to a presidential system, and a fairly centralized presidential system, but was ousted from power by the provisional parliament. The day after the Gouin cabinet came to power, prices rose three to four times. The black market US dollar in Paris jumped from 200 francs to one to 400 to one. The Gouin cabinet's first shot was to tighten finances. Almost half of the government personnel were laid off. Those who were laid off became unemployed, and those who were not laid off became impoverished. Prices rose, but the salaries of civil servants did not rise, which was reflected in society as laxity, disorder, and low administrative efficiency and work efficiency. The day I left Le Havre, I went to a passport office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply for an exit visa. The civil servant picked up the seal and stamped it without asking any questions. After stamping it, he chatted with me, put the seal into his large briefcase, and asked me:

"Is this your first time in the port? Have you visited the city here?"

I shook my head.

He said that he was willing to take me on a tour of the streets. When I followed him out of the office, there was still an hour and a half before closing time. I was worried about those who came after me: if another person came to apply for an exit visa, what would they do?

On the way, he told me that he was the head of a family of five, and that his salary was not enough to make ends meet. It was not easy to find a side job in Le Havre. I asked him if there were any French merchant ships in the port. He smiled bitterly: "There's nothing left, it's all American!"

In fact, there are not many American ships in the Atlantic Ocean, and even fewer American merchant ships. The William Mary Victory I was on was a maritime transport ship built during the war as part of President Roosevelt's "Two-Ocean Naval Expansion Plan." I asked the person in charge of the ship if it could be converted into a merchant ship in the future. He said: The United States has no intention of developing maritime transport business in the Atlantic Ocean.

The Atlantic shipping industry is still in the hands of the British. The British Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, at over 60,000 tons, are still the "titans" of merchant shipping worldwide. Each trip from Southampton, England, to New York, or from New York to England, carries nearly ten thousand passengers, and even more troops. The ships have ballrooms, theaters, and swimming pools. Because the ships are large, one does not feel the pain of boredom at sea. It is said that the British shipping industry was very sad about the Queen Mary transporting American troops. The reason is: American soldiers often used knives to cut the tables or bulkheads, and picked up a small piece to take back to the United States as a souvenir. They believe that being able to ride the Queen Mary once in a lifetime is something to remember for the rest of one's life. This time, the personnel of the London embassy who were participating in the United Nations agencies all went to the United States on the Queen Mary. Mr. Bao Huaguo also took this ship from England to New York.

Secondly, Norway's maritime business is trying to catch up and recover. Shortly after Germany surrendered, several Norwegian merchant ships revived shipping between the United States and Europe. Recently, Norway is negotiating a loan from the United States to purchase ships and build merchant ships in the United States with all the loan money. In Paris, I met the former consul in Paris, who said: Soon, Norway will have ships sailing to the Far East.

Shipping competition is the prelude to trade competition. In the United Kingdom, slogans of "Tighten your belts, increase production, and develop foreign trade" are posted everywhere. Movies and radio broadcasts are all promoting "foreign trade." Most educated Britons understand that Britain is a country that started by relying on international trade. They would rather tighten their belts and save money to sell overseas. In fact, Britons now wear the coarsest woolen fabrics (no better than our Northwest woolen fabrics) and enjoy the simplest industrial products. Britons cannot eat eggs and enough butter, and even a vegetable or a rib is a delicacy on the menu in Britain. Some time ago, British newspapers unanimously attacked the Labour cabinet's food minister. Picketing several cinemas, they showed the food minister's photo, with various derogatory and "sarcastic" words next to it. At the same time, they also showed dozens of housewives complaining about not being able to buy oil, sugar, bread, vegetables, eggs, etc. Several newspapers pointed out that the lack of food in Britain was due to Britain's excessive supply to the German occupied territories. They questioned the government: "Why should we help our enemies and let ourselves go hungry?" As a result, Prime Minister Attlee met with Field Marshal Montgomery.

Explaining the truth of the facts. I also heard many "street speakers" in London's Hyde Park attacking the Labour government for the food panic.

The same is true of democratic countries, France and Britain are different, and the people of Britain and the United States are different. When the ship entered the port of New York after a monotonous ten-day journey, the American officers and soldiers on board all shouted and jumped. A small Red Cross tugboat filled with American flags sailed outside the port to welcome them. The small tugboat was full of American women, who waved to welcome their strong men back in triumph.

The Statue of Liberty still stands on the shores of New York. The "skyscrapers" of more than a hundred stories, whose roofs were once damaged by aircraft, have now been rebuilt with golden splendor. At the mouth of the Hudson River, large and small ships are like dense swarms of bees. The recently built USS Midway aircraft carrier, a 45,000-ton sea fortress, is also docked in the port.

Neon lights illuminate every street in New York. Thousands of vehicles and pedestrians cross Times Square. This "kingdom of gold" has not declined in the slightest after four years of war, but has become even more prosperous and flourishing than before. The wheels of the times have rolled over the Old World, creating a pinnacle for this young country in the New World. (Sent from New York on March 31st)

### The Supreme Procuratorate Concludes Investigation: Another Batch of Traitors Indicted; Chuan Shishuo to be Publicly Tried Today; Former Minister Yu Shaoying Sentenced to Fifteen Years

[Report from our newspaper] The Supreme Procuratorate concluded its investigation, and another batch of suspected traitors were indicted. These include Liu Yangshan, Xu Weizhen, Tang Liang, Ye Xuesong, Xu Xiqing, Chen Shaowei, Fei Gongxia, Sun Yunzhang, Shi Zhiming, Chang Dongming, Shi Jiangshi, and others, totaling eleven cases. Additionally, the suspected traitor case of Sha Yuanji and the internal disorder case of Wang Meimei were not prosecuted.

Yesterday, those whose investigations were prosecuted by the office included Wang Manyun, Sun Mingdong, Wu Binglin, Ling Jiacheng, Xue Qishou, Zhang Yipu, Gui Zhihai, Shang A'er, and others whose names I have.

[Report from our newspaper] Following the transfer of the major traitor Mai Jingming by military authorities, Chuan Shishuo will also be publicly tried at the Tilanqiao High Court at 2:30 PM today. Chuan once held positions such as a puppet minister and provincial governor, and was also one of the key figures in the puppet government at the time.

[Report from our newspaper] The father and son Yu Shaoying (puppet Ministry of Finance Treasury Director, puppet Central Reserve Bank Treasury Bureau Director, and supervisor of the bank) and Yu Zifan (puppet Central Reserve Bank Deposit Section Chief, and director of the bank's Wuhu office) were sentenced yesterday in their case of collaborating with the enemy. The main text: Yu Shaoying colluded with the enemy and plotted to rebel against his own country, sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for ten years. Yu Zifan colluded with the enemy and disrupted the financial system, sentenced to six years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for six years. All of the defendants' property, except for what is deemed necessary living expenses for the family, will be confiscated.

### Indictment of Chuan Shishuo

The indictment of Chuan Jinshuo by the Supreme Procuratorate is as follows:

"Defendant Chuan Shishuo, male, age 56, native of Wenzhou. Formerly puppet Minister of Construction, residing at 41 Avenue Albert, currently in custody.

The aforementioned defendant, in connection with a suspected traitor case (Case No. 173 on Investigation, year 35), has been investigated by this prosecutor, who believes that a public prosecution should be initiated. The facts of the crime, evidence, and applicable laws are listed as follows:

Chuan Shishuo previously served in the education sector. In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], when the traitor Wang Jingwei came to the occupied territories to establish a puppet organization, Chuan Shishuo, as a former classmate of Zhou Fo-hai in Japan and a fellow townsman of Mei Siping, colluded with the puppet regime. In March of the following year, when the traitor Wang called for the 'National Government to return to the capital,' Chuan took the position of puppet Minister of Railways. In November of that year, he went to Japan to inspect railways for the purpose of collusion. On September 10th of the 30th year [1941], he was reassigned as the chairman (later renamed governor) of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, concurrently serving as the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Security Commander, handling the 'cleansing' of the province, training county assistants, expanding the puppet security forces, cultivating power, and contributing funds to the puppet government in response to the Greater East Asia War promoted by the enemy and puppets. In October of the 33rd year [1944], he was transferred to be the puppet Minister of Construction, until the victory of the War of Resistance. He has now been transferred to this office for investigation by the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission.

The defendant has already confessed to the aforementioned facts in detail during the investigation, which is consistent with his statements at the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, and is supported by his handwritten confession. The facts of the crime are extremely clear. The defendant successively held key positions in the puppet central government and as head of the provincial government for more than five years. During his tenure as puppet Minister of Railways, he went to Japan to collude with the enemy under the guise of inspecting railways. During his tenure as the chairman and concurrent security commander of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, he expanded the puppet security forces, handled the 'cleansing,' trained county assistants, and contributed funds, all of which were measures to resist the activities of our country's guerrilla forces and implement the puppet government's decrees. Furthermore, the Ministry of Construction, where he served, was responsible for important matters such as transportation and water conservancy. Therefore, it is undeniable that he colluded with the enemy and plotted to rebel against his own country. The defendant, as a highly educated person, did not think of serving the country during a time of national crisis, but willingly colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country, a crime unforgivable. He should be deemed to have violated Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Procedure Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, we hereby initiate a public prosecution and request that you immediately render a judgment in accordance with the law. Respectfully submitted to the Criminal Division of this court. Dai Rongduo, Prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court, April 13, 35th year of the Republic of China [1946]."

### Slight Changes to the Election Procedures for City Councilors in Each District; Polling Places in Each District Should Be Increased Appropriately; Voting Time Extended to 10 PM

[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau has announced that the election of city councilors in each district of this city is scheduled to be held on April 28th. To facilitate the election process, there have been slight changes to the original arrangements: (1) The number of police personnel for the election in each district will be determined by the city government based on the size and actual needs of each district, with one to three officers dispatched to patrol and monitor. (2) The voting time was originally set for the 28th, from 6 AM to 6 PM on the same day. It has now been decided that if the time is insufficient, it can be extended to 10 PM on the same day. (3) If the number of polling places in each district is insufficient, one to two additional polling places may be added. (4) During voting hours, workers in each factory who cannot go to work due to participating in voting should still be paid their wages. The municipal government has instructed each factory to take note of this point.

### Pan Gongzhan Elaborates on Political Views at 20th District Campaign Speech

The 20th District (Yangshupu) District Office of this city convened a public speech meeting for the candidates for city councilor in the district at 2:30 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Longchang Road Industrial Technical School. In addition to all of the Baojia leaders of the district, there were also over one thousand citizens who freely attended to listen, filling the seats. District Chief Ji Xia presided over the meeting and introduced the four candidates participating in the election: Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Lizu, Chen Zhijing, and Shi Chengfu. Pan had to leave early due to other matters, so he gave his speech first, lasting thirty minutes. He extolled local autonomy as the foundation for national construction, and that citizens should value the election of city councilors and be cautious in their decision-making. He also said that democracy grows gradually and cannot be achieved overnight, so as long as the people seriously exercise their political rights, democracy will surely be realized. Next, he stated that he believed that the three most important things that Shanghai should pay attention to at present are: (1) How to enable all citizens of the city to enjoy a life of peace and prosperity in a peaceful and stable environment. This not only requires the police to improve daily, but also requires citizens to build a sound Baojia organization and develop the ability to self-govern and self-defend. (2) How to mobilize the power of the whole city to eliminate illiteracy in the shortest possible time. Only with universal education can democratic politics have a sound foundation. Yangshupu is an industrial area, and the general workers and their children are deeply affected by the hardship of being uneducated due to the struggle for livelihood. Labor education and labor hygiene should be promoted with all our efforts, and the government should be assisted and urged to gradually implement them so that they can be promoted and effective. (3) How to make all citizens of the city commonly recognize the crisis that Chinese industry is currently encountering, and to sincerely promote labor-management coordination, so that this post-war city can not only restore its industrial and commercial status as the first port in China, but also make industrial products able to compete with foreign goods in the market. Therefore, the people should cooperate with the government and implement policies one by one in accordance with policies in order to take measures involving stabilizing prices and settling labor disputes, etc., to create a smooth environment for industrial production. We must know that only when industry is prosperous can commerce be developed, and all municipal administration will have the hope of rapid progress. Finally, Pan said that city councilors are representatives of the citizens, and no matter who is elected, they should be close to the citizens at any time and place, listen to the opinions of the citizens, carefully consider and integrate them, and contribute to the government, so that they can be said to be fulfilling their duties.

### Movie Industry Treats Reporters, Reports Difficulty in Assigning Seats, Says All Movie Theaters May Close If Police Bureau Does Not Rescind Order

[This Newspaper's News] The Movie Industry Association of this city, regarding the City Police Bureau's order to close eight movie theaters, specifically treated reporters at the Kangle Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to report on the process. Chairman Liang Qitian presided over the meeting, and Standing Director Kuang Baoying reported and explained the difficulties of assigning seats; stating that in fact, implementing assigned seats would be very costly, and indeed not something that general movie theaters could afford. Implementing assigned seating requires hiring double the staff; a thousand seats would require at least fifteen ushers; each person's monthly salary would also need to be at least 130,000 to 140,000. At the same time, if tickets are printed with numbers and cannot be sold completely, there would be extreme waste every day; the cost of each ticket needs to be ten yuan, and the cost of several showings a day can be known. If seats are not assigned, tickets can be used continuously. In addition, armed people can enter the theater and arbitrarily choose seats; if seats are assigned, disputes will inevitably arise.

Mr. Liang continued to state several difficulties, saying that current ticket prices have already risen repeatedly; if the theater's expenses are not enough, it will inevitably increase prices again, which will not only increase the burden on the audience, but also affect the theater's business. After seats are assigned, audiences will inevitably arrive late; after the lights are turned off in the theater, people will continue to arrive one after another, inevitably obstructing the view of other viewers, and order may not be improved.

Li Di Yun, the Standing Director of the Association and manager of the Dahua Theater, said: the Police Bureau's orders have been obeyed repeatedly, and there has been no contempt; children under the age of twelve are not allowed to enter, and this has already been obeyed. It is generally considered that the order in public places in this city is best in movie theaters, and it is hoped that the authorities can help improve problems such as black market tickets outside the theater, as well as stalls and traffic. If the Police Bureau cannot rescind its order, all movie theaters may close, so it is hoped that all circles will uphold justice.

### Tianyun Tower Employees Petition

[This Newspaper's News] Tianyun Tower of this city's Wing On Company has recently been operating poorly and losing a great deal of money, and has been forced to close down. As a result, more than 1,000 male and female employees have lost their jobs at the same time. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, they lined up and went to the Municipal Government to petition. Shi Bangrui, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, received them on behalf of the mayor and relayed to the representatives that the matter has been handled by the Social Bureau. All employees of the city's agricultural market also petitioned the Municipal Government yesterday.

### Sympathy Suicide: Woman Violently Stabbed, Man Fails to Kill Himself

[This Newspaper's News] The case of the woman surnamed Jin from Dinghai, Beijing West Road, Lane 1110, No. 17, being violently stabbed to death by her lover, Wu Shuying, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to the investigation, Wu comes from a scholarly family in Dinghai and graduated from St. John's University, but has no permanent property, so he has not yet married Jin. However, Wu and Jin have known each other for many years and their love is very deep. They finally felt that they would regret it for the rest of their lives, so they agreed to commit suicide together. The woman asked Wu to stab her to death with a knife first, and then commit suicide himself. Unexpectedly, when Wu raised the knife to stab, the woman cried out in extreme pain at the first stab, and said to Wu, "Kill me quickly, kill me quickly." So Wu stabbed her five times in the abdomen, neck, throat, and arms, etc., blood splattered everywhere, and she collapsed. Later, family members heard the sound and arrived, and Wu did not have time to commit suicide. The police rushed to the scene and took the suspect to the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau for detention. The injured woman was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but to no avail, and she died shortly afterwards. According to Wu Shuying's confession, he admitted the crime and will be submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution according to law within one or two days after the investigation is completed.

### Shanghai-Minhang Bus Robbed, Carrier Dies From Bullet, Three of Five Thieves Captured, Part of Stolen Goods Recovered

[This Newspaper's News] The Shanghai-Minhang bus of the Shanghai-Caohe Automobile Company is scheduled to depart from the East Xinqiao Station on Aiduya Road at 7:30 AM. Yesterday morning, it departed on time, driven by driver Wu Wenqi in truck No. 35848, heading towards its destination. At about 8:20, it was driving to the No. 2 bridge on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, when five thieves suddenly appeared in the carriage, including two in suits, two in long gowns, and one in short clothes, with four guns. One thief pulled out a gun to threaten Wu, ordering him to drive slowly, and the remaining thieves searched the passengers one by one. After traveling about a mile and a half, all twenty or so male and female passengers were left empty-handed, losing two gold rings, one gold watch, and more than one million in legal tender. The five thieves got off the bus and fled not far away. A passerby reported the incident to the Changqiao Outpost. An inspector led the police to pursue the robbers, who became anxious and came up with a clever plan. First, two thieves stopped the private cars of vendors Zhang Guan Gen and Zhang Youliang and sped away. Not long after, a carrier, Jin Miaogen (a local resident, 27 years old), arrived pushing a cart with 1.2 dou of rice. One thief also tried to rob his private car but failed, angering the thief, who pulled out a gun and fired a shot, hitting Jin in the back of the head, killing him instantly. The entire car was eventually robbed. Two remaining thieves, one escaped to Caohejing, where he was captured by the security team, and one fled to Shiyewan, where police officer Chen Shixiong arrived on patrol and gave chase. A scuffle ensued, and several shots were fired. Traffic police officer Lu Zhixiang bravely rushed forward and tackled the thief, and the thief was captured. When taken to the Sanhua Sub-bureau for interrogation, part of the stolen goods was found on his person. Afterwards, security teams from Caohejing, Longhua, and Meijialong and other places searched for the remaining thieves. As of dusk, they were still searching. It is reported that the deceased Jin Miaogen lived at No. 4 Wujia Lane and left behind a wife and a daughter.

### Major Petition by Provincial Civil Servants in Guangdong; Major and Minor Students in Guangzhou Suspend Classes for One Hour

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng Dispatched from Guangzhou via Airmail on the 19th of This Month from This Newspaper

As if a contagious cold, the recent strikes and class suspension trends in Guangzhou have been widely discussed. Petitions and euphemistically named "awaiting orders" incidents have occurred one after another, the most sensational being the major petition by civil servants. Particularly serious is the "requesting leave and awaiting orders" by the Guangzhou Provincial Women's Normal School and four other provincial schools in support.

It is inherently difficult to unite civil servants in an organized manner. However, in Guangdong, the source of the revolution, this unprecedented initiative has emerged nationwide.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, civil servants undoubtedly made significant contributions to the nation. Despite displacement and meager treatment, they endured hardships silently. However, after the victory, due to price fluctuations, they deeply felt that life had become even more difficult than before. Although the government repeatedly increased salaries and bonuses, they still couldn't keep up with the rapid rise in prices. Furthermore, the auditing office here has been strictly implementing the "Qualification Examination Connection Method" and the "Civil Servant Salary Restriction Method" since November of last year, without considering the actual local conditions. This resulted in a large portion of civil servants' salaries being deducted, exacerbating their suffering. Therefore, civil servants from the ten major provincial government departments, including civil affairs, finance, construction, and education, felt a need to take urgent action for self-preservation and initiated the establishment of the "Guangdong Provincial Civil Servants Welfare Advancement Association."

This is a purely civil servant organization. In early April, each agency sent a representative to prepare for its establishment. The work progressed rapidly, maturing by the 10th. On the 11th, they invited journalists to report on the principles and aims of the association. On the one hand, they planned to establish an employee consumer cooperative to assist the government in stabilizing prices and improving the welfare of civil servants in general. On the other hand, they openly attacked the auditing office, foreshadowing the questioning of the auditing office the next day.

Requests Explanation of Reasons

And Passes Twelve Proposals

At 2:00 PM on the 12th, the congress formally established at the Chung Cheng Middle School auditorium. Over 1,500 civil servants participated. They immediately passed a motion to send two representatives to invite Director Li Yueyi of the auditing office to attend the meeting to explain the reasons for deducting civil servants' salaries. They also passed twelve proposals: (1) Establish the Provincial Civil Servants Welfare Advancement Association, including employee and family consumer cooperatives, social clubs, and libraries. The expenses, in addition to requesting the provincial government to allocate welfare funds, will be raised by the members. (2) Establish provincial-level civil servants' children's schools and reserve places in various public schools. (3) Request the provincial government to issue two sets of civil servant uniforms per person. (4) Request the provincial government to approve a loan of 100,000 yuan per person, to be repaid in five monthly installments. (5) Request the provincial government to forward to the Executive Yuan the handling of relief funds for civil servants returning to the capital, and to pursue the allocation of these funds. (6) Request the provincial government to request the relief sub-bureau to issue relief goods. (7) Request the provincial government to quickly negotiate with the Enemy Property Administration Bureau to allocate enemy and puppet properties as employee dormitories. (8) Request the provincial government to allocate rice and cloth at parity prices to reduce the burden on civil servants. (9) Petition the central government to postpone the implementation of strict civil servant qualification regulations in this province until next year. (10) Request the provincial government to pay civil servant salaries according to the salary scales of the Central Trust Bureau and various banks. (11) Request the provincial government to issue salaries on schedule, twice a month, on the 1st and 16th. (12) The auditing office should be held responsible for compensating the losses of provincial civil servants whose salaries are reduced.

Staff Flee, Leaving the Place Empty

Mistakenly Beat a Reporter

After two hours of discussion, the proposals were passed. However, Director Li was still nowhere to be seen. Public sentiment was filled with resentment, and they decided to march as a group to the auditing office to question Director Li. Listing eight reasons, over a thousand male and female civil servants formed a long line, holding large banners and two flags with the words "Questioning the Auditing Office," and set off mightily. Upon arriving at the auditing office, the procession stopped in front of the gate and sent representatives to the second floor to request an audience with Director Li. Reporters also entered to cover the event. The staff there stated that Director Li was out and that the secretary of the office would receive them. The representatives felt that the secretary could not represent the auditing office's views and reported this to the crowd. Upon hearing this, the crowd became agitated, shouting slogans and causing a commotion. Some civil servants, in their anger, rushed into the office, only to find it empty, with only one or two servants on guard. This further fueled the situation, and they destroyed the office equipment beyond recognition. The leaders were unable to stop them. Ironically, a reporter from a news agency was mistaken for an office employee and beaten up. After the truth was revealed, the representatives apologized to him. At the same time, the guards of the finance department stationed nearby mistakenly thought an accident had occurred and set up a machine gun inside the iron gate, aiming it at the crowd as a precaution. Later, the group, finding no progress, reassembled and went to the military headquarters and the provincial government to petition Director Zhang and Chairman Luo. The chief of staff of the military headquarters, Gan, received the presidium, expressed sympathy for the difficulties faced by civil servants today, and promised to forward the difficulties to the central government. The representatives also relayed the petitioning process to all the civil servants standing at the entrance. The civil servants' half-day of labor and appeals finally received a satisfactory response, and the meeting was adjourned.

Director Issues Written Statement

Considers This Action a Regret

However, the auditing office, after the fact, not only requested the military police to send a team to protect it but also notified the local court prosecutor's office to send personnel to investigate the incident. It also invited Liu Houwu, the supervisory commissioner of Liangguang, to visit the office for inspection and to investigate who should be held responsible. Director Li also issued a written statement, stating that civil servants carrying machine guns and firearms formed a group and, without explanation, rushed into the office, destroying all the office equipment. Now, the office is unable to perform its duties, and he believes that this incident occurring during the victory of the War of Resistance and the establishment of the rule of law is deeply regrettable. Afterwards, the office suspended operations on the 13th and published an urgent notice in various newspapers, issuing a written statement, extensively discussing auditing regulations, stating that they could not help civil servants, and reported to the central government to handle the matter according to law.

Civil Servants Submit Defense

Claiming This Was a Legitimate Action

Upon seeing Director Li's written statement, the Civil Servants Welfare Association also issued a written defense, refuting Director Li's statement, claiming that this was a legitimate action. Civil servants were not rioters and did not carry machine guns or firearms. Only the guards at the entrance of the auditing office carried guns. As for the damage to the doors, windows, tables, and chairs on the ground floor of the auditing office, it was caused by the finance department's guards setting up machine guns, aiming directly at the civil servants, causing sudden panic among the civil servants, who dispersed into various streets. A portion of them hurriedly entered the auditing office. Although representatives of the association tried to calm them down, they could not stop them. In addition, they continuously visited Director Zhang of the military headquarters, Commissioner Liu, and Chairman Luo of the provincial government, and Minister of Auditing Lin Yun-gai (who returned to Chongqing on the 18th) to report and explain the establishment, purpose, and questioning of Li and to express sympathy and concern from the officials and to find a reasonable solution to the withholding of civil servant salaries.

Scholars Engage in a "Rebellion"

Quietly Awaiting a Reasonable Solution from the Central Government

As for what happened after this incident, in order to prevent the dispute from escalating, the authorities, under the mediation of Commissioner Liu and personnel dispatched by the military headquarters, conducted conciliation. Chairman Luo also expressed his views: (1) Investigate the facts and handle them impartially. (2) Compensate for the losses. (3) Absolutely guarantee the safety of auditing personnel. He also stated that the provincial government would seek a reasonable solution to the issue of civil servant salaries.

Therefore, both parties complied with the orders of their superiors, awaiting mediation. The auditing office also resumed operations on the 15th.

Since the opening of this scene of an all-out martial arts performance on the 12th, followed by a tit-for-tat battle of the pens, the newspapers have become battlefields, extremely lively. Now, everything has come to an end. The civil servants stated that if salaries could not be improved in the short term, they would petition again until a reasonable solution was reached, and welfare efforts would continue to be prepared. The auditing office stated that the dispute was awaiting resolution by the central government. The result was that the people were given a good show, and everyone said: "Even scholars are rebelling!"

Because the petition by civil servants was relatively novel, everyone's attention was focused there, and even the increasingly fierce trend of "requesting leave and awaiting orders" was overlooked. After the climax of the major petition by civil servants subsided, everyone's attention shifted back to this.

Zhongda Initiates a Trend

Various Schools Follow Suit with Requesting Leave and Awaiting Orders

The "requesting leave and awaiting orders," a disguised form of strike, was initiated by Zhongshan University. Because the price of rice in Guangzhou has been expensive for the past three months, and the meager loans were insufficient to maintain their livelihood, they implemented requesting leave and awaiting orders in order to obtain improvements, leading to widespread emulation.

The price of rice in Guangzhou has risen to 46,000 yuan per dan this month. The publicly funded students of the provincial normal schools and vocational schools only receive 4,000 yuan per month, which is not enough to cover their monthly food expenses. Although the principals of various schools had previously requested the education department to forward a request to the Ministry of Education for an increase, the education department agreed to forward the request to the Ministry of Education to increase it to 8,000 yuan. However, the exchange of official documents was time-consuming, and funds could not be received immediately. The students also waited quietly for the Ministry of Education's approval. However, on the 11th, Yao Baoyou, the director of the education department, went to the Provincial Women's Normal School to give a speech. All 600 students of the school jointly presented Director Yao with a request to increase the publicly funded amount to 15,000 yuan per month per student; otherwise, they would immediately "request leave and await orders." Director Yao stated that this matter required approval from the Ministry of Education but could only be increased to 8,000 yuan, and he advised the students to wait patiently. The students were not satisfied with Director Yao's reply and immediately suspended classes and held a general assembly to establish the Women's Normal School Students' Livelihood Improvement Request Committee, resolving to request the education department for: (1) improving their livelihood, (2) allowing them to postpone their service, (3) strengthening the school's sanitation facilities, (4) guaranteeing employment, and (5) improving the curriculum. Director Yao replied to each request and expressed sympathy, promising to help, and issued a notice stating that this matter could not be approved in one or two days and that the Ministry of Education had already approved an increase to 8,000 yuan, a portion of which had already been remitted, and that 8,000 yuan would be retroactively paid for February and March after being approved by the auditing office, advising the students to prioritize their studies and resume classes first. The students insisted that the matter would not be resolved, and they would still request leave and await orders, and on the 12th, they issued a notice to the public, calling for support and sending personnel to contact various relevant units and preparing to unite all publicly funded students in the city to jointly request improved treatment in order to maintain their studies.

Hold a Joint Petition

Hold a Meeting to Determine the Conditions for the Petition

Perhaps their living conditions were truly dire, and a single call received an enthusiastic response. The cultural community in the city also expressed sympathy, and the various normal schools, feeling a similar plight, expressed their determination to provide support. First, the Provincial Xiangqin Normal School provided assistance. Then, the Provincial Liberal Arts and Sciences, Law and Business Colleges, and the Guangzhou Vocational School, also deeply affected by the same suffering, the Liberal Arts and Sciences College immediately implemented "requesting leave and awaiting orders" to support the Women's Normal School and formed a joint association of five schools to jointly petition the authorities.

On the morning of the 16th, students from middle and upper schools throughout the city also suspended classes for one hour in support of the Women's Normal School.

On the 17th, the joint association of five schools held a meeting and decided to send representatives to petition Chairman Luo, with the petition content being: (1) Improve their livelihood, requesting that the actual amount of public funds issued be comparable to 2.3 dou of public grain, plus one-quarter of the basic living subsidy for provincial civil servants, and that it be issued monthly before the 5th. (2) Issue demobilization fees. (3) Improve the treatment of teachers and staff. (4) Guarantee employment for normal school students and vocational students. (5) Increase internship fees. (6) Increase sanitation facilities. If a satisfactory answer is not received, they will continue to request leave. In the afternoon of the same day, a reception was held for the cultural and news media. At the meeting, representatives of various schools issued heartfelt calls, describing their current dire living conditions and infinite hardships. Two schools have been forced to "request leave and await orders!" Their main problems are still the extreme hardship of living and the lack of guaranteed prospects. They said that some loans are always accumulated, and some could receive 2.3 dou of public grain per person during the war, but now the public grain has stopped, and they only receive 1,500 yuan per month in lieu of it. Although it has been increased to 4,000 yuan since January, they are still receiving 1,500 yuan, which is not enough to even eat congee. The school's living conditions, dormitories are not enough to allocate, some don't even have a bed, the lights don't work, the tap water doesn't work, the sanitation facilities are too poor... a series of hardships, how can one not shed tears of sympathy?

Director Issues Earnest Talk

Students Should Prioritize Their Studies

The local education authorities also tirelessly persuaded the normal school students to resume classes. Director Yao also issued a statement, answering their various requests one by one and seeking a reasonable solution, and sincerely guided the students to love themselves, love their country, and prioritize their studies.

Therefore, the Guangzhou Women's Normal School students, who had insisted on "requesting leave and awaiting orders" for seven days, resumed classes yesterday, the 18th, and will continue to make requests until a satisfactory result is obtained.

Professors Write a Letter to Fellow Students

The Words Are Earnest, Each Word a Tear

The Women's Normal School has resumed classes, but the Liberal Arts and Sciences College is still "requesting leave." In addition to requesting improved living conditions, they are also requesting to be reorganized into a university. Although the school officials have painstakingly advised them, it has had no results. Yesterday (the 18th), all 57 professors of the college jointly wrote a letter to fellow students, advising them to resume classes through proper channels, stating: "Requesting improved treatment and increased public loan amounts is inherently reasonable, but solving problems must follow proper channels. We, as colleagues, are heavily burdened and poorly paid, suffering from hunger and cold, which has long been known to the public, but we still teach tirelessly, not "requesting leave and awaiting orders," because we believe that academic culture is an essential element of social progress and that education is the lifeline of the nation, which cannot be interrupted for a moment. Furthermore, we cannot bear to let our beloved students, who are as close as family, fall into the plight of having no classes to attend, no way to study, and wasting their time. Now, requesting increased loans and proceeding with "university reorganization" have been put forward using the method of striking, without considering the sacrifices and impacts. We are deeply saddened. Finally, we encourage the students to prioritize their studies and cherish their time." The words are earnest, each word a tear.

As of now, the students of the Liberal Arts and Sciences College are still "requesting leave and awaiting orders," and two "hand grenades" were found at the entrance of the college president's office and the director of student affairs' office, wrapped in paper with the words "Danger" written on them in large characters. The reason why students have such weapons is naturally something to ponder. After this incident, the professors and people from the society heard about it, and all expressed indignation. As for how this matter will develop and whether the students of the college will continue to insist on striking, it is still unknown. But looking at the series of events that have occurred in the past ten days, they all symbolize the seriousness of social problems and the latent crises in the future of education. Of course, everyone understands the government's difficulties and cannot be overly demanding; but at least they can quickly find ways to provide relief and reasonable solutions in order to eliminate the continuous occurrence of events. (April 19, in Guangzhou.)

Each test venue was quiet and silent, with very little talking or whispering, and no cheating or carrying of forbidden materials.

Timely Submission of Papers

Each examination session was scheduled for one hundred and twenty minutes, but most submitted their papers within ninety minutes, and the rest were able to submit their papers on time.

### Zhejiang Normal Students

Appeal for Food

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou] The food expenses for normal school students and publicly supported vocational school students in Zhejiang Province have always been subsidized by the government, and since this semester, it has been determined to be 3,000 yuan per month. The Education Department believes that, given the current high prices, the originally determined amount is far from enough to cover the actual expenses. It has already telegraphed the central government to request a supplementary payment, but no reply has been received so far. Yesterday, the student associations of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou Commercial College, Hangzhou Normal College, Hangzhou Polytechnic College, and Sericulture School jointly presented a request to the provincial government, stating that food expenses cannot be interrupted for even one day and that most students are from poor families. If they are required to pay for their own food, they will truly be unable to afford it. They specifically requested the provincial government to quickly issue an additional payment and also planned to send a document titled "Appeal for Food for Normal School Students and Publicly Supported Vocational School Students" to all sectors of Hangzhou to request their sympathy.

[TASS News Agency, Leningrad, 25th] The All-Union Institute of Plant Cultivation held a scientific conference to discuss how to expand the methods of collecting world crop specimens in the next five years and utilize them. The number of specimens totaled 150,000. Valuable agricultural knowledge and the scientific classification of crops are based on these collections. Many plants cultivated by the Plant Cultivation Institute's experimental stations occupy a large portion of the country's cultivated areas. In the case of wheat alone, the institute obtained 50 varieties based on its collection of world specimens. Under the new five-year plan, the collection of specimens will be greatly expanded. Several scientific expeditions will be sent to grain-producing areas throughout the country for this purpose. As a result of exchanges with foreign scientific research institutions, especially with the United States, Canada, France, Sweden, and Finland, the number of specimens will increase even further. On the one hand, a large supply of rice will be provided to domestic scientific and breeding institutions. This year, the breeding stations have obtained more than 50,000 wheat, barley, oat, pea, and buckwheat seedlings, as well as countless castor, vegetable, and other seeds. Works such as "The Soviet Cultivated Flora" and "The Biochemistry of Cultivated Plants" are about to be published.

### Teacher Appreciation Movement Charity Soccer Match: City Officials Appear Together; Heads of Party, Government, and Military Participate to Support; Full List of Sports Association Team Announced

The Teacher Appreciation Movement Charity Soccer Match will be held at 3:30 PM this Saturday at Yiyuan, between the Sports Association Team and the Referee Team. The Shanghai Municipal Sports Association Soccer Team is composed of council members and staff of the association. All are former veterans who are now old and find running difficult, let alone showing technical skills. However, in order to respond to the Teacher Appreciation Movement and encourage the younger generation, even the elderly officials do not hesitate to try their best. This is also a new atmosphere in the sports world. The referees' team is accustomed to running. Facing each other, the strength is inevitably disparate, reducing interest. Therefore, the Sports Association team specially invited Xu Wenkui and Li Ning, the captains of the Qingbai and Donghua teams, to participate in the support to increase interest. The full team list is as follows:

[Captain] Qian Dajun, [Manager] Wang Weijun, [Goalkeeper] Shen Shihua.

### Police Investigation Gradually Effective: Black Market for Securities Dwindles; Public Bonds Hover Around the 6,000 Mark; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Both See Tired Declines

Yesterday, plainclothes police officers inspected the Securities Market, and speculators lost their courage at the sight of them. The spot debt market almost came to a standstill. Only after the situation stabilized did transactions occur, but they were sporadic and amounted to nothing. In general, the overall market initially broke through the 6,000 yuan mark under the pressure of suppliers at 6,250 yuan, seeing a low price of 5,900 yuan, and finally hovered around the 6,000 yuan mark. The results of the afternoon closing showed that Categories A, B, D, and E were slightly tired, and Category C fell back by 300 yuan. This was purely due to unfavorable objective circumstances, as buying and selling did not proceed smoothly and were hit hard. Most Chinese stocks were suspended. It was reported that two apprentices from a certain number on Central Road, holding stocks, were arrested by police patrol officers, which shocked other places even more. Each of the major counterparties sought ways to remedy the situation but remained temporarily cautious in the absence of appropriate solutions. Each stock transaction was a guerrilla-type transfer, gathered from various places, and was a disjointed, concealed price negotiation. Each stock was once tired due to the liquidation by holders. Finally, the call price slightly rebounded. Compared with the previous closing price, each hot and cold stock saw a tired decline. The so-called three little hot stocks in the stock market, Jing, Xinguang, and Qinxing, held shareholders' meetings at the same time yesterday, and resolved to change the capital from pseudo-Central Reserve Coupons to National Currency and pay interest of one cent. The situation of foreign stocks was even more secret. Open transactions were extremely rare. Except for the most popular Yisha, etc., which had some supply at the previous closing price, the rest were silent. Near noon, there were low absorbers, and the call price of each stock was slightly increased. As a result, all stocks were slightly lower than the previous day.

### Gold and Banknotes Both Show Declines

The opening price of gold yesterday was still firm. Generally, people still had many concerns about the distribution price of 1.6 million by the Central Bank of China, which was not without impact. The buying interest shrank again, so it did not get rid of the hovering. The morning opened at 1.59 million, but the price of 1.60 million was difficult to break through. Soon, the US dollar turned around, and the gold market had a lot of outflow, once retreating to 1.57 million. After that, it rose slightly, and the fluctuation range was narrow. By noon, it was still around 1.575 million. The afternoon was slightly stable. As a result, it fell by 10,000 compared with the previous closing price, 168,000 for decorative gold, 1,600 for pattern silver, and 1,050 yuan for silver dollars. Secret discounts were slightly stable, and interest rates ranged from 12 cents to 15 cents.

The US dollar turned to show struggle. The demand and supply have been balanced. The morning opened at around 2,350 yuan. US business foreign firms slightly supplied. Buying interest was lazy, and it once fell back to 2,270 yuan. After that, it repeatedly advanced and retreated inside and outside 2,300 yuan. The afternoon trend turned stable, and a slight increase was seen. As a result, it fell back by 30 yuan compared with the previous closing price. Hong Kong tickets were stable at first, and Robbie turned loose, and then slightly tired. As a result, it fell back by 5 yuan compared with the previous closing price. The US exchange rate was still flat. 415 yuan for Hong Kong Telecom and 510 yuan for Robbie were traded.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Flour and Soybean Oil Follow Suit

Yesterday, the rice market rose by 1,000 yuan, with various producing areas being firm and expensive. Although there were no transactions in flour on the market, the outside stomach of the Chaozhou Guangdong gangs was still strong, and it continued to add 1,000 yuan. Shantou's digestion was more active, and it rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan again. Soybean cakes also rose by 200 to 300 yuan with Shantou's acquisitions. Road cargo added 400 to 500 yuan. Bran also continued to rise by 400 to 500 yuan, with Nanyang, Xiamen, and Shantou all having outlets. Yongbang Shantou slightly increased the selection of soybeans, and the price rose by 1,000 yuan. Medium and lower levels were flat, and the price of raw materials rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The situation improved and killed times. According to the rice market, yesterday, this city arrived in seven types of white japonica, etc., totaling more than 7,000 stones. The types and number of stones are as follows: 3,258 stones of white japonica, 315 stones of Du Xian, 100 stones of white yuan, 154 stones of early, 2,185 stones of early rice, 1,733 stones of thin, and 137 stones of Wu Xian.

### Large Batch of Edible Oil to Arrive: Price-Controlled Distribution Implemented

According to news from the grain industry in this city, recently, because the traffic between Shanghai and Qingdao has been smoother, a large amount of oil stored there will be transported in succession, which will be distributed by the vegetable oil factory and sold at parity retail to 500 stores of the designated oil sales number. Each store can be distributed one or two barrels per week, and each barrel is 350 city catties.

### Luxury Goods That Have Arrived: Allowed to Apply for Registration

A batch of imported luxury goods that arrived in Shanghai before the end of March and were waiting to be unloaded, after being banned by the customs, the owners of this batch of goods requested accommodation from the Imported Goods Management Office. After being approved to apply for registration by the office, many people have been going to apply in recent days. Because the office has set the end of this month as the deadline for accepting this request, after further inquiring about the types of goods, it can be decided which materials will be temporarily accommodated for import.

### China's Economic Problems: Famine is the Most Important

[Washington, 24th American News Service] According to the US Department of Commerce's Foreign Trade Office, China's most urgent economic problem is the famine. The lack of food is becoming increasingly serious, and several areas are threatened by famine. The lack of fuel is second only to the food problem. This year, due to abnormal dry weather, the possibility of locust plagues has already increased, so it is expected that this year's rice harvest will not greatly alleviate the food shortage. Not only that, but cholera and meningitis in southwestern China are quite rampant, threatening all residents in the area. According to the report of the Chinese Ministry of Food, Hunan Province has been the hardest hit. Other provinces and regions with serious disasters include Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Hebei-Tianjin area, etc. The situation in other places may be equally urgent, but due to the lack of transportation and vehicles, it is impossible to conduct a thorough investigation. According to news from the northeastern provinces of Manchuria, the harvest of this important agricultural area last year was still satisfactory, and there will not be a widespread famine for a while. However, due to the difficulty of distribution, it may make the supply of several large consumer areas insufficient. According to the report of the US Consul General in Hankou, the food situation in Hankou can reflect the critical situation in Hunan and Hubei provinces. The rice transported from Hunan to the area has been cut off. Although there was a proposal to obtain assistance from Shaanxi and Sichuan in January, it was delayed.

### Cheap Cotton, Expensive Yarn: Yarn Mills Enjoy High Profits; Double Horses Once Rallied to 1.22 Million

The textile industry in this city has recently seen rapid progress, the reasons being: (1) Cheap cotton and expensive yarn, manufacturers enjoy high profits, (2) A large number of US cotton imports, sufficient supply of fine yarn raw materials, (3) Taking over Japanese yarn mills and weaving as much as possible, (4) Many orders for US yarn spindles are placed with Shenchang Foreign Firm, but in reality, it still boils down to the superior profit of yarn manufacturing. Although the wages of textile workers have recently increased sharply, at least 3,500 yuan per person per day, and at most 6,000 yuan. One package of yarn costs 350,000 yuan in labor costs, plus more than four dan of raw cotton, about 350,000 yuan, totaling 700,000 yuan. However, the market price of 20-count cotton yarn is mostly outside 1 million yuan, so each package can still profit 300,000 to 400,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the yarn market was exempt from ups and downs. In the early morning, the progress of 20-count Double Horses was too fast. It rallied to 1.22 million. As many bulls in the same industry made profits and sought to sell, it stepped down to 1.16 million. The closing price was the same as yesterday's price, but the small and medium-sized miscellaneous brands were not easy to fall back after being brought up, and they rose from 20,000 to 40,000 compared to yesterday. The Cantonese gang was quite searching for 32-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn. 20-count seemed to have no big stomach, so the price of fire-type yarn rose limitedly.

Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegraph reported an increase of 16 to 25 pounds of sound, with the near-term US dollar at 27.81, the long-term at 28.07, and the Meterling spot at 28.26. The spot cotton trade in this city was still good, and the market price became more and more firm. Meterling's delivery to the factory was as high as 82,000 yuan, and the transaction was about 1,000 packages.

### Silk Goods Over Demand: Silk Market Transactions Quiet

Yesterday the silk market was flat. Artificial silk fluctuated only from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan throughout the day. The 120th Tianqiao opened at 1.53 million yuan, and closed at 1.51 million yuan, which was 10,000 yuan less than the day before. The factory's economic situation was quiet, and transactions were light. The call price was generally unchanged. Silk goods rose again yesterday, which was because silk factories had been shut down for a long time, and the inventory was short, and there was a phenomenon of over-demand. Each 100 US-Asian bed covers rose by 100,000 yuan again, and each code of Dachen Checkered Crepe was called over 4,000 yuan, and finally made 3,920 yuan.

### Tea Prices Still Have Not Improved: Foreign Firms Prepare for Activities

The tired wind of the tea market has not ended. The stores on this street are still lazy to enter, and the Tianjin gang has also closed their stomach for a long time. At present, there are only scattered drags for Pouchong tea, and the prices are all lower than the previous market, and there is no improvement in transactions. As for the foreign firm tea market, it is still quiet and silent. However, it is heard that some foreign managers of British trading companies have set off for Shanghai successively, and the White Head Bank (i.e., Indian Bank) also intends to make a comeback for the Chinese tea trade.

### Asphalt is Depressed

Asphalt has been gradually weak recently due to the sluggish sales market. Although there is no trend of large declines, it is depressed and it is not easy to turn around for a while, and most of the producing areas are blocked, and they all have low expectations. The sales plate in Shanghai has recently been slightly reduced, with Heben at 55,000 yuan, Inner Ping at 45,000 yuan, De Yu at 40,000 yuan, Lan Du at 38,000 yuan, Lan Oil at 35,000 yuan, and Macheng at 20,000 yuan.

### Coal Market Transactions Inferior

The trend of the coal market is still not good. People are idle, and the number of new households continues to be cautious. There is still no improvement in transactions. In particular, all kinds of bituminous coal are the least asked for. Only white coal kids have slight retail sales, and the market atmosphere is always sluggish. The market is unchanged while resisting the support. In addition, the colleagues of the hand-cranked briquette factory in this city have applied to the Fuel Management Committee of the Shanghai District of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the allocation of Hongji coal seams, which has been approved, and they will handle the payment immediately.

### Sugar Prices Rise Step by Step

Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was still firm, especially the middle sand. In the morning, the association's division was initially flat and then tight, from 56,500 yuan to 57,250 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was the time for the auction again. A total of 2,000 packages of white middle sand, 56,000 yuan, rose by 5,000 yuan; 500 packages of white three and a half trucks, 64,000 yuan, rose by 3,000 yuan; 1,500 packages of raw sand, 52,000 yuan, rose by 4,000 yuan, all of which were opened as scheduled. The market opened 57,500 yuan to 58,000 yuan for white middle sand. There were differences in the bundled white, with an opening of 61,000 yuan. The calling price of green sugar was slightly higher, but goods of 47,000 to 8,000 yuan were also opened.

### UK Increases Production: Artificial Fibers

[London, 25th British News Service] A reporter from the Daily Mail declared on the development of artificial fiber manufacturing in the UK that many factories in the central UK are currently receiving a large number of artificial fiber raw materials, which will be used for the sock industry. As for the mass production of artificial fiber fabrics and nylon stockings, it remains to be seen. Once the Nylon Textile Factory in South Wales is completed, nylon production will greatly increase, and small factories are also trying to obtain more nylon raw materials.

### Myanmar Promotes Rice Production: Government Decides to Provide Subsidies

[Reuters Yangon 25th] The Government of Burma has decided to pay a subsidy of £90 or 1,200 rupees per hundred acres of fallow land to encourage rice production and help relieve famine around the world, so as to restore cultivation.

### London Chinese Bonds: Market Conditions Gradually Progress

[Reuters London, 25th] "Standard Evening News" stated that the business of Chinese securities worth £16 million on the London market, which was suspended in 1938-1939, has gradually improved, especially those guaranteed by customs and salt taxes. The newspaper pointed out that 14 of China's 40-odd ports before the war have now been reopened, with only two continuing to be closed and the remainder being inland river ports. At present, the scope of trade in these ports is very small, but it is believed here that China will soon resume its debt obligations.

### Chinese Furs on the American Market: Generally Feel Too Expensive

[Reuters New York 25th] Chinese furs have now appeared in the fur departments of major stores across the United States. The criticisms from all parties are different. Some people think that the quality is excellent, and some people think that the leather is too hard or the color is not good. It is difficult to say what its future will be. It is generally thought that the price is too high, and it may be difficult to sell well. In a store in Philadelphia, Chinese mink coats are priced at US$1,495. The wholesale price of such leather coats is around US$900, so the retail price is between US$1,095 and US$1,200, and there will not be many buyers. However, leather-inlaid coats will generally still be popular this fall, and the popular furs will be Persian lamb, squirrel, leopard, lynx, sea otter, muskrat, raccoon, mink, silver fox, blue fox and mink.

### The Inevitable White Man

— Original by Jack London, Translated by Lu Mang

"But what about Saxe Dorff? One night,

I was about to go to sleep when two "cats" began to sing in the courtyard. I wasn't in bed yet, but standing by the window, holding a water bottle. But just then, I heard the window of the neighboring room open. Two shots were fired, and the window closed again. I forgot to tell you how quickly it happened. At most, only ten seconds. The window opened, bang, bang, two shots, and the window closed. Whoever they were, he didn't stop to see the results of his shooting. He knew. You understand my meaning? -- He "knew it." There was no more chorus from the "cats," and the next morning, the two offenders lay there, quite dead. I found it incredible. I still find it incredible. First, it was starlight, and Saxe Dorff didn't aim before shooting; second, he shot so fast that the two shots sounded like one double-barreled shot; and finally, he knew he had hit his target without even looking.

'Two days later, he came to see me on the ship. At that time, I was the first mate on the Duchess, a very large 150-ton schooner, a ship transporting black slaves. Let me tell you, in those days, a ship transporting black slaves was just that, a ship transporting black slaves. There were no government officials on board, and there was no government protection for "us." It was a rough business, each taking what they could get, and if we ended up finished, there was nothing to be said. We transported black people from every South Sea island that didn't drive us off the shore. Sure enough, Saxe Dorff came aboard and said his name was John Saxe Dorff. He was a small man with sandy-colored hair, sandy-colored skin, and sandy-colored eyes. He had nothing remarkable about him. His soul was as moderate as the color of his appearance. He said he was broke and wanted to do some work on the ship. Willing to be a cabin boy, cook, cargo manager, or ordinary sailor. He knew nothing about anything, but said he was willing to learn. I didn't need him, but his shooting had made such a deep impression on me that I took him on as an ordinary sailor, with a wage of three pounds a month.

'He really was willing to learn, I can say that. But he was fundamentally incapable of learning anything. He couldn't recite the thirty-two points of the compass in order, just as I couldn't mix drinks like Roberts. As for steering, he made my hair turn gray in a hurry. I never dared to hand him the helm when we were sailing on the sea, and he was even more clueless about how to handle the sails. He could never tell the difference between a sail's yard rope and a sail's foot rope, just couldn't tell. The jib and the mizzen sail looked the same to him. Ask him to ease some mainsails, and before you knew it, he had dropped the after sails. He fell into the sea three times, and he couldn't swim. But he was always cheerful, never seasick, and he was the most willing person I had ever seen to do things. He was an unspeakable soul. Never talked about himself. His history, as far as we knew, began the day he signed on the Duchess. Where he learned to shoot, only the stars in the sky knew. He was a Northerner from America -- that's what we could tell from his accent. And that was all we knew about him.

And now we're going to start talking about the main point. We didn't have good luck in the New Hebrides, only managing to get fourteen indentured laborers in five weeks, so we headed for the Solomon Islands. Malaita, then as now, was a good place to load cargo, so we sailed into Marou, in the northwest corner. There were two docking areas there, one closer to the shore and one further out, and a very unstable anchorage; but we anchored well, and then fired a gunpowder cannon, a signal to notify the black people to come and be transported. After three days, we hadn't gotten a single laborer. Hundreds of black people paddled their canoes to our ship's side, but when we showed them beads and printed cloth and small axes, and told them how happy it was to work on the plantations in Samoa, they just laughed.

'On the fourth day, there was a change. Exactly fifty laborers came to sign contracts and were locked in the large cabin below deck -- they were allowed to come up to the deck to walk around, of course. Naturally, on careful thought, signing such a large number of contracts at once was suspicious, but at that time, we thought some powerful chief had lifted the ban on transporting black people. On the morning of the fifth day, our two rowboats went to the shore as usual -- one for cover and one for the workers. As usual, the fifty black people on the ship were on the deck, strolling, talking, smoking, and sleeping. Saxe Dorff and myself, plus four other sailors, were the entire number remaining on the ship. The two rowboats were guarded by Gilbert Islanders. In one were the captain, cargo manager, and laborer recruiter. In the other, was the second mate, which was the covering boat, which stayed about one hundred yards from the shore. Both rowboats were armed, though it didn't seem likely that there would be any disturbance. [To be continued]

### The Old Man

— Yang Lian Yuan

He has lived in the small wooden house at the gate of this Western-style building for seventeen years.

Seventeen years, such a long period of time!

Seventeen years ago, the Chinese people's revolution was advancing to a new stage at that time. Some people were awakened: Are they still slaves? In the South and North, whirlwinds were sweeping.

Seventeen years ago, this old man moved from the wind-and-sand-covered Imperial City to this metropolis. Is it a move? Only he himself knows. He is an old man who guards the gate for others. Then, would it be more appropriate to replace "move" with "seeking food"?

"At that time, when I first came here, those foreigners were really impressive! Later, I gradually got used to it. I used a little bit of the method of serving princes and nobles to deal with them, and it was enough..." The old man coughed and choked, and his words stopped temporarily...

He continued: "Being a servant is a servant's fate! Sir, I have been here for seventeen years, but I have never been to the main street once. Sir, I heard that this city is more prosperous than Beijing! But I have only seen the Germans living in this Western-style building replaced by the French, and two years ago, the French left and were replaced by the Japanese. I only saw these. I guard the door for them, and they all paid me wages. Now, I am still guarding the door, guarding it for you, gentlemen!"

The coughing sound rang out again.

This Western-style building is also old, but the old man's small wooden house is even more dilapidated!

Near midnight, he opened the gate and let the last carriage carrying the masters who had had their fun drive in. Then he coughed and choked as he retreated into the small wooden house.

Five hours later, the sound of the train whistle coming from afar woke him up. The old man got up, slowly opened the gate, and slowly swept the path around the garden. For seventeen years, the old man had spent seventeen years like this, even though the masters had changed several times in between?

What about the days to come? The old gatekeeper himself doesn't know. Whether he lives or dies is irrelevant to the prosperous city.

### Presented to Wang Ziruo

— Yang Qing Pan

In recent years, I have not known a time of peace. A song of Yunyang makes dreams clear. If Changmen had no resentment, there would be no need for esteemed wine to move emotions.

### Preface to Presented to Cai Jun Beilun

— Jiang Wei Qiao

In the year of Gengwu, my friend Huang Renzhi introduced Cai Jun Beilun to me in a letter, saying, "Mr. Cai is a man of noble integrity, registered in Taiwan, but he does not forget his motherland. He abandons the wealth and honor of the barbarians and returns to starve on the seashore. Such a person is rarely seen in recent times." Beilun was extraordinary and upright, and his conversation was lively and humorous, so I became friends with him against the tide. Mr. Cai was originally from Quanzhou, Fujian. Since his great-grandfather traveled to Taiwan as an official during the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty, his family settled there. During the Jiawu War, Taiwan was ceded to Japan. Beilun was twelve or thirteen years old, and he felt indignant and depressed, harboring the ambition to move inland, but he did not dare to do so without his parents' permission. He had no choice but to study in Japan, nurturing his ambition and waiting for the time to come. When his father died, he was again delayed by his elderly mother, so he served in the Taiwan Governor-General's Office and the Tokyo Ministry of Foreign Affairs. People thought that Beilun would become rich and powerful, but Beilun was saddened by his situation! After serving for more than four years, his old mother passed away. On her deathbed, she told him: "My son, you have humbled yourself for the sake of providing for me. Now you can carry out your ambition." Beilun recorded it with tears. After the mourning period, he immediately resigned and returned to his ancestral land with his family, naming his three sons Hanji, Hanwei, and Hanguang, to show that he did not forget the Han people. He first lived in West Lake, and then moved to Shanghai, not living in a fixed place, working as a teacher and a lawyer, only seeking to make a living without being picky about his profession. One year, there was an envoy of Kunyun on the sea who was good at physiognomy. His words were subtle and accurate, causing a sensation for a time. Many famous officials and magnates were close to him. In fact, it was Beilun, imitating Junping, relying on physiognomy to support himself. His efforts can be said to be painstaking. In the year of Dingchou, the Japanese invaders invaded our country, and the southeastern provinces fell. The enemy generals knew Beilun and repeatedly sent envoys to invite him to join them. Beilun avoided them as if they were dirt, and refused to be moved by the bait of important positions. Sometimes, when he could not avoid them, he politely declined them. After declining them, the invitations came again, and he firmly refused again. Friends worried about him, but Beilun did not care, saying, "If I die for righteousness, what regrets would I have?" When the enemy surrendered, he was overjoyed, saying, "I did not expect to see the resurgence of the Han people today. I will return south to pay homage to the graves of my ancestors!" I know Beilun deeply, and on his return, I write this to present to him.

### Birds of a Feather (30)

— Zhao Qingge

Li Yun had stopped crying at this time. Because from now on, she could be with Lihua every day. So, she happily went to find Lihua. Lihua was serving Master Hei in the study at this time. Li Yun told Lihua everything in a low voice. Lihua jumped up with joy.

Master Mo watched the two children's expressions and couldn't help asking them what was going on. The innocent Lihua told Master Mo everything excitedly again. She originally thought that Master Mo would be as happy as they were when he heard the news, but unexpectedly, Master Mo sighed deeply and said:

"A dream, a dream, another 'dream'!"

The children didn't understand Master Mo's meaning, but they could see that Master Mo was not only unhappy but also very sad. Only Master Mo understood in his heart that his illness came from this matter. Now, he was filled with emotions for this matter! He couldn't sort out his chaotic thoughts, and he seemed to have returned to that dream seven years ago. He seemed to be drowning in the mud!

Lihua and Li Yun looked at each other, dumbfounded and not knowing what to say, and didn't dare to say anything more, so everyone fell into silence.

"Yunmei! Yunmeimei!" Shiling shouted loudly. Then, he ran into the study like a whirlwind.

"Brother Bao, you're back so soon! Did you bring my bedding?"

"Yunmeimei, Uncle Weng is dead!" Bao Ling said breathlessly.

"What?" Master Mo suddenly sat up in shock.

Lihua and Li Yun were so scared that their eyes widened.

"Uncle Weng used a copper needle for smoking to pierce his belly button. He also drank all the remaining opium. When I went, he was already out of breath. There was a lot of blood on the bed. I was so scared that I didn't dare to stay for a moment and ran back in a hurry. So your bedding wasn't brought back either," Bao Ling said nervously, wiping the sweat from his face.

Li Yun was stunned when she heard this.

Lihua was so scared that she trembled.

Suddenly, Master Mo muttered to himself:

"Good! Now, the dream is over! It's over!" After saying that, Master Mo laughed out loud. "Haha..."

A boundless darkness enveloped him! He unconsciously coughed out a mouthful of thick phlegm, and then, as if he had drunk too much wine, he fell down in a daze; in a confused state; in a dizzy state

Bao Ling then realized in surprise that his words had caused trouble. Before he could regret it, he rushed to help Master Mo up.

"Dad! Dad! What's wrong with you? What's wrong?"

"Dad! Dad!" Lihua also called out in panic, shaking Master Mo.

"Yunmeimei! Go get water!"

Li Yun was also caught up in another new fear, and she had forgotten about her own affairs. She quickly poured a cup of tea and handed it to Bao Ling.

"Dad! Drink some water! Dad" Bao Ling held the tea to Master Mo's mouth.

However, Master Mo didn't open his mouth anymore! He only struggled to open his tired eyes, and softly shouted:

"Xiaohua"

"Dad!" Lihua responded, throwing herself into Master Mo's arms!

At this time, Master Mo moved slightly, then lay back peacefully on the bed, and just like that, as if drunk in a dream, he stopped thinking; stopped the flow of blood; stopped the breathing of his entire life; and from then on, he was truly silent and at rest

"Dad!" Bao Ling's voice changed!

"Dad!" Lihua cried!
