### Many Hidden Obstacles to Railway Restoration; Solutions Found for the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways

[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 11th] It is reported that although the Military Mediation Department has established a transportation group to discuss restoration methods for the national railway restoration issue, apart from certain sections of the Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan Railways that are being prepared for repairs, the restoration of most transportation routes still faces many obstacles due to sharply conflicting opinions on both sides. According to transportation industry sources, engineers previously sent to the Communist-controlled areas of Zhangjiakou to carry out restoration work were sent by the local Communist army to Mingxiakou, where they were detained for five days before being released. In addition, the Communist army has independently established railway bureaus on various routes. The Jinpu Railway Bureau has already been established, and station chiefs have been appointed, requesting the demolition of bunkers at each station. It is heard that the government, within possible conditions, still hopes to obtain reasonable consultations to allow transportation to be restored as soon as possible, so that people displaced from their homes during the War of Resistance can return to their hometowns quickly.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 11th] Reliable sources indicate that the issue of restoring the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been resolved after repeated consultations between both sides. Regarding several new conditions proposed by the Communist army recently, apart from the issue of management and personnel, which remains under discussion, the government has made significant concessions. It has been decided that work will begin on the 12th from Liguo to Yanzhou. Regarding the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, from Damiao to Baitaibu, after the Communist representative Wei Guofa from the Xuzhou group went to negotiate yesterday, it was also agreed to start work simultaneously on the 12th. It is heard that the Communist army has introduced 400 workers for the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, each receiving three catties of flour per day.

The Military Mediation Department Chief of Staff meeting decided to order the Communist army to withdraw from Jianping within 24 hours. Otherwise, the National Army could take action, and the Jiafeng group was ordered to monitor the execution. The Communist army there, the 43rd Brigade, not only did not comply with the previous order but intensified its actions, dispatching troops. On March 7th, some Communist troops arrived in the area between Chaoyang and Yeboshou, sabotaging the railway and burning down the Taipingfang station. Several station masters and staff, as well as money and goods, were looted. They are still active in the area north of the railway and have not shown any signs of withdrawing north of Jianping.

### "Agricultural Communes" in the Northeast "Liberate" the People's Food

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] A person from the Northeast says: The people of the Northeast, who have fallen into a deep abyss of suffering, have not only had soybeans "liberated," but also wheat, sorghum, and corn, which have been "liberated" from the "daihe" (Japanese for "offering") of the enemy puppet era. There are no more organizations like the "Agricultural Development Department" and "Agricultural Development Cooperative" in the Northeast, but "Agricultural Communes" still serve the friendly nations in various parts of the Northeast. This organization is now serving the friendly nations and the so-called People's Army in a way that scrapes the bone and sucks the marrow. People who are reluctant to contribute grain are likely to be strangled to death. Recently, the price of gold in the Northeast has risen to 170,000 legal tender per tael, and people are fleeing to Jinzhou in droves.

### Second Commemoration Week of the Second Plenary Session; President Chiang Encourages Party Members to Understand the Times and the Environment and Conduct Self-Examination Humbly

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] The Second Plenary Session held its second commemoration week at 9 AM this morning. After President Chiang led the ceremony, he delivered a speech, praising the enthusiastic discussion spirit of the conference this week. However, he believes that for each issue, it is necessary to understand the era and environment in which the country is situated and conduct humble self-examination so that it can make a practical contribution to national construction. Our task is extremely arduous, and comrades of the entire conference must promote party virtue, establish confidence, concentrate our will, be a model for all party members, share weal and woe, respond to the people of the whole country, and strive to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete the work of national construction. He deeply believes that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve ultimate success. The chairman's speech lasted 55 minutes. After the speech, there was a ten-minute break, followed by the 14th session, where reports on border issues were heard. Bai Yunti reported on the Mongolian banner issue and its solutions. Gesang Zecai reported on the current situation of the Tibetan people. Zhang Zhizhong also reported on the plan to resolve the Xinjiang issue. The meeting adjourned in the afternoon.

[Dispatch from the United Press, Chongqing, 10th] Chairman Chiang stated in his speech at the Second Plenary Session today that the current task of the nation is exceptionally difficult, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be implemented. If anyone criticizes the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, they can blame him personally, but they should not attack others.

### Premier Song's Political Report (Continuation 3)

I have also heard criticisms that the situation in the takeover of enemy and puppet industries is chaotic. This probably refers to the initial period. When Japan surrendered, I was still abroad, but since I am serving as the President of the Executive Yuan, I cannot shirk my responsibility for the chaotic situation at the beginning of the takeover. Take Shanghai, for example. During the initial takeover period, there were more than a dozen party, government, and military agencies taking over, sealing warehouses, sealing houses, and arresting suspected Han traitors. The situation was very chaotic. I arrived in Shanghai on October 11th under the order of the President. Following the President's instructions, I ordered all agencies to report a list of all seized and sealed materials within three days. At the same time, I established the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to take over the materials sealed by various agencies and handle them uniformly in accordance with regulations. Later, I went to Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and other places, where the Executive Yuan also established management bureaus to take over and handle them. Since the Executive Yuan has taken responsibility for this matter, it is naturally unavoidable that there will be misunderstandings in many areas. However, to achieve a balance of income and expenditure to avoid currency inflation, we cannot overthink criticisms from various parties. Even if there are indeed such temporary misunderstandings, it is the price that the person in charge should pay. In short, the country's income and expenditure must first show a trend toward balance, and then people's minds can be stabilized, and prices can be stabilized. After prices are stable, all non-productive idle funds can be channeled into normal industrial and commercial enterprises. With stable people's minds and stable prices, it is possible to implement currency system consolidation. After the currency system is consolidated, industry and commerce will have a foundation for revival.

Employee Compensation Increases Should Have Reasonable Adjustments

From the perspective of stabilizing prices, one extremely urgent and important matter must be mentioned, which is the issue of increasing the compensation for employees of government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Due to unstable prices and high living costs, compensation should be reasonably adjusted, and the government must plan comprehensively and set improvement standards. However, for the sake of the country and the public, I hope everyone can maintain a spirit of patience and cooperation, keeping improvement requests within a reasonable range. Otherwise, the national treasury will spend too much, and prices will rise too quickly. As a result, even if salaries are increased, it will not help. It is unlikely that the majority of people would want a situation where a part of themselves damages the overall economy for immediate benefits.

Addressing the Economic Crisis by Increasing the Supply of Materials

The government's second strategy to cope with the economic crisis is to increase the supply of materials. During the War of Resistance, there was no way to transport materials in or produce and supply them in large quantities, which made it impossible to stabilize prices. Currently, the government is doing its best to obtain materials from abroad. The sources are: (A) Materials under the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, some for temporary relief supplies such as food and clothing, and some for tools, machinery, and raw materials needed for general restoration of transportation and industry. (B) Utilizing the US military's surplus materials in the Far East. This includes a wide variety of materials and a large quantity, which can supply the current urgent needs of the people. (C) Using the government's foreign funds to purchase materials. (D) Obtaining long-term foreign loans from countries such as the United States and Canada to import machinery and raw materials. (E) Requesting compensation materials from Japan.

At the same time, the government should do its best to promote the development of domestic agriculture and industry to increase domestic material production. To make the domestic economy prosperous, the government should directly enable the people to obtain machinery and raw materials from abroad to promote their production capacity. Indirectly, and more importantly, the government should do its best to restore social order and land and water transportation, stabilize prices, to ensure the people's safety and livelihoods, and lower interest rates. Then, the revival of enterprises and the supply of materials can be fully guaranteed. [To be continued]

### Chongqing Gold and Currency Prices Rise

### Suzhou High Court Interrogates Chen Gongbo; Chen Admits to Being the Chief Culprit Without Hesitation; The Property of All Traitors Will Be Disposed of According to Law After Sentencing

### Tenders Solicited for Urgent Renovation of the National Assembly Hall; Cost Approximately 400 Million Yuan; The Entire Hall Can Accommodate 2,450 People

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] As the National Assembly is about to convene, various preparations are being intensified. The National Assembly Hall and the Art Exhibition Hall next to it have been undergoing urgent renovation since the 6th. The tender decision has determined that the renovation cost is approximately 400 million yuan, including 180 million yuan for woodwork, 110 million yuan for water and electricity engineering, and 120 million yuan for building renovation engineering. The project can be completed in 45 days.

### East Indian Troops Attack British Transport Team; Java Situation Tense Again; British Send Planes to Assist in Battle, Dispatched Five Times; Sjahrir Protests Dutch Landing Damages Sovereignty

[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: Since the Dutch troops landed in Java last Saturday, the situation there has become tense again. Today, fighting broke out again. Sixty-five miles from Batavia, Indonesian troops attacked a British transport team, and the two sides opened fire. As a result, seven British officers and soldiers were killed and twenty-five wounded. The casualties on the Indonesian side are unknown. During the battle, the British troops requested assistance, and the British sent planes to help, dispatched five times. Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir today protested to Britain and the Netherlands, stating that the Dutch landing in Java has undermined Indonesian sovereignty, and the discipline of the Dutch troops is also poor.

[United Press, Batavia, 11th] The British government is today implementing its policy of gradually withdrawing its troops from the Dutch East Indies. Approximately one thousand British Indian troops are boarding ships awaiting departure. According to a British statement, British troops were ambushed by East Indians between Budensosuk and Bandang last night, and fighting broke out, not ceasing throughout the night.

[Reuters, Batavia, 11th] The Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook today held lengthy talks with British Envoy Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and British and Dutch military leaders. Southeast Asia Allied Army Commander-in-Chief General Montagu Stopford, Java Allied Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Christison, Dutch East Indies Army Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Spoor, and Far East Dutch Navy Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Pinke were all present.

[Reuters, Batavia, 11th] Indonesian President Sukarno has approved Sjahrir's new cabinet and authorized Sjahrir to begin negotiations with the Netherlands.

### Without a Common Policy Between Britain and America, Soviet Ambition Cannot Be Stopped; New York Times Discusses the International Situation; The Soviet Union is Fully Launching a Nerve War Against Britain

[Reuters, London, 11th] The New York Times special correspondent states: The identical attitude shown by Britain and America in the past week regarding the problems of the three eastern provinces of China, Iran, and Bulgaria makes people increasingly believe that without Britain and America adopting a common policy, Soviet ambitions in Asia cannot be stopped. Although the British government has not formally expressed its support for Churchill's speech in Fulton, the number of senior diplomats and senior military officials who advocate close cooperation with the United States has been increasing daily.

The Soviet Union's refusal to discuss the issue of the three eastern provinces of China is deeply unsettling. Britain is clearly deeply regretful of the Soviet Union's unilateral actions, disregarding its obligations to the United Nations.

What London is currently speculating is whether the Soviet Union is willing to submit these issues to the United Nations or other international conferences for review? Or will the Soviet Union continue to act alone, regardless of outside disapproval. If Moscow continues to take the latter approach, then Churchill's theory of Anglo-American cooperation will gain support even among pro-Soviet elements in the Labour Party.

[Another Dispatch] The New York Times stated that Britain's strength has been greatly weakened since this war. Those who do not understand Britain may believe that Britain has been reduced to a second-rate power and that the British Empire will gradually disintegrate. The Soviet Union clearly also holds this view and is therefore concentrating all its efforts on launching a nerve war against Britain, in order to eliminate the weaker of the two major powers first. Today, the British Empire is engaged in a struggle for survival no less intense than during the most severe period of the war, facing both the rise of nationalist movements in India, Egypt, Palestine, and elsewhere, and the offensive of communist Russia. Britain cannot enjoy peace and security even after victory. Churchill's proposed Anglo-American cooperation theory is nothing more than expanding the balance of power policy to world politics.

Soviet Newspaper Criticizes Churchill's Speech

[Another Dispatch] The Pravda today commented on Churchill's speech in Fulton under the title "Churchill Brandishes a Gun as a Demonstration," stating in brief: Churchill's assertion that a third world war is inevitable is intended to launch a war against the Soviet Union. Churchill advocates that Britain and America conclude a military alliance to deal with one of the three great powers, and its purpose is nothing more than to control the world with Britain and implement power politics. Old Churchill knows that he cannot clap with one hand and that he is not strong enough to complete the encirclement of the Soviet Union alone. Therefore, he advocates that Britain and America conclude a military alliance so that the British Empire can survive and implement its imperialist policies.

### Churchill Meets with Truman Yesterday

### Iranian Leftists Demonstrate to Prevent Parliament from Convening; Elections Cannot Be Held While Soviet Troops Are Not Withdrawn

### Birthday of Muslim Spiritual Leader; Steel Diamonds Used to Weigh Body; Solemn Ceremony Held in Bombay

[Reuters, Bombay, 11th] The Muslim spiritual leader Aga Khan (direct descendant of Muhammad's daughter Fatima) held a celebration yesterday at the local stadium for his 75th birthday using steel diamonds. More than 70,000 people attended. His body was weighed against steel diamonds on scales, weighing two hundred and forty-three and a half pounds. Representatives of Muslims from Iraq, Ibn, Nanfei, Dongfei, Syria, Lebanon, Central Asia, and Myanmar sat around the weighing platform. One end of the scale was a chair. The ceremony was held before sunrise. After Aga Khan sat upright in the weighing chair, a group of religious figures chanted the Quran, while one noble dressed in embroidered robes placed the steel diamonds into the weighing pan.

### On the Spanish Question, Britain and America Reject French Proposal; Believe Spain Does Not Endanger Peace; France Caught in Dilemma

[United Press, New York, 11th] According to a broadcast from Paris today, the United States, acting in concert with Britain, presented a note to France on the 9th of this month, rejecting the French proposal to submit the Spanish question to the United Nations Security Council for discussion. Part of the reason is that the Spanish regime does not endanger international peace.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] According to authoritative sources, France's proposal to submit the Spanish question to the Security Council for discussion is supported by the Soviet Union on one hand, and opposed by Britain and the United States on the other, thus feeling caught in a dilemma.

A solemn memorial service was held in Vienna this morning to pay tribute to the heroes who died in Austria and the Allied countries. At this time when the world situation is tense again, the meaning of the memorial day in Vienna is very profound.

### Editorial: Today's Afforestation Movement

Once a year, today is Arbor Day again. Party and government agencies in various places are holding afforestation movements as usual, creating a grand scene. However, today's movement is of particularly profound significance, because during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the trees in various places were all cut down for various military purposes. All building timber is already causing sighing at the lack of housing, and even daily fuel has actually reached the point of being "expensive as cinnamon." The general public feels the pain of struggling to light a fire.

However, if this afforestation movement is carried out according to the old rules of previous years and held once a year, how much actual effect will it have? It is necessary to review this. As far as we can see, in many places where trees are planted, they are intentionally or unintentionally broken and destroyed within a few days, especially the trees planted along the roads, which are the most common victims. Therefore, although trees are planted, forests are never created.

Of all the people who participate in this movement, eight or nine out of ten are still officials and students from various agencies, and the general public is always in the minority, especially farmers, who are a minority within the minority. Therefore, the trend of afforestation has never been cultivated, and consequently, it does not achieve widespread effectiveness.

Regarding the first point mentioned above, we believe that on the one hand, it is certainly necessary to plant new trees and create new forests, while on the other hand, it seems necessary to effectively protect and manage the trees and forests that have been planted in the past. The responsible authorities, by virtue of their duties, should not only manage afforestation, but also take care of forest protection. Afforestation is temporary, but forest protection is constant. When creating new forests and planting new trees, should we inspect the old forests and old trees? If there is any carelessness and they are trampled and destroyed, should we investigate the responsibility for this problem? It all seems to be worth paying attention to.

As for the general public not feeling a deep interest, this issue is naturally very complicated. We believe that one of the reasons is that past publicity has been too superficial and has not penetrated the people. Now that Baos and Jias have been universally established in various places, we believe that concentrating on afforestation and empty talk are not as effective and practical as using rural Baos and Jias, distributing trees, and urging planting.

Of course, doing so requires a large number of seedlings, and whether it can actually be done is a problem. However, agricultural and forestry farms and nurseries should already exist in every city and county. If a policy is decided and preparations are made in advance, this problem is not unsolvable. Moreover, holding an afforestation movement always requires a sum of money. Even if this sum of money is used to purchase seedlings and widely distribute them, the magnitude of its effectiveness and the practicality of its publicity will definitely not be less than holding a ceremony.

In addition to planting new trees and creating new forests, we also have doubts as to whether we have made the most of the existing forests and trees. It has been a full half year since the recovery. The source of timber in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui has still not been unblocked. At a time when foreign capital has not arrived and existing stocks have been depleted, the construction industry in various places has still not been able to recover. Internal timber merchants and mountain households are even more unable to relieve their difficulties under the obstacles of taxes, transportation, etc. As the ancient saying goes, "The people's pursuit of profit is like water flowing downward." For the general merchants, as long as there is profit to be made, promotion and movements are superfluous. "By the ways of today, do not change the customs of today." If the producers have no profit to be made and the merchants are unwilling to move forward, then the annual routine movement will probably not be able to realize the expected hope!

### Our Country's Grain Shortage is Serious; Hoping for UNRRA Relief; Ten Million Bags of Rice Needed Before Autumn Harvest; Food Minister Xu Kan Submits Appeal

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The United Grain Board, composed of Britain, America, and Canada, will put forward important proposals this week to allocate world grain, and the fate of hundreds of millions of people in China, India, and Eurasia will be determined by its decision. The board has received a complete report on the grain situation in China. Chinese Food Minister Xu Kan recently stated that UNRRA Director Lehman telegraphed the ministry, instructing the hungry people of China to tighten their belts to the maximum before the autumn harvest. Xu Kan said that after Japan's surrender, the grain shortage became more serious due to the destruction of transportation lines. The slow withdrawal of Japanese military and civilians also took away a large portion of China's grain, making it difficult to raise military rice. Before the end of September, ten million bags of rice are needed. China plans to ask UNRRA to buy rice for relief in Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. When Special Envoy Marshall returns to Washington, he will appeal to UNRRA on behalf of the Chinese government. The United Grain Board has listened to the appeal of the Indian grain delegation. There are many applications to the board from various places. Japan and Germany have also asked it to increase the allocation of grain. MacArthur has asked the board to transport 1.25 million tons of grain to Japan in the first half of this year for relief, but British Food Minister Smith has opposed this. The British government is also opposed to increasing the transport of grain to the country.

Hungry People in Twenty-Three Countries are Crying Out for Food

[United Press, Washington, 10th] According to authoritative sources, twenty-three countries have requested rice in the second quarter of this year, totaling more than two million tons, but the amount of rice that can be obtained is estimated to be only 500,000 tons. From this, we can know how difficult the international grain distribution authorities are encountering as a result of the world food shortage. The Rice Committee of the United Grain Board is striving to respond to the supply and demand of rice. It is expected that the urgent meeting convened by the Food Board on Thursday will be able to answer it, and at least a portion of food can be allocated to the countries threatened by famine.

Hoover Criticized for Using it as a Political Tool

[United Press, New York, 10th] The American National Citizens Political Action Committee today wrote to President Truman, requesting the dismissal of American representative Hoover, who is investigating the famine situation in Europe. It is claimed that Hoover will use food as a weapon to attack the democratic forces in Europe. Hoover himself has not commented on this. However, according to his subordinates, after World War I, Hoover never used food relief to achieve reactionary political goals. The American Industrial Union, together with the head of the United Fish, Food, Tobacco, and Agricultural Workers Union, Henderson, also wrote to the President, saying that millions of residents in Assam starved to death because Hoover did not approve of their demand for independent democratic political activities.

### International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to be Located in Washington

### U.S. Debt Mounts High: Total Debt of All Countries Equals That of the U.S.; U.S. Senator Opposes Lending to Britain

[United Press Washington, 11th] Democratic Senator Ellender, opposing loans to Britain, declared today that the U.S. now owes $279 billion, exceeding the total debt of Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia by $145 billion. The total debt of all countries in the world is only equal to that of the U.S. The area of the U.S. is equal to only one-tenth of the total area of the united nations. The united nations have ten people while the U.S. only has one, yet the united nations is seeking loans from the U.S. From this, it seems the U.S. has been harmed by progress. The U.S., for the sake of stabilizing the world economy, has already agreed to allocate nearly $10 billion to participate in the International Bank and Equalization Fund. If the U.S. lends to Britain, there will be no reason to refuse loans to the Soviet Union and France, which will inevitably cause resentment. The average debt per American citizen is $1,997, while in the British Empire it is only $161.

### Honma Sentenced to Death

Among them, several lost their parents during air raids, and there are also many who became widows due to the impact of the war. (Among them there are also widows of the *Kamikaze* squadron.)

### Loan for Grain Merchants Approved; Can Be Fully Decided and Lending Commenced Within a Week

Overseas Procurement Also Agreed Upon; Speculators Should Cease Their Activities

The loan scheme for grain merchants has been approved by the Ministry of Food. The Ministry of Food is now consulting with the Four Banks Joint Treasury on loan procedures. It is expected that all matters can be fully decided and lending commenced within this week. The total amount is 200 billion yuan, mostly to be handled by the Farmers Bank of China, with an interest rate of 3%. Yang Xizhi, the Food Administration Special Commissioner who flew to Chongqing with the loan draft five days ago for instructions, also flew back to Shanghai the night before last. As for the city's food supply, there have been abundant arrivals in recent days. Coupled with the existing reserves of more than 500,000 piculs, speculators have been alarmed by this news and are selling off their holdings.

Two Batches of Overseas Rice Have Arrived

In addition, the Food Administration authorities are preparing to purchase large quantities of food from Southeast Asia to supplement the food supply. Initial discussions have been successfully conducted by Ambassador Wellington Koo with the London Food Bureau. The Ministry of Food in Chongqing will also send a senior official to Singapore to conduct further specific discussions with relevant parties. According to news from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), UNRRA relief rice will be shipped to China in large quantities. From January to June of this year, it is estimated that a total of 209,000 tons of rice will be shipped to China. The first batch, transported by the "Niagara," containing 18,157 bags, arrived at the end of last month and has been unloaded in Kowloon. UNRRA has allocated the above rice to the Guangxi Branch and the Guangdong Branch. The second batch, carried by the "Toke Torres," with 2,143 tons, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is currently being unloaded.

Yang Xizhi Talks About Loan Procedures

According to Mr. Yang Xizhi's statement to reporters, grain merchants applying for loans must first have their qualifications examined by the Food Administration authorities and the bank, checking: (1) business history, (2) past credit, (3) facilities in the production area, and (4) transportation and sales capabilities. Only those who pass the examination can be granted loans by the national bank. The loan amount is also limited, depending on the strength of the grain merchant. For example, if they can purchase 500 piculs, then the government loan will also be for 500 piculs. If they have the capacity for 100 piculs, continuous purchasing, transportation, and sales will follow, and the rest will follow this pattern. By making the city's reserves abundant and the sources plentiful, the drop in rice prices can be expected in the near future. As for the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, with more than 300 members, whether all of them are qualified to apply for loans will be determined after further review. After the implementation of the grain merchant loan, the Food Administration Special Commissioner's Office will stand in a guiding position for grain merchants and will investigate whether they have used the entire loan to purchase rice in the production area, whether the rice has been transported to Shanghai after purchase, whether it has been hoarded after arriving in Shanghai, and its source and destination. If any violation of the above situations is discovered, severe punishment will be imposed. Mr. Yang also said that the recent resurgence of rice prices in Shanghai was caused by speculators raising prices, while grain prices in the production area have not fluctuated. Therefore, after grain merchant loans are used for large-scale purchases in the production area, the speculative atmosphere in the city can be eliminated immediately.

### "Minzu" and "Jiang'an" Ships to Depart Today

It is heard that the company has built several new ships in London, which will successively come to China to begin operations. China Navigation Company's "Jinan" is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Qingdao on Thursday, originally to carry relief supplies. Due to the small amount of relief supplies, it will load some commercial goods.

### Enemy Property Mortgaged to French Businessmen; We Negotiate to Reclaim and Take Over Management

Property Dispute Arises Over Gresham Apartments

Among all the properties investigated and seized by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, a property dispute involving a value of hundreds of thousands of yuan has recently occurred. This property originally belonged to a Japanese named Kanagori Kanko, located at Gresham Apartments (1226-1238 Avenue Joffre), occupying six mu of land, and 12.52 mu along the Pingliang Road. As of June 10th, 1940, the Japanese had mortgaged the above properties to the French Shanghai First Charity Hall for 264,000 yuan in national currency, and later mortgaged 30 million yuan in Japanese currency. After the victory, all properties of Japanese expatriates in Shanghai were confiscated by our government authorities. The above property's original owner was Japanese, and therefore should be taken over by our side. However, because Kanagori Kanko used it as collateral, a dispute arose in the property rights aspect with the French Shanghai First Charity Hall. It is heard that the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau is willing to advance the full amount of the mortgage to the French First Charity Hall and confiscate the property under the management of our country. The negotiations with the French side are ongoing.

Indicted on Charges of Traitor

[Our Dispatch] Wang Xinghuai, the battalion commander of the spy team attached to the 94th Regiment of the 24th Division of the Puppet 9th Army stationed in Taixian, led more than ten people into Lingjia Village on the night of July 21 last year, under the pretext of collecting public grain, robbing every household.

### Water and Lumber Industry Labor Dispute Under Mediation; City Government Orders Detailed Investigation

Gas Company Labor Strike Concludes with Agreement Yesterday

Amidst the ongoing labor dispute in the city's water and lumber industry, an unfortunate incident occurred where a member of the First Squad of the First Battalion of the Shanghai North District Defense Corps shot and injured civilians. The deceased were identified as striking workers Zhu Jinfu and Zhang Chunsheng. Yesterday afternoon, worker representatives Xin Ruiding and Zhu Qichang, among others, went to the Social Affairs Bureau to request mediation. The wages of workers in this industry are mostly calculated on a daily basis, amounting to 1,050 yuan in national currency per day, with meals provided by the employers, but the workers are responsible for providing their own tools. They are now demanding an increase in wages to 6,300 yuan in national currency per day, with meals still provided by the employers and tools remaining their own responsibility. However, employers did not send representatives to the bureau yesterday, so formal negotiations could not be held. According to Director Li Jianhua of the Labor Factory, regarding the shooting incident, the General Defense Corps and the Garrison Command will naturally investigate and handle the matter according to the law, as it is not within the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Bureau. As for the labor dispute, the bureau will immediately begin mediation.

Furthermore, the municipal government has strictly ordered the General Headquarters of the Defense Corps to thoroughly investigate the incident and instructed that the perpetrators be detained and sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for legal action.

Defense Headquarters Releases Account

According to a Central News Agency report, an unfortunate incident occurred at Zhabei Road the day before yesterday afternoon. According to a report by Wang Binyan, Commander of the Shanghai North District Corps, and after investigation by Nie Yuehan, staff officer of the General Headquarters, the cause of the incident was that around 2:00 PM the day before, mud workers went on strike. It happened that one worker was still working at the Public Safety Lane on Zhabei Road, and was seen by other striking workers, who went forward to stop him. Wan Guozhang, the acting head of the lane (and a member of the First Squad of the First Battalion of the Shanghai North District Defense Corps), discovered this and stepped forward to mediate, causing a misunderstanding. The workers broke the lane head's head, causing him to bleed profusely. Wan argued with them, and the entanglement reached the Public Safety Lane squad headquarters. Deputy Adjutant He Senkun of the District Corps was also on the scene and mediated from the side. As a result, workers from the Xinguang Underwear Factory lined up and persuaded the troublemaking workers, a Mr. Shen and Zhu Genlin, to return, which could have resolved the matter. Unexpectedly, around 4:00 PM, more than a thousand workers suddenly swarmed and surrounded the squad headquarters, demanding that Shen and Zhu be handed over. The Deputy Adjutant told them that they had already been persuaded to return to the Xinguang Factory, but they claimed not to believe it. They first destroyed the sentry box and doors and windows, creating a threatening atmosphere, shouting "Hand over your weapons!" "Charge in!" and "Open fire!". The guard, Han Wencheng, seeing the disparity in numbers, had no choice but to retreat inside the door. The crowd continued to roar and harass him. In self-defense, Han fired a warning shot into the air, but unexpectedly, as he pulled the trigger, a rioter jumped forward and was killed. The General Headquarters, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered the Special Task Force to work with the police and military police to maintain order and handle the aftermath. The General Headquarters has now submitted a detailed report on the incident to the Songhu Garrison Command for review and has ordered the squad to detain the involved corps member, Han Wencheng, pending further investigation.

[Our Report] The labor strike at the city's ten major department stores, including Wing On, Sincere, New World, and The Sun, has ended after mediation from various parties. It has been decided that the highest minimum wage for employees will be 60 yuan, calculated based on the cost of living index. The bloody conflict at Wing On will be resolved through legal channels. Thus, the labor strike that had been deadlocked for many days has come to an end. All companies resumed business yesterday morning.

[Our Report] There has been no progress in the Commercial Press labor strike case. The Shanghai management and board of directors of the press have telegraphed General Manager Wang Yunwu in Chongqing for instructions.

The labor dispute at the Shanghai Gas Company has been resolved after multiple mediations by the Social Affairs Bureau. An agreement was reached yesterday, with the following key points: (1) Full-time workers will work eight hours per day, with Saturday afternoons and Sundays off. (2) Wages will be paid as usual during holidays. Workers who work during holidays will be paid double their wages. Four days off will be given for the Lunar New Year; if working, the wages will be tripled. (3) Annual bonuses will be paid as stipulated by the government. (4) Wages will be paid on a 30-day basis, abolishing the 26-day system. (5) Employee savings will be paid as follows: employees who resign before 12 years of service will receive 5%; those who resign after 12 years of service will receive 7.5%; those who resign after 12 years of service and are over 50 years old will receive 10%. (6) Medical expenses for employee illnesses will be borne by the company. (7) Wages and subsidies will be adjusted according to the cost of living index issued by the municipal government.

### Garrison Command Announces Arrest of Qiu Changjiang and Others for Collaborating with the Enemy

Qiu Changjiang, Zhang Xuekui, Peng Shaogan, and other representatives of the British Tramway Company's employees, were reported by Cai Fengshan, Wang Helin, Gu Xiu, and ten others from the same company for searching for patriotic elements and conducting anti-British and anti-American activities on behalf of the enemy during the enemy's occupation. After receiving the report, the Garrison Command immediately arrested them and sent them to court. The following facts have been released by the Songhu Garrison Command: (1) Bai Wengui, an unemployed worker at the company, worked underground after Shanghai fell. Qiu and others repeatedly attempted to harm him but failed. After the victory, Bai was given a certificate of reinstatement. Bai Wengui asked the union to restore his position, and Qiu and others said, "What's the use of your underground work? You still have to come to us." (2) Qiu and others exerted the most effort in the anti-British and anti-American movement during the enemy's occupation. They also spoke up for the enemy to prevent underground activities, forced workers to register, and obtained worker rosters and fingerprints to prevent workers' underground activities. (3) During the enemy's occupation, Qiu and others assisted the enemy in searching for identification documents hidden by patriotic elements. Receipts for donations of winter clothes to soldiers at the front and a letter from Chairman Chiang to the national public found in the homes of company workers numbered 283 and 390 were searched and taken away, and they were threatened. (4) If unemployed workers requested the union to arrange employment, Qiu and others demanded tips, extorting 50,000 yuan from each person. (5) Zhu Yongye, Wu Shusheng, Zhu Baolong, Liu Xingshun, Jin Guoxiang, Jiang Hetong, Jin Dalin, Ji Zhihe, Wang Jianhua, Wang Yan, Zang Zhicheng, Wang Chang'an, Xu Jinyou, and others were all accomplices of Qiu and others, assisting them in collaborating with the enemy and committing all kinds of evils.

### Nicknamed "Hound," the Malice of a Japanese Military Policeman is Evident; Citizens Have Filed Over 300 Complaints; Over 100 Criminals Brought to Court for Interrogation

One thousand and eight Japanese military policemen imprisoned in the Japanese-Chinese Textile Factory prisoner-of-war camp in western Shanghai controlled the entire Shanghai intelligence work during the enemy's occupation of Shanghai, set up ten dens of evil, wantonly arrested innocent compatriots, and inflicted cruel torture, resulting in countless deaths. Their crimes are too numerous to count. After the 23rd Regiment of our military police took over the defense of Shanghai, they began to register the crimes of the Japanese military police. As of yesterday, they had received over 350 complaints from citizens, not including the victims of over a thousand martyred comrades from the Martyred Comrades Association and underground workers.

Scalding Legs with Corrosive Liquid

The crimes reported include: (1) murder, (2) torture, (3) rape, (4) wanton destruction of property, and (5) robbery. The criminals are mostly senior special police officers from the Japanese military police, especially Takahashi Beifu of the Northern Shanghai Branch and Takeda Sadamu of the Western Shanghai Branch, against whom there are even more complaints. Takahashi, nicknamed "Hound," is extremely vicious. Many arrested compatriots had their legs scalded with corrosive liquid, leaving them disabled. In addition, our military police regiment has found evidence of crimes committed by more than 100 Japanese military officers and soldiers. These 100-plus Japanese military officers and soldiers will be interrogated separately in the coming days by the military law officer of the military police regiment. The victims will also be summoned to court for identification and confrontation. Those whose crimes are confirmed after interrogation will be prosecuted by the military prosecutor and sent to the military court or high court, which will be established on the 15th, for trial and sentencing.

Japanese Military Police Prisoners Reorganized into Ten Squads

The 20th Military Police Regiment, which is responsible for managing the Japanese military police prisoners in the Shanghai area, has now reorganized the Japanese military police into ten squads, with the officers formed into a separate squad for easier control. They are: the Xinshijie Military Police Branch reorganized as the First Squad, the Western Shanghai Military Police as the Second Squad, the Waterway Yangshupu area Military Police as the Third Squad, the Northern Shanghai Branch as the Fourth Squad, the Railway Police (i.e., train protection unit) as the Fifth Squad, the Pudong Branch as the Sixth Squad, the Southern Shanghai Branch as the Seventh Squad, the Special High Command as the Eighth Squad, the Jiading Nanhui Branch as the Ninth Squad, and the Eastern Shanghai Branch as the Tenth Squad. It is hoped that citizens throughout the city will report the crimes of the Japanese military police to the regiment as soon as possible, so that the Japanese military police who acted lawlessly and committed all kinds of evil can be brought to justice without anyone escaping.

### Building a Navy is More Than Just Lamenting "Lack of Talent"; Comments from Deputy Director Zhou of the Naval Office: Need for Massive Capital and Self-reliance in Creating Heavy Industry, Dispatching Personnel for Training, and Receiving Vessels Donated by the UK and US

[Our Report] Zhou Xianzhang, Deputy Director of the Naval Office of the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 9th. Our reporter made a special visit yesterday afternoon, and Mr. Zhou spoke in detail about the situation of our country's navy. Regarding the reconstruction of the navy, although it is being actively carried out, the specific methods still need to be planned in the long term with naval advisors after the establishment of the US military advisory group to China. According to Mr. Zhou, building a navy is definitely not something that can be accomplished in three to five years. Not only should the construction of the navy itself be emphasized, but other equipment is also very important. For example, the construction of warships, ports, materials, and equipment should be developed equally. Furthermore, since new-style warships now use oil, and our country's oil production is extremely low, we still need to discover oil fields and establish oil factories. Problems such as these require massive capital and self-reliance in establishing heavy industry. And the lack of talent is the biggest difficulty. Although there is assistance from countries such as the UK and the US, with ships being donated, we cannot use them at all without talent. And relying on aid from other countries is not a long-term solution. Minister Chen Cheng is extremely concerned about cultivating naval talent and is determined to improve naval treatment and raise the standards of soldiers. Mr. Zhou expressed his hope that China could also imitate countries such as the UK and the US and hold a "Navy Week" every year, mooring warships in various ports for citizens to openly visit, arousing the interest of the general youth in the navy, and on the other hand, sailing warships to places where overseas Chinese reside, so that overseas Chinese can also engage in naval work.

A Small Number of Personnel Returning After Completing Studies

Naval training is divided into basic and practical work. Practical training is now being conducted at Qingniao, and in the future, it is planned to establish naval schools and company camps along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to implement basic training. There are currently about 1,000 naval personnel training in the United States and about 370 in the United Kingdom. Among them, a small number of personnel have completed their studies and returned home to work. The United States has donated eight warships to our country, now in Cuba. The largest of these is about 1,700 tons, including two destroyers, two torpedo boats, and four minesweepers. Several hundred ship reception personnel went to the United States last year, and after training is completed, they will sail the ships to China by the end of June of this year. The United Kingdom has also donated 13 warships to us, one of which will be sailed to China by trained personnel by the end of April. Training in the UK is done in batches, that is, after one ship's training is completed and handed over, another ship's training is started. The third batch of personnel to be trained recently arrived in the UK. The naval personnel training in Qingdao are supplied with landing craft by the US naval authorities, and are taught on a one-officer, one-teacher basis, creating specialized personnel. There is one class per month with 15 officers and 150 soldiers. Four classes have now been established, and the training period is determined by performance. After the training is completed, the landing craft will be handed over. The first class can be completed by the end of April.

Japanese Warships Received Severely Damaged

As for the Japanese warships received, repairs are now being stepped up, as the ships left by the defeated Japanese army are severely damaged, and most are unusable. Mr. Zhou said that the small ships being received should be repaired separately at the coastal ports, and should not all be concentrated in Shanghai, resulting in uneven distribution and prolonged time.

Jiangnan Shipyard to Be Expanded

The Jiangnan Shipyard will be expanded. The representatives who went to the UK for inspection have now returned to the country and will soon begin planning.

Mr. Zhou hosted a banquet in Shanghai for Captain Will, the US Navy officer in charge of training, asking him to do his best to assist in the training of Chinese naval personnel. Mr. Cheng returned to the United States on the 10th. Mr. Zhou also invited General Anastin, the captain of the British warship, to lunch yesterday to discuss everything. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Nanjing today.

### Miki Tsuyoshi, Who Abused American Soldiers in the Shenyang Concentration Camp, Tried for the First Time; Nine Counts of Crimes with Supporting Letters

Miki Tsuyoshi, the former administrator of the American military concentration camp near Shenyang, was tried for the first time yesterday in a US military court. After Japan's surrender, he hid with his wife in Hongkou, Shanghai, until his arrest this spring. The Shenyang concentration camp housed 1,200 American soldiers, including 200 American soldiers and sailors, some of whom died due to various influences.

Miki Tsuyoshi was brought into the courtroom by military police at 9:00 AM yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer presented nine counts of crimes and submitted several letters from American prisoners of war in the concentration camp as evidence, describing Miki Tsuyoshi's crimes. According to them, William Jones was a

very Iranian

person when he was detained in the concentration camp. The Japanese ordered him to do hard labor. One day, when William Jones finished working, he received fifteen packs of Chinese cigarettes from a northeastern Chinese man who sympathized with him. The Japanese soldiers found the cigarettes on his body and asked him where the cigarettes came from. Jones did not want to involve others and refused to reveal the name of the person who gave him the cigarettes. Miki Tsuyoshi continued to beat Jones with a stick for four hours to make him "tell the truth." He beat him again in the same way the next day. It was winter, and the temperature in Shenyang was below zero. Jones was

scantily clad

confined to a dark room with only a wool blanket to keep him warm. He suffered a serious illness due to the beatings and died in the hospital four days later from hunger and cold. Miki Tsuyoshi falsely claimed to the public that Jones died of pneumonia, but in reality, he died due to unbearable abuse. The letters of testimony described Miki Tsuyoshi's cruelty in detail. The court adjourned at 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, American medical officer Miller testified, explaining the causes and consequences of pneumonia. The defendant's lawyer wanted to prove that Jones died of pneumonia, while the plaintiff's lawyer wanted to explain that Jones' death was largely due to being beaten and catching a cold, which led to pneumonia. Therefore, Miki Tsuyoshi

cannot shirk responsibility

Secondly, there was a witness letter recounting the miserable conditions in the concentration camp and Miki Tsuyoshi's violent behavior of beating people at every turn, and listing the names of those who were abused. Miki Tsuyoshi sat silently in the defendant's seat. Although he was listening to the details of his crimes, he showed no shame. The case may be sentenced this Wednesday. The Doolittle Raid victim case may be delayed by a day or two because the witnesses have not yet arrived.

### The Highest Institution of Learning Standing on the Plateau of Xikang: National Xikang Institute of Technology [Part Two]

— Xiao Jin

Of course, a newly established school is always less perfect than one with a history, but thanks to Dr. Li's reputation and perseverance, everything was finally put in order and everything was on track.

Overall View of the Campus

The campus is located on Lushan Mountain, seven kilometers outside the city. Classrooms and dormitories are housed in temples on the mountain, facing the water, with a vast "Qionghai Lake" on the opposite side, a lake and swamp covering fifty or sixty kilometers around. According to local legends, Qionghai Lake was once a large city during the Han Dynasty, but it sank due to an earthquake. The surroundings of the lake are bare mountains. Xichang City is located at its southwest end. Near the mountain, the scenery is very elegant. Sometimes, a small boat drifts on the calm water surface, creating a detached atmosphere.

With such conditions, faculty, equipment, and environment, "Xikang Institute of Technology" seemed to be eligible to be converted into a university, because there was no university in Xikang. Therefore, in the summer of 1940, Dr. Li, unafraid of the long journey, went to Chongqing to negotiate with the authorities to convert it into a university, but to no avail. When he returned to the school, he sorrowfully reported the news of the failure to hundreds of young people with high hopes, and everything changed and everything was in decline.

Dr. Li Leaves the School

In 1941, Dr. Li left the school and resigned from the position of president. His successor was Dr. Zong Dahuan, who was also the dean of studies at Beiyang Institute of Technology and Xikang Institute of Technology. Although he was an experienced school administrator, under the circumstances at that time, he could only maintain the status quo. The professors who came with Dr. Li left with him, and he could only hire another group. In 1942, in the midst of difficulties, a six-year medical department was added. He planned to first establish the three departments of agriculture, medicine, and engineering, and then request the authorities to convert it into a university, but this effort was like clouds in the sky, lightly blown away to Utopia.

In the spring of 1943, Dr. Zhou fell ill in Chongqing, and the school affairs were jointly managed by the three directors of academic affairs, general affairs, and student affairs. At this time, the school had reached the end of its rope. Professors and students left the school in large numbers, and the life of the school was in grave danger, like a bird in a storm, which could be destroyed at any time.

New President Takes Office

In the spring of 1944, the fate of "Xikang Institute of Technology" seemed to have taken a turn for the better. The new president, Mr. Lei Zuowen (also an old general of Beiyang Institute of Technology, a metallurgist), arrived at the school. The students held a welcoming ceremony, pouring out their grievances like children who had lost their nanny. "Xikang Institute of Technology" was like a desolate garden, which now had a diligent and hardworking gardener.

As a result of two years of diligent cultivation, everything was on track. Flowers full of vitality and fruits that were firm and plump were presented to us. "Xikang Institute of Technology" was revived. Everyone in the school shouted such a sentence in their hearts.

However, the good news of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War finally spread to distant Xichang. After being away from home for eight years, who wouldn't want to return home to visit relatives? However, 70% of the teachers and students of "Xikang Institute of Technology" are from other provinces. This troubled the president and saddened the hearts of teachers and students from other provinces. Today, everyone is still waiting anxiously for the authorities' decision.

Xichang, this heavenly kingdom in the borderland, has abundant resources, beautiful scenery, and a warm climate, but it lacks culture, transportation, and, more importantly, strong law and order, and far-sighted policies. With the end of the war, "Xikang Institute of Technology" is in such an environment, and its future is not very optimistic. This autumn, busy with repatriation, the source of teachers and students is an even greater problem!

### Glimmers of Hope in the Shadows: Looking at the Northwest from Lanzhou

— Special Correspondent Bingzi of this Newspaper, Lanzhou, Sent on March 3rd

The ice bridge on the Yellow River has thawed, and the God of Spring has begun to descend on Lanzhou. After the Spring Festival, the prices in the Lanzhou market, which had suddenly risen sharply, have gradually fallen in recent days. Gold has fallen from 170,000 yuan per tael to 130,000 yuan. Rice has fallen from 46,000 yuan per picul to 40,000 yuan, and wheat has fallen from 22,000 yuan per picul to 17,000 yuan.

Looking at the Northwest from Lanzhou, we see a struggle for survival amidst turmoil and a quest for progress amidst stability. The future is a bright prospect, but the present is a dark and struggling plight.

A Recent View of Gansu

In fact, the prospects for Gansu are worth aspiring to. Although it does not have many heavy industrial raw materials, petroleum is its greatest treasure. Yumen Oil Mine is already famous throughout the country, and recently, large oil layers have been discovered near Lanzhou. It may become "China's oil depot" in the future.

After the Bao-Tian Railway, which historically extended into Gansu for the first time, was opened to traffic, the Tian-Lan Railway is also being expedited by the provincial government. Recently, all sectors in Xinjiang have been calling for the construction of the Gan-Xin Railway. In terms of highways, the Xi(an)-Lan Road, the Gan-Ning Road, the Gan-Qing Road, and the Gan-Xin Road all have or will serve their greatest purpose during the Anti-Japanese War and the future reconstruction period. In the future, when the Bao(tou)-Ning(xia) Railway is completed, and can be extended to Lanzhou, coupled with the opening of the Eurasian air transportation, Gansu will be, as former U.S. Vice President Wallace said, the center of world transportation. But at present, it is caught in a situation of disaster and the gradual depletion of talent.

The Lanzhou Survey Team of the National Hydropower Engineering General Office has departed for Sangyuan Gorge in the downstream Lanzhou County of the Yellow River to conduct a survey. The team originally planned to complete the survey in one year, but now that American engineer Sacvan will come to China this autumn, it has been decided to complete the hydropower survey by September.

The Lanzhou Daily, organized by the Gansu Branch of the Youth Corps, will be published on Youth Day. After the publication of this newspaper, there will be a total of four daily newspapers here.

Last year, the province had a poor harvest, and the disaster situation was serious. The urgent problems of spring plowing seeds and the people's food in the transition period are being taken seriously by all parties.

Industrial Struggles

After Chairman Gu Zhenglun went to Chongqing, he will strive at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to start the construction of the Da-Lan Railway this spring. The main purpose is to use the construction cost of 4 billion yuan to carry out the program of relief through labor.

After the victory, some technical personnel in Gansu successively participated in the repatriation work. As a result, Gansu's only industries were either stagnating or closing down. Even the Yumen Oil Mine has been greatly affected, and its oil production has been sharply reduced. In short, Gansu, whether it is people's livelihood industry or anything else, is struggling this year.

Ningxia and Qinghai

Under the governance of two famous Muslim generals, Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang, Ningxia and Qinghai have been good examples of seeking progress in stability for many years. Politically, there may be some places that are not "democratic" enough, but Ningxia's water conservancy, household registration, and land administration, and Qinghai's road construction and afforestation, have all been very successful. Qinghai can only be reached by the Gan-Qing Highway, and Ningxia can only be reached by the Ping(liang)-Ning, Ning-Sui(yuan) roads, and the Lan-Ning Road completed a few years ago. Due to the underdeveloped transportation, people from outside are unwilling to enter, and people from inside rarely come out. Therefore, we are willing to call out the slogans of "Transportation First" and "Talent First" on behalf of the two provinces of Ningxia and Qinghai.

Suiyuan After the Calamity

Suiyuan—the province that was famous for the Battle of Bailingmiao before the July 7th Incident—became famous again after the victory because it was besieged by the Communist army. Although Guihua and Baotou were relieved in December last year, the supply of food and coal has become the biggest problem in the province. Currently, it is the province with the highest cost of living in the country. Flour costs 500 yuan per catty, and coal costs 80 yuan per catty. If the Ping-Sui Railway can be unblocked in the future, Suiyuan's coal and iron—according to Japanese investigation reports, it ranks second in the country after the Northeast—will make the greatest contribution to the reconstruction of the country. Moreover, Suiyuan, west of the Yellow River where there are more benefits than harm, can provide a large number of immigrants. However, all of this requires the strength of the country to develop and organize.

An Overview of Xinjiang

The resources and importance of Xinjiang do not need to be explained by the reporter. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, Xinjiang has been in constant war. After 1932, Sheng Shicai used a policy of terror to rule Xinjiang for more than ten years, but after he left Xinjiang, the so-called "Ili Incident" broke out. Because of this incident, many of our national soldiers and officials and civilians in Xinjiang were sacrificed. Last winter, after Minister Zhang Zhizhong went to Xinjiang to mediate, this turmoil seemed to subside. Generally, people believed that there would never be any unfortunate incidents again, but recently there have still been rumors of "Kazakhs" causing new disturbances. The official has not confirmed what exactly is going on, and no one can figure it out.

Standing at the post of working in the Northwest, the reporter would like to call on the people of the country to pay attention to the Northwest again. After the independence of Outer Mongolia, the Northwest has become the front line of national defense. At the same time, not only the Northeast is our lifeline, but Xinjiang is also our lifeline. How to maintain or develop this lifeline requires more patriots from all over the country to come to the Northwest! (Sent on March 3rd)

### Returning from Taiwan

—Sent by Weiming

Reported by this newspaper on the 6th

Taiwan, which had been occupied for a long time, has returned to the embrace of the motherland after the enemy's surrender. This is China's glory and the Taiwanese compatriots' fortune. After 50 years of Japanese management, Taiwan has made significant achievements in agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, finance, education, industry, hospitals, and other areas, as far as the reporter has observed. However, the enemy's exploitation of the Taiwanese compatriots was too severe during peacetime, so the people's livelihood was very painful, and there was no freedom to speak of. This time, the government sent personnel to take over and liberate them, which was greatly welcomed by the Taiwanese compatriots. However, after being in Taiwan for several months, the reporter deeply felt that there were several crises lurking, and had to report them to the people of the country and urge the authorities to pay attention, so that they could be used as a lesson for future governance:

The Burden of Living Has Increased 30 Times Compared to Before

(1) Four months ago, when the reporter first set foot on the island, the price of rice was only one Taiwan dollar per catty. Now, it has risen to thirty Taiwan dollars per catty, which means that the people's burden of living has increased 30 times compared to before. Therefore, the factories in Taiwan, like those in the mainland, are having labor strikes every day, requesting wage increases. In order to统筹办理, the local government did not allow any factory to increase wages individually, which led to increasingly fierce disputes. Some workers even took the opportunity to beat Japanese factory managers to vent their old grievances. If these labor strikes are not quelled as soon as possible, they will not be good for the local area.

The Newly Assigned Supervisors Will Have Difficulty Seeing and Hearing Everything

(2) Before the takeover of Taiwan, there were 20,000 Japanese civil servants. This time, the Chinese government sent less than 2,000 civil servants to take over, including technical personnel. As a result, except for a few public utilities, such as the railway, which have been taken over, the remaining factories can only send supervisors (all management within the factories is still done by Japanese people). Often, one person has to supervise several factories (the most being one person supervising nine factories). A person's energy is limited, and their ears and eyes cannot see and hear everything. Think about whether this kind of supervision work is effective. Moreover, the Japanese, seeing that their local economy is gradually recovering, are all thinking of leaving Taiwan and returning to their country. How our country will take over various enterprises in Taiwan in the future is a serious problem.

Employees Complain About the Difficulty of Supporting Their Families

(3) It is said that the civil servants sent by the government to take over Taiwan can be paid 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per month for household expenses in the mainland. They can also receive 2,300 Taiwan dollars per month in Taiwan. Of these 2,300 Taiwan dollars, the government allows each person to exchange 1,000 yuan for 30,000 yuan in national currency (i.e., one Taiwan dollar for 30 yuan in national currency) to be sent home to subsidize household expenses. However, now each person in Taiwan needs at least 30 Taiwan dollars per meal. The mere 2,300 yuan is only enough to barely support one person's life in Taiwan. How can they save money to send home? Moreover, the 30,000 to 40,000 yuan in national currency mentioned above has just received a payment notice for January for each family member because the procedures of government agencies are cumbersome and slow.

There is a Severe Shortage of Talent, and the Remuneration Needs to be Increased

At this time of soaring prices, 30,000 to 40,000 yuan two months ago could still buy four or five piculs of rice in Shanghai, but now it can only buy one picul or a few dou of rice. Isn't this a big discount in disguise? No wonder a civil servant recently committed suicide out of grief because his family in the mainland could not make ends meet! Taiwan is in dire need of talent, and our government should encourage people to go there to serve. How to improve or increase their remuneration is an urgent matter that the authorities must pay close attention to.

### American Mechanical Engineering Students

The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University is the largest department in American universities. Students from all over the world flock there to study. The university is built on Manhattan Island, with a total of sixty-nine giant buildings, and most of New York City also spans this island. Columbia University was chartered by King George II of England and built in 1754, when the United States was still in the development stage of colonial status. Its scientific research and academic program standards are known to the world. Every year, 30,000 students attend lectures, and there are a total of 3,000 professors, instructors, and staff. During the war against Germany and Japan, the American Navy used its laboratories, classrooms, and dormitories to train thousands of naval technicians. Every few months, many naval officers graduated from Columbia University. Now that peace has arrived, Columbia University is preparing to expand its scope of teaching and make further progress.

### The Great Artery of Democratic Politics: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives

On the path towards political democratization, our government is currently meticulously formulating various concrete plans and schemes for implementing democracy. The selection of candidates for provincial, municipal, and county councilors has been gradually decided. The following information pertains to the operational practices of the House of Representatives, a major political institution of the United States of America, the world's only powerful democratic ally. It is provided for reference and is urgently being published. - Editor's Note.

Composed of Individuals from All Walks of Life, Lawyers Predominating

Tracing back to the founding of the United States, its initial Congress was composed of representatives from various professions, with lawyers consistently holding a majority. According to a survey by the American Political Science Association, it was announced that during the 78th Congress (1943-1945), out of 531 members of both houses (96 senators and 435 representatives), 309 had served as lawyers. In addition, there were 56 businessmen, 33 journalists or publishers, 23 educators, 16 agricultural experts, 1 broker, and 1 housewife.

The average age of senators was 59, while that of representatives was 51. The average age of American voters was 41. The average educational attainment of members of Congress was higher than that of the average American citizen. Women voters accounted for more than half of the adult voters in the United States, yet in the 78th Congress, women held only 1.5% of the seats.

Members Receive Meager Allowances, Free Postage

The Constitution stipulates that senators and representatives shall receive compensation. It was not until 1855 that members were allowed to receive meager allowances. In 1855, the annual salary for senators and representatives was $3,000. It increased to $5,000 in 1865, $7,500 in 1907, and $10,000 in 1925. The annual salary for the speakers of both houses and the president pro tempore of the Senate (the Vice President serves as the permanent chairman of the Senate, and when vacant, a senator is elected to fill the position) was $15,000. Travel allowances were calculated based on the round-trip mileage between the member's residence and Washington, D.C. The annual allowance for staff was $9,500, and the allowance for stationery was $300. In addition, members of Congress were entitled to free postage.

Each Represents 30,000 People, Number of Seats Increasing

The Constitution stipulates that the number of representatives in the House of Representatives should not exceed the principle of one representative for every 30,000 people; the population of each state is calculated according to the number of voters, plus four-fifths of the non-voting population.

In the first Congress, there were 65 representatives. For over a century, Congress has passed bills to adjust the number of seats after each census, increasing the basic number represented by each member. As a result, the number of states has increased (adding a total of 48 members), and the rapid population growth of each state has increased the number of representatives to 435. During the 1920 census, it was announced that the number of seats should be adjusted urgently, and the number of seats for eleven states should be reduced. However, until 1929, no new decision was made, so during this period, there were actually no new members added to the House of Representatives. In 1929, Congress passed a bill that stipulated that the number of representatives should be adjusted according to the population figures of each state based on the 1930 census, and the number of seats should be adjusted according to the census figures each time. The number of seats in the House remains at 435.

After the Speaker of the House is Sworn in at the Opening Session of Congress, Members Cannot be Removed from Office During their Term, Except in Cases of Death, Resignation, or Expulsion by a Two-Thirds Vote

Speaker's Powers Weakened, Elected by Majority Party

The Constitution states: "The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers." The Speaker and other officers are usually selected from the majority party in the House and decided by a vote at the first meeting. After the Speaker is sworn in, he also represents the body of representatives in taking the oath.

Actual circumstances and tradition make the Speaker extremely important in Congress. Although the "reforms" of 1910-1911 weakened the Speaker's powers, his importance remains undiminished. The Speaker convenes meetings, recognizes members' right to speak, cites meeting laws, signs bills passed by Congress, addresses, joint meeting sub-motions, and decrees, etc.

His personal power is still great, but in practice, important motions are sub-decided by the majority party. One complete opposite between the U.S. House of Representatives and the British House of Commons is that the Speaker of the House still frankly leans towards his own party, and his party is often the majority party in the House. However, he must be absolutely impartial. Although the Speaker retains the right to vote, he rarely uses it unless there is an impasse.

The "reforms" of 1910-1911 deprived the Speaker of the power to appoint any House committee and made him lose the power to serve as chairman of the important Rules Committee.

The opening procedures of the Senate are also stipulated in the Constitution. The procedures should be based on the existing regulations adopted in the early days of Congress and Jefferson's Rules of Order. Jefferson's Rules of Order were drafted by Vice President Jefferson during his tenure as Chairman of the Senate from 1797 to 1801. Many articles of these rules are now adopted by Congress. The congressional rules and regulations issued at the opening of each Congress include the Constitution, statutes, and Jefferson's Rules.

Various Committee Systems Perform New Tasks

The congressional committee system began during the presidency of Washington. This system was repeatedly expanded during the presidency of Jefferson (1801-1809). Both the Senate and the House have standing and special committees. U.S. President Wilson, the 27th president, said: "The Congress in the committee hearing room is the Congress performing its tasks."

After the expansion of the committee system, the number of standing committees of Congress increased to 61 in 1927, and was reduced to 47 after reorganization. Among the most important are: (1) the Ways and Means Committee (responsible for collecting national taxes); (2) the Appropriations Committee (responsible for national expenditures); (3) the Judiciary Committee; (4) the Banking and Currency Committee; (5) the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee; (6) the Rivers and Harbors Committee; (7) the Agriculture and Forestry Committee; (8) the Labor Committee; (9) the Military Affairs Committee; (10) the Naval Affairs Committee; (11) the Public Lands Committee; and (12) the Rules Committee.

Number of Members on Standing Committees Variable, Usually Twenty-One

The number of members on standing committees ranges from two to forty-three, but is usually twenty-one. Representatives can serve on three committees, but representatives working on important committees rarely serve on other committees.

Committee members are decided by the House according to a list provided by a selection committee composed of a majority party. The average number of members of the majority party is determined by the selection committee representing the majority party. In the 79th Congress, there were 243 Democratic representatives, 190 Republican representatives, and several representatives from other two minority parties (including at least 22 American Labor Party representatives, the same as another larger party).

The average number of Democratic and Republican members on each committee is 60% and 40%, respectively. The number of seats for other minority party members is also determined by the number of representatives from that party.

The chairman of each committee is usually appointed from among the majority party members. The chairman is selected from among the majority party members of the committee.

Each committee has a specific meeting place in the Capitol. Some important committees often have scheduled meeting times, mostly in the morning before Congress convenes at noon. Committees cannot hold meetings during congressional sessions. Committee members can conduct their own research on congressional recess bills, or special subcommittees can discuss them. Major special committees of the House in the 78th Congress included the Committee on Post-War Economic Policy and Planning; the Committee on Post-War Military Policy; the Committee on Un-American Activities; and the Committee on Small Business Wartime Plants.

Important subcommittees included: the Social Security Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee; and the Loss Subcommittee of the Army Department, Treasury Department, and Post Office Department Appropriation Bills of the Appropriations Committee.

Rules Committee Agenda Bears Special Mission

The Rules Committee has a special mission regarding congressional meeting procedures. From 1858 to 1911, the Speaker of the House was one of the committee's ex officio members. After 1911, the Speaker left the committee, and since then, the selection of committee members has been entirely selected by each party in the House, just like other committees. The number of members of the Rules Committee increased from five to ten, then to twelve, and finally to fourteen in 1937.

The power of the Rules Committee lies in its ability to determine the parliamentary procedures for discussing bills. It has the right to obtain seats and speak, which means that it can interrupt another member who is speaking during the debate and rise to speak. The majority party in the Rules Committee belongs to the majority party, so the committee also cooperates with the main committees of the majority party.

The majority party steering committee is usually composed of more than twenty representatives, who are selected by the majority party themselves. The committee selects the bills to be discussed from the congressional agenda and prepares actions favorable to its party. The congressional agenda is jointly determined by Congress and the Rules Committee. The importance of the chairman of the steering committee is second only to the Speaker of the House.

### Still Homeless: Looking Back at Gaoyou, the Road is Long and Winding

— Sent by Tao Tao

Our newspaper's Zhenjiang express news on the 8th:

Gaoyou, a classic-style city, is located in the middle section between Zhenjiang and Huaiyin. It possesses a considerable amount of tranquility and serenity, and even has a fairly prosperous marketplace. It has always been regarded as a land of fish and rice. The annual output, just in terms of the production from the lakes and fields, occupies an important figure among the counties north of the Yangtze River. Now, looking back, it truly is:

Unbearable to Recall the Past

Ten years ago, the grain ships docked on the surface of the Grand Canal would stretch for more than ten miles. They shuttled back and forth, and in terms of transportation, there were small steamships from Zhenjiang to Huaiyin on the upper river, single-engine boats from Baoying to Gaoyou, single-engine boats from Gaoyou to Yangzhou, single-engine boats from Zhenjiang to Gaoyou, and long-distance buses from Zhenjiang to Huaiyin, which could depart in the morning and arrive in the evening. On the lower river, there were small steamships that went directly to Xinghua and Taizhou or Dongtai. In short, it was a crossroads with convenient water and land transportation. Communication facilities included state-run telegraph and telephone services, as well as provincial long-distance telephone services. The city also had electric lights and telephone installations. The people were hardworking and loyal, enjoying a life that met their needs, and living a leisurely and peaceful life. In terms of culture, there were eight complete elementary schools, one experimental elementary school, and a county-run junior high school, as well as the provincial Jieshou Rural Teachers' College and several small local newspapers. Foreign newspapers, such as Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao, could be seen by the afternoon of the following day. Everything, in every way, was a prototype similar to Yangzhou and Zhenjiang. But good times don't last, and in the last ten years, it has been:

A Series of Unfortunate Nightmares

That was when the Japanese invaders moved from the Northeast War to Central China, from Shanghai to Nanjing, and finally descended upon Gaoyou, turning the entire county seat into bankruptcy. However, it soon changed its appearance, turning several streets that could not accommodate a single military vehicle into flat, wide roads that could accommodate two military vehicles side by side. Along with them came batches of national scum and traitors, with treacherous people in power and rampant rumors, creating a hell on earth, turning people who were minding their own business at home into victims of unexpected disasters. The likes of chairmen, county magistrates, and bureau chiefs were all people who relied on others for survival, only caring about their own peace and accumulation of wealth, and not caring about the grievances of the common people! They only knew that pleasing the Japanese chief was their sacred duty as chairmen, bureau chiefs, and county magistrates, and they did not care about the life and death of the people. However, in these ten years, there was a dividing line, that is, the extremely poor became rich, and the rich became poor. Comparatively, those with more skills naturally belonged to the merchants. Merchants were the darlings of the heavens during the period of occupation, with nothing being unfavorable. This was a gift of inflation. However, when:

The Victory Situation Unfolded

People were first afraid to openly spread the news. There was only private discussion in hushed tones, because the enemy was still stationed in the city. Although the overall situation was gone, it seemed like remnants still remained, and they explicitly posted notices to arrest those who spread rumors and caused trouble? Even though the 42nd puppet army division was reorganized into the 5th National Army Division, but these useless things, where could they exchange the clear matters of the nation? They only knew about transporting rice and levying donations. Speaking of transporting rice, private transportation was strictly prohibited, but the division headquarters could use small steamships to transport thousands of loads. As for donations, no store could offset the day's income with the day's donation amount. This was because buyers from the surrounding villages could not come, and three miles away from the city was the range of the Communist army. In this 34th year of the Republic, merchants lost money. On the one hand, they had to cope with massive donations, and on the other hand, prices after the victory were falling sharply. Although it did not lead to bankruptcy, they were exhausted. Similarly, since merchants felt pain, the common people did not need to be told. Especially in the scorching summer weather, after Wang Sunliangcheng of Jiangbei came to Gaoyou to inspect, he believed that the fortifications were not solid. On a whim, he ordered division commander Wang Hemin to:

Mobilize All the People in the City

The total number was about 50,000. From 5:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day, they had to build earth walls and dig ditches around all the temples and monasteries where troops were stationed. Each household had to send one person, making it difficult for the people to sleep and eat. If they were even slightly late, they would be whipped immediately. That kind of tragic and inhumane cruelty, even if King Zhou or Emperor Yang of Sui saw it, they would have to retreat and admit inferiority. The common people knew that this kind of defensive work was of no use, but no one dared to say anything. On the contrary, if you were accused of being in contact with the "New Fourth Army," there would be the danger of being beheaded at any time. Later, the town and village chiefs were all forced to flee. Those who could not escape sought death, causing an uproar in the city. Only then did a few gentry come out, risking their lives, to petition the division headquarters, which then changed to soldiers taking their place. However, those common people who had done the work all fell ill in the autumn, and they were all stubborn diseases. Because I couldn't afford the daily cost of hiring workers, I had a ten-year-old girl go to work for three days, and she suffered a severe illness that nearly killed her, which did not recover until the Communist army attacked the county seat. However, I was looking at this environment, and I had to jump out with tears in my eyes. Poor child! You also have democracy, and I also have democracy, and we lived such:

Strange Democratic Life

When the Communist army attacked the outskirts of Gaoyou, it was on the night of "How often do we see the moon above?". It truly did not take much effort to easily obtain it. Those costly earth walls and bunkers could be said to have no effect. Even from the perspective of the Communist army itself, it was said to not be an easy task, because the attacks on Xinghua and Yancheng took several days and nights to resolve. Moreover, there were not only three or four thousand puppet troops in Gaoyou city, but also more than a thousand Japanese soldiers. In addition, within these seven days, airplanes brought 400,000 rounds of ammunition. However, the facts were always the opposite of what most people thought. From the sound of the first bullet, it only took less than three hours to end the battle of Gaoyou County, with the entire army being wiped out, people and ghosts surrendering, and the division commander fleeing. The large batch of bullets sent by the plane were all given away because the numbers did not match. The casualties among the people were not as severe as during the occupation, but the burning of houses was unprecedented in Gaoyou. Now, let's talk about:

The Activities of the Communist Army Entering the City

The first action was to issue a notice to reassure the people, and then there were many more tricks. They held registrations for those who had served in the puppet army and self-renewal registrations for those who had worked in puppet organizations or schools. They used anti-Japanese currency, with one yuan equal to 5,000 puppet currency. Now it is said to have risen to 8,000 yuan. The rise and fall of the anti-Japanese currency is based on the rise and fall of prices, but this is not entirely true. When we first arrived in Gaoyou, the price of rice was only 400 yuan per dan, but now it has reached 700 yuan per dan. They held sham people's public trials, organized various guilds, and stipulated that stores could not close and employees could not be fired. However, the Communist army opened a large number of commercial venues. These commercial venues were all-encompassing in nature, ranging from oil, salt, cloth, paper, stationery, foreign and domestic goods, to arrowhead, eggs, and nothing was missing. Now even the water stoves have opened. I dare not say whether they are collecting taxes or not, but I only know that the first batch of troops to arrive in Gaoyou all had dialects from Zhejiang and Jiangnan, while the second batch were all from our neighboring counties of Xinghua, Dongtai, and Yanbei. The female political officers, mostly due to intellectual relations, were mostly from Jiangnan, and there were very few from the inland. As for the so-called "people's army," they were all genuine local products, and the number was impossible to estimate. There was also the so-called "Yangge dance." It is feared that all Communist soldiers understand this set of movements. It has now been promoted to penetrate deep into the civilian population, especially:

The General Young Women of the Surrounding Villages

It has become a compulsory course. Younger girls around the age of ten learn it, and older women in their thirties and forties learn to twist their butts and sway. But what about in the city? Although it has not been done yet, it has been listed as one of the regular sports in elementary schools. In the long run, this kind of drama can be spread widely. It has been almost two months since the Communist army entered the city, and the people do not seem to feel much pain. It is like a person who does not feel pain at the time after being cut with a knife, but only feels sad after the pain subsides. Therefore, when the appropriate time comes, they will all desperately flee abroad. The number of refugees stranded in the Yangzhou-Zhenjiang-Nanjing-Shanghai area is probably over 100,000. They have fled, but where do they find a place to settle? As of today, there are many people who feel that they have run out of money. Seeing that the general trend is like this, and there is no compassion from anyone, some people have launched a campaign to return home. The reason is simple and painful: it is better to die directly in one's hometown than to starve to death in a foreign land.

### American Young Students Learning Wireless Radio

Youth members of the "Victory Corps" in a public high school in a city in the western United States are learning wartime wireless radio. The U.S. Wartime Manpower Commission announced a plan in September 1942 to organize a high school victory team, allowing the 6.5 million students in American high schools to have the opportunity to prepare for war service. First World War aviator and aviation leader Rykkenbacko was appointed chairman of the team's National Policy Committee. The victory team was also sponsored by the U.S. Army Department, the Navy Department, and the Department of Commerce. The picture shows the situation when high school students in this country are practicing wireless radio. (Qin)

They were even taking property or arbitrarily vandalizing things. This kind of barbaric behavior is illegal. Yesterday, they jointly issued a notice to the public stating that if anyone is confirmed to be willingly collaborating with the enemy, acting as their henchman, disturbing the local area, or extorting people by taking advantage of their power, and is hiding in the countryside, any citizen can collect evidence and report it confidentially to the county government or the court.

### Please Improve the Method of Selling Items at Reduced Prices

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, prices have been rising frequently. Our authorities are reorganizing the Baojia system, and prices will continue to rise in the future. The people are suffering and crying out in agony. The authorities should request that items be distributed according to household registration to show fairness and avoid abuses, though they are adopting the method of selling items at reduced prices. Before distribution according to household registration, however, abuses are emerging in all kinds of ways.

Like in the past with selling salted fish, preserved meat, and sugar at reduced prices, when we go to buy them, we are often told that they are sold out. The people murmur complaints, but the authorities do not ask or listen, and no thorough investigation or punishment is carried out. While investigating pseudo-organizations is indeed a serious crime, the distribution aspect is still somewhat unsatisfactory to the people's livelihoods. If those with power take advantage of their positions to engage in corruption in the distribution of items such as cloth, matches, and soap, please punish them severely to appease the people, who are greatly blessed.

The method of selling coal at reduced prices recently is excellent. Each household must use their electricity bill as proof. In this way, one can both avoid middlemen from profiting without delivering real benefits and prevent stores from cheating in the process. The authorities can use the lower half of the electricity bill as a reference, and from now on, all sales at reduced prices will be handled this way to put an end to bad practices. Zhou Dingzhong

### One's Own Life

— Xiaoshan

Jones, a columnist for the Christian Proverb News, once chatted with President Roosevelt in Hyde Park. He asked Roosevelt, "Will you expect James Jr. (Roosevelt's eldest son) to be a great man, the same as you?" Roosevelt replied very seriously, "To use yourself as the standard for your children and grandchildren's future is a pride, and also a contempt."

This answer has only one meaning, that is, life is one's own!

In these years, we have seen books about "life" everywhere, such as "The Road of Life," "Life and Cultivation," "Secrets to Getting Along in the World," and "Life Experiences..." They are truly dazzling. Perhaps the writers of these books are all "veterans" who are experienced in the world, and their intentions may be very proper, and their contents may be very real, but the problem is whether these things can resonate with individual lives?

We must admit that life is "self" and "personal." The life experiences, successes, and cultivations of a certain person can never be used as a map. To think that because someone else has blazed a path in life, I can mechanically follow it as I advance along my own is a very big mistake.

Life should be creative, not imitative; life is pioneering, not following; life is even more "today," not canned, not ancient!

Kruglyakov was determined to be Gorky's "disciple." He devoted himself to learning Gorky's tone, studying Gorky's life background, and analyzing Gorky's central thoughts. But Gorky patted him on the shoulder and said, "Child, work hard in your own way! Imitating Gorky is a foolish thing."

Taking one's own life to make a model for others is a despicable pride; taking the lives of others as a copy for one's own is a terrible destruction. One's own future is always endless!

This is not calling on us to be conceited, high-minded people. It is rather saying that life has a "polytypic individuality." Roses and dog-roses are roughly the same, but you cannot make your dog-rose into someone else's rose. When you build your own life and create your own life, you will agree with Shelley's famous poem--"The Ant and the Fly"--and sing:

"I don't compare myself with you--fly--I have my own life!"

We say again that the highest achievement of those who use the lives of others as models is merely the tail end of life.

### The Growth of the Chinese Air Force

— Zhong Qi

The army of our nation has always surpassed the navy and air force. However, since experiencing this three-dimensional war, the navy and air force began to rise in prominence, especially the air force. It exerted unparalleled power and made indelible contributions to the history of the War of Resistance.

In 1932, the Chinese Air Force was born in an environment of extreme material shortages. The Central Aviation School was officially established in Hangzhou, which was the embryonic stage of our air force.

On the second day after the outbreak of the "August 13th" Battle of Shanghai (August 14, 1937), the air force, which had not been growing for long, bravely attacked enemy ships, inflicting significant blows on the stubborn enemy. This was truly something that the enemy and the people of Shanghai did not expect. In a short span of five years, the Chinese Air Force's position was solidified. August 14th was then designated as our nation's Air Force Memorial Day. This was the childhood of our nation's air force.

Later, we received assistance and aid from our Allied nations, forming a powerful elite force that exerted its maximum effectiveness in various defense battles, winning the sympathy of various countries. The United States, in particular, sent many air force personnel to help us in difficult circumstances, finally defeating the strong enemy and achieving final victory. This was the developmental period of our nation's air force.

During the War of Resistance, the Air Force Command was distributed in five locations: Chongqing, Guilin, Chengdu, Lanzhou, and Kunming. The largest tactical unit was a group of flying squadrons formed into a group, and each flying squadron included twelve aircraft, which in itself was a basic tactical unit. Therefore, the organization of our nation's air force was generally similar to that of other countries.

Now that the war has ended, we have also heard about the whereabouts of General Chennault. It is said that the Central Aviation School will be moved back to Hangzhou, and it is also heard that Chinese paratroopers have already performed in Kunming. We have great expectations for the future of the air force, and we hope that the Chinese Air Force will contribute to national defense in its adulthood, thus fulfilling the meaning of establishing the air force in our nation.

Education

### Rectifying School Discipline

— Xiyuan

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the material losses of the people of our nation are truly incalculable. And the spiritual damage is even more indescribable in words. Not to mention anything else, just in terms of the school discipline in education, it is already extremely heartbreaking. The school discipline here does not specifically refer to the good or bad discipline of students. It includes whether principals, teachers, students, and school workers are fulfilling their duties. There are numerous schools in Shanghai, and among them, there are indeed many that are well-run. However, there are also countless schools that use schools as a tool for profit, so-called "study shops." Principals engage in various forms of misconduct, such as over-enrolling students, exploiting teachers, speculating and hoarding goods, selling diplomas, and surrendering to the enemy. Teachers, under the pressure of life, teach extra classes everywhere, are late to class, or absent, and student papers are not graded or returned. Students, of course, are even worse. They write love letters, read novels, and talk about movies during class. The order in the classroom is worse than a tea house. Teachers who know how to handle things can barely manage to teach, but those who are rigid will simply kick you out. And what about the school workers? They are lazy and rude, and even demand tips from teachers and students. Otherwise, they will not report guests or forward phone calls. Such examples are too numerous to write down. In short, school discipline has plummeted.

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, all facilities are gradually returning to their original state. However, school discipline remains the same. The principal is still a school shop owner, the teachers still hold multiple jobs, the students still fool around all day, and the school workers are still the same. If this continues, how can schools be run well? Education is supposed to cultivate young people, but now it has become a way to harm them. Can we turn a blind eye to such bad school discipline? Can we not rectify it immediately?

In my opinion, first, I hope that the Ministry of Education will issue a clear order to revitalize school discipline and encourage integrity. Second, the Shanghai Education Bureau should have a war-like method to supervise each school. Third, it is necessary to screen whether the principals and teachers are qualified and whether they have lost their integrity. Fourth, inform each school to raise standards, teach strictly, and not hesitate to hold students back or expel them. Fifth, improve teachers' salaries and limit extra classes. Sixth, investigate students' academic records in detail and hold graduation exams. Seventh, vigorously promote teacher training. Eighth, compile and publish educational publications. The above eight items are the main matters for rectifying school discipline. If they can be implemented in order, then school discipline will definitely turn from decline to prosperity, from evil to good.

### Einstein on the Atomic Bomb

— Cong Jun

Since the United Nations defeated the two major aggressor leaders in the East and West, the future of the world has revealed a ray of brilliant light. All peace-loving people are grateful that the United Nations is based on the great spirit of moral mutual assistance and cooperation to seek world peace and human happiness. However, on the other hand, some people are extremely worried about the atomic bomb, which is called the "weapon of peace." Many people say that this atomic bomb achieved world peace, but in the future, world peace may be destroyed by it.

In fact, this is also unnecessary speculation. Is the trauma left by the war not enough to give us a serious lesson? I think that as long as everyone can trust each other and prioritize world peace, there will be no problem with the guarantee of peace. However, until now, the Soviet Union and the United States are still troubled and suspicious about the atomic bomb. According to a recent Washington telegram, the U.S. House of Representatives is about to consider a bill to prohibit foreign disclosure of information obtained from the upcoming atomic bomb bombing fleet test. The reason is to prevent the future security of the United States from being threatened. The Soviet Union requested that the "secret" of the atomic bomb be made public or that it be included in the control, naturally also for fear of being threatened.

In recent months, countless politicians and scientists have provided opinions on the atomic bomb. Recently, the world-renowned scientist, the inventor of the theory of relativity, Professor Albert Einstein, also published his views on the atomic bomb.

Einstein does not advocate keeping this secret forever. He said, "Keeping the secret of the atomic bomb is not the happiness of mankind's future. Reporting it to strong countries or managing it jointly by the United Nations are both solutions." Looking at Einstein's words, we can see that he strongly advocates establishing mutual trust between nations: "I believe that peace-loving countries in the world can draft a concrete peace plan that is acceptable to all countries in the world." His vision is indeed very broad. Peace cannot be guaranteed by shouting empty slogans, nor can it be guaranteed by a few people.

Einstein further explained the root cause of eliminating war from a psychological point of view, and his arguments are very pertinent: "If the countries in the world understand that their problems cannot be solved by war, they will compromise. If they think about the tragic consequences of war, then the cause of the war becomes insignificant."

The reason why some people are deeply worried and cannot help but fear that the atomic bomb, which ended this war of aggression, may become the demon of another war, is mainly because mankind has not been able to truly understand the true meaning of peace. At least some of them still believe that war can solve everything and gain everything. This is really wrong. Except for aggression, war is unnecessary, and aggression has a great practical lesson that is currently in front of us: Victory ultimately belongs to the side that adheres to justice. So why think about war again? You say it is to prevent war, but that is not something that can be achieved by this so-called "weapon of peace." If you defend against him and he defends against you, even if there is no war, confrontation and suspicion will arise first. As one member of the U.S. House of Representatives said, "Using war to resolve international disputes and conflicts has become a thing of the past. An eye for an eye will mean that mankind will never have peace." Yes, we should seek reasonable ways to resolve all international disputes and conflicts and never use retaliatory means. Now that the two major aggressors in the East and West have been disintegrated, it is time for all countries to jointly seek permanent peace. Everyone must establish confidence in peace--from self-confidence to mutual trust and common faith. Instead of worrying about the threat of war, why not first eliminate the root causes of war from a psychological point of view and remove the heart of suspicion?

The power of peace has increased and can converge into a main stream that prevents war. Whoever dares to risk the disapproval of the world, whoever dares to play with fire, will be submerged by the waves of peace.

In addition, I think there is one more point that should be recognized: The effectiveness of atomic energy should be universally applied to various aspects that improve human welfare. That is to say, scientists should carefully study how to apply the atomic bomb to all aspects of life related to humans, shift people's incorrect misunderstandings about atomic energy, and eliminate people's one-sided views on atomic energy, thinking that it is the only tool of war. I think that even the term "weapon of peace" should not be allowed to exist. Let's simply call the atomic bomb that was first and last used to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki the "God of Peace."

Remember the lessons of war, strengthen the power of peace, and we should cherish Einstein's proposition.

### One Should Not Fly High After Getting Air Injections

— Mi Weilang

Even though the weather was very bad, a retired sailor still flew at will. His oxygen mask did not seem to make him feel uncomfortable, but when he flew to an altitude of 16,000 feet, he suddenly started to sweat and his face turned green. So he quickly flew back to the airfield and went to the hospital for treatment, but unfortunately, he died 28 hours later.

It turned out that this poor victim did not tell the authorities of the airline that he had previously undergone artificial pneumothorax (commonly known as air injections) treatment at a tuberculosis sanatorium. His death was due to a law in physics: When atmospheric pressure decreases, the cavities in the lungs begin to expand, leading to fatal complications.

Dr. Tang, in the journal of aviation medicine, once said: Patients who have undergone artificial pneumothorax treatment should not fly; if they must fly, then they should not fly higher than 5,000 feet.

### Social Services: Replies to Readers

A Reader Asks About Mother's Illness:

Editor, please, for God's sake, disclose this letter. My mother fell ill last August. The symptoms are: her abdomen became hard and swollen, with daily, piercing pain like needles, her gums are also sore, food has no taste, bowel movements are difficult and require laxatives for slight relief. Our whole family is already in dire straits, how can we afford doctors and medicine? I hope you, sir, can introduce kind-hearted gentlemen and tell us what simple treatments are available, so my mother can escape her suffering. Your kindness would be like a rebirth. (A Reader)

Dr. Gu Yuqi Replies: Based on the symptoms described in the letter, it is likely a gastrointestinal illness. A detailed examination is necessary. You can go to the diagnosis and treatment department of Tongde Hospital at 67 Zhengyang Road every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday afternoon from 2 to 4 pm for a free examination and treatment.

Zheng Huiming Asks: My neighbor has a son surnamed Zhao, who has suffered from bedwetting for many years. He is now seventeen years old and has seen many doctors, but none have been effective. Please, sir, use a corner of your newspaper to ask kind-hearted doctors to provide a treatment method. Your kindness would be like a rebirth.

Dr. Gu Yuqi Replies: The Zhao boy has suffered from bedwetting for many years because of a weak constitution. He should take more blood-tonifying and body-strengthening agents and exercise.

Xu Zhongzhi Asks: I have returned from Chongqing specifically to bring my mother to Shanghai for treatment. Because I am unfamiliar with the place, I do not know the names or addresses of famous ophthalmologists. Therefore, I venture to ask you, sir: My mother lost her sight during the war, and her suffering is unbearable. In 1937, one day my mother was walking in the street when suddenly her left eye experienced extreme pain and became blurry. This continued for nine days and nights until she received treatment at Nanchang Hospital. The specialist ophthalmologist was German and was said to be quite famous. After the examination, he said the disease was called "cataracts," and there was too much fluid inside the pupil, requiring surgery to drain the fluid, otherwise the right eye would also be affected and lose its sight. After the surgery, it was not effective, and the left eye could no longer see the light of day, but it no longer felt pain. After three or four years, the right eye developed the same problem, with intermittent pain. Because there were no surgical facilities in the small place, only medicine was available. The medicine was very effective, called "Pilo Oorping," which dilates the pupils, can relieve pain, and makes vision clearer. But after using up this medicine, it was no longer available, so the vision in the eyes became more blurry. The only characteristic is that both eyes look the same as normal people, but they cannot see at all. Please introduce a famous ophthalmologist to seek treatment and restore her sight.

Dr. Gu Yuqi Replies: Based on the situation described in your letter, it is likely "cataracts." In theory, surgical treatment should have been applied at that time, which may have been promising. Now that so much time has passed and the optic nerve has atrophied, it may be difficult to restore sight. If you are willing, sir, you can ask an ophthalmologist to study it again.
