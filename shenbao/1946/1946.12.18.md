### The Review of the Draft Constitution Concludes: The National Assembly Reopens This Morning to Hear Reports from the Joint Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] Chairman Chiang, noting that the review of the draft constitution has reached a stage and that a general assembly will be held on the 18th with the goal of completing the constitution soon, once again invited Sun Ke, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Qun, Hong Lanyou, Lei Zhen, and others to dinner at 8 PM on the 17th. He inquired in detail about the progress of today's draft constitution review, and the meeting did not conclude until midnight.

[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] The tenth meeting of the Presidium of the National Assembly was held at 4 PM on the 17th, chaired by He Chengjun. First, Hong Lanyou, Hu Shi, and others reported on the discussions of the general meeting. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM. Then, Chen Cheng reported on the progress of the fourth general meeting. Finally, it was decided that the General Assembly would be held at 9 AM on the 18th, with He Chengjun as chairman. Each review committee will report on the results of its reviews. The fifth general meeting was held at 3 PM to continue discussions on: (1) the President of the Judicial Yuan, Grand Justices, the Control Yuan, and the issue of the power of consent; (2) the organization of the Examination Yuan and the power of consent of the Control Yuan; (3) the examination and assessment of public officials; (4) the power of consent and disciplinary powers of the Control Yuan; (5) the number of members of the Control Yuan; (6) the impeachment power of the Control Yuan over the President and Vice President of the Yuan; (7) changing the provincial and county system to a local system; (8) adding clauses on the autonomy system of the Mongolian and Tibetan regions; (9) adding clauses on the division of provinces and regions; (10) electoral regulations; (11) dividing the basic national policies into chapters; (12) adding a clause on marriage to the basic national policies; (13) stipulating that students must transcend party affiliations; (14) the definition of law; (15) the interpretation of the constitution; and (16) the establishment of procedures for the implementation of the constitution.

[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] Pu Ru and other Manchurian figures in Nanjing hosted a press conference at 3 PM on the 17th, appealing for attention and sympathy towards the Manchus. Pu first reported that in the 35 years since the founding of the Republic of China, Manchus scattered throughout the country have been subjected to shame and humiliation, and deeply feel discrimination and oppression. Their ancestral language is gradually disappearing, and their surnames and clans are often concealed. This unequal situation has become abnormal. Those who still live in tribes, propagating in the Northeast and Xinjiang according to their inherent customs and habits, are even more unable to share national rights and are treated as outcasts. He believes that since it is said to be a republic of five ethnicities, there should be no discrimination. The Manchu issue has been neglected for 35 years. It should not be neglected again in the constitution being drafted by the National Assembly. Just as the status of the Mongols, Tibetans, and even minority indigenous peoples can be enumerated in the constitution, the more than 30 million Manchus should also receive equal assistance. Since he could not attend the Joint Review Committee, he had to make this statement and express his views in writing. He will still raise the issue when the General Assembly reconvenes, hoping that this ethnic issue, which is so closely related to their own skin, can be reasonably resolved. Otherwise, this issue is like tinder waiting to be ignited, which will not benefit the country. Bi Tianmin, Tong Minchang of the Xibe tribe in Xinjiang, Cang Yunong of the Manchu population in Beijing, and Fu Zikai, and others then spoke, saying that the Qing Dynasty abdicated, it was not conquered. Since the founding of the Republic, they have endured humiliation and lived in unity, loyal to the country. In the past 35 years, there have been no incidents of rebellion. Puyi's puppet Manchukuo did not receive the support of the Manchus, but they still cannot enjoy the equal rights they deserve. As far as the National Assembly is concerned, there are representatives of industries and indigenous peoples, but there are no representatives of the Manchu people. In the process of drafting the constitution, few people have sympathy for the Manchus. They unanimously signed a request for support from all sectors for their simple request: "Striving for equality."

### The Power of the Judicial Yuan Debated Vigorously at the General Meeting: The Number of Legislators Re-referred for Reorganization

[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] The reorganization team of the Joint Review Committee held its first meeting at 10 AM on the 17th at the Presidium of the National Assembly. The conveners of the general meeting and the chief conveners of each review committee, Shao Lizi, Lin Bin, Kong Geng, Chen Qitian, Bai Chongxi, Jiang Yuntian, Wang Chonghui, Xu Hanzhuan, and over twenty others attended. Chairman Sun Ke presided, discussing the various cases referred by the general meeting. It took a long time, and the various opinions decided will be submitted to the general meeting to be held in the afternoon for discussion.

[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] The fourth meeting of the Joint Review Committee was held at 3:50 PM on the 17th in the first lounge of the National Assembly. News reporters were allowed to enter the venue to observe. One hundred and thirty-three representatives attended at the start of the meeting, with more arriving later, totaling one hundred and fifty-one. Chairman Chen Cheng announced the start of the meeting and then proceeded to the discussion according to the agenda. The first item was the organization of the National Assembly. Because the issue of ethnic minorities could not be resolved, it was sent to the reorganization team for discussion. The team revised Clause 26 as follows: "The National Assembly shall be organized by the following representatives: (1) Each county and city and its equivalent area shall elect one representative, but if the population reaches 500,000, one additional representative shall be elected for every additional 500,000 people. The definition of counties, cities, and equivalent areas shall be determined by law. (2) Mongolia shall elect four representatives from each league and one from each special banner. (3) Tibet shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law. (4) Various ethnic groups in border areas shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law. (5) Overseas Chinese citizens shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law. (6) Professional organizations shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law. (7) Women's organizations shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law." After the proposal was made, only Liu Zongping suggested deleting the character "each" from "each special banner" in the third clause as a textual modification. The rest were passed without objection. The second item was the issue of National Assembly representatives not holding official positions concurrently. The reorganization opinion for Clause 28 was: "National Assembly representatives shall be re-elected every six years. The term of each National Assembly representative shall last until the date of the opening of the next National Assembly." The twelve characters "National Assembly representatives shall not hold official positions concurrently" added by the first review group were deleted, and the opinion of the reorganization team was passed. The third item was the powers of the Legislative Yuan. The reorganization team revised Clause 62 as follows: "The Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body in the country, organized by legislators elected by the people, who exercise legislative power on behalf of the people." Someone suggested that "on behalf of the people" was unnecessary because the Legislative Yuan is an organ of governance, not an organ of political power, and cannot exercise governance on behalf of the people. Li Zhongxiang, Yin Shuxian, Chen Qitian, and others advocated maintaining the original proposal. When put to a vote, 108 people passed it by a majority, and only 33 people supported removing the four characters "on behalf of the people". The discussion then moved to Clause 63. The reorganization opinion only deleted the three characters "amnesty cases" from the original draft, and everyone passed it without objection. The fourth item was the number of legislators. The reorganization team revised Clause 65 as follows:

The total number of legislators shall not exceed 500,

Organized by the following legislators: (1) Those elected by each province and city, whose total number shall not exceed three-quarters of the total number of the entire Yuan. (2) Those elected by each league of Mongolia and Tibet. (3) Those elected by various ethnic groups in border areas. (4) Those elected by overseas Chinese citizens. (5) Those elected by professional organizations. The election of legislators, the distribution of the number of legislators, and the percentage of women that should be included shall be determined by law. Someone suggested that rigidly stipulating 500 people was unreasonable. Xinjiang representative Mai Huanxin and others suggested that the name of the Turkic people and their regions should be stipulated in the ethnic groups. There were still some opinions. The chairman immediately announced that it would be handed over to the reorganization team for further reorganization and then submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. The fifth item was the issue of countersigning the general promulgation of orders. The reorganization team intended to maintain the original draft, that is, Clause 38. Originally, there had been much debate during the third review, but no decision had been made. After the review by the reorganization team, it was believed that the original proposal should still be followed. Shi Shangkuan, the convener of the third group, stated that this case would be reserved for discussion at the General Assembly. The sixth item was the number of people required for reconsideration in the Legislative Yuan. The reorganization team's revised opinion for Clause 58 was: "The Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the following provisions: (1) The Executive Yuan has the responsibility to submit policy guidelines and policy reports to the Legislative Yuan. Legislators have the right to question the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan. (2) (3) Maintain the original draft." This clause was discussed for a long time, and several opinions were formed on the number of people required for reconsideration. One was a two-thirds attendance of legislators and a two-thirds passage of those present. One was a three-quarters attendance of legislators and a two-thirds passage of those present. One was a two-thirds attendance of legislators and a three-quarters passage of those present. At first, most people supported the first opinion. Representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party spoke. When the debate reached an impasse, Pan Gongzhan stood up and said: "A two-thirds attendance and a two-thirds passage is equivalent to four-ninths of all members, which is less than half, and cannot be established." As soon as these words were spoken, everyone applauded, expressing their support. After a vote, the second option was passed with the most support, that is, a three-quarters attendance of legislators and a two-thirds passage of those present. Secondly, Qing Gongzhan once said: "The executive power of the legislators should be the executive power of the Legislative Yuan because legislators must be within the Legislative Yuan to have executive power." The chairman announced that this principle would be handed over to the reorganization team for further discussion. The seventh item was the powers of the Judicial Yuan. The reorganization team's opinion for Clause 82 was revised to: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial body in the country, in charge of the adjudication of civil, criminal, and administrative lawsuits and the disciplinary action of public officials." There was much debate on this clause. The affiliation of the disciplinary power and the independence of the disciplinary power were discussed fiercely. Yu Jiaju and others all insisted on maintaining the original proposal. In the end, the reorganization team's opinion was passed with 77 votes in favor. The chairman announced that the unfinished issues would be discussed again at the fifth meeting on the 18th.

### National Assembly's Female Representatives Fight for Election Quotas

[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] The women's representatives of the National Assembly are extremely indignant that the provision that women should account for 20% of each election has been passed by the review committee, but has been rejected by the reorganization team. Today, all the women representatives signed their names and submitted their opinions to the Joint Committee for attention, and seem determined to make it happen.

### Marshall's Envoy Will Not Leave China During the National Assembly Session; Rumors of Orders to Abandon Sending Personnel to Yan'an

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 17th] According to reports, those around Special Envoy Marshall indicated that the envoy would not leave China, at least during the National Assembly session. The envoy is very interested in the National Assembly's discussion of the draft constitution. He paid a visit to Chairman Chiang last Sunday and had a long talk on the issue of the constitution. Also, Ambassador Stuart has once again inquired about the CCP's attitude towards resuming peace talks in the future. CCP spokesperson Wang Bingnan told him that the CCP's attitude has already been stated.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 17th] Reliable sources said tonight that the government has temporarily abandoned sending peace envoys to Yan'an due to changes in the situation. Unconfirmed reports said that Chairman Chiang had informed Marshall and Stuart of this decision two days ago.

### Hu Shi Praises the Kuomintang: Their Ability to Express and Withdraw is Highly Commendable; Zhu Jiahua Hopes to Enact the Political Consultative Conference Draft Constitution

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A portion of the National Assembly representatives held a social banquet at the Lixingshe on the evening of the 16th, with many attendees from academic, educational, and cultural circles. This was the first gathering of social figures and political scientists, and they openly expressed their opinions on the issue of constitution-making at the meeting. Hu Shi, Zhu Jiahua, Zhou Gengsheng, and Fu Sinian were invited to speak.

Hu Shi said first that he considered this experiment in democratic politics in China to be a great success. Some people say that the National Assembly has suffered the pain of fatigue bombing, but in fact, with so many people, several times more than the parliaments of the United States and France, the order is no worse than that of the parliaments of various countries. Before 1917 in the United States, there was a rule in the Senate's rules of procedure that discussions could not be terminated, which was true fatigue bombing. Hu Shi expressed his respect for the Kuomintang, saying that it is commendable that a party that has been in power for 20 years can fully demonstrate both the spirit of freedom and the effectiveness of discipline. Especially in the changes of the last two days, the ability of the Kuomintang to express and withdraw is even more commendable than discipline.

Zhu Jiahua said that constitution-making is a major plan for the century, but it must take into account the current political environment. The Political Consultative Conference draft constitution was formulated through long-term discussions by all parties, summarizing the opinions of all parties, and has its own historical value. He hopes that all parties will promote it and enable the General Assembly to successfully complete this historic task. The spirit of enhancing the basic rights of the people should be respected.

Zhou Gengsheng advocated including the article on complying with the United Nations Charter in the basic national policies according to the original draft. He said that China is one of the four major signatory countries of the United Nations Charter. China should have the determination to consolidate the United Nations organization and implement the United Nations Charter to show that China will fulfill its responsibility for world peace.

Finally, Fu Sinian and Luo Jialun expressed their opinions on education and border issues, respectively. Today happened to be the eve of Hu Shi's birthday, and the guests and hosts expressed their congratulations.

B. Ordinary telephone stations will designate times and provide the same preferential treatment as item A. C. The time for evening calls and news agency daytime calls will be negotiated separately.

(2) Regarding telegrams: A. If the license fee is not paid in cash, it will be guaranteed by a money shop or bank. B. Ordinary news telegrams will be sent in advance. C. The Ministry of Communications will be requested to study simplified code telegrams in conjunction with the Central Propaganda Department for use by newspapers across the country.

(3) Regarding airmail: Various air transport locations may use the book and small package method for mailing, but it still needs to be requested.

In addition, the airmail rate for newspapers between Nanjing and Shanghai is currently 3,120 yuan per kilogram, which will be reduced to 1,290 yuan per kilogram according to the book and small package method. In addition, Beijing-Hankou is 1,910 yuan, Beijing-Peiping is 3,670 yuan, and Beijing-Chongqing is 4,200 yuan, with air freight rates added.

The representatives also raised two points of hope: (1) A request to revise the telephone fee method, and temporarily pay at 50% of the current price before the new method is announced. (2) A request to revise the telegraph fee method, and temporarily pay at the original price before the new method is announced. Tao and others said that today's discussions focused on technical issues and promised to forward the above two points of hope from the press to the authorities of the Ministry of Communications. The talks ended at around 6:30 PM, and they will continue to discuss at the Ministry of Communications again on the 11th.

In order to try to reverse the decline, the Communist Army's "Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government" recently decided on a new strategy: (1) Persist in the Northern Jiangsu area, adopting the policy of counties not leaving counties, districts not leaving districts, and villages not leaving villages, and implement guerrilla warfare.

### The Tragic Scene After the Chongli County Robbery: Communist Soldiers Indiscriminately Slaughtered the People, Numbers Impossible to Tally; Corpses Piled in the Catholic Church, a Gruesome Mess of Blood and Flesh

[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 17th] As I, the reporter, pen this utterly tragic and unbelievable dispatch, I am filled with immense grief and call upon the nation to pay serious attention to this reality. For the Communist army is inflicting primitive and inhumane cruelty upon the people, creating a red terror that is starkly revealed in the Chongli massacre. Thousands of anti-Japanese Communist soldiers launched a massive attack on Chongli County, 50 kilometers from Zhangyuan. The defending troops of Shi Wangshan's unit and the civilians did their utmost to defend the city, but were ultimately overwhelmed due to the disparity in numbers, sacrificing themselves entirely. After the Communist army carried out planned killings and destruction, the regular army arrived and they fled in haste. On the 14th, the local authorities invited me and a group of 15 other reporters stationed in Zhangjiakou to travel by car to Chongli to observe the post-robbery scene. The number of people slaughtered by the Communist army is still impossible to tally, but of the original population of over 2,800 in the county town, less than half remain. Over 400 corpses have already been collected. I personally witnessed over 200 corpses piled up in one area of the Catholic Church courtyard, a gruesome mess of blood and flesh, with bodies and heads separated, all frozen stiff. It is said that before the Communist army executed the people, they first stripped them of their clothes. The methods of killing were a collection of the best of ancient and modern techniques, including nailing limbs to trees and disemboweling people, gutting them, tying several people together and stoning them to death, cutting off breasts and genitals, gouging out anuses, severing arms and legs, and most commonly, burning the genitals with fire and stabbing them to death with bayonets. Father Xu of the Catholic Church was crushed to death by rocks. Two foreign priests were attacked. Some civilians escaped from burning houses, but were thrown back in to be burned alive. Furthermore, over 200 captured soldiers and civilians were bound with lead wire and mowed down with machine guns. The狰狞 怪狀(zheng ning guai zhuang) facial expressions of the corpses showed the painful struggles before their deaths. Every household suffered casualties. The Zheng family had five members killed. Based on age, there were old men over 70 years old, and four or five recorded instances of war. As for occupations, there were Catholic personnel, priests, soldiers, farmers, workers, merchants, and women. The Xizi Catholic Church, with over a hundred years of history and magnificent scale, was the center of the Northwestern Diocese. The local people defended it for twelve hours, but were ultimately burned to death with the church. Only the orphanage remains intact, spared because the one hundred and eighty orphans knelt and begged for mercy. I witnessed many of the civilians who escaped returning with deranged nerves, alternating between crying and laughing, staggering through the streets, searching for the corpses of their family members. The foreign nuns cried at the sight of everyone. An eight-year-old child knelt before me and begged me to leave more soldiers to save them, their words deeply moving. The people's coal, food, and clothing were either taken away or destroyed. They are now only able to fill their bellies with horse corpses. The authorities have already begun emergency relief efforts. What crime have the people committed to suffer such abuse? We, on behalf of the dead, accuse this group of brutal and murderous cutthroats of filling the fields with corpses and appeal to the nation to help these survivors, demand that the government punish the perpetrators, and hope that Chinese and foreign reporters will come to witness this human tragedy.

### Sino-French Negotiations to Resume the Day After Tomorrow: Continuing Discussions on Implementing the Vietnam Agreement; Overseas Chinese in Hanoi Send Community Leaders Back to Report on Their Suffering

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Sino-French negotiations regarding the implementation of the Sino-French Vietnam Agreement were suspended for about a month due to changes in the French political situation. It has now been decided to resume them in Nanjing on the 20th. The French side will continue to be represented by the original delegation. In addition to the head of the delegation, Muhe, who has been staying here all along, the two members responsible for seaports, finance, and transportation, Fangdan and Gexiye, are also scheduled to arrive in Nanjing from Shanghai by train on the night of the 19th to participate. It is reported that the issues that remain to be resolved by both sides include: (1) the settlement of occupation army expenses, which were originally set at 60 million Vietnamese dong per month. However, the two sides have different opinions regarding the duration. Our side believes that it should be counted from the date of the handover of defense, while the French side argues that it should be paid according to the reduction in personnel since our army began to withdraw in March of this year. As for the food rice for the motorcades, the French side also believes that it is included in the military expenses, while our side believes that the devaluation of Vietnamese dong means that the expenses of the garrison are actually more than this, and proposes that it be calculated separately. (2) The evaluation of the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the issue of compensation for our losses in Vietnam. Regarding the former, the main issue is technical, namely the agreement on the depreciation standard of the railway and the current degree of damage. In the past few days, when the two sides contacted each other to resume negotiations, Muhe had already exchanged views in principle with our Ministry of Communications. Our side is expected to propose an evaluation plan and figures on the 20th. As for compensation, our side has also made a decision in principle on whether to use currency or factory equipment left by the Japanese, and may propose it together with the former case. (3) The cooperation on the Vietnamese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the establishment of a free port in Haiphong. The method of cooperation for the former remains to be discussed. For the latter, in order to facilitate transportation and simplify management, our side believes that it is necessary to delineate a free zone and establish a dedicated wharf. The French side, on the other hand, argues that the wharf should be public and that there is no need to set up a dedicated wharf separately. Our side's specific plan will also be proposed after the resumption of negotiations. According to the speculation of a certain authoritative person, it is hoped that the first two items and the first half of the third item can be successfully negotiated and resolved, while the free zone and dedicated wharf in Haiphong may still need to be resolved after an actual on-site survey.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 16th] The overseas Chinese here believe that the situation in northern Vietnam has not yet become clear and that conflicts may continue to occur in Hanoi and other places at any time. In order to establish a neutral zone for overseas Chinese as soon as possible, after discussions among 32 overseas Chinese organizations in the city, it was decided to send overseas Chinese leaders Yang Jianquan and Yan Renfu to Nanjing to report to the central government on the suffering of the overseas Chinese in the Haiphong-Lang Son conflict and to give their opinions on the establishment of a neutral zone. Yang Yan is scheduled to fly to Kunming and then to Nanjing on the 17th.

[French News Agency, Hanoi, 16th] It is widely rumored here that road traffic between Lang Son and Tianyan has been cut off by Vietnamese troops, but this has not yet been confirmed. The Tianyan area is located near Guangdong Province, where French troops had previously been stationed for several months. On the other hand, the situation in Nghệ An, which was originally very tense, has recently eased slightly after the French Commissioner for Tonkin negotiated with the government authorities of Duy Tan and requested protection for European expatriates in the city.

In June 1942, he went to England as Chief of Staff of the Second Army and participated in the landing battle of Oran (November 8, 1942). He was then appointed Assistant Chief of Staff of the Allied Headquarters on December 8, 1942, and soon promoted to Chief of Staff Representative, serving under Marshal Eisenhower. He was then transferred to the 19th Army Command in the European Theater. After the end of the European War, he was sent to Germany to take on important positions and returned to the United States in August 1945.

### Fujian-Xiamen Highway: Roadbed Repaired

[Our Newsletter] The Fujian-Xiamen Highway, which is 200 miles long, was an important transportation artery in Fujian Province before the war. It was completely destroyed in 1938. None of the 300 bridges along the highway were intact. Recently, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Ministry of Communications, and the Fujian Provincial Government have jointly started reconstruction work, with a budget of 300 million yuan. Half of the funds were allocated by the Ministry of Communications, and the UNRRA supplied the labor rations and road construction materials. Last week, UNRRA ships arrived in Fujian, carrying 750 tons of road construction materials and many engineers and technicians. The roadbed has now been repaired, and the remaining work is being accelerated. According to UNRRA foreign engineer Gu Lasi, the population is dense along the highway line, and the plague in southern Fujian this year is unprecedented. At present, malaria is prevalent, and nearly half of the residents are infected. However, inland transportation is blocked, and external medical relief is extremely difficult. The restoration of highway traffic is urgently needed.

### The Chinese Delegation to the United Nations Holds a Grand Banquet: General He Yingqin Says He Will Write an Article for Our Newspaper; Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Jie is Scheduled to Return Home on the 23rd with His Entourage

[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in New York, Mao Shuqing, 17th Exclusive] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations held a Christmas banquet at the Yangcheng Restaurant here tonight to entertain people from all walks of life. The invited guests included secretaries of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations, journalists, Chinese officials, and prominent members of the American Chinese community, such as General He Yingqin and Dr. Dong XianGuang, more than two hundred people in total. During the banquet, General He Yingqin told reporters: "I am one of the loyal overseas readers of the Shen Bao. Please convey my regards to the colleagues at your newspaper." He expressed great interest in winter hunting and praised the perfection of the American hunting management system. A week ago, He Yingqin, accompanied by Chinese Air Force General Mao Bangchu, went to Virginia for a hunting trip, staying for several days and hunting a male deer. He said: "Only one week of the year is allowed to hunt male deer in the forest, and female deer are not allowed to be hunted. The authorities keep statistics on all the pheasants, bustards, and eagles that are hunted. When the prescribed limit is exceeded, the entire forest is closed. Unless you go to the forest and hunt in person, you cannot know the details of the hunting rules. I would very much like to write an article for the Shen Bao, introducing the social conditions in the United States." The reporter replied that the Shen Bao would be happy to publish General He's work.

[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in New York, Mao Shuqing, 17th Exclusive] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations has completed its mission after two months of arduous work.

Other members of the delegation will return to their posts before Christmas. Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun will leave New York around the 20th.

### International Exchange Rate Issues: Difficult for the Monetary Fund to Stipulate

[French News Agency, London, 16th] Officials here expressed doubt about the possibility of launching a "International Monetary Fund Promotion Week" as reported by Washington. It is also said that there are many difficulties in how to stipulate the exchange rates of currencies between the member countries of the International Monetary Fund. In addition, the attitude of the Republican Party, the majority party in the US Congress, is another difficulty. The President of the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development resigned last week due to increasing difficulties in the future.

Loan to China Issue

[Reuters, London, 16th] London financial figures believe that it is "too early" or directly calls on China to not contribute its full allocation to the Bretton Woods institutions, regarding the news from New York that the US government will oppose the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development issuing any credit loans to China. Currently, China is the third largest contributing country in the fund, only decided on by the US and the UK, with an allocation of US$600 million. It is understood that China has already contributed Chinese currency equal to US$20 million. According to a New York report: "Senior authoritative figures" believe that a public speech by a US State Department official explains that allowing China to use its funds by the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the Fund should not be considered a risky move. Figures in New York and London once believed that the situation in China may prevent China from enjoying all the rights of a member country of the International Monetary Fund at some point. However, financial figures in London point out: Whether China is considered a risky target of the Fund should be decided by the staff of the Fund, not solely by the United States. The view that China will not be able to obtain credit loans from the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development has also surprised figures in New York. The report also stated: Because 80 percent of China's expenditures are used for military purposes, the currency fund's credit may automatically prevent China from requesting loans from the fund to make up for its balance of payments. The report continued: The directors of the Monetary Fund recently admitted the US government's interpretation of this article, stating that using the currency fund's funds to finance extensive military system plans should be prohibited. Whether the aforementioned US policy's explanation is　　　　　, it still needs to be proven by the final decision of whether the United States will allow an Export-Import Bank US$500 million loan to China.

### Corruption Case at the Guiyang Auto Factory: Huang Jingchang Sent to Kunming for Trial

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Bai Yusheng, Commander of the Fourth Supply District of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, told reporters that the unit had recently uncovered a major corruption case.

After being discovered, the officer was escorted to the military law office in Kunming for trial. It is said that Huang Jingchang was a student in Germany and had worked in the National Resources Commission and other agencies. He was very capable and had a good reputation in the engineering field.

### Siamese Ambassador Arrives in Nanjing for Talks: Mission to China is to Eliminate Misunderstandings Between China and Siam; Unfortunate Incidents Between Overseas Chinese and Siamese Have Decreased

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Dula Leek, the first Siamese Ambassador to China, and his party arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 4:40 p.m. on the 17th. Dula said that his mission to China was to eliminate misunderstandings between China and Siam and to promote diplomatic relations between the two countries. He also said that he was of purely Chinese descent and would strive to complete this important task. He told reporters at the hotel: Unfortunate incidents between overseas Chinese and Siamese in Siam have recently been decreasing, and even if they occur, they are not as serious as reported outside. This time, the Thai ambassador will try to resolve misunderstandings as much as possible. Regarding the establishment of consulates in China, I will recommend to the government that consulates be established in Shantou, Haikou, Shanghai, and Nanjing. The consulate general will be established in Nanjing. Regarding the prospects for Sino-Siamese trade, Dula said: "Siam's current imports and exports are still restricted by the Anglo-Siamese Agreement. Once exports recover in the future, Siamese rice, tin, and rubber can all be shipped to China." He continued: "The restrictions on overseas Chinese education in Siam are only in primary schools because the government stipulates that primary schools are run by the government." When asked about the truth of reports that the Siamese government restricts overseas Chinese schools and forces overseas Chinese schools to teach Siamese, Dula replied: "I am afraid it is a misunderstanding caused by the Siamese government's desire to inspect textbooks, which takes time to translate between Chinese and Siamese."

### Allied Authorities Revise List of Japanese Factory Reparations

### Japanese Synthetic Gasoline Plant to be Included in Reparations Scope

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] Regarding the rumor that a synthetic gasoline plant is listed among the Japanese reparations factories and may be dismantled and relocated to Taiwan, the National Resources Commission believes that if the synthetic gasoline plant is converted into a fertilizer manufacturing plant, it will not require much funding. When Qian Changzhao recently answered an inquiry from a Central News Agency reporter, he said: The dispute at the US headquarters in Tokyo is to preserve Japanese fertilizer plants to prevent them from being dismantled, so as not to affect Japanese food supply. It is said that a part of the synthetic gasoline plant has been converted into a fertilizer plant by the US headquarters awarding Japan. Now it is learned that a synthetic gasoline plant has been privately converted into a fertilizer plant by the Japanese, but it has not yet been completed. It is now planned to negotiate to include the plant in the scope of reparations.

### Nanjing Police Bureau Recommends Implementing Public Prostitution System; Draft Proposal to be Submitted for Approval

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Fuzimiao and Daxiao Shibatang area of Nanjing, located on the banks of the Qinhuai River, has long been a gathering place for singers and prostitutes due to the legacy of the Six Dynasties' extravagance. Although the police bureau has repeatedly cracked down on it, the malpractices have become greater and greater. There are even cases of criminals hiding for fear of being caught and punished. Now, in order to rectify public morals and facilitate the maintenance of public security, the police bureau of the district has drafted a "Preliminary Proposal for the Restoration of Public Prostitution" and submitted it to the department for review and decision. The steps and measures in the "Preliminary Proposal" are recorded as follows: (A) Steps: (1) Investigation and registration (according to the bureau's investigation, there are 400 private prostitutes in the Southern District), (2) Issuance of business licenses, (3) Delineation of business areas -- concentrated in the Daxiao Shibatang area, (4) Regulations on the identification of brothel households, (5) Prohibition of singers from staying overnight with customers; (6) Establishment of women's factories to accommodate prostitutes who change careers or unemployed women. (B) Measures: (1) Hygiene inspection issues -- designated doctors will be required to conduct mandatory inspections twice a month, and clients will also be inspected to prevent venereal diseases, (2) Prostitute identification issues -- stipulate uniforms and wear badges; (3) Prostitute protection issues -- those who wish to be of good character, are beaten by madams, are several months pregnant, or have not been full three months after childbirth will be given legal protection. The distribution of business income between prostitutes and madams will also be legally stipulated to avoid damage to the interests of prostitutes, (4) Public security and public morals issues -- clients must purchase tickets at the price to prevent criminals and deserters from mixing in the incident; (5) Tax issues -- the tax amount standards are stipulated according to the prostitute level and business conditions. 40% is remitted to the municipal government, and 60% is for police expenses.

[Another Dispatch] According to informal statistics, there are about 15,000 secret prostitutes in Nanjing, 400 of whom have been identified in the Southern District, and 2,211 singers have been registered. The authorities, in view of the fact that nine out of ten singers also engage in prostitution, are planning to increase their remuneration in order to stabilize their lives.

### Purpose of Transporting Industrial Equipment from Northeast China: Soviet Union Intentionally Plunges Us into Difficulty - Commentary from the Washington Star

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The Washington Star stated in an editorial today: The Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from Northeast China and its transport back to the Kremlin is a strategic gambit, but it will inevitably provoke resentment from the United States and other countries. The editorial stated: This move will not be considered dignified, and it is believed that the Soviet Union, when looting the Northeast, must have had its long-term strategic goals in mind. The purpose of the Soviet Union's plan to seize spoils of war is to permanently plunge China into a state of weakness and difficulty, and it is by no means to support the Soviet economy.

Editorial

### The Achievements of the United Nations General Assembly

The United Nations General Assembly closed on the 16th. During the past 54 days of meetings, many important issues were discussed. Although the representatives of various countries argued fiercely, and the waves of success lake rose and fell, the atmosphere was generally harmonious, and the achievements of the meeting far exceeded those of any international conference since the end of World War II. British Foreign Secretary Bevin said: "The sun of peace is rising." Assembly President Spaak said in his closing remarks: "When you return to your countries, you will be able to convey a message full of confidence and hope to your governments and people." Gu Weijun, the chief representative of our country, also said: "All resolutions are very important, very progressive, and contain a spirit of freedom. They will surely promote unprecedented cooperation and bring great light to the future happiness of mankind."

To achieve world peace, we must first prevent the arms race among countries that poses the greatest threat to peace. The greatest achievement of this United Nations General Assembly is undoubtedly the passage of the resolution on universal disarmament. This proposal was formally put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on October 29th, and the United States immediately expressed its agreement and further proposed the establishment of a regulatory agency. Finally, a principle was adopted to hand over the discussion of the method to the Security Council. In principle, disarmament includes any weapons of any country, and the regulatory agency is completely independent and not subject to the restrictions of the veto power. This means that the Soviet Union does not insist on retaining the veto power, is willing to report and reduce domestic and foreign troops, and the United States can hand over the secrets of the atomic bomb for international co-management. This is the greatest expression of mutual concessions between the United States and the Soviet Union. If the Security Council can come up with appropriate measures and this principle can be implemented, the crisis of a third world war seems to be fundamentally eliminated.

The second greatest achievement of the United Nations General Assembly is that a solution has been found to the Spanish question. In the past, the Franco regime in Spain was opposed by many countries in the world, and the Soviet Union's criticism was particularly fierce, but Britain strongly supported it. The main reasons: (1) The commercial relationship between Britain and Spain accounts for a large number of British exports. (2) As Soviet power spread westward, Britain wanted to use the Franco regime to strengthen its defense against the Soviet Union. (3) International intervention may re-ignite the Spanish civil war and cause the European situation to become chaotic again. Due to the above reasons, Britain opposed any actions to sanction the Spanish government, and the United States was unwilling to take active action against the Spanish government due to its confrontation with the Soviet Union. However, at this United Nations General Assembly, both Britain and the United States made concessions and passed a resolution to recall Spanish envoys. Although the methods of economic severance and military sanctions were not passed, recalling envoys is at least a manifestation of justice. Moreover, military sanctions will inevitably arouse the resentment of the majority of the Spanish people, and economic severance will also cut off the livelihood of the Spanish people, which may not be the most appropriate method at present.

In addition, there are two important issues that have not been satisfactorily resolved. The first is to limit the veto power of the five powers, and the second is the trusteeship plan for the colonies of former enemy countries. The veto power of the five powers is enshrined in the United Nations Charter, and the Soviet Union believes that it is the foundation for the establishment of the United Nations, opposing any proposals to abolish or restrict it. Many small countries advocate abolishing it, and the United States and Britain agree to restrict it, but no concrete agreement has been reached. However, arbitrarily amending the United Nations Charter can easily shake the dignity of the Charter itself and increase Soviet fear, and the fact that the disarmament resolution is not subject to the restrictions of the veto power already shows the Soviet Union's concession on this issue.

Regarding the colonial trusteeship issue, many countries have advocated that the United Nations Trusteeship Committee directly handle it, but the United States and Britain are unwilling to fully accept it. However, regarding the Pacific islands, US President Truman did not adopt the requests of the Department of the Army and Navy to annex them, but only hoped that the United Nations Trusteeship Committee would entrust the United States with sole trusteeship, which still shows considerable respect for the United Nations organization. As for the proposal by South African Prime Minister Smuts to ask the United Nations General Assembly to allow the annexation of South West Africa, it has been rejected by the majority of the General Assembly.

In summary, the achievements of this United Nations General Assembly are already quite considerable. At the same time, the harmonious atmosphere of the United Nations General Assembly is more concretely manifested in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The most complex issues of the five defeated countries, such as the co-management of Trieste, the opening of the Danube River, and the reparations of the defeated countries, have all been agreed upon, and the peace with Germany has already begun to be discussed. The next Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference will not be difficult to solve completely. According to recent news reports from various countries, the transformation of Soviet policy is unanimously praised as the main reason for the success of the United Nations General Assembly. What is particularly gratifying is that the Chinese delegation adopted an impartial attitude in this United Nations General Assembly, taking care of the interests of all parties, striving to seek compromises, and seeking to solve practical problems, which has won the praise of various countries and invisibly improved China's international status. The Chinese delegation has also made a considerable contribution to the achievements of this United Nations General Assembly.

### Public Prosecution Filed Against Traitor Yan Bailiang

Traitor Zhu Han and Li Song Sentenced

[This newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, 17th] Yan Bailiang, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, served as a specialist in land registration in Jiaxing and Wuxing, Zhejiang before the war. Because he compiled many volumes of maps of the area along the Zhejiang River, Yan Bailiang actually offered all the maps to the Japanese invaders after the August 13th Incident, willingly betraying the country and receiving generous rewards. In the 28th year, he used the pseudonym Yichang to found the pseudo-China Commercial Center in Shanghai, advocating a policy of enslavement. In the 29th year, he transferred to the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Secretary of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Tax Bureau, committing many evils during his tenure in various pseudo-positions. Later, he was reported to the Jiangsu Higher Procuratorate, and after repeated detentions, the prosecutor found that the crimes were true and filed six lawsuits on the 17th.

[This newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, 17th] Zhu Han, the pseudo-county magistrate of Taixing, Subei, and Li Song, the pseudo-secretary, were tried and sentenced by the Jiangsu Higher Court on the 17th. Zhu Han was sentenced to 12 years in prison, and Li Songhou was sentenced to 6 years in prison.

### Changshu Security Conference: Large-Scale Suppression of Banditry

[This newspaper's dispatch from Changshu] Since the attack on Guli Town by bandits, the security situation in the rural areas here has become unstable again. Recently, scattered bandits have become increasingly active. In view of this, the military, government, health, and police agencies held a security conference at the headquarters of the garrison brigade on the 16th to discuss steps for a large-scale suppression of banditry and plan the direction of the operation. The security brigade headquarters has transferred a portion of its officers and soldiers stationed in the Shazhou area back to the city to consolidate defenses and concentrate mobile forces. They will depart to various areas in the next few days to conduct patrols and sweeps in order to wipe out the bandits in one fell swoop.

### Director of the陆军 University Research Institute, Xu Yanmou, Arrives in Suzhou

[This newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, 17th] Lieutenant General Xu Yanmou, Director of the Research Institute of the Army University, arrived in Suzhou today to participate in a joint public banquet held by five military agencies stationed in Suzhou, including the Youth Army Artillery Regiment, the Automobile Training Regiment, and the Regiment Management District Command. The invitees included local military and government leaders, party and regiment representatives, and members of the press, totaling more than 60 people. Xu was one of the most eye-catching guests. All of the generals above the rank of colonel at the banquet were his students. The reporter of this newspaper, with the introduction of Major General Cao Yongxiang, had a very pleasant conversation with this famous strategist. At the end of the banquet, Xu stood up and gave a speech amid applause from the entire audience, the gist of which was that the weak civilian customs of Jiangnan would not be enough to adapt to today's world competition. Suzhou is the leading county in Jiangnan and should take the lead in changing the weak civilian customs. Therefore, he hoped that the military agencies stationed in Suzhou would establish close ties with the local administrative agencies and incorporate the organizational spirit of the army into the civilian population in order to eliminate the need for soft habits and cultivate a strong will, which would guarantee local security on a small scale and defend the country against insults on a large scale. According to reports, Xu will take a short rest in Suzhou and then return to his hometown of Kunshan before returning to Nanjing in a few days.

### Hangzhou City Councilors Suggest: Open Female Military Service, Lift Dance Ban, Establish Public Prostitution

[This newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou, 17th] The Hangzhou City Council held its third general meeting on the 16th and listened to reports from various departments of the municipal government. Because Hangzhou's food supply is only enough for two months, councilors expressed great concern about how to solve the spring famine. The person in charge said that based on past experience, they have already planned to prevent it. A councilor proposed that in order to implement gender equality, women should also be required to serve in the military and perform labor service.

[This newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou] Hangzhou City Councilor Qian Jingxi submitted two proposals to the City Council on the 16th. One was to lift the dance ban, on the grounds that Hangzhou is an international garden city and must have dance hall facilities. Past public opinion criticisms were nothing more than management technical issues, which can be improved. After the dance ban is lifted, the city can prosper, and the city's tax revenue can also be increased. The second was to establish public prostitution, on the grounds that the government cannot provide a way out for private prostitutes and must consider their survival. Arresting and fining them only increases disturbances and does not help in practice. Therefore, the establishment of public prostitution can facilitate management, and sexually transmitted diseases that endanger national health can often be reduced.

### Suzhou Tax Collection: The Shortfall is Still Huge

[This newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, 17th] The provincial government has ordered that the work of collecting in-kind taxes in this county must be completed by December 15th and all payments must be submitted. The deadline has already passed. The reporter of this newspaper visited Chen Chun, the deputy director of the County Land Tax Office, on the 17th to inquire about the situation. He was told that as of the 15th, 6,218 shi of in-kind taxes, 2,072 shi of requisitioned taxes, 1,865 shi of public grain, and 1,015 shi of grain called "Cheng Gu" have been collected, totaling 11,170 shi, which is far from the quota of 360,000 shi. Fortunately, the provincial government has issued an order to extend the deadline by half a month. However, overdue penalties will be added during the extended period, and the major office will intensify its efforts to collect taxes in order to meet the needs of all parties.

### Wang Maogong to Nanjing

[This newspaper's dispatch from Zhenjiang, 17th] Wang Maogong returned to Zhenjiang from Huaiyin on the afternoon of the 16th to preside over the provincial government's routine meeting and arrange the county magistrate examination before going to Nanjing.

### Chairman Chiang Again Orders Jiangsu Province: Military Grain Must Be Collected on Time

[This newspaper's dispatch from Zhenjiang, 17th] It is reported that Chairman Chiang again issued a hand order to the provincial government on the 15th, stating that the military grain to be paid by Jiangsu Province must be collected by the end of this year and no further delays will be allowed.

### Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie Encounters Danger During Inspection Tour: Ship Damaged and Adrift at Sea Overnight

[This newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou, 17th] The Zhejiang Chairman arrived in Huangyan on the 13th, went to Taizhou at 9:00 p.m., returned to Haimen from Taizhou on the night of the 15th, reached Xiaoxiong via Taozhu on the 16th, and stayed in Jiantiao on the 17th. He will arrive in Sanmen on the 18th. He is inspecting the political situation along the way, diligently seeking out the people's plight, and providing guidance and encouragement to his subordinates at any time. When he was 30 li away from Wenzhou in Haimen, the ship he was on was damaged and drifted for one night, experiencing all kinds of dangers. Fortunately, he encountered the Xinruian, a sea liner, the next day, and was towed back to Wenzhou, which relieved the danger. However, he still persevered and continued his difficult journey to inspect the counties of Wen and Tai. He will return to Hangzhou at the end of the year.

### Another One Using High-Interest Loans as Bait: Bath Attendant Swindles 80 Million

[This newspaper's dispatch from Wuxi] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, prices were slightly more balanced, so the trend of hoarding greatly decreased. Therefore, women and ordinary merchants with some savings all rose up to "join societies" and "split exchange," and there was a trend of "bidding societies." However, these are all disguised high-interest loans, so those who are overwhelmed by this oppression and cannot make ends meet, resulting in bankruptcy or escape, are heard of every day. Dai Chunshan, a bath attendant leader at the Sanquan Pool Bathhouse outside Ximen, took the opportunity of bidding societies and splitting exchanges to lure more than 100 women, old maids, and small bosses, totaling more than 80 million yuan, and absconded with the money. This is truly shocking.

Limping Cart Puller

Chunshan is from Gaoyou, 31 years old this year. He joined the military in his early years and was shot in the left leg during the war. After treatment, he became lame and walked abnormally. After retiring from the army, he changed his career. He first rubbed backs in a bathhouse in Zhenjiang and then opened a bathhouse in Yixing. Later, because the business was not good, he came to Wuxi from northern Jiangsu with his wife, Aju, last summer and lived in the workshop of the Jinji Silk Factory in Youche Lane outside Ximen. At that time, life was very difficult. Dai went out to pull a cart, and Aju also sold sesame cakes and fried dough sticks to maintain the family's livelihood. Later, because his lame leg made it difficult for him to walk, he changed his career to become a cobbler.

Excellent Credit

Until the 23rd day of the first month of this year, he was introduced to the Sanquan Bathhouse near Dexin Bridge to rub backs. Because he was diligent and thrifty, he gained the trust of the boss. In April, because his income was not enough for household expenses, he "invited societies" from neighbors and colleagues. Because his character was good and his credit was excellent, Dai further split small amounts of money from nearby women, and his interest rate was higher than the market rate. In order to keep his word, he sent the interest on time. In fact, he pulled from east to west, all the money was split from others. However, women generally stored their private savings with him because they coveted his interest. Later, his methods became more and more flexible, specializing in doing "head societies," and then "bidding societies" at high interest rates. Everyone's purpose was to seek profit, and they all put the society money they had won with Dai.

Chanting Buddha and Buying Property

In July of this year, epidemics were prevalent in various places, and Zhan also contributed 600,000 yuan to worship the Buddha for one day, which verified the Buddha's appearance. Residents there became more and more convinced and were willing to exchange gold jewelry and give the money to Chunshan. By this time, there were more than 50 debtors. Once one enters this area, one will hear his name. In August, in order to avoid being detected of his hypocrisy, he secretly bought a house there for 2.25 million. At the same time, all the furniture in the room was newly purchased. On September 13th, he moved all his family members in, bought new clothes, added new decorations, held banquets, and bought gold jewelry, just like a wealthy merchant, being arrogant and uninhibited. Since Dai obtained the house, he has been unable to support the interest for the debtors and has been in arrears from time to time, but the debtors do not suspect anything else. A peanut vendor invested 8 million yuan, the boss of the Sanquan Pool more than 10 million yuan, an old woman, Shao Zhou, more than 7 million yuan, and his colleagues more than 10 million yuan, all of which were loaned to Dai. At this time, Dai was in debt for more than 50 million yuan.

Escaping in the Middle of the Night

At the end of September, Dai's brother and brother-in-law suddenly came to Wuxi from northern Jiangsu by boat and secretly transported out gold jewelry and valuable clothes, disguised as transporting peanuts and other things. At the beginning of this month, Chunshan was already determined to abscond, so he tried his best to split money from various households and pledged the house order for 1 million yuan. On the 14th, he secretly arranged for his wife and daughter to escape. During the day, he also sold 2.5 dou of rice stored at home to others. At about 1:00 a.m. that night, Dai finished his work at the Sanquan Pool and disappeared without a trace. On the 15th, more than 20 cases of society deadlines and split exchange deadlines were due. The parties went to his home to look for him and saw that the door was locked from the inside. They realized that he had absconded. After investigation, the total amount of money defrauded was more than 80 million yuan.

### Wuxing Huge Fraud Case: Deadline for Creditors to Clear Claims

[This newspaper's dispatch from Wuxing] The case of Zhenkang Silk Shop in this city, which issued bad checks and defrauded more than 200 million yuan, suddenly declared bankruptcy, has been reported in this newspaper. The 46 shops that were defrauded believe that the shop's fraudulent remittances and sudden closure, and the person in charge avoiding and hiding, are undoubtedly fraud and obtaining property. They organized a creditors' group on the 14th and elected Tan Qinbu, Qian Xiangrong, Lu Zhongyan, Zhang Caixin, Yang Luming, and Pan Gantang as representatives. They first published a warning in the newspaper, setting a deadline of seven days to handle the matter clearly. If it is ignored after the deadline, they will file a lawsuit with the Wuxing Court and request a wanted order. The relevant authorities also attach great importance to this case.

### Refugees from Jian, Fu, and Lian Counties: Stranded in Yangzhou, Suffering from Hunger and Cold: Three Demands Accepted

[This newspaper's dispatch from Yangzhou] Since the National Army successively recovered various counties in northern Jiangsu, tens of thousands of refugees from the sixteen counties affiliated to Yangzhou have mostly been sent back by the Executive Yuan's Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch or have returned to their hometowns at their own expense. Among them, only the refugees from Yancheng, Funing, and Lianshui counties have not been able to return because their hometowns are still in war. Since they fled to Yangzhou in January of this year, each person has only been given one and a half bags of relief flour by the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch, with nothing else. Now that the weather is cold and the ground is frozen, they have no food or clothing and cannot bear the hunger and cold. Therefore, a thousand refugees from Lian, Yan, and Fu counties automatically gathered a few days ago and went to the Yangzhou District Working Team of the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch to petition. Representatives Tian Liting, Gu Tongsan, and Zhang Xiangfu directly presented their grievances to Team Leader Chen, and submitted three requests, asking them to forward them to the branch: (1) Relief supplies in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang should be treated equally, (2) An additional three bags of flour and soybean flour should be issued, and (3) An additional three sets of cotton clothing should be issued. Later, Team Leader Chen telegraphed the details to the branch for review. On the 16th, he received a reply, stating that the requests made by the Yangzhou refugees could be accepted. The refugees from Yan, Fu, and Lian counties were overjoyed when they heard the news.

### Ningbo's Establishment as a City: Not Yet Finalized: Talk by Person in Charge of Zhejiang Provincial Government

[This newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou, 17th] It is rumored that Ningbo will be established as a city on New Year's Day. According to the person in charge of the provincial government, the city map has been surveyed and mapped several times, but it still needs to be discussed by the government committee before being reported to the Executive Yuan. Although the postal and county finances are self-sufficient, it is unknown whether they will be sufficient if expanded into a city. The provincial government has no money to allocate, so it will not be established in the short term.

### Shanghai County Establishes Winter Relief Association

[This newspaper's dispatch from Minhang] The Shanghai County Winter Relief Committee has been formally established on the 15th after the county government appointed Xie Youmin, Wang Yiren, Zhu Yangzhong, and others as members. The committee held its first meeting the following day, chaired by Ni Youxiang, the county magistrate and director. The committee discussed several important cases and publicly elected Huang Yunzhen as the deputy director. It also organized fundraising and supervision committees to actively promote winter relief work.

Attention to Those Withdrawing Money from Banks

I am the accountant in a rice store in Jinze Town, Qingpu. Although it is a small-capital rice store, the amount of cash flowing in and out every day is quite large, especially in the morning when farmers sell their rice. Our purpose of operating is to transport the rice to Shanghai for sale, so all the cash is brought down from Shanghai, or withdrawn from banks and money shops. A few days ago, an employee of our store collected 2 million legal currency from a Shanghai grain firm, with four bundles of 500,000 each. Because the banknotes were very tightly packed, and there was a bank seal affixed to the hemp thread, relying on the bank's reputation and due to time constraints, they were not counted. The employee immediately left Shanghai and returned home, handing the banknotes over to me. Because I had seen a report in a newspaper about a certain iron factory frequently experiencing shortages in full bundles of banknotes, I paid special attention and counted them one by one. Unexpectedly, the same thing happened: each bundle was short 10,000 yuan (with ten 500-yuan notes making up 10,000 yuan), for a total shortage of 40,000 yuan. For small businesses like ours, it's almost like working as a solo merchant, painstakingly transporting rice to Shanghai, really hoping to earn a few hard-earned coins. Who knew that returning home would bring such great disappointment? This is so pitiful for small businesses. Banks are the hub of social finance, yet even they have such malpractices. What are small businesses to do? (Zhao Xinyong, Jinze Town, Qingpu)

Evil Wind of Rotating Credit Associations (Biao Hui) Drags Down Small Shops

We are a group of small merchants harmed by "hui" (rotating credit associations). Our small shop, which could barely make a living, is now about to close down!

The origin of "hui" is that people with a little face and some influence inherit the bad habits of the enemy-puppet period, using a kind of latent power to invite participation. We, who are timid and afraid of trouble, cannot escape. This matter of gaining profit without capital has aroused the approval of many people, and we can't even keep up with the invitations to join hui. 100,000, 300,000, 500,000, up to 1 million, emerge one after another. For example, in a hui composed of 20 people, with 500,000 per person, the head of the hui can get 10 million. Bidding is held once or twice a month, and those who do not win the bid pay their dues monthly. But we have more than one "hui", sometimes as many as forty or fifty. Our monthly business income is only three to four million, and we still have to cover capital and expenses, while monthly hui payments exceed two to three times that amount. Where does this uncovered money come from? Borrow from the bank? We small businessmen don't overdraw. Request government relief? How easy is that? Should we steal or rob? Never, we can't do that forever. How to solve this difficult problem? We can only appeal to the government authorities and social elites to find a way to maintain and resolve our livelihoods, to avoid becoming beggars, and to avoid being surrounded and destroyed by evil forces.

Qinghu Highway Urgently Needs Improvement

The Qinghu Highway is only 25 kilometers from Shanghai (starting from Wujiagang on the Shanghai border), but the fare costs as much as 4,200 yuan, which is really too expensive! Moreover, the road surface is uneven. In these 25 kilometers, there are more than 20 bridges, only one or two of which have railings. The rest are wooden bridges without railings, only wide enough for one car to pass, with the wheels already tightly pressed against the edge of the bridge, making passengers feel frightened. The company has never repaired them. Most of the bridges can only carry a load of three metric tons, while ordinary cars are five metric tons. No wonder they fall into the river!

Now, we hope that the company will quickly repair the bridges along the way into permanent structures that can carry at least eight tons. Otherwise, ten-wheeled trucks will not be able to pass, and the fare should be reduced. (Jin Ziqiang)

### President Truman Issues Order: Overseas Troops Under Unified Command; Divided into Seven Zones, Commanders Responsible to Headquarters; Friction Between Army and Navy in Pacific Region Can Now Be Cleared Up

[United Press Washington 16th] The Army and Navy Departments jointly announced today: President Truman has approved that U.S. military zones stationed around the world, whether Army or Navy, will be under the unified command of one headquarters, with the commander responsible to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The unified command is divided into seven parts. The joint Army and Navy statement is as follows: The Far East region is under the command of General MacArthur, including Japan, Korea, the Philippines, the Marianas, the Ogasawara Islands, and the Ryukyu Islands. The Pacific region is under the command of Admiral Nimitz, commander of the Pacific Fleet. The Alaska region is under the command of Major General Craig. Unaffiliated strategic air force units are under the command of General Kenney. There is no change in the civil and military governments of Guam and the former Japanese-mandated islands. This new arrangement enriches MacArthur's occupation affairs in Japan and South Korea; MacArthur's jurisdiction does not extend to the Asian continent. U.S. forces in China are still under the command of Lieutenant General Gillem, with headquarters in Nanjing.

[United Press Honolulu 17th] President Truman's announcement today to revise the command authority of the Army and Navy can clear up the cause of the friction between the Army and Navy in the Pacific region that has been going on for months. This time, the new command authority in the central Pacific region gives the command authority of the Army in Hawaii to the Navy and restricts MacArthur's command authority over the Army in the central Pacific, effectively restoring the authority that the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet had before 1945. A few weeks ago, naval officials here told the press that there was an "intolerable" situation in the Pacific Command. The Navy felt that although it was responsible for the central Pacific, it had no power to carry out this mission.

### U.S. Army Equipment Moved to East Coast for Storage

[United Press New York 17th] The New York Herald Tribune reported today that the U.S. Army is moving military equipment stored on the West Coast, including heavy tanks, heavy artillery, military supplies, and transport vehicles, to locations near seaports, railways, and highway networks on the East Coast. It is said that the most important strategic storage depots are located near New York and Boston, so that reserve forces can be quickly equipped in times of emergency, or troops can be dispatched to foreign countries to fulfill the tasks entrusted by the United Nations. The report also stated that this decision is intended to make mobilization faster and not affect the U.S. transportation system.

### French Socialist Party Forms Cabinet; Prime Minister Blum Concurrently Heads Foreign Affairs; Announced Policy Program to Parliament Yesterday

[Agence France-Presse Paris 16th] France's new Prime Minister, Socialist leader Léon Blum, formed an all-Socialist cabinet today, with himself as Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, Blum's cabinet is a transitional government. Once the President of the Republic is elected in January, and the Fourth French Republic decides on its first cabinet according to the constitution, it will step down.

According to Reuters: After the formation of the cabinet was completed, Prime Minister Blum broadcast to the nation, announcing the formation of a Socialist cabinet as an emergency measure in the face of the worsening government crisis. He said that the new cabinet's term will not exceed one month, but within this short period, it will ensure the secure protection of France's interests and freedom. In the coming days, essential laws must be passed, constitutional institutions must be established, and especially, the people must gain confidence in the country's system, currency, and future.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 17th] Prime Minister Blum presented the list of the new cabinet to the National Assembly this afternoon, and delivered a speech on the spot, explaining the new cabinet's policies. On the domestic front: (1) strictly balancing the budget; (2) increasing production; (3) facilitating the flow of goods; (4) stabilizing prices and currency values; (5) increasing taxes on the propertied class and exempting the salaried class from taxes. On the diplomatic front: (1) merging the economy of the German Saar region; (2) opposing any revival of Germany's wartime industries; (3) close cooperation with the United Nations; (4) maintaining France's traditional friendship; (5) Germany using exported coal to compensate France.

Cabinet List

The full list of the new cabinet is as follows:

Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs

Léon Blum

Minister of State

Mollet and Lauter

Minister of Justice Lamadier

Minister of the Interior Taipurou

Minister of National Defense Troquet

Minister of Planning Goun

Minister of Finance and Economy Philippe

Minister of Agriculture Prishang

Minister of Industrial Production La Guster

Minister of Education Naqilan

Minister of Public Works and Transportation Mosh

Minister of Overseas Territories Mutai

Minister of Labor and Social Security Mayi

Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Thomas

Minister of Health and Population Seniyi

Minister of Veterans Lecena

Regarding the Minister of National Defense, Troquet, a Socialist leader with a reputation since before the war, is an openly anti-communist figure. When the Vichy government tried the leaders of the Third Republic, Troquet was Blum's defense lawyer. The former Prime Minister of the Provisional Government, Goun, is responsible for presiding over the four-year construction plan. The Minister of Finance is Philippe, the Minister of Finance in De Gaulle's cabinet.

Prime Minister Blum

[Agence France-Presse Paris 17th] Blum's attempt to form a coalition cabinet failed because the right wing refused to allow the Communist Party to take the position of Minister of National Defense in the new cabinet.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 16th] Political observers here recently stated that Prime Minister Blum is scheduled to present the entire Socialist cabinet to the National Assembly tomorrow afternoon and will surely gain the support of a majority of members. Other parties are also willing to have Blum's cabinet be responsible for taking the strict measures needed for the current economic situation. Among them, Communist leader Thorez said: "We not only support Blum, but also help him move forward." As for Blum's plan to organize a national unity cabinet, the Communist Party is not responsible for this failure, because the Communist Party has already made concessions time and again. Schumann, the leader of the People's Republican Movement, also made a statement of a similar nature.

[Reuters London 16th] The British government previously issued an ultimatum to the Albanian government regarding the incident in which British ships were fired upon by Albanian gun emplacements and struck mines in the Corfu Strait, demanding an apology and compensation for the losses. It is now learned that the Albanian government's temporary reply has been delivered to London, and its content only acknowledges receipt of the British note, with no response to the points mentioned in the note. London officials still believe that if the case does not need to be submitted to the Security Council, the Albanian government must still provide a fully satisfactory reply within 14 days of the delivery of the British note, that is, before December 23rd. British officials also pointed out that the last time the U.S. government issued an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government for forcing a U.S. plane to land, the deadline was only 48 hours.

More than 400,000 attendees gathered in front of the Imperial Palace.

The proposal was ultimately rejected because the majority of votes were against it.

[Agence France-Presse Lake Success, New York 16th] The United Nations Security Council met tonight to discuss the Greek appeal case. Representatives of Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania were invited to attend and state their views. The Yugoslav representative, Karkovich, spoke first, criticizing the Greek Prime Minister for making inaccurate statements to the Security Council, intentionally damaging the prestige of Yugoslavia and causing misunderstandings. The Albanian representative, Roha, followed, requesting the Security Council to reject the Greek proposals, saying that the sections condemned in these proposals were sufficient to endanger peace and security. Greece is now attempting to provoke Albania, making its territorial claims reasonable. I hereby request the Security Council to send an investigation committee to conduct an on-site investigation of the northern border of Greece. The Bulgarian political representative to the United States, Stoichev, said: Bulgaria has been "slandered" by Greek newspapers, and the accusations made by Greece are completely unfounded. Finally, the Greek Prime Minister explained Greece's position, reiterating that Yugoslavia is supplying Greek rebels with weapons, and that all incidents have occurred within Greek territory. Greece has no intention of expanding its territory. I do not believe it. Member states of the Security Council are welcome to send their representatives stationed in Greece to investigate the facts.

Therefore, women all over the world must fully devote themselves to a great work to save the world from the pain and anxiety caused by war. Chinese women are willing to cooperate with Japanese women in this great work."

### Indian Constituent Assembly Debates Independence Bill

[This Newspaper] London 17th Broadcast; It was rumored that Nehru had said that India would declare independence from Britain within three days. His acting spokesperson firmly denied the report.

[Reuters New Delhi 16th] Indian Interim Government Home Minister Patel, while controlling the Constituent Assembly debate on Nehru's "Bill Declaring India as an Independent Republic with Royal Authority," stated in his speech that the recent British government's statement on India had new concessions to the Muslim League that exceeded those stated in the British statement of May 16. We have not accepted it, and this assembly will never accept any other new concessions. Liberal politician Jayakar proposed an amendment to Nehru's resolution, requesting that discussions on the Indian constitution be postponed until the Muslim League and other independent states participate in the Constituent Assembly. He said that it would be wrong, illegal, and dangerous to pass the constitution today, and it would be enough to cause great turmoil. The debate on the bill will continue tomorrow. The Communist Party's proposal to redraft Nehru's constitutional draft was rejected. Nehru's sister, Mrs. Pandit, the Indian representative to the United Nations General Assembly, will attend the meeting tomorrow.

### British Foreign Policy (Middle)

— By Professor Carr, translated specifically for this newspaper by the editorial department

The backbone of current British foreign policy should be to neither stray from the United States nor offend the Soviet Union, but rather to seek balance between the two.

Today, when we discuss foreign policy, touching upon the European continent and the rest of the overseas world, the first thing that comes to mind is the Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet Union has suffered appalling plunder and losses due to the German invasion. Before it can equip itself to become an active and outstanding member of the world political stage, it faces a vast reconstruction plan, both spiritually and materially. Although the United States possesses all the elements of material power, the extent to which its people bear a desire for a progressive policy, especially a progressive European policy, is still undecided. The difference in attitude between the Soviet Union and the United States in the future is that the former's strength may increase due to the progress of domestic reconstruction work, thus making its actions in Europe more effective. The latter's aversion to excessive involvement in European affairs will increase accordingly. Therefore, in the future, we may see that the Soviet Union's influence on the European continent will be greater than it is today, while the United States' influence will be smaller than it is today. If this is indeed the case, it is obvious that the main task of British foreign policy is to seek a balance between a Europe with the Soviet Union as the main force and an overseas world with the United States as the main force.

Britain and the United States Cannot Be Hostile

I probably don't need to elaborate on the fact that Britain cannot participate in any alliance of continental European countries that are hostile to the world, especially the United States and its dominions. Since the First World War, it has become an unbreakable truth that Britain absolutely cannot participate in any military intervention that the United States does not participate in, or at least remains neutral but does not actually tend to agree with. The United States cannot, in fact, be completely unconcerned about European unification. However, if European unity achieves any effective success, by definition it must exclude the United States, or we can say that it is turning a knife against the United States. Britain can never participate in such a combination. Absolute non-participation in a solely European alliance may become the basis of British foreign policy.

However, it is equally true that Britain cannot base its foreign policy on combining with the world outside Europe while turning a knife against Europe itself. Regarding this point, I would like to elaborate slightly. Because there is a natural tendency for people to believe that language is a truly effective bond, and that the tradition and sentiment of unity in the English-speaking world can itself become the foundation for forging and stabilizing a political group. The United States was the first to warn us that this idea is a dangerous illusion. The United States contains a rather strong anti-British tendency in its political tradition. Even today, any overly close cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States internationally will cause the United States to harbor a special suspicion of being asked to "bail someone out of trouble." Wallace, in the speech that forced his resignation, said something similar, but he did not take responsibility for the speech.

The Tripartite Alliance Should Be Maintained

Therefore, I have learned that just as allying with the United States and the Soviet Union in the war was a major condition for winning victory, it seems to have equal importance in peacetime for guaranteeing security. Such a tripartite alliance is as necessary today as it was in the past. At the same time, this is also the condition for guaranteeing Britain's domestic security and foreign interests. If Britain cannot maintain friendship and mutual understanding with the United States, its interests in the Far East and the Pacific will not be able to develop. I am also equally certain that if a policy of friendship and understanding is not adopted towards the Soviet Union, Britain's interests in the Middle East (a large collection of countries from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean to the border of India) will ultimately not be able to be maintained or utilized.

The governments established by many European countries are indeed not very sound. From our perspective, they are not good governments at all, and we even harbor many dissatisfactions towards them. However, I don't think that the opinions of Britain and the United States are likely to be accepted by these countries, nor can they induce them to reorganize their governments to conform to Western liberal democratic forms. We must remember that since the First World War, almost every country in Central and Eastern Europe has completed a Western-style democratic constitution, but the governments produced under these constitutions have mostly been either corrupt or incompetent, or both. When such governments collapse, no one mourns. We must know that although liberal democracy in the Western Hemisphere has many qualities that we admire, it is not a standard form that can be applied everywhere, but only a form of government produced by certain nations at a certain stage of their development. Just as plants grow vigorously in suitable soil, but wither and die once they are transplanted to unsuitable soil, this kind of democracy has never actually taken root on land outside of Europe.

### Foreign Goods Dumping Creates a Crisis; Representatives of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association Go to Nanjing to Petition; Calling on the Government to Provide Loans for Relief

[Reported by this newspaper] Amid the influx of foreign goods, the crisis in China's pharmaceutical industry is becoming more serious than in other industries. The pharmaceutical industry has reached a point where it can no longer exist. The Pharmaceutical Industry Association has specially sent representatives Gu Keming, Yao Junzhi, Ni Jingfu, Yang Shuxun, Chen Mingshan, Hu Jiayu, Huang Sufeng, Cao Zan Chu and others, as well as Jin Runxiang from the Chamber of Commerce and Tian Heqing from the Industrial Association, to form a petition group to go to Nanjing by car last night to petition, calling on the government and people from all walks of life to pay attention to the crisis facing the pharmaceutical industry and provide the necessary relief.

Reception for Journalists Last Night

The association also held a reception for the media from this country at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Yao Junzhi reported on the situation. He bitterly complained about the serious crisis facing China's pharmaceutical industry due to the threat of foreign drug dumping, the impact of purchasing surplus materials containing drugs, and the pressure of high-interest loans for production, which has caused more than 300 factories to close down, leaving only 70 or so factories that cannot continue to operate. Yao said: Currently, 44 pharmaceutical factories urgently need a total loan of 12,355,000,000 yuan. At present, they are all on the verge of shutdown due to poor economic turnover. If the government provides timely loans, they can still be saved. Then Tian said in detail about the various difficulties of the industry's inability to balance income and expenditure, the excessive arrival of foreign drugs, and the lack of outlets for domestic drugs, and especially pointed out that the members of the association are part of the national industry. The association put forward oral demands, calling on the government and relevant parties to provide relief: (1) Because the pharmaceutical industry's research and advertising expenses are overdrawn too much, the government should consider the focus of each factory's investment when providing loans, and not use pharmaceutical finished products as collateral. (2) We respectfully request that our government order the Materials Supply Bureau to bundle domestic pharmaceuticals with American military surplus pharmaceuticals when allocating them to various pharmaceutical merchants, with a ratio of 20%. (3) Regarding the restriction of imports of foreign pharmaceuticals, it can be divided into three steps. Preliminary raw materials can be imported, drug chemicals should be restricted from import, and pharmaceutical finished products should be prohibited from import at any time. The association stated that this petition group intends to host reporters and National Assembly representatives in Nanjing. If a satisfactory answer is not obtained, the members of the association will collectively stop production.

[Reported by this newspaper] The year is rapidly coming to an end - the calendar pages fly away silently one by one, and these days it seems to be flying faster and faster: Only a few days are left in the 35th year of the Republic of China!

Let the past be the past! After eight years of arduous war, perhaps we had too high expectations for this year, and therefore we cannot avoid the sadness of a bit of disillusionment. However, hardship and difficulty are the best training - the four thousand years of history of the Republic of China are by no means accidental, we have nothing to fear!

If there are mistakes, we should resolutely correct them. No matter how rugged the long road ahead may be, as long as we have the courage to grit our teeth and move forward, what harm is there in looking back? Moreover, the "past" is not necessarily without any pleasing aspects! Therefore, we have launched the election of the top ten news stories of the 35th year of the Republic of China, divided into "Chinese" and "Shanghai" sections. The faces of the country and this city in the 35th year of the Republic of China can be represented by these items.

The following were invited to evaluate the top ten news stories: Cheng Yuxi and Xu Xinqin from the Central Daily News; Zhao Minheng, Zhang Yunhu, Luo Suilin, and You Rongsun from the News; Li Zongying, Xu Junyuan, and Li Xiawen from the Ta Kung Pao; Cao Fa from the Zhengyan Daily; Xu Zhucheng, Meng Qiujiang, Xu Liping, Liu Huozi, and Yang Chongye from the Wenhui Daily; Du Shaowen, Chen Fuyu, and Cai Ji from the Southeast Daily; Yang Yanqi and Sun Fengnian from the Heping Daily; Xing Songwen, Yan Bingzhong, Chen Shanshan, and Zhou Qifeng from the Frontline Daily; Zhou Yuhong from the Shangbao; Chen Dehui, Kong Linghuan, and Hengzhou from the Yishi Daily; Cui Wanqiu, Yang Lianyuan, Dong Yan, and Wang Huizhang from the Zhonghua Shibao; Guan Jiu'an, Xu Wenquan, and Dai Yumin from the Minguo Daily; Shen Shanhong from the Libao; Hu Chuanhou from the Central News Agency; Wu Jiatang from the English-language Da Mei Evening News; and Shao Fu, Gu Zhian, and Wang Dexin from this newspaper. A total of 33 votes were cast for domestic news and 32 votes for local news, totaling 65 votes.

### Rapidly Ending Year with Many Disputes: Workers at the General Electric Light Bulb Factory Demand Reinstatement After Being Dismissed

[Reported by this newspaper] The General Electric Edison Light Bulb Company on Changshou Road in this city was originally operated by an American businessman. It was occupied by the Japanese during the war. At the beginning of the victory, it was first taken over by Denmark as an agent. On September 30th of the 34th year of the Republic of China, more than 200 workers were dismissed, and each person was given 150 light bulbs as severance pay. On December 1st of last year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs formally returned the factory to the American original owner for reorganization and resumption of business. However, since the factory resumed work, it has only hired more than 80 workers, specializing in the manufacture of light bulb filaments. The glass shells are manufactured and supplied by other factories through three employees of the factory. The scope of manufacturing is not as large as before the war, and the number of workers hired has also decreased. However, the workers who were dismissed last September believe that they were exiting a factory that was occupied by the Japanese, not the General Electric Company. Now that the Americans have taken over the original factory, they have the right to demand reinstatement. Because repeated requests were unsuccessful, they intercepted the glass shells being transported to the factory at around 2:00 PM yesterday and twisted them to the police station. The matter has now been submitted by the labor side to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, but because both labor and management have reasons, it is difficult to make a fair judgment.

### Coal Price Review Committee Decides to Initially Allocate 6,000 Tons of Coal; Discussion of Coal Briquette Supervision Issue to Be Held After Coal Arrives

[Reported by this newspaper] At 3:00 PM yesterday, representatives from six units, including the Social Affairs Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, the Coal Briquette Retail Industry Association, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, held the first meeting of the Coal Price Review Committee at the Social Affairs Bureau. After a thorough discussion of more than two hours, the following major cases were resolved: (1) The meeting date of this committee is set to be held once every two weeks, with the time being 3:00 PM on Friday. (2) The price of bituminous coal was reserved and not decided because the representative of the bituminous coal merchants did not attend. (3) The coal briquette cost form will be submitted to a group for review. The group will be organized by representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, and the Coal Briquette Retail Industry Association. (4) Allocation issue: It was decided to initially allocate 6,000 tons. The allocation method will be formulated by the Fuel Management Committee and the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. (5) After new members join the association, they should enjoy the same rights. It was resolved that newly established coal briquette factories should enjoy the same right to allocate coal after completing commercial registration. Non-member factories should be urged to register as soon as possible, otherwise they will not be allocated. (6) The issue of coal briquette supervision will be discussed after the coal arrives.

(Another report) Regarding the allocation of coal for coal briquettes in this city, there are two central issues: (1) Cost issue. The production costs of large and small factories are not uniform. Some people advocate dividing them into two levels to take care of the interests of small factories. The cost review team is scheduled to meet again at the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow. Factories attach the most importance to this, so it is handled very carefully. (2) Allocation issue. Some people are concerned that there may be abuses when coal briquettes are sold by retailers to citizens in the future, such as poor quality or a lack of goods that should not occur. Therefore, it is suggested that retail sales should be carried out in different districts in the future, with a person in charge designated in each district. The competent authorities will strictly supervise them at any time, and if there are any abuses, they will be severely punished. The review committee is scheduled to meet again at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM tomorrow.

(Another report) According to personnel from the Social Affairs Bureau who told reporters, around the 18th of this month, the American ship "Yunni Tai" will transport 6,000 tons of Annam white coal to Shanghai. The competent authorities hope that this batch of coal can still be sold at a price of 100,000 yuan per ton.

### Difficult to Sell Enemy and Puppet Properties by Bidding; Vacant Land Will Be Sold Starting Next Spring

[Reported by this newspaper] The China Trust Bureau's second ban on the sale of enemy and puppet real estate has sold two batches so far, but the houses in Jia Alley have always lacked buyers. The third bidding and sale will be handled in January next year, or it will mostly be vacant land to avoid disputes.

The issue of bidding and selling the houses in Weihai Villa on Weihaiwei Road has always attracted much attention. Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council has also sent a letter to the China Trust Bureau, asking it to handle the matter carefully. It is reported that if approved by the Executive Yuan, the villa houses will be sold separately, and the original residents will have the right to purchase them first within a limited time.

### The Machine Federation Hosts a Broadcast Promoting the Use of Domestic Goods

The Shanghai Machine Federation is an organization formed by well-known domestic goods factories in this city.

The purpose is to introduce high-quality domestic goods so that buyers can easily choose them, so the significance is very profound. It has now begun trial broadcasting and will officially open on a selected day.

### 40 Billion Yuan of the Municipal Government's Budget for Next Year Comes From: National Obligatory Labor Decides to Collect a Substitute Fee, Stipulating 5,000 Yuan Per Person Per Day

[Reported by this newspaper] According to reporters who learned from confidential sources in the Municipal Government yesterday: Among the income that can be increased in this city's budget for next year, the source of this income is the substitute fee for national obligatory labor.

According to the decree of the Central Ministry of the Interior, able-bodied men aged 18 to 45 must perform three days of obligatory service for the country every year. (This city has increased it to ten days) Those who are unwilling to work can use cash as a substitute. The population of this city is more than four million people. The number of able-bodied men who should perform obligatory service is estimated to be one-fifth of the total population, or more than 800,000 people. If the daily substitute fee is calculated at 5,000 yuan, then the total amount that can be obtained is 40 billion yuan, which is 40 billion yuan of income that the Municipal Government can increase next year.

Because the difference between income and expenditure of the Municipal Government next year is too large, the budget form has not been completed so far. After the budgets of the various bureaus and departments were withdrawn and re-edited at last week's municipal meeting, they have been tightened as much as possible. According to estimates from related parties: The total budget of this city next year is about 250 billion yuan. According to statistics from the Finance Bureau, the total income of this city next year is more than 230 billion yuan. With the addition of 40 billion yuan in labor substitute fees, the income can reach 270 billion yuan, so the Municipal Government's income and expenditure next year can be balanced, and it is believed that its budget form can be finalized at this week's municipal meeting.

Also, according to the person in charge of the Finance Bureau who told reporters yesterday: It has not yet been decided whether the municipal construction donation in this city can be collected as usual next year. The collection of this tax was decided by the first Municipal Council, and its purpose was to make up for the inability of income and expenditure to offset each other in the second half of the 35th year. It was decided at that time that new sources of income must be sought for the 36th year. However, the Finance Bureau, in view of the fact that the financial situation of this city next year is still very tight, has submitted a request to the Council to continue to collect it for another year. The Finance Bureau's estimated total income of more than 230 billion yuan for this city next year already includes more than 20 billion yuan in municipal construction donations.

His wife was lying on the bed, with two axe wounds to the right side of her face, one axe embedded in her right skull and still not removed, barely alive. It was later learned that Alexander had committed the crime and, fearing punishment, had taken poison to commit suicide. Purple potassium cyanide granules were found on the floor, presumably the poison he had ingested. Changshu police immediately rushed Alexander to the police hospital for emergency treatment, but he died at 9:30 AM the following morning. Sophia was also taken to Guangci Hospital, where doctors managed to remove the axe, but she remains in critical condition.

Police officers found three letters in the room, translated from the original as follows: (1) To Soviet Bishop John, approximately thirteen pages long, mentioning that his wife had been seduced by the Consulate's Commercial Counselor, Achiv. (2) Briefly stated: Your government officials must punish those responsible for the tragic deaths of two people, Commercial Counselor Achiv, whose sins led to the loss of two lives; he is my wife's lover. Signed, Alexander Kotunin. (3) The will stated: The furniture in my house is gifted to the Soviet Catholic Church; my personal belongings are gifted to my father-in-law; the silver fox fur coat, the large gold ring, and one kimono, and two coats, are left to my daughter Olga; my new coat to Yibi; the entire set of tableware is divided equally among Yibi, Jianayuntianai, and Sulalye; the deeds and cash are also divided equally among them. The money from the General Association is also to be given to Yibi, Jiana, and Yuntianai; the smoking set to Dima; the small diamond ring to the one who bought it. My last wish is that the person responsible for this bloody tragedy is Achiv, who attempted to make my wife leave me and our son, because the wealthy are all-powerful, and they are tempted by money and luxury.

Considering the above letters, the case appears to involve a love triangle. The full details remain under investigation.

### ### Allegations of Bribery Against Xuan Tiewu; Investigation Underway to Determine Source of Rumors

[Our Report] According to yesterday's evening paper, Xuan Tiewu, Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison Command and Chief of the Police Bureau of this city, was recently accused by someone in a formal complaint to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration for corruption and dereliction of duty. It is alleged that a certain Russian expatriate in this city, suspected of being an enemy agent, previously obtained an exit passport from the Police Bureau to return to his home country. This Russian expatriate had been reported by a foreign national, and now the original informant has filed a complaint with our Executive Yuan and other agencies, alleging that Xuan received a bribe of US$270,000 and allowed the Russian expatriate to leave the country privately.

Yesterday, Commander Xuan stated: that this matter has no factual basis whatsoever. The Police Bureau has always carefully handled the issuance of exit or domestic travel passports to foreigners in accordance with regulations. All stateless expatriates or those from countries without diplomatic relations who apply for an exit visa must obtain a guarantee from a reputable business, ensuring that there are no outstanding civil or criminal cases against them, before a visa is issued. No one suspected of being an enemy agent has ever been authorized to leave without permission, as records can attest. Furthermore, no Russian expatriates are on the list of war criminals.

Xuan also stated that the purpose of these rumors is unknown, but the fact that they damage the reputation of the Police Bureau and himself is undeniable. He is currently investigating the source of these rumors and instructed all officers at the Garrison Command's anniversary celebration the day before to assist the Police Bureau in tracking down the source of the rumors. Xuan is confident that these unfounded rumors will soon collapse on their own.

### Salvation Army to Build Shelter for the Needy; Distributing "Happiness Bags" for Christmas

[Our Report] As the harsh winter sets in, the Salvation Army, which has been conducting various charitable activities in China for thirty years, has observed a growing number of homeless refugees on the streets without food or clothing. In addition to strengthening its usual relief efforts, regularly providing refugees with buns, clothing, and medical care, it has recently decided to expand its winter relief efforts by establishing a large-scale shelter. The necessary funds have been discussed with Continental Daily News to jointly launch a fundraising campaign to raise 20 million yuan for the construction. According to Wei Lecze, the Salvation Army's Shanghai Regional Director, and Chang Ziying, the Regional Director, the blueprint for the planned shelter has been approved by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. The location has been selected at the intersection of Dong Jiaxing Road and Desiwei Road in Hongkou, and construction will begin soon, with completion expected by the end of this month. It is planned to begin accepting refugees at the beginning of next month, with an initial capacity of 300 people. If donations exceed the target amount, the capacity will be increased accordingly. The beds needed have been agreed upon with the United Relief Association, which will provide them in full. The collection point is located at 25 Sassoon Building on the Bund, Nanjing Road (telephone 13113), in the Continental Daily News. It is hoped that all sectors of society will generously contribute and join in this great endeavor. Furthermore, as Christmas approaches, the Salvation Army has specially prepared 1,600 emergency bags (or "Happiness Bags") for distribution to refugees, containing items such as towels, wool socks, toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor sets, soap, sunglasses, stationery, pencils, candies, and handkerchiefs, with a total value of over 30,000 yuan.

### Five Male and Female Thieves Apprehended in Succession

[Our Report] The Sichuan Road Police Bureau recently received a tip-off that a large group of bandits was hiding at 15 Qianyi Lane, Tiantong Road. Chief Zhou Nan led Inspectors Xie Zhiguang, Police Chiefs Wang Shubei and Zhang De, and officers Wang Ersheng, Tang Lunmei, Wei Shulin, and Zhang Xianzhang to the location. At midnight, they forced entry and apprehended a young woman, Ling Lindi (22 years old, from Yancheng), and confiscated a German-made pistol with four bullets. After interrogating her at the bureau, she provided no information. Subsequent searches of various hotels also yielded nothing. However, yesterday, the bandit Chen Laitao, 21 years old, from Nantong, was arrested at 97 Baoshan Road. He confessed that his accomplices were staying at Room 205 of the Ningbo Merchants Hotel on Tianjin Road. Three more thieves were subsequently apprehended: Cao Fusheng, 28 years old, Li Miaohong, 24 years old, and Chen Zhuzhu, 23 years old, all from Nantong. They confessed that on July 29th at 7:00 PM, they robbed the Fuxing Grocery Store at 336 North Baoxing Road. The victim was Dai Wu, who lost 350,000 yuan in legal tender and over a million yuan in clothing and accessories. They had previously committed several robberies in the Jiangwan and Hongkou jurisdictions. The sub-bureau has applied for their detention and plans to hand them over to the Garrison Command for further investigation upon completion of the investigation.

### Lishi Society: Noble Mission to Improve Welfare of Military Personnel; Spare No Effort in Entertaining Allied Officers; Recently to Take Over Broadway Mansions

[Special Report] During the eight years of the War of Resistance, especially in the final three years approaching victory, the Lishi Society, established eighteen years ago, was directly responsible for entertaining Allied officers entering China.

The Lishi Society was established two years after the success of the Northern Expedition. Its nature and mission were simply to serve the officers and soldiers of the army and improve the welfare of military personnel. Similar organizations are called Kaikosha in Japan and the Army YMCA in the UK and USA. The Lishi Society's target group is the officers and soldiers of the army, just as the New Life Movement's target group is the general public. Its work has some similarities to the army's Political Department (now renamed the News Bureau), but its existence does not overlap with the army's Political Department. The army's Political Department's target group is limited to the officers and soldiers of its own unit, while the members of the Lishi Society are general officers and soldiers who have joined the society through certain procedures. A certain company commander from Army A or a certain lower-ranking soldier from Division B can all apply to join the society, and after joining, they all have certain rights and obligations.

The Lishi Society's work had already achieved good results before the war. The buildings of the Nanjing General Society, as well as their exquisite design and scientific management, were often praised. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the number of Allied troops entering China increased daily, and the arduous task of entertaining the Allied troops fell on the shoulders of the Lishi Society.

Speaking of the Lishi Society, one is naturally reminded of the New Life Movement General Association, because the actual person in charge of both groups is the Secretary-General Huang Renlin, who is described as tall and strong. With his talent and connections in various fields, it is naturally the most appropriate for him to preside over the work of entertaining the Allied troops.

Entertaining the Allied troops is not a simple matter. The term "entertaining" implies a relationship between guest and host. It is already difficult for a host to please a guest, and the scarcity of resources during the War of Resistance made it even more difficult. The Allied troops who came to China had originally enjoyed a high standard of living and mostly held a sense of superiority. The hosts responsible for entertaining them had to not only provide them with daily necessities as much as possible but also pay attention to their physical and mental health and needs, because the two armies were fighting side by side, which was directly related to the victory or defeat of the war and indirectly related to the future friendship between the two countries.

From the perspective of entertaining the Allied troops, we can see that the efforts of the Lishi Society were multifaceted. We have no way of obtaining statistics on the actual number of Allied troops who came to China, but in terms of entertaining, the Lishi Society had an obligation to entertain every Allied officer and soldier who entered China. After 1941, Kunming, where the Allied troops were most concentrated, and Chengdu, where the most decisions were made, needed seven or eight hundred head of cattle, four or five hundred pigs, and tens of thousands of eggs every day. As a result, the price of meat in neighboring provinces and counties soared. In the locations where the Allied troops were stationed, the Lishi Society had to set up comfortable and thoughtful reception centers for them, and even the tea servers and servants had to be trained in the European style. In terms of mental needs, they regularly held musical performances, sports competitions, founded camp publications, and held dances. Everything that could be thought of and done, the designers of the Lishi Society spent all their energy "arranging" for the Allied troops.

In order to entertain the Allied troops, the Lishi Society specially set up a battlefield service group, which was distributed in the locations where the Allied troops were stationed. Even as far as India and Burma, the members of the service group left their footprints. They also co-organized an interpreter training class with the now-defunct Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, writing an unforgettable page for Sino-American cooperation.

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, although the battlefield service group has ended, the work of the Lishi Society has become stronger. There are two reception centers, nine reception centers in the Shanghai branch, and fourteen reception centers in Peiping. The four reception centers in the Northeast will be closed in the short term due to the war. The main guests in the reception centers everywhere are now the personnel of the Coordination Executive Headquarters, with more than 500 people. The Lishi Society is responsible for providing adequate accommodation, but the guests are now responsible for their own food. According to Director Zhang Chu of the Shanghai branch of the society, the first to eleventh floors of the Broadway Mansions on the Suzhou River will be taken over and managed by the branch.

### Steady Supply of Kerosene; No Restrictions on Imports; Chen Changtong of the Import Control Commission Discusses Recent Situation

[Our Report] Recently, this reporter noted that foreign kerosene companies were dissatisfied with the Import Control Commission's determination of current import quotas based on pre-war kerosene import volumes, which did not match the current surge in fuel consumption, preventing the oil companies from fully utilizing their kerosene reserves to meet market demand. This reporter visited Mr. Chen Changtong, Chief of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Import Control Commission, who stated that the Commission's regulations on import quotas, in addition to referencing the import volumes of 1935, 1936, and 1937, also need to reference the import volumes of 1946. The reason for referencing the import volumes of 1946 is that, in view of the post-victory situation, China's demand for certain imported goods may have changed, so the import quotas can be adjusted according to the actual situation. For example, if the import volume of kerosene has increased sharply after the victory, then when allocating quotas, it must be based on changes in the actual situation and increase the import quota. There is absolutely no reason to completely base it on pre-war import volumes. Therefore, the current concerns of kerosene importers are unnecessary. Although the current quota has not yet been determined, the import of kerosene is still proceeding smoothly, and there have been no changes due to the promulgation of the revised import and export trade regulations.

### Enemy Property Review Committee Approves Tenth Batch of Factory Sales; Fourteen Units of State-Confiscated Materials

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Purchases Tugboats; Some Have Already Arrived in Shanghai

[Our Report] Ships of the US surplus materials purchased by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the Philippines have now arrived in Shanghai in succession. There are a total of eight large tugs, renamed Min 1 through 8. They have not yet been fully received because they have not all arrived. It is also learned that some of these tugs are currently traveling between Shanghai and the Philippines, towing various ships to Shanghai. Those that have already arrived in Shanghai include four YF vessels, all of which are lighters. One of them has already been towed to Yichang, and the three in Shanghai will all be used as lighters on the upper Yangtze River in the future. There are also two YR vessels, which are repair ships and have no engines of their own, so they cannot be operated. They are currently docked at Old White Ferry. As for Tugboat Min 108, it once came to Shanghai and has already sailed to the Philippines, and it will soon tow ships to Shanghai.

### Dispute at the Dragon Gate Grand Theater; On-Stage and Backstage Brawl

[Our Report] The Yue Opera troupe Quanxiang has recently been performing at the Dragon Gate Grand Theater at 661 Zhongzheng Road. At approximately 9:00 PM last night, just as the performance was starting, Mr. Yu, the father-in-law of Jin Jilin, the front-of-house manager, arrived to find Jin and wanted to see the play. At that time, Wu Yinzhou, Lü Liangcheng, Xu Hexing, and other three backstage inspectors saw that he was an old man and spoke to him rudely, driving him outside. At the same time, Chen Xiancheng and Zhang Xiaozhang, two accountants at the front desk, witnessed this situation and expressed their dissatisfaction, as the visitor was indeed Jin's father-in-law, whom they knew well. They argued reasonably, and a quarrel broke out. Unexpectedly, Wu and others retreated backstage and gathered more than a dozen actors, who rushed out and grabbed Chen and others, beating them severely. This caused great chaos in the theater, and the audience dispersed in droves. After receiving a report, the Taishan Sub-Bureau ordered the police to the scene, who arrested several of the perpetrators and took them to the bureau for interrogation. The two victims were also sent to Nanyang Hospital for treatment.

### Special Plane Flew to Changxing for Investigation; 17 Packages of Banknotes Recovered; Bank of China Insured 600 Million

[Our Report] The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beijing Flight 31, which crashed in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, on the afternoon of the 14th, carried 1.2 billion yuan in national currency. The Bank of China had previously taken out safety insurance with the China Property Insurance Company, with coverage of 600 million yuan. It is now learned that 17 of the packages (based on 31 packages totaling 1.2 billion yuan, 17 packages would amount to over 660 million yuan) were not burned and have been safely kept by the Changxing County government after being recovered.

After receiving the telegram from the Changxing County government, the China National Aviation Corporation, in addition to dispatching personnel from the company, the Bank of China, and the China Insurance Company that night to investigate via Jiaxing by train, learned yesterday morning that there was a small airport in Changxing that could accommodate airplanes. At noon, they dispatched another plane, personally piloted by Chen Wenkuan, Director of the Aviation Division. The company's secretary, Wu Lieqi, and Zhou Kechang, Assistant Manager of the Bank of China, accompanied him, and they also brought a Jeep. They took off from Shanghai at 11:00 AM and landed in Changxing at a small airfield ten kilometers from the accident site, the Dragon King Temple, and then drove by Jeep to investigate. They stayed there that night and will continue their investigation today. Director Chen Wenkuan and others flew back to Shanghai around 3:00 PM.

According to Chen last night, he himself did not travel by car after landing in order to take care of the plane, but only saw the wreckage of the crashed passenger plane, which had been moved to the Dragon King Temple, from the air while circling, and most of it was damaged. Later, Bank of China personnel informed him that 17 packages of banknotes had been recovered, but the cause of the passenger plane crash could not be determined at this time.

### Secretary Wu Discusses the Accident; Banknotes Flew Everywhere; Fuselage Did Not Catch Fire; Villagers Scrambled to Pick Them Up, Causing a Sensation Far and Wide

Secretary Wu Lieqi, upon returning to Shanghai, told reporters about the accident: Flight 47 took off at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. At 11:45 AM, it arrived over Changxing. Looking down on Changxing, the hills rose and fell, and the mountain ranges were intertwined. It circled low for two weeks and saw the wreckage of Flight 31 lying on the side of Nong Mountain. Then it went to Changxing City. After landing, it went to Changxing County Hall to visit County Magistrate Cheng. According to County Magistrate Cheng, the mountain roads were rugged, and it would take more than four hours to travel back and forth. He stopped them from entering because he was afraid that they would not be able to return to Shanghai that day due to the short time. He then told in detail about the accident of Flight 31: At about 4:00 PM on the 14th, the people of Changxing saw a plane flying rapidly from the west. Soon they heard a loud noise and thought it was an accident. He hurriedly ordered people to go to the Nengwang Temple on the top of Nong Mountain to investigate. According to the township chief of the area: at that time, the villagers at the foot of Dragon King Temple Mountain saw many pieces of paper falling from the top of the mountain. Knowing that it was something from the plane, they flocked to see it. They were shocked to find that it was colorful banknotes. For a while, they cheered and scrambled to pick them up, causing a sensation among the nearby residents. They rushed forward, fully loaded and returned, because after the banknotes fell, they piled up on the ground. It was easy to pick up, as easy as taking something out of a bag. When the county government personnel arrived, they joined forces with the township chiefs to prohibit the villagers from picking them up and ordered people to quickly collect them in linen bags, totaling twenty bags. At the same time, they sent people to guard the five bodies of the deceased. The fuselage of Flight 31 did not catch fire, it was only smashed to pieces. All the deceased were killed by the impact. The wooden boxes for packing banknotes could not be found. At this point, the twenty bags of banknotes have been transported to the county government for preservation. The Changxing County Government, the Changxing Court Procuratorate, and the local township chiefs have signed and sealed them. The court has also sent people to the scene of the accident to verify the bodies and report to the superiors for the record. The bodies have now been transported to the Changxing County Government.

When Director Chen Wenkuan, Secretary Wu Lieqi, Assistant Manager Zhou Kechang, and others arrived at the Changxing County Government, Manager Chen of the Huzhou branch of the Bank of China had also rushed to Changxing from Huzhou. Together with Zhou, he discussed with the Changxing County Government the process of the banknotes falling and the villagers抢拾picking them up. He电吿telegraphed Shanghai last night. Zhou and Chen are still staying in Changxing, waiting for instructions from their superiors before deciding how to deal with the situation. Except for four people guarding the bodies, Director Chen and Secretary Wu flew back to Shanghai on the original plane at 4:45 PM yesterday afternoon and arrived here at about 5:30 PM. It is scheduled to send a plane to Changxing again tomorrow (the 19th) to transport the bodies to Shanghai.

[Our Report] According to an investigation by the Bureau of Public Health, the various funeral homes and coffin storage facilities in the city are holding 150,000 stockpiled coffins.

After the victory, Xu and others fled, and Ni Qianji hid their property. He was reported by Yu Shuyi, a worker at the silk factory. He was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. First, the informer Yu Shuyi made a statement. Then, the defendant Ni Qianji confessed that the silk he wove was ordinary goods and not for military use. He claimed that Yu Shuyi made a false accusation because his loan application was unsuccessful. Finally, Shi Jinrong, the accountant of Xie Da Xiang, testified in court, proving that the factory's products were ordinary silk, and submitted two ledgers of transactions between Xie Da Xiang and the factory as evidence.

The informer Shen Xiping had an old feud with Zhao. Because Shen Xiping asked him about Zhao Xikui's address, he replied that he did not know, which led to him being falsely accused. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing to another date.

### "Little Shandong" Gathers a Crowd to Harm "Old Man": Fruit Store Manager Stabbed Fourteen Times

[Our Report] At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, in front of Hengye Company at No. 47, Lujiazhai Alley, Sipaillou, Nanshi, Ni Xiangshui (nicknamed "Bomb," 27 years old, from Ningbo), the manager of a fruit store, was suddenly ambushed by more than 20 thugs lying in wait, who used axes and knives to slash at him. He was stabbed fourteen times on the spot, and blood flowed freely, causing him to fall to the ground in extreme pain. The thugs, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, dispersed in a rush. Afterwards, Ni struggled to crawl to the entrance of the alley, where he hired a rickshaw to report the incident to the Yimiao Police Station, which dispatched Inspector Fan Boxiong and police officers Yang Qingyuan, Chen Wanfu, Luo Zhiyuan, and Zhu Daoxian to investigate the scene. Four knives were seized at the scene. The perpetrators were still being closely investigated as of late evening.

According to an investigation by reporters, the victim, Ni Xiangshui, lived at No. 30, Guanyi Street, Nanshi, and is currently the manager of Xiangxing Fruit Store on Fangbang East Road. He has considerable potential influence in the Shiliupu area, with a large number of followers, mostly fruit vendors in the area.

He gathered a crowd to drag out and beat Chen Jigui (37 years old, from Ningbo), the old clerk of the store. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Chen discovered Fang Xingnan, a vendor who had participated in the attack, near Shiliupu. Chen, seeking revenge, also gathered old clerks to question him. However, Fang refused to be outdone and immediately summoned nearby vendors, leading to another brawl. Chen Jigui, Fang Xiangzhang, Zeng Linquan, Ni Xiangyou, Ding Along, and five others from the old clerks' side were beaten and injured. After the police arrived, both sides were taken to the Yimiao Police Station. After learning the details, the injured old clerks were released on bail for medical treatment, while the perpetrators Fang Xingnan, Zhu Jiaxiang, Zhou Hongbao, and Xu Baoting were detained on suspicion of disturbing the peace and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for processing yesterday. The mastermind behind the scenes, "Little Shandong," upon hearing the news, felt he had lost face and went to Ni Xiangyong, asking him to mediate. After Ni investigated the matter, he realized that it was his subordinate's fault and refused to intervene. "Little Shandong," seeing that his plan had failed, harbored resentment in his heart. Yesterday morning, he gathered a group of pickpockets from the Shiliupu area, armed with weapons, and ambushed Ni in Lujiazhai Alley. He then sent several accomplices who knew Ni to his residence, tricking him out. When he arrived at the alley, they attacked him. Ni's leg bone is broken, and his injuries are quite severe.

### Pre-War Deposits Repaid in Silver: Defendant Believes There Is No Legal Basis, Plaintiff Claims It Is In Accordance with Human Sentiment: District Court Concludes Hearing, Sentence Set for the 21st

[Our Report] A lawsuit demanding repayment of pre-war silver dollar deposits with silver dollars or the equivalent in silver at the market price was heard at 9:00 AM yesterday morning in the Civil Division Seven of the District Court, presided over by Judge Dong Qimin. The defendant, Zhongnan Bank, was represented by lawyer Gui Yu. First, the plaintiff's lawyer, Yu Congdao, stated the facts of the case, briefly stating: "The plaintiffs, Shen Haoming, Shen Cui..., Shen Meiling, and Shen Rongling, each deposited 200 silver dollars with Zhongnan Bank on May 26th of the 19th year of the Republic and February 10th of the 20th year, with a term of 15 years, to receive 1,000 silver dollars in principal and interest upon maturity, each with a deposit certificate as proof. The silver dollar deposits matured on May 26th of last year and February 10th of this year, respectively. The bank only repaid 1,000 legal tender, and the difference between the pre-war and current value of the currency is a well-known fact. Therefore, the 1,000 silver dollars due to the plaintiff should be compensated with legal tender according to the market price of silver on the date of repayment, converted at the rate of seven qian and three fen of silver per dollar, in order to be fair." Then, the defendant's lawyer, Gui Yu, stood up and argued: "When the government announced the abolition of silver dollars in the 24th year of the Republic, it stipulated that one legal tender dollar was equal to one silver dollar. There was no difference between legal tender and silver dollars. As for the depreciation of legal tender during the war, it is indeed a fact, and the bank is very sympathetic. However, the plaintiff's request to repay the deposit at the price of silver has no legal basis. Silver dollars have been abolished for a long time and cannot be regarded as currency, so it cannot be accepted." He also stated: "The repayment of 1,000 legal tender dollars is now offered. If the plaintiff believes it is unfair, then they should make a separate claim. The plaintiff's claim to repay with silver dollars is not legal, and the court has no right to make a claim on their behalf. Litigation cases are not considered unless they are made. The court is requested to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit." Lawyer Gui jokingly said: "If the enemy and puppets forcibly exchanged 'Central Reserve Certificates' at a rate of two to one for legal tender, and after the victory, the puppet currency was exchanged for legal tender at a rate of two hundred to one, then 1,000 legal tender dollars before the war would only be worth 2.50 dollars today." Judge Dong Qimin, believing that the facts of the case were clear, announced the conclusion of the debate and set the sentence for the 21st of this month.

### Stabilizing Yarn Prices to Supplement Foreign Exchange: Yarn Spun From Imported Cotton Will Be Purchased By The Government: Next Year's Imported Cotton Quota Estimated at 800,000 Bales: A Small Group Will Be Established to Allocate Quotas

[Our Report] It is reported that when Premier Song convened relevant personnel from the textile industry in Shanghai this time, he expressed that the government would uniformly purchase cotton yarn nationwide to make comprehensive improvements to my country's cotton spinning industry. This move is purely based on the principle of taking from the cotton spinning industry and giving back to the cotton spinning industry. Later, the people attending the meeting all stated: The Chinese people's nature is to admire freedom, and excessive restrictions may not be easy to thoroughly implement and benefit. Therefore, it was decided in principle that the yarn produced from the imported cotton part should still be purchased by the government. As for the domestic cotton part, there may not be excessive restrictions. In order to supply a huge amount of foreign exchange for cotton, the government must recover a part of the cotton yarn for the purpose of stabilizing domestic yarn prices. At the same time, in order to compensate for the huge outflow of the foreign exchange, the government will encourage the export of all materials that can supplement inflammation as much as possible to support it.

As for the quota for imported cotton next year, in addition to investigating the amount of cotton stored by various yarn factories, foreign firms, and flower shops, and the amount of domestic cotton that can be purchased by the end of next year, the amount of raw cotton still lacking will be calculated, which will be used as the imported cotton quota for next year. It is estimated that the quota will be approximately 800,000 bales. At a price of US$175 per bale, the total cost will be US$140 million.

According to news from the Spinning Management Committee: 92 member factories affiliated with the Cotton Spinning Association in the Sixth District have reported their cotton storage volume. According to statistics: The total amount of cotton stored by each factory as of the end of November this year is 220 million pounds, which is enough for each factory to use for an average of 150 days. According to Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the association, all yarn factories in each district of the country must report their cotton storage volume by the deadline, otherwise it will indicate that the factory does not need imported cotton and will lose the right to receive imported cotton in the future.

It is also reported that the Raw Cotton Quota Allocation Review Committee will be composed of Li Gan, Director of the Quota Allocation Office of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Management Committee, Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, and Xi Yushu, Secretary-General of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District.

### Gold Prices Soar Again Yesterday: Peak at 3.41 Million, US Dollar Also Rises by 300 Yuan

Yesterday, gold continued to rise sharply due to the prevailing optimistic sentiment. The limited supply from the Central Bank contributed to this. The morning opened at 3.25 million. After the opening, there was a slight sense of pressure, and the scattered sales were settled, and it fell to 3.17 million. However, the Hakka gangs and those with capital maintained prices, and immediately returned to 3.2 million. People's hearts were firm again, and gradually climbed to 3.29 million before the source of supply and settlement from all parties occurred. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 160 bars at a price of 3.25 million. Later, it once fell to 3.22 million. However, afterwards, people's hearts were still strong, and the buying atmosphere revived. The supply suddenly stalled, and at noon, it broke through the 3.3 million mark again. In the afternoon, it continued to advance, and trading the next day soared to more than 3.41 million before being forced to slightly retreat. As a result, the closing price rose by 165,000 compared to the previous one. Gold ornaments rose to 357,000. Silver dollars were also stable. The implicit dismantling was at par, and the implicit tightening, the interest rate was between 1 jiao and 2 fen to 1 jiao and 5 fen.

Foreign currencies also passively tended to be prosperous, but the rise was not as good as the gold market, because the speculative atmosphere was fading. The US dollar initially fluctuated between 6,000 yuan and 6,200 yuan in the morning. It was mediocre in the middle, and at noon, it rose to between 6,200 and 6,400. In the afternoon, it followed the gold market, rising to 6,500 yuan at the close, an increase of 300 yuan compared to the previous one. Hong Kong dollars were very popular, and the result was also good at 100 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 1,230 yuan to 1,250 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,500 yuan to 1,525 yuan, and the US exchange rate was 20,000 yuan. Only the Hong Kong exchange rate had slightly more transactions, and the rest were just calculated.

### The Joint Treasury Approves the Handling of Production Loans for Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Factories: The Interest Rate is Changed to Four Percent, and the Minimum Number of Looms is Fifty

### Public Bonds Mediocre

Public bonds were extremely lackluster yesterday. The Unification C opened at 1320 yuan in the morning, immediately announcing a slight increase, returning to 1380 yuan, and finally hovering slightly. As a result, A, B, and E each rose by 20 yuan compared to the previous one, Unification C rose by 70 yuan, and Unification D rose by 30 yuan. The turnover was only more than one million yuan.

### Coal Prices Rise Again

The Jiao Zuo lump coal market, the appetite for business is increasingly concentrated, and the market continues to rise again. Bituminous coal fines are still scarce, and the market price is gradually rising. Kaiping No. 2 fines have broken through the 400,000 yuan mark, and the supply is still scarce. Although manufacturers and colleagues previously went to Hong Kong to purchase Hongji white coal fines as a group, the market is now reviving due to high foreign exchange rates and remote delivery, and the price is shouted two or three million yuan higher per ton.

### Tea Market Turning Elegant

In the foreign firm tea market, the buying interest in Zhenzhou Xinwen is still surging, but the idea of the cargo side raising prices is like bamboo shoots after a rain, so the market is unusually elegant. In terms of prices, those with better quality each look at a show and knock on 170,000 yuan. Those with middle grades are stronger than before. For other teas, high-grade Chen Qimen, the British firm Renji, have been happy to absorb them, but the market stock is about to be exhausted. The trend is that demand exceeds supply, and it often progresses. As for Chen Zhong Qimen, which has been stable for a long time, it was still flat in the morning, and in an instant, everyone followed Rong. The imports and exports of Chen Chou Zhen and Chen Zhenmei and other flower colors are similar, and the market lacks changes. Domestic sales of red and green tea are still lifeless.

### Issues of Ordered Imports: Those Shipped Before November 24 Have a Chance to Be Approved: Application Procedures Take Too Long: Merchants Strive to Simplify

[Our Report] Regarding the handling of goods ordered abroad before November 17, the authorities have officially announced that goods shipped before November 24 may be considered for import approval. According to relevant personnel, there are many types of such orders. Generally, cotton may be able to obtain import permits, and newsprint also has the hope of import. Hardware goods are quite problematic. In addition, for goods shipped out after the 24th, if the owners return them to the original ship in accordance with the regulations, they will lose commercial credit and the shipping expenses will be even greater. Therefore, they are making efforts to hope that the government can handle it leniently. People engaged in the import and export industry are also deeply concerned about the possibility of allocating remaining materials to importers. They believe that although there are many such materials, it is doubtful whether they can meet market needs. Even if there are valuable civilian goods, they may have already fallen into the hands of merchants with special backgrounds, and the legitimate merchant income may be the remaining of the remaining materials. The government is currently implementing an import licensing system on one hand and shipping large quantities of surplus materials on the other, striving for a balance of international payments. The intentions are good. However, under the current system, the procedures are cumbersome and time-consuming, and merchants are very inconvenient. For example, pigments have become rare goods in the world market today, and orders must be quick to not miss the opportunity. However, if a request for approval telegram comes from abroad today, it will take two weeks for Chinese importers to go through the application procedures, and the goods have already been ordered by others. Recently, the import and export industry has been collectively striving to simplify the application procedures. According to the industry's observations, as more and more remaining materials are shipped, the allocation of materials to importers will become a reality when the import quota is finalized.

### Although Manufacturers Have Allocated Goods, Rayon Prices Still Rise; Completely Affected by Gold Notes

Although yesterday rayon manufacturers allocated goods for sale, the price of gold notes rose again, causing public excitement. Therefore, the market rose slightly again yesterday. The price of "150" brand bright rayon was the highest, with "Tian Ju" brand bright rayon even asking for 4.5 million yuan. Generic brands also required 400,000 yuan to be supplied. However, transactions were very scarce. Factory-direct warp yarn also showed a slight increase in sales yesterday. O-grade goods were traded at 4,525,000 yuan. Goods below E-grade were unavailable. Spot goods were offered at 4.1 million yuan. Dried warp yarn also rose yesterday. Within 30 counts, five bundles of goods were opened at 3.28 million yuan, and another bundle was offered at 3.15 million yuan, an increase of 780,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Silk fabrics were unremarkable, and transactions were very few. The production area of Hangzhou goods has already reported price increases, but there is no outlet in the Shanghai market, and prices remain unchanged.

### Market Flooded with Goods for Auction, Yarn Market Shows No Improvement

Yesterday, the yarn market was sluggish and weak. Although gold notes soared to new heights, yarn prices still showed no improvement. The market was flooded with 20-count yarn for auction, and because there were no tax invoices, the selling price was particularly low. At the same time, customer demand was limited, and the market in other cities was weak. Therefore, the price of yarn did not rise slightly due to the high price of gold, which is a rare and welcome phenomenon in recent times.

### Tinplate Prices Soar

Tinplate is used in the manufacture of oil cans and canned goods, and the demand is very large. In the early post-war period, a considerable amount of goods arrived. Later, due to the lack of emphasis on the use of tinplate abroad, the products also decreased. Several months ago, exports were once banned, causing panic in the city and prices to rise step by step. Although the ban was later relaxed, the arrival of 26-gauge and 24-gauge large tinplate was still rare, resulting in stable prices in the city that have not fallen. Recently, the overseas pricing has increased, and the trend is upward again. The price of 26-gauge has increased by 500,000 yuan per , and the price of 24-gauge has increased by 1 million yuan per box. However, there are still many inventories of double-width tinplate, and the price is stable.

### Xiamen Oranges Arrive in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Peide" ship returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou, stopping at Xiamen along the way, and transported more than 7,000 pieces of oranges and watermelons from Guangzhou. They were imported on the morning of the day before yesterday (Sunday) and are currently docked at Jinzhan for unloading. In addition, the "Haixiang" ship returned directly to Shanghai from Xiamen yesterday, carrying more than 5,000 pieces of oranges.

### Market Conditions Are Unpredictable, Food Prices Fall Across the Board

A total of more than 13,000 piculs of rice arrived from both the north and south. The weather was clear, and public sentiment turned lax. Southern japonica rice fell by 3,000 yuan, and northern japonica rice also fell by 2,000 yuan. Indica rice followed with a decrease of over 1,000 yuan. "Bai Yuan" rice fell by 3,000 yuan, and "Yin Yuan" rice also fell by 2-3,000 yuan. The trend has stopped rising and turned to falling. The arrival of oil on the market was abundant, and all oils fell one after another after opening. Raw oil and sesame oil both fell by 3-5,000 yuan, soybean oil also squeezed down by 2-3,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil and clear oil both fell by 3-4,000 yuan. The soybean market softened, and prices fell by 3-500 yuan across the board. The arrival and sale of red sorghum were both scarce, and there was no basis for movement for the time being. Broad beans followed the downstream of various goods, seeing a small decrease of 1,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were stable due to the shortage of goods. Raw peanuts from the Guangdong region fluctuated, tight at first and then weak, resulting in no gains or losses. In the soybean cake trade, Shantou was lively, and Taiwan saw a slight increase of 2-300 yuan.

### The Market Is Like a Battlefield; Chinese Stocks Engage in a Fierce Battle Between Bulls and Bears; Yongxin Yarn and Xinyuan Both Hit the Price Limit

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were like being on a battlefield, rising and falling sharply. The major yarn and cotton dealers attacked from the east and west, and the fluctuations were very large. The opening prices of all stocks in the morning were already high. After No. 38 and No. 177 offered to sell at high prices, they immediately fell.

No. 152, No. 226, No. 89, No. 36, No. 76, and No. 232 continued to buy. The off-market price was extremely high, forming a situation of demand exceeding supply. The surface was extremely narrow, buying orders were unprecedented, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. Near noon, the price rose by more than 70 yuan.

After No. 215, No. 76, No. 145, No. 207, and No. 88 came to sell, it began to fall back by more than 20 yuan. However, No. 218, No. 89, No. 28, No. 133, and others rushed to cover their positions. After that, it was announced that the price limit had been hit twice. No. 160, No. 102, No. 61, No. 89, No. 185, and No. 83 all sold, and it still fell back. Struggling endlessly, although No. 22 and others came in, because No. 198, No. 207, No. 181, No. 47, and No. 232 all sold, and No. 157 bought from time to time, but public sentiment was already timid due to the supply of financial assistance, and gradually fell.

### Special Institutionalization in Taiwan: A Cross-Section of the Monopoly Bureau and the Trade Bureau

— Taipei, 4th (Airmail) Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun of this newspaper

Taiwan, called the "vacuum zone" of the economy, still retains its original special posture more than a year after its restoration. In the past, the phenomenon was: the Bank of Taiwan refused the establishment of the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks. When the legal tender and customs gold, which were circulating throughout the country, arrived at the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung, they became like waste paper; otherwise, they would be swallowed by middlemen and banks for a third or two of the exchange rate. Merchants paid the national unified tax domestically, but their cargo was most easily confiscated by the Monopoly Bureau and the Police Bureau. They either said that this was an order from the executive authority, or that it conflicted with the province's monopoly policy. As for what happened to the confiscated goods, it is easy to cause problems.

This state of blockage caused by the isolation from the domestic economy fully illustrates the special style performed by the local authorities in this province due to their special views. This style has been criticized and attacked by all parties, but until now, except for the Monopoly Bureau which has been revised, no clues of reform have been discovered. The chief loves to obtain Taiwan, and he insists on developing national capital and the principle of people's livelihood, moving them to the entire island as an experiment. However, the difficult problems in reality have completely hindered the economic ideals he wants to practice.

Monopoly Bureau: Large Organization

Revenue from Five Monopoly Items Exceeds 700 Million

As a large organization in Taiwan Province, the Monopoly Bureau has a headquarters in Taipei, which is divided into eleven sections and offices, eleven branch offices in the province, two offices, two cigarette factories, two camphor factories, thirteen wineries, two match factories, as well as the Fanzi Field Factory, the Metrology Institute, the Tobacco Testing Institute, and 41 units that have been received and are related to the business, such as beer, refined camphor, camphor oil, printing, wine bottles, and glucose companies. Not only are these units unclear to the general public, but the bureau itself has not been able to fully understand them.

Director Ren Weijun took over the entire bureau on November 1 last year. Originally, two-thirds of the factories were shut down, but most of them resumed work within ten days. Now there are more than 6,500 employees, distributed in various units, working for the manufacture and sale of monopoly goods.

The value of the bureau's assets received, calculated at Taiwan dollar purchase prices, is 20,194,041 ares of land, equivalent to 8,118,550 yuan; machinery worth 8,308,097 yuan; buildings totaling 4,869 ares, equivalent to 16,972,719 yuan; raw materials worth 16,239,741 yuan; materials worth 2,786,370 yuan; other materials totaling 3,192,118 yuan; manufacturing equipment worth 1,598,404 yuan; and transportation equipment worth 344,221 yuan. Finished and semi-finished products are excluded.

During the Japanese era, the highest revenue from eight monopoly items (salt, camphor, opium, tobacco, wine, gasoline, weights and measures, matches) accounted for more than 49% of the total revenue of the province, and the revenue in 1940 exceeded 100 million Japanese yen. After the takeover, opium was explicitly abolished, gasoline was no longer necessary to be monopolized, and table salt was handed over to the Salt Administration Bureau on April 1 of this year. Therefore, the current monopoly items are mainly camphor, tobacco, wine (including rice wine, beer), matches, and weights and measures. According to the bureau's estimate, the revenue for this year is more than 700 million Taiwan dollars, accounting for more than 32% of the total revenue of the province.

Benefits Lower Than Unified Tax

Old Policies Are Ready to Be Completely Changed

Director Ren told reporters that it is unreasonable for democratic countries to have a monopoly system. When China's wartime monopoly system was established, he served as a member of the Chongqing Monopoly Design Committee. From 1940 to 1941, he served as the director of the Monopoly Bureau in Hunan. Later, it was abolished due to normal tax revenue, lack of raw materials, and the tense war situation. At that time, he was serving as a member of the examination committee for the Ministry of Finance's monopoly. He explained that the difficulties he currently feels are (1) high labor costs, (2) lack of raw materials, and (3) transportation difficulties. In addition, the continuous influx of private goods from the mainland has affected revenue. However, according to the actual situation, what are the achievements of this isolationist policy? It is obvious that because the products of each factory are freely produced only based on production capacity and raw material conditions, the selling price is high, the quality is poor, and mountains of cigarettes are unsalable. The cost of beer is 20 Taiwan dollars, but it is retailed for 70 yuan, exceeding the price of Shanghai Yihua Beer. American-made camphor has taken away the market for 80% of Taiwan's camphor production, and because of the huge organization, poor management, and inadequate supervision, cost accounting cannot be reported, and it is easier for corrupt elements to gather and seek profits. On August 2, Chen Jidi, the director of the Chiayi branch, committed suicide due to poverty. It has been investigated and found that he embezzled 600,000 yuan of monopoly goods and committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The newly appointed director of the branch, Zhou Bizhang, and Liu Chicao, the director of the Nanmen factory, have recently been detained for corruption, as well as several other cases, which are sufficient to illustrate the failure of the personnel supervision system to be perfected.

The monopoly system, a product of inheriting the financial policies of the colony, is currently obviously focused on revenue. Director Ren said that from November last year to the end of June this year, the number of treasury deposits was 206 million yuan, and the total value of inventory materials, finished products, and accounts receivable was still more than 670 million yuan. There was no loss, and there was still a surplus. Since July, the operating income of various places has doubled compared to June, and there have been profits in July and August. However, according to the opinion of the strict finance department, the number that can be paid to the treasury is much less than the original budget. Monopoly and unified tax are different. The former's benefits are higher than the latter. If the benefits are the same or lower, the method must be completely re-examined. In fact, since July, the Monopoly Bureau has designated various branches to adopt a contracted system, except for the number stipulated to be paid to the bureau, its administrative expenses are paid from the excess number; otherwise, salaries may not be paid. This kind of malpractice of the modern financial system has been exemplified.

The chief himself said that he is very anxious about the monopoly revenue, because neither the central government nor the provinces have this system, so many disputes and criticisms have arisen. He further explained that the cigarettes and wine he saw along the way during his southern tour were not from the Monopoly Bureau. In the past, when Japan occupied the mainland, it also implemented a monopoly, so it works in Taiwan. He bluntly said: "In principle, I advocate monopoly. If it doesn't work, it may be simpler to levy a unified tax and improve the products, which may increase revenue. This is a policy issue, and even if we want to change the method, we must have preparation time." The authorities have revealed a consideration of the existence or abolition of the monopoly, which has no future.

Trade Bureau Denies Control

Main Business: Import, Export, and Distribution

Another financial focus in Taiwan Province is placed on the Trade Bureau, which is also a product of Taiwan's special circumstances. They first took over the "Taiwan Important Materials Group," the highest form of Japanese strengthening control of Taiwan's trade. After 200,000 Japanese troops were repatriated, they began to take over the assets of Mitsui, Mitsubishi's Taiwan branch, and their affiliated institutions. Originally, it used the name of a company, but because it could not follow the company law in law, it was changed to the current bureau on February 1.

As the name suggests, the Trade Bureau's business is mainly import, export, and distribution. Director Yu Baixi especially explained to reporters that they took over the Japanese control institutions, but did not take over the Japanese control policies. The only administrative control item they handle is the prohibition of private sugar smuggling. The reason for taking such measures is (1) Taiwan Province suffered great losses during the war, and grasping material exchange can be used for reconstruction. (2) The price of sugar outside the province is about ten times higher than that in the province, and a small number of adventurous merchants cannot be allowed to earn huge profits. (3) If the only sugar left in the province is exchanged with luxury goods and unnecessary goods outside the province, it will inevitably disperse the strength. On August 5, this ban was also lifted. Now only food is allowed to circulate within eight regions in the province, but export is still prohibited. He said that now it is 100% business, and not control at all. He continued to state that the position of the Trade Bureau is equal to that of merchants. It concentrates manpower and material resources to purchase and export materials for various units, avoid waste, and adjust surpluses and deficiencies according to the urgency and importance. If merchants entrust it, it is happy to accept.

In the past six months, the bureau's business center has been (1) exporting materials such as 7,017 tons of sugar, 20,916 tons of coal, 316 tons of camphor, 485 boxes of tea, 417 boxes of wood, and 1,000 boxes of oranges, which cannot be compared with the annual surplus of 200 million Taiwan dollars in the heyday before the war. (2) Importing materials mainly include 100,000 bolts of cloth, 90,900 bags of flour, 7,256 tons of fertilizer, 3,029 tons of soybean cake, 2,532 tons of peanut cake, and other rapeseed cake, etc. (3) Distributing 90,900 bags of flour to remedy the food shortage, 100,000 bolts of cloth, and contracting 52 dealers in the province to distribute rubber products and calcium carbide, etc. Offices have been set up in Keelung, Kaohsiung, and Taichung in the province. Outside the province, in addition to Shanghai, offices are being prepared to be established in Hong Kong, Qingdao, Tianjin, Dalian, Fuzhou, Tokyo, etc. The distribution mechanism in the province is also being prepared to be completed recently. The value of materials that can be exported in these six months is 70 million Taiwan dollars, and the value of imported materials such as fertilizer, cloth, and machinery is 20 million Taiwan dollars, which can obtain a net profit of more than 270 million yuan.

Two Kinds of People Oppose the Trade Bureau

Seizing Monopoly Interests by Cutting Off Commodities

Director Yu further explained that there are two kinds of people who are trying their best to oppose the Trade Bureau. One is those who are limited by traditional political relations and intentionally oppose it, which cannot be explained. The other is merchants with vested interests, such as Dagong Enterprise Company, which uses capital from Taiwan Province, and merchants from Min, Wen, and Shanghai in the mainland. After the restoration, they focused on fertilizer. As a result, chemical fertilizers were shipped from Shanghai at 400,000 yuan per ton, but they were sold at a price of 180,000 yuan in legal tender. This loss-making business was because they did not understand the actual situation in the province. In the past, the 500,000 tons of fertilizer needed annually were subject to strict control and quantitative distribution. They sold the fertilizer at a low price, attempting to make up for the loss through food, which was frustrated. As a result, it aroused the opposition of this group of people. He concluded with the following words: "The Trade Bureau is not a profit-oriented organization, but a business organization that adjusts people's livelihood and engages in construction! As of June, the amount paid to the treasury was 100 million yuan."

On the other side of his explanation, people have seen the recent prospects of the merchant style. The Trade Bureau aims to make profits by raising sugar prices, and the achievements of this painful strategy are limited. It cuts off commodity trade and seizes monopoly interests in domestic and foreign transactions. In the first provincial assembly meeting, a councilor said: The reason why officials and people are separated now is mostly due to the Trade Bureau. The central government has ordered the abolition of the trade law, which is really inappropriate to use in this province and must be abolished. Obviously, under the monopoly where merchants should not profit, this all-inclusive and specialized trade system has caused dissatisfaction among people inside and outside the province. People are all recalling the trade companies of various provinces during the war. The economic model of feudal separatism has deepened the barriers between provinces and caused the economy itself to shrink. However, Chief Chen Yi did not want a small number of merchants to obtain huge profits, and attempted to use the Trade Bureau to purchase and sell in a unified manner, so that the government could make money and use it for the people. He firmly believed that this was the economic theory instructed by President Sun Yat-sen! (August)

### Indian Contemporary Sage Aurobindo

— Delhi Air Dispatch, Our Correspondent in India, Zhou Xiangguang

Aurobindo, may my reverence and worship reach you!

Today I see your body, filled with wisdom;

If I see it on another day, I will not have praised you enough!

Aurobindo, may my reverence and worship reach you! — Tagore

On the shores of the Indian Ocean, in the French territory of Pondicherry, resides the contemporary sage Sri Aurobindo. He has lived here for over thirty years, and for the past fifteen years, he has remained silent, except when discussing matters of philosophy with the Mother, Melar. His purpose is to transform all living beings into divinity and guide them to enlightenment. Scholars from all over the world travel great distances to have the honor of meeting him. Thousands of people visit each year, but only a few people in our country know of him. Is this due to the obstruction of the towering Mount Sumeru? Although, many in our country know of Gandhi, Tagore, Jinnah, and Nehru, it is regrettable that few know of Aurobindo, the leader of the Hindu religion worshiped by these three hundred million Indians. The writer traveled to Pondicherry to visit Aurobindo and returned with deep emotions. November 24th marks the 35th anniversary of Aurobindo's renunciation of the world and pursuit of spiritual practice. I will use this occasion to recount his life and introduce him to the people of our country, and express my admiration.

The Venerable Old Man with an Imposing Demeanor

Aurobindo is 74 years old this year, with white hair and a youthful complexion, and an imposing demeanor that inspires awe. He was born on August 15, 1872, in Calcutta. His father, Krishna Nath Ghose, was a famous educator in Bengal, but he wanted his children to receive a complete English-style education. Therefore, when Aurobindo was five years old, he sent him to St. Paul's English School in Darjeeling. At the age of seven, he sent him and his two brothers to England to study at a private English school. At the age of thirteen, he entered St. Paul's School in London. Five years later, he entered King's College, Cambridge University, and received scholarships for Greek and Latin. After graduating, he passed all the written examinations for the Indian Civil Service Examination with top marks. However, he did not want to work in administration, and in the final equestrian test, he did not participate, so he could not obtain formal qualifications. If Aurobindo had been willing to work in administration, his position in society today would have been no less than that of a High Court judge or a provincial governor. Later, Aurobindo met the Prince of Baroda State in England, and at his request, he returned to India in 1893 to work in the state treasury, while also serving as the vice-principal of the State College. Before his return to India, his father passed away, and he was unable to see him one last time, which he regretted.

Long Residence in England, Proficient in Foreign Languages

Aurobindo lived in England for many years and was deeply influenced by Western civilization. He was a scholar of Greek and Latin and was proficient in French, German, and Italian literature. He was particularly proficient in Dante's Divine Comedy and Goethe's Faust. He was also highly proficient in Sanskrit, Pali, and Bengali. He translated the Sanskrit work "Vikrama-Urvasi" ("The Hero and the Nymph") by the ancient Indian poet Kalidas. Several volumes of Aurobindo's poems and essays have been published. At the same time, he began to practice yoga, making rapid progress. His poems and essays are superb and ethereal, and his recently published collection of poems and essays is a rare work in the literary world. He married Miss Milly at this time, but Aurobindo did not enjoy the pleasures of marital life. He often said to his attendants: "We should take lofty thoughts and ordinary life as the main purpose of establishing a family." Until 1906, Aurobindo left Baroda State and returned to Calcutta, despite the earnest attempts of the Prince to retain him. At this time, Aurobindo began to engage in practical political activities. He first served as the principal of the Bengal National College. The British dismissed him because of his association with the anti-British affairs of the "Motherland Daily." He was later reinstated until he was arrested and imprisoned.

Once Formed a Party and Became its Leader

As the chief writer of the "Motherland Daily," Aurobindo's arguments were very different from those of his contemporaries. At that time, most people in India advocated a self-governing government within the British Empire, but Aurobindo advocated an absolutely free and independent country. He also regarded the awakening of the national spirit as the most important thing. Aurobindo organized the Nationalist Party and became its leader. In 1907, he presided over the All-India Nationalist Conference in Surat, which suddenly awakened Indian politics. At that time, the poet Tagore was traveling in Europe and made a special trip to Pondicherry to visit Aurobindo, saying: "We are waiting for your perfect voice to spread, and the motherland will awaken in your fame." Later, Aurobindo's younger brother, Birendra Ghosh, organized a revolutionary group. The British government suspected that Aurobindo was planning from behind the scenes and arrested him in May 1908. He was released from prison in May of the following year. During his one-year imprisonment, he devoted himself to yoga and attained enlightenment. After being released from prison, he saw that his comrades in the party were scattered and felt that the essence of the political movement was nothing more than a manifestation of a religious revival movement. Therefore, in February 1910, he set sail from Calcutta to Pondicherry to continue his secluded practice, in order to realize his great ambition of transforming mankind from the ordinary to the sacred. At that time, the Indian National Congress still hoped that Aurobindo would come out of seclusion and participate in the political movement, and offered him the position of chairman, but he politely declined. Finally, Mr. Chitaranjan Das of the Congress Party visited Aurobindo and urged him to come out of seclusion. Aurobindo replied: "Chittaranjan, I will no longer participate in the affairs of the human world with my original thoughts and inspiration. I am pursuing the highest goal. If my ambition can be realized, then I will use this as a foundation for the beginning of my new career." As far as I can see, what is the purpose of Aurobindo's words? His monthly magazine "Arya" can explain its meaning. This monthly magazine was published in 1914, just after Aurobindo had spent four years in seclusion.

Writings Throughout His Life Numbering Hundreds

Aurobindo's writings throughout his life number hundreds of volumes. The most important of these are the two great works, "The Life Divine" and "Essays on the Gita," both of which contain more than two million words. All his arguments are to expound on the spirit and wisdom, as well as yoga arguments. The rest of the articles include ancient Indian culture and civilization, the true meaning of the Vedas, the evolution of the human race, the creation and style of poetry, and the purpose of universal harmony. The monthly magazine "Arya" was discontinued in 1921. The magazine that has succeeded it is the "Advent," which is compiled by his disciples and aims at Aurobindo's philosophy. It is published by the Sri Aurobindo Library in Madras, India. There are also the "Aurobindo Annual Report" and "Quarterly," which are published by the Aurobindo Philosophical Society in Calcutta and Bombay. Their purpose is the same as that of "Advent." Soon after Aurobindo settled in Pondicherry, the Mother, Mear, arrived in India from Japan and visited Aurobindo. The Mother is French and is 69 years old this year, but she looks like she is in her thirties. She had a wish to practice spiritual practice since she was young. When she grew up,

Recent Photograph of Aurobindo (Sent by Zhou Xiangguang, Our Correspondent in India) She devoted herself to visiting and learning about the Tao. Her footprints have spread throughout Europe and Asia. She has profound attainments in Eastern and Western philosophy. Judging from the various books she has written, she has indeed attained enlightenment. Today, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram is presided over by her.

The Philosophy of "The Life Divine" is Profound

The Aurobindo Ashram is located in the east of Pondicherry, facing the Indian Ocean. There are more than one hundred buildings in the ashram, with beautiful scenery, fragrant flowers and birds, and lush bamboo forests. It is indeed a sacred place for spiritual practice. There are more than 400 monks and nuns in the ashram, all of whom are contemporary Indian artists, musicians, poets, writers, engineers, and doctors. They devote their entire lives to following Aurobindo's spiritual practice in order to realize Aurobindo's "Month of the Divine Life."

Aurobindo's advocated "The Life Divine" is different from ancient Indian yoga. When people engage in yoga, once they succeed, their mind and body will inevitably separate and leave. The Buddhist concept of entering Nirvana means this. However, Aurobindo's philosophy of the Divine Life splits into two paths and returns to the same destination: one is ascent, and the other is descent. Ascent refers to the process from enlightenment to complete enlightenment, which is what the Buddha called attaining Bodhi and the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom. Descent refers to the process after attaining Bodhi, where one descends their wisdom and not only enters into the spirit, but also penetrates into the body, so that this body is transformed into divinity. From this, we can know that Aurobindo's philosophy requires people to create benefits for mankind in the human world after attaining enlightenment, and not for their own personal gain. It is broad and profound, and it develops what predecessors have not developed. No wonder the French writer Romain Rolland praised it: "Mr. Aurobindo brings together Eastern and Western philosophy into one body and melts the essence into one furnace!" The truth of the ancient Chinese immortals' "Three-Phase Coordination and Understanding of Reality" is quite similar to Aurobindo's philosophy. Unfortunately, our language and writing are not yet resolved, so we cannot verify each other. The Buddha said that there is only one truth in the world, then Aurobindo's philosophy is the same as the philosophy of our Chinese immortals. The manifestation of the truth is waiting for someone with a heart to do it.

China and India are as closely related as lips and teeth, and their cultural exchanges have lasted for two thousand years. During this awe-inspiring period of exchanges, no wars have occurred, which is regarded as a beautiful story by historians. Moreover, our country's culture has been deeply influenced by Buddhist thought, and the revival of Neo-Confucianism in the Song and Ming dynasties is one example. In the future, if we want to promote academic and cultural exchanges between China and India, as well as the friendship between the two nations, we must study the spirit of India's nation-building. Aurobindo's philosophy can be said to represent this trend. In the future, if we want to lay a foundation stone for world peace, we must devote ourselves to Aurobindo's philosophy. November 24th is the 36th anniversary of Aurobindo's renunciation of the world and pursuit of spiritual practice. The signatory is unable to go to worship the master due to official duties, so I will translate a verse from the "Rigveda" to wish him from afar:

"Arise, O Spirit!

Strive forward!

The night has passed,

The dawn appears!"

### The Blocking of the Yellow River Estuary: Can the Night Work Be Completed by January Next Year? Will Undergo a Second Test of "Time"

— Zhengzhou Air Dispatch, Our Correspondent in Zhengzhou, Fan Shiqin

Time is very ruthless. If you ask it to be a witness, it will tell the truth without any politeness. The Yellow River Huayuankou blocking project was supposed to be completed before July 1st of this year, but if you ask time to be a witness, it will just say "no" and be done with it. Now it is preparing to testify for the second time on February 1st next year. This makes us wonder, will it still say "no" at that time, or will it change its mind and say "yes"?

There are always many reasons for the failure of a thing. There are many reasons for the first failure to block Huayuankou: everything is always connected with politics, so when we talk about the Huayuankou blocking project, we cannot avoid talking about the CCP issue. The lower reaches of the ancient Yellow River channel, more than a hundred miles downstream of Huayuankou, are almost entirely in the hands of the CCP. The purpose of blocking the estuary is to divert water into the ancient channel, so dredging the ancient channel and blocking the Huayuankou estuary are one and the same thing. Therefore, in March, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission sent a surveying team to the lower reaches to survey and estimate the earthwork for the restoration of the ancient channel embankment, but as soon as they arrived in Kaocheng, they were blocked by the Communist army. As a result, the development of the Huayuankou blocking project on this side was delayed. In April, two rock drilling machines of the Lvwangxiang blocking bureau near Xinxiang were smashed to pieces by the Communist army, and several people were also captured at that time, which also affected part of the project. When stones were thrown in May, the CCP saw that the project was about to be completed, so it sent people to Huayuankou to make trouble and raised serious "protests." As a result, it was agreed that only two meters of stones would be thrown first, which of course delayed this part of the project again. Secondly, the issue of willow branches and workers is really embarrassing for us Chinese. The rock drilling machines, pile drivers, cranes, wooden stakes, cement, flour, and even wooden boats needed for the project were all shipped from the United States by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) on schedule. We only needed to supply some willow branches and workers. The Chinese countryside is indeed poor enough, and willow branches have also become valuable. It is said that at that time, one cart of willow branches would cost about 40,000 yuan. Even if the local area had these willow branches and the people could afford to lose money, there would not be enough means of transportation to transport them. For example, the willow branches that Zhongmu County should send would take a year and a half to transport even if all the county's ox carts and small carts were mobilized. The willow branches became a problem, and the project sometimes had to stare blankly and could not proceed. Workers were supposed to be hired, but somehow they became conscripted workers. At the same time, because the treatment was too poor, some workers ran away and some escaped, which also hindered the progress of the project. As for the engineering aspects, we are laymen and dare not say anything. We only heard them say that a certain consultant should not have insisted on driving the piles in, and why did they saw them off when they could not drive them in? It was also not okay to insist on throwing stones down. There were many such words, which shows that there were also problems in the engineering.

The reason why these past events are written down is to explain that the water situation has won the time on the project. In mid-June, the upper reaches of the Yellow River rose sharply, and the flow rate reached 17,000 cubic meters per second, and it was difficult to continue the Huayuankou blocking project at a flow rate of more than 4,000 cubic meters per second. Therefore, one-third of the large wooden piles that had just been driven were washed away all at once, and the failure was announced.

Zhao Shouyu, the chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, resigned from his concurrent position as the director of the blocking and restoration bureau, and was replaced by Zhu Guangcai, a water conservancy expert. After Zhu arrived, the 8-meter-deep gap at the washed-away wooden pile suddenly became 18 meters deep due to the water erosion. It was impossible to drive in wooden piles, and it was even more impossible to speed up the throwing of stones, otherwise the water would erode deeper and deeper, and the flow would become more and more rapid. This seemed to be deliberately posing a difficult problem for the new director. According to Director Zhu, it is more difficult to improve this situation than to start over, because the deepest water level at the beginning was only 8 meters, but now it has reached 18 meters. At the same time, the water is concentrated in this deep place and flows turbulently and rapidly, so it is absolutely impossible to block it by force. Therefore, his method is to silt up the deep place and to divert the water evenly, at least diverting a part of the flow to the side. For this reason, it is first necessary to make the water level average high, so that the water in the rapid place will slow down, and the slow flow will become silt, and the deep place will also be silted up. Director Zhu's method of raising the water level at the mouth is to build a new bridge 350 meters behind the blocking estuary, where the water level is only 4 meters deep. This new bridge can not only raise the water level at the mouth, but also serve as the second line of defense for the blocking project. That is, if there is no way to repair the piles and throw stones on the old bridge, then another stove can be built on the new bridge to block the estuary. After this new bridge was built, there was a lot of opposition from the outside, thinking that this was a waste, and thinking that the old bridge project was so large that it was not enough to block it, so could the new bridge still help? Now the effect of this new bridge has already been seen. The place where the water was rapid has slowed down, and the 18-meter water depth at the bottom has been reduced to 13 meters. At the same time, it should be noted here that the reason why the water situation can be changed is that throwing willow bundles in front of the old bridge has a side effect. Those willow bundles are always two or three feet long, with large stones inside, and two or three hundred people pile them bundle by bundle into the water. The wooden piles can be repaired in two or three days, and then the throwing of stones will continue.

What the blocking and restoration bureau is now worried about is not the issue of willow branches, because this difficulty has been alleviated since the method of self-purchase and self-transportation was changed. It is also not the issue of workers, because now only more than 10,000 workers are needed, and their treatment has also been improved. The most problematic thing now is the stone material. The Railway Bureau can only transport one trainload of stone material per day, and they hope to be able to transport five or six trainloads. The blocking and restoration bureau believes that stone material is equivalent to ammunition for war, and without enough stone material, they have no way to fight.

Regarding the issue of the lower reaches and the CCP, this is the 150 million yuan relocation fee for the residents on the riverbed, which has been decided to be issued, but the technical aspects are being studied on how to issue it. Chairman Zhao of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and American consultant Tadd decided to go to Shandong with CCP representative Zhao Mingfu in the near future to investigate the downstream embankment restoration project. The progress of the project, the extent of the progress, and how the funds will be handled in the future will all be revealed in the next episode.

This time, the Yellow River Huayuankou is determined to be completed before the end of January next year, otherwise, when the freezing period arrives, ice blocks will come like mountains and seas, and the partially completed project will not be able to withstand the impact of the ice blocks. At that time, not only will the project suffer, but the new dikes in the flooded area will probably be difficult to protect. The disaster will not only affect eastern Henan, but northern Anhui will also be submerged. This depends on how time will testify for the second time for the blocking of the estuary.

### The World Art Center: Stepping into the Studio of Female Professor Pan Yuliang

— Air Dispatch from the 4th, Special Correspondent in Paris, Wang Ren

Able to use the brush to create magic, light or heavy makeup as desired, literary fortune has opened a new record, and a famous teacher is seen in the art world.

This is what I wrote after visiting the studio of Professor Pan Yuliang at the Scientific and Cultural Congress in Paris. Paris is the center of world art. The residences of artists in the 14th arrondissement are always built with studios. Most of them are full of reality and face north to get light that is suitable for painting. Also, the rooms are taller than ordinary residences. All studios should be located on the top floor.

Because sunlight shining on paper or cloth changes the colors, it is difficult to see accurately. Facing south has too much sunlight, which is absolutely not suitable for drawing. The east and west sides are exposed to sunlight in the morning and evening, which is also not very suitable for painting. Professor Pan Yuliang, a female professor at Central University who won the Rome Prize in her early years and stayed in France and then Italy, also has a studio facing north, in a long alley in the 14th arrondissement, in front of a two-story building in a hidden courtyard. The old house has a high gate, which is full of secluded interest. There is a key on the door, and it opens when pressed. Inside is a large courtyard, and it is not easy for outsiders to know it. Knocking on the door at dusk is like guessing a riddle, and it takes a long time to find it.

On a Sunday in late November 1946, I accepted a letter of invitation and made a special trip to enjoy tea. The guests were all famous figures in the art world, including the strongest among the twelve people who stayed in France, and Professor Pan was no less than a leader among them. Pan's residence is divided into two rooms, the outer room near the door is the studio. The three characters "Pan Yuliang" are signed next to the door, and the names of the visitors who have visited are inscribed vertically and horizontally on the left and right sides of the famous name, like the empty corridor of the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon in West Lake. The original colors of the celebrities can be imagined as soon as they arrive at the door.

Pan has been away from the country for nearly eight years, and she is concerned about people's livelihood and talks freely about national affairs. She said that Chinese celebrities are not only not good at enjoying themselves, but also not good at showing off. If she herself is engaged in painting, if she is shocked by the beautiful name of "world-class", and if she thinks about other national athletes racing to show off, she will definitely not have the chance to win. Those who heard it all agreed that she knew what she was talking about. After talking for a long time, she excused herself and walked north from there. The avenues she passed along the way were brightly lit, and the joy of the night was very evident. Compared with the dynamic state in front of the lights in Paris, the silver candles of the Ghost Festival on the 30th of the seventh lunar month of the Chinese old calendar and the bright moonlight on the ground when young women walked to the moon on the 15th night of the eighth lunar month, are like a small wizard seeing a great wizard, and they cannot be mentioned on the same day.

### Taipei Observes the Lunar Eclipse

— Taipei Airmail Report, Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu

It was the full moon day of the eleventh lunar month. Before 5 PM, the sky was filled with clouds, carrying a heavy feeling of rain. However, after 5 PM, the weather became exceptionally clear. The lunar eclipse observation reception, scheduled to be held tonight at Taipei Zhongshan Hall by the Taipei Astronomical Society, was expected to proceed smoothly. Indeed, Heaven was truly helping. After I finished dinner, a crystal clear full moon was already hanging radiantly above the mountains in front of my window.

Arriving at Zhongshan Hall, it was already crowded with visitors. A white cloth for signatures was completely filled. Inside the venue, staff from the Taipei Weather Bureau were explaining astronomical knowledge to the visitors: A solar eclipse is a phenomenon caused by the moon moving between the Earth and the sun. Because the moon is small, not everyone on Earth can see it. A lunar eclipse is a phenomenon caused by the Earth blocking the moon and the sun, which is visible in many places. Then, they gave a simple explanation of "Taiwan Time": Taiwan's longitude is 120 degrees east, which is within the Central Plains time zone. The time here is the same as in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other places. Every 15 degrees of longitude marks a new time zone, resulting in a one-hour difference. For example, Chongqing is at 105 degrees east longitude, so its time is one hour behind Taiwan, Shanghai, and other places.

Taiwan vs. Hong Kong: Which is Accurate?

These were very basic but interesting astronomical facts, which were absorbed by everyone present. In fact, this is a most practical form of social education. Judging from the enthusiasm of the attendees, one can see that this work has been quite effective, although the formation of this trend did not start today.

A few days ago, the newspaper carried a report from the Hong Kong Observatory stating that the lunar eclipse on the morning of the 9th of this month, from the initial eclipse to full recovery, would take six hours, longer than the lunar eclipse of June 15th this year, and it also provided a detailed prediction of the time of the lunar eclipse. However, according to Section Chief Wang of the Astronomical Measurement Section of the Taipei Weather Bureau, who told reporters at the venue that, based on the time of 120 degrees east longitude, they measured the time of the lunar eclipse as follows: Initial eclipse at 0:10:11.8 AM on the 9th, total eclipse begins at 1:18:41.2 AM, maximum eclipse at 1:47:53 AM, emergence at 2:17:04.8 AM, full recovery at 3:25:34.2 AM. The total duration from the initial eclipse to full recovery is 3 hours, 15 minutes, and 23 seconds, which is 34 minutes and 13 seconds shorter than the first total lunar eclipse on June 15th of this year. Therefore, he suspected that the report from Hong Kong might be incorrect. Fortunately, this mystery will soon be revealed, the reporter thought to himself.

After the explanation of astronomical knowledge, there was still a long time before the actual observation of the lunar eclipse. The Weather Bureau was very thoughtful and specially borrowed a colorful war documentary film "Female Warrior" from the United States Information Service to show to the attendees, in order to pass the time.

Accurate to the Second

On the balcony outside the cliff, a four-and-a-half-inch refracting telescope and another mirror were set up. Many people were willing to lie on the cement floor and keep their eyes glued to them, unwilling to leave.

Time passed minute by minute, gradually approaching the last program of the day. The night was deep and the wind was strong, but everyone standing on the balcony did not feel cold, only a sense of interesting tension. The 8th passed by, and around 0:00 AM on the 9th, after the explanation of the staff, everyone quietly looked towards the sky. The eastern edge of the moon gradually entered the dark area, its color was dim yellow, like swirling smoke. At 0:10:12 AM, the Earth's shadow kissed the edge of the moon and ruthlessly engulfed its face. At this time, the luminosity gradually decreased. Then at 1:18:42 AM, the moon was finally completely swallowed by the Earth's shadow, and the Earth was as dark as the new moon. But in the darkness, there seemed to be some faint light inside the moon. Looking through the telescope, the periphery of the moon was light blue with green, the inner layer was rose and copper-colored, and the innermost layer was dark red. This is said to be atmospheric refraction caused by sunlight passing through the Earth's surface air. Seeing this, I couldn't help but recall the comical scene of following people in the countryside to bang on basins and small gongs as a child. The moon gradually shone brighter, but for decades, many people still said it was scared out by the sound of the gongs.

The results of the observation were very consistent with the time calculated by the observatory using complex formulas. Although the telescope could not be perfectly accurate in practice, the difference would not exceed five seconds. This proved that the report from Hong Kong was completely wrong.

### Germany: All Sorts of Things in the Red Zone

— Yan An, Translated from This Week Magazine

When I told my landlady in Berlin that I was going to the "enemy zone" (her term for the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany), she looked very uneasy. "Poor thing!" she said. "You will encounter the most terrible experiences."

Our trip behind the "Iron Curtain" was arranged in advance with the Soviet liaison officer. Our group—myself and two friends—were free to visit any places we liked. We requested that there be no Soviet personnel present to monitor our meetings with Germans, and this request was immediately granted.

We traveled in our own car, accompanied by a Russian guide. This guide was a very polite young man named Viktor. Viktor was very helpful to us because our American car would have been stopped by the Soviets if not for the authority of his shoulder insignia.

Under Viktor's protection, we traveled a thousand miles through Soviet-controlled German territory. We met German politicians, workers, elementary school teachers, housekeepers, farmers, newspaper editors, mayors, and priests. We spoke with Soviet military government officials, propaganda experts, and plainclothes soldiers.

I had two basic questions in my mind: First, why do most Germans believe that life under Russian rule is chaotic and miserable? Second, what is the basic Russian policy in Germany?

The answer to the first question was difficult to find. From Berlin to Dresden, the places we passed looked quiet and prosperous. Every piece of land was cultivated. In the industrial centers that were not destroyed by our bombs, the smoke from the chimneys was rising steadily.

What about the food situation? When Germans were asked about this question, they quickly showed their ration cards. I found it strange: most of the food rations here were much larger than in other parts of the German occupation zone—Germans did not seem to pay as much attention to this fact as we did. Only meat seemed to be most abundant in the American occupation zone.

However, the people in the Soviet occupation zone did not seem to be eating very well. On the contrary, most of them had sunken eyes and looked tired from hunger. Although you don't see many fat Germans in the American occupation zone, it is even more difficult to find a German of average weight here.

Germans Fearful

We know that the reason for this phenomenon is very simple: there is almost no black market here. In the American-controlled area, almost everyone gets extra food from the black market, but here in the Soviet occupation zone, people have to rely entirely on the food they get from rations, because the Soviet discipline is very strict, scaring the Germans into obedience. In addition, all German bank accounts have been temporarily frozen "to prevent inflation." Except for the sick and the elderly who can withdraw limited deposits, the people here must rely on the money they get from actual work to survive.

Many Germans resent this restriction. But seeing the orderly state of affairs here, the anti-Soviet prejudices held by many Germans seem somewhat unreasonable.

How do Red Army soldiers behave? According to the Germans I spoke with, including several old friends, they all admitted that the behavior of the occupying forces could be called satisfactory. They told us: "Of course, there are occasional disturbances, but the situation now, given the circumstances, is almost normal."

Are Germans afraid of the Soviet measures against Nazi elements? In fact, Soviet policy on this point is not as strict as that of the American authorities. In the American occupation zone, no German who belonged to the Nazi Party or was related to Nazi organizations can hold a responsible position. But here in the Soviet occupation zone, former Nazis, except for a few "big shots," can be pardoned as long as they work hard and cooperate sincerely with the Russians.

Despite these facts, Germans continue to hate the Russians, which is attributed to Goebbels' propaganda. Germans living in the British and American occupation zones often hear that Russians are blood-sucking demons, so they assume that life in the Soviet occupation zone is completely terrifying.

On the other hand, most Germans think that the British and Americans are kind and extravagant, with sometimes slightly ridiculous personalities. Therefore, people in the Soviet occupation zone envy the people in the British and American camps. They think that everyone there has a lot of food and games.

In the many public schools we visited, we could not find any traces of Marxist propaganda. Professor Zok, the provost of Jena University, told us that the Soviet authorities gave him all possible assistance but did not interfere with his plans.

Although the Russians have anti-German sentiments, they seem very concerned about German political and cultural affairs. This fact may not be easily understood by many Western observers. What is the Russian intention? Is there any truth to the rumors about a future Soviet-German alliance to counter Europe?

Of course, outsiders have no way of knowing the secrets of the Kremlin. But whatever plans the Soviet supreme political authorities are considering, the current fear of a Soviet-German alliance is, to put it mildly, unfounded.

Anti-Soviet Crusade

The Russians are clearly trying to strengthen the left-wing elements in Germany. But they do not regard German communists as "comrades" or potential allies, but as agents, only enough to assist the administrative work of the occupying country.

Obviously, German communists are willing to fight Western capitalism shoulder to shoulder with the Russians. But most Germans, when thinking about a possible Third World War, probably fantasize about an anti-Soviet crusade, enabling their country to rise again militarily.

If it is said that the average German would rather help destroy the Soviet Union than fight shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union, then the average Russian would laugh at the idea of fighting alongside Germany against the United States. Because Russians do not like Germans, but they do like Americans, and seem to completely misunderstand the anti-Soviet sentiments of the United States.

Our Russian guide, Lieutenant Viktor, was completely unaware of this ominous tension. One evening, he said: "Look at how these foolish Germans are staring at us. They are very surprised to see you Americans mingling with Red Army soldiers. They think we don't like each other. They think there will be war between us. They must be crazy!"

Hoping for Peace, No Ill Will

Strangely, we heard almost the same words from the American soldiers we met in Germany. These American soldiers belonged to a forty-man detachment that had been stationed in the Soviet occupation zone for the past five or six months.

"Are you all right?" we asked them. "Are there only a few Americans living among so many Russians?"

They answered in unison: "We have never had any ill will between us. They have not given us any trouble. Most of them are good soldiers. They are doing a good job too!"

A middle-aged sergeant with glasses continued: "Some people seem to think that Germans are very similar to Americans. I definitely don't think so. In fact, Russians are more like us than Germans!"

Another American soldier, a young man from the American Midwest, shrugged his shoulders and said with contempt: "These Germans must be neurotic—thinking that there will be a war between the Russians and us. What an idea! I don't know much about politics, but I do know Russians. As far as I know, there is nothing wrong with them. So, how can we fight?"

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Rising Sun of Peace: The Clouds of Doubt Between the Four Powers Will Disappear!

— Chu Yukun

The New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference, in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere, completed its historical task and ended successfully on the 12th of this month. The most important resolutions passed were two: (1) The draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, passed by the Paris Peace Conference, were approved; and it was decided that they would be signed in Paris on February 10th next year; at that time, these five countries could return to a normal state. (2) It was decided that the next Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in Moscow on March 10th next year to discuss the draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria. Therefore, we cannot but believe that the achievements of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will have a major impact on the future situation, and at least make 1946 a peaceful year.

When British Foreign Secretary Bevin left New York to return home, he told the press: "The sun of peace is rising; misunderstandings between the four powers are dissipating, guaranteeing that all countries will move forward and create a foundation for lasting peace."

The UN General Assembly Also Has Significant Achievements

The second session of the United Nations General Assembly also declared a successful conclusion on the 14th of this month after passing the "Disarmament Charter." The scope of discussions at this United Nations General Assembly was very broad, such as (1) the issue of the Franco regime in Spain; (2) the issue of the veto power exercised by permanent members of the Security Council; (3) the issue of investigating the stationing of foreign troops in various countries; (4) the issue of general disarmament, all of which have been agreed upon. The most significant achievement is still the issue of disarmament, passing a "Disarmament Charter," the main points of which are as follows: (1) The United Nations General Assembly recognizes the need to rapidly implement general disarmament. (2) It urges the Security Council to adopt all practical and necessary measures, depending on the urgency of the work, to achieve this goal. The various plans drafted by the Security Council for this purpose should be sent to all member states of the United Nations, and then a special session of the United Nations General Assembly should be convened to review them. (3) It urges the Atomic Energy Commission to immediately pass measures to control atomic energy, so that its use is limited to peaceful purposes. (4) The United Nations countries should hand over their troops to the command of the Security Council to maintain world peace.

The French Cabinet Is Having a Difficult Birth

In the first vote of the French National Assembly, Communist candidate Dorriot lost the election. In the second vote, Popular Republican candidate Bidault also lost. So, who will come out to take on this difficult task? Post-war France is riddled with holes, especially in terms of finance, and the problems are numerous and urgently need to be solved. The current political turmoil cannot be allowed to drag on. Therefore, as a result of consultations between the leaders of various parties, they unanimously supported the return of Socialist leader Blum to power. Blum was elected Prime Minister in the third vote of the National Assembly.

Although French politics has progressed, it has still not escaped the past practice of having many small factions. The Socialist Party is the third largest party in France, and Blum's assumption of office completely relied on the agreement of other parties, so its foundation is naturally very fragile, which goes without saying. However, the current problems in France are one, financial and monetary problems, and two, foreign policy problems, which cannot be solved without an outstanding old politician like Blum. However, as of now, Blum's cabinet is still having a difficult birth. If it is congenitally deficient and postnatally imbalanced, how can we expect it to grow and open up a new path for France's revival? Therefore, we still dare not be overly optimistic about France's future.

### Remote Control Panel for Atomic Factory Laboratory

### Atomic Bomb Test Model

### Atomic Physicists Live in Another World

— By Associated Press, Ted Holmes, Translated by Lan Yu

Scientists at the University of California have recently lowered the fences guarding wartime secrets, allowing journalists and photographers to walk into the huge circular ventilated room of the newly completed 184-inch large atom-splitting machine for the first time.

Reporters discovered that atomic physicists live in another world of their own making and have their own language, even a monosyllabic word that seems foreign to outsiders. The journalists were deeply impressed by the visit, but gained very little knowledge.

In a large room in this building, it was filled with young people wearing white work clothes who looked very sincere. They were all busy patching up that steel behemoth. It stood tall, its height reaching all the way to the circular roof.

"This," said the person guiding the visit, "is the atom-splitting machine."

It is impossible for you to ignore it. This atom-splitting machine, which emits a four-thousand-ton magnetic force and is painted light yellow, looks like a huge foreign drip, which is separated into upper and lower parts by a rectangular vacuum steel box; the box is equipped with ingenious portholes, so that physicists can see the atomic splitting inside.

The power added by this new atom-splitting machine is three times greater than that of any similar machine before. The entire decomposition of the atom is hoped to be completed with it, rather than just partially "shaving" particles out of the atom as before.

The tour guide pointed out that when you approach this machine, its magnetism's attraction to the nails on your shoes will make you feel as if your feet weigh ten pounds each. "All the coins and keys on your body will rise from the bottom of your pocket and stick to the edge of your pocket. It's a very strange feeling," he said.

Dr. Cocksey, the physicist in charge of this atom-splitting machine, said that he and his colleagues have not yet begun to move towards any research goals for the peacetime application of atomic energy or cosmic energy that can be compared to wartime atomic bombs.

"This research," he said, "is still in a very primitive stage. All we are doing now is trying to know more about this energy. The realization of its peacetime application is still in the future."

### Japan is Researching the Manufacture of Atomic Bombs

— Min, translated from the Chicago Sun Daily

Dr. Philip Morrison is a young American scientist who participated in atomic bomb research and manufacturing. After the war, he was the first to accompany experts to Japan to observe the damage caused by atomic bombs. In Hiroshima, he met Professor Yoshio Nishina of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research of Japan and learned that Yoshio was carefully studying atomic energy, but his laboratory was pitifully simple. He did not have the sophisticated equipment that British and American scientists had. He only had some domestically produced instruments, whose value did not exceed US$20. It was even worse than the laboratory of a middle school student's family in Britain and the United States. He also had no chance to see the Smyth Report—a bulletin published by the US military department, which contained many (not all) atomic bomb manufacturing secrets—for reference. He only had an image of Hiroshima after the bombing. Based on the degree of destruction, he explored the secrets of the atomic bomb. He collected all the theories about atoms and drew many valuable drawings, the number and scope of which were surprising. Many of them were unknown to countries other than Britain and the United States. Due to the high speed and correct route of his research, who would believe that it was a product of a laboratory worth US$20? Morrison was amazed and deeply believed that if Yoshio had sophisticated equipment and more information, he would be able to catch up with Britain and the United States in a short period of time and discover all the secrets about atomic energy. Dr. Morrison finally said: "Atomic secrets are not reliable, and the only guarantee is the joint management of atomic energy and international understanding!"

### England Plans to Seize Aviation Hegemony: Striving for Supremacy After the War, Aiming to Compete with the United States, Aircraft Factories Hasten Production of New Aircraft

— —Shaw, London Aviation News, November 1st—

After the Great War, Britain is striving to revitalize its domestic industry, expediting production of goods intended for export in exchange for needed materials. In aviation, it is also striving for supremacy, aiming to compete with the United States, with ambitious plans to seize aviation hegemony.

British aircraft factories are hastening the manufacture of new aircraft, seeking progress in both speed and capacity. Currently, the fastest transatlantic aircraft averages 220 miles per hour from New York to London. With a tailwind, it can be even faster, reaching London from New York in just fourteen hours.

A few years from now, according to aviation experts, commercial flights between New York and London will take seven hours or less, with speeds increasing to 500 miles per hour. Within ten years, flights between London and New York may be shortened to two and a half to three hours. Businesspeople from both locations could then fly to discuss deals.

500 Miles Per Hour

The aircraft currently being designed in Britain have a speed of 500 miles per hour and an altitude range of 30,000 to 40,000 feet. However, it is unlikely that they will appear in large numbers within a year or two. Specifically, there are roughly three types of commercial aircraft that Britain is preparing to manufacture. The first type is a twin-engine aircraft that can carry 20 to 30 passengers, with a speed of 400 miles per hour. This aircraft has a very high speed and is specifically designed for flights between major European cities, taking only two hours from London to Berlin and four hours to Moscow. It is expected to be completed next year.

The second type is a four-engine aircraft with a speed of 350 miles per hour. It can carry 65 passengers. This type of aircraft is intended to compete with American aircraft on transatlantic and transpacific routes. The third type is called the "Flying Wing," also with four engines. It weighs 95 tons and has a speed of 600 miles per hour, making the flight from London to New York less than seven hours.

In addition, with more aircraft, more airports must be built. Long runways take up a lot of space. Therefore, there is a plan to build aviation airships to serve as airports. In this way, the problem of airports can also be solved.

The new aircraft designed by Britain have attracted worldwide attention, and several countries have already placed orders with Britain. The United States may also imitate them soon. The new British aircraft use Gasturbine gas turbines, while the United States continues to use Piston-type engines and is unlikely to change. This is because American businesses have invested millions in this area. Perhaps in six or seven years, American commercial aviation will begin to mass-produce British-style aircraft.

The United States Will Not Fall Behind

The United States is also designing new types of aircraft and is experimenting and manufacturing them. The United States believes that its aviation hegemony will not be taken away by the British, and is confident that it can hold the reins of world aviation, relying on the following types of aircraft.

The first is a four-engine aircraft with a speed of 400 miles per hour. Its passenger capacity is 46 to 180 people.

The second type is a six-engine aircraft. It can carry 400 passengers. Its range is 10,000 miles. Airships are also being manufactured. Some were originally for naval use during wartime and are now being converted for commercial use. This is not only true for airships, some passenger ships were also used to transport troops during wartime. For example, the passenger ship that departed from Shanghai in July and August of this year is one such example, and passengers are required to perform tasks such as sweeping and washing dishes, just like soldiers in wartime. From this point of view, the end of the war does not seem to be over. Full demobilization may still take time. The United States is also studying "Flying Wing" aircraft, and whether it will be successful depends on the results of the current experiments with "speed exceeding the speed of sound."

The United States believes that these types of aircraft can be compared to or even exceed Britain's Gas turbine gas turbine aircraft. Both the United States and Britain are designing aircraft that "exceed the speed of sound." The speed of aircraft is already close to the speed of sound—the speed of sound is 770 miles per hour (at normal temperature), but the effects of vibration at such high speeds have been little studied.

The United States' flight experiments to break the sound barrier may have important news to announce soon. Currently, there are plans to use a rocket-powered aircraft to ascend to an altitude of 70,000 to 80,000 feet. If this experiment is successful, commercial aviation will not have to worry about not being able to reach a speed of 1,000 miles per hour. In that case, any place in the world can be reached within twelve hours. (The End)

Spring and Autumn

### A Record of Zhang Daqian's Decade

—Zhang Muhua

It has been nearly ten years since people in Shanghai have seen the paintings of Zhang Daqian. During these ten years, Daqian's artistic achievements and his great personal cultivation are truly worth mentioning. I will only briefly mention what I know.

A few days before the July 7th Incident, Daqian had just arrived in Beiping from Nanjing. Unexpectedly, as soon as he settled down, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. He had no choice but to live in seclusion in the Summer Palace, using poetry and painting to express his grief and indignation. Soon, enemy troops occupied the capital, and the situation became even more unbearable. In the western suburbs of Pingxi, the enemy's flames were raging, and even the Summer Palace was disturbed from time to time. Daqian, filled with grief and indignation, vowed to share the same fate. Then, a Western friend, braving the dangers, drove into the garden and forcibly pulled him into the city. At this point, driven by loyalty and righteousness, he immediately planned to go south. However, due to the chaos and blocked roads, he could not return. At that time, I lived in my hometown in western Anhui. I often received letters from Daqian, who complained that he was stuck in the north and could not return immediately. In the late summer of 1938, Daqian planned to have his family take his collection of famous works and leave Beiping first. Then, he quietly arrived in Tianjin and, with difficulty, crossed mountains and seas to reach Chongqing. His ability to escape the enemy's encirclement without being captured demonstrates Daqian's wisdom and courage. At that time, when we met, we were filled with mixed emotions of grief and joy. Talking about the past pleasures of Suzhou and Nanjing felt like another lifetime. In the winter of 1938, Daqian created dozens of paintings in Chongqing to raise funds for the soldiers at the front. At that time, the people of Chongqing admired Daqian's great personality and yearned for his style. His paintings were sold out in just three hours, raising thousands of yuan, all of which were used to provide winter clothing for the soldiers.

Later, he traveled to Qingcheng Mountain, admiring its beauty and producing even more works. Observing his style, which integrates both spirit and form, with ancient and noble qualities, he is truly superior to the artists of the Song and Yuan dynasties. This is because his talent is exceptional, and he is diligent and tireless. It is no accident that he has become a master of his generation. When Daqian was in Qingcheng Mountain, he sent me a letter, describing the beautiful scenery of the mountains, with its myriad appearances, enough to make one's heart feel clear and bright. I was moved and decided to visit, hoping to relieve my accumulated worries! When I arrived in Qingcheng Mountain, it was indeed as Daqian had said. It was both majestic and strange, both beautiful and secluded, and its depths were no less than those of Jiange, the Three Gorges, or Mount Emei (as Wu Zhilao said). The scenery varied with the wind and rain, the darkness and light, the four seasons, and the changes in weather. Especially the clouds on the Eight Diagrams Platform under Zhao Gong Mountain, which changed rapidly, were a magnificent natural spectacle. Daqian observed it day and night, capturing it all in his brushstrokes, down to every flower, every tree, every bird, and every butterfly in the mountains, detailing their nature, principles, and appearance, and sketching them all.

We then traveled north to avoid the Sword Gate, seeing the mountains cut across the wilderness, the sky and gorges overturned. We sang loudly, filled with a sense of independence. Daqian wrote a poem: "Going north and coming south between stone oxen, the King of Shu leads the Five Ding to rest. The white sun sways, dragons and snakes rage, hammers strike the mysterious sky, gods and ghosts worry. The mountains and rivers are naturally strategic, who says the passes limit spears and shields? Gentlemen, bear to weep at the new pavilion, one battle can still hold this state." The tone is sonorous, the meaning is deep, and it has the same exquisite craftsmanship as Du Fu's Sword Gate poem.

Daqian was also inspired by the beauty of Mount Emei and spent the whole year in the clouds and mist, much like the painting style of Bei Yuan and Nan Gong. If one wants to grasp the fusion of its heavenly secrets, one must be in it, so he decided to climb to its summit. His poem on visiting the Golden Summit of Mount Emei reads: "Thousands of layers of cliffs house spiritual vehicles, a sea of silver waves protects the treasure ship. After returning from the Five Sacred Mountains, I sit and lie as I please, suddenly surprised that the divine beauty is in the West."

After returning from Mount Emei, he felt that Dunhuang was a treasure of our country, and the murals in the Mogao Grottoes were all works of the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties. He had long cherished the desire to go there. Therefore, in the winter of 1940, he went west to Jiayu Pass to worship Buddha in Dunhuang, and then devoted himself to studying painting for three years. Living in a room in Mingsha during this time of war and turmoil, his spirit is truly admirable. His style also changed greatly. Every painting had a source, and every stroke had a history. Painting is where intent and emotion gather and heavenly secrets reside. To express intent and emotion fully, one must be based on learning. To penetrate heavenly secrets, one must have talent. Talent is bestowed by heaven and cannot be forced. However, having talent without learning, or learning without diligence, will not lead to success. Now, although Daqian takes his path from the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, he is able to wield his brush with depth and vigor, not limited by skill or bound by method. He not only dominates his generation, but is also enough to revive the decline of the past eight generations.

Last autumn, the desperate bandits were defeated, and Daqian happily said: "The dark areas will once again see the light of day, and my paintings will also be available for the appreciation of the people of Beijing and Shanghai." The people of Beijing and Shanghai have not forgotten Daqian, and Daqian should not forget the people of Beijing and Shanghai either. His life and personality are also the same as his painting style, bold and unrestrained, based on his carefree nature. He does not hesitate to spend millions on famous paintings, and he helps friends in need without stinginess, displaying the style of an ancient gentleman. Feng Ruofei once gave him a couplet saying, "Rich enough to rival a country, yet poor without a place to stand." Mr. Shen Yinmo also gave him a poem: "Zhang's wealth can rival a country, Zhang's poverty leaves him without a place to stand; both rich and poor, people do not understand, but see his frost-white beard. He admires Li Bai's drinking, he misses Lin Dongpo's poetry; painting is his lifelong love, he does not hesitate to call himself a painter before others. The six methods are nearly broken, and the historians hold their pens with trepidation; the gentleman expresses himself with his surroundings, not losing to Qu Tang, ashamed of Wu Gorge; the clear ape's wail is most eloquent, the white gulls are still intimate; his body is light as he travels thousands of miles to Dunhuang, encompassing the Six Dynasties and the Three Tang Dynasties; he returns to a room with only four walls, and burns incense after finishing the Thousand Buddhas." This couplet and poem are truly a portrait of Daqian. Now, Daqian's paintings are on display in Chun Shen. I wonder if there are any wise and virtuous people in Shanghai who, upon seeing his works, will find resonance in my words?

### Anecdotes of Writers

— Gan Si

In the biography of the American writer Henry D. Thoreau, there is such an anecdote: when the state government of a certain state in the United States arrested runaway black slaves and returned them to their original owners, Thoreau refused to pay taxes. He was therefore arrested and imprisoned. One day, Emerson asked him, "Henry (Thoreau's name), what are you doing here?" Thoreau asked in reply, "Waldo (Emerson's name), what are you doing not here?"

### Introducing the British Engraving Exhibition

— Xu Shiqi

One evening, Mr. G. Hedley of the British Council came to my house and talked about the upcoming British Engraving Exhibition (Exhibition of Graphic Art) and consulted me about the location of the exhibition. I recommended the Daxin Gallery on Nanjing Road in the city center, which is convenient for transportation and allows the audience to easily concentrate on appreciating British art. This reminded me of sixteen years ago, in August 1930, when I went to London from Paris to spend the summer and visited the Royal Academy exhibition. The British art world, which represents the academic style, impressed me with its solemn and rigorous composition, its dignified and elegant coloring, and its meticulous brushwork. It seemed to lack a kind of unrestrained and free expression. This may be due to the conservative nature of the British national character, which is slightly different from the French style.

This small exhibition has only fifty works, including etchings, aquatints, engravings, metal engravings, and color woodcuts. Among them, the etchings by Job Nixon, No. 13, "Country Landscape," Strang's "St. Paul's Cathedral," and No. 15, "War," No. 16, "Portrait of Shaw," No. 17, Taylor's "Bathing," and No. 24, F. Dodd's "Portrait of the Painter Hunt," are the most outstanding, with rigorous lines and precise expression. (Attached picture) Dodd, born in 1874, is now seventy-two years old and a graduate of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, and is one of Britain's leading contemporary painters.

There are also line engravings and wood carvings, such as S. Gooden's "Double Horse," No. 29. No. 20, "Dance," and No. 42, "Water City," are all excellent works. The other color woodcuts have a novel style and are full of primitive artistic interest, but the technique is ordinary, not as advanced as the Soviet woodcut world in recent years.

Engraving and woodcut originated in our country very early, such as the stone carvings of Xiaotangshan in the Han Dynasty and the stone carvings of Wu Liang Temple, which are well-known in the country. Woodcut is especially developed, and there have been excellent works handed down through the ages, which have influenced modern Japanese ukiyo-e. However, there has not been much progress in the last hundred years. Unlike Europe, in addition to engraving and woodcut, there are also etchings, aquatints, engravings, line engravings, and lithographs. This British engraving exhibition represents the great contribution of engraving to art in the past 150 years.

The American Council on Education published a beautiful catalog with the contents of this exhibition, with detailed explanations of the history of engraving, introductions to famous artists' works, and the types of engraving techniques. In addition to expressing artistic contributions, it also has the meaning of promoting arts and crafts, which is worthy of our attention. Because arts and crafts are the only tool to improve human culture and promote the beautification of life.

### Poems by Yesenin

— Translated by Ren Jun

The table is still here, still in my hometown home, oh my melancholy and gentle land! Beyond the mountains, the beautiful twilight is stretching out snowy hands to beckon.

The gray sky of cloudy days, those disheveled clouds, are drifting towards the horizon, and the yellow sorrow compels me to be excited.

The shadow of the setting sun is falling on the dome of the church head. Oh, my friends who played with me, I'm afraid I won't see you again.

The years pass in oblivion, and you don't know where you ran with it... Only the flowing water is still noisy in front of the winged waterwheel as it was before.

I often pray for the unreturned travelers in the misty land, in the twilight, in the moans of the broken moss.

Snowstorm

The snowstorm is fiercely blowing, and there are unfamiliar carriages flying in the wilderness. A stranger is sitting in a carriage and flying.

Where is my happiness? Where is my joy? Everything is passing by in the same crazy carriage under the fierce whirlwind.

(October 1925)

Sky Blue Jacket

Sky blue women's jacket. Green eyes. I have never uttered such a true heart to my lover.

My lover asked me, "Is the snowstorm blowing? Light the stove, make the bed." I replied to my lover, "Now, someone is scattering white flowers from a high place.

You light the stove and make the bed, my heart does not have you, but a snowstorm is blowing."

(October 1925)

### Expressive Pieces

— Yang Mou

Wine

If life is a prison-like torment and suffering, then intoxication and bewilderment should be happiness and enjoyment.

Frowning, enduring bitterness, ....

Excited? Like a kite with a broken string, without direction, without a goal, all that pervades is an empty soul.

The undulation of the water, the beating of the heart, weaves a rhythm without rhythm, and many streams of melancholy are seeking temporary rest. Reason helps you break into an unfamiliar society, and reason also helps you embrace troubles. Just use reason, and you have to prepare to leave reason.

Looking at the world with drunken eyes, how foolish these humans are. Looking at the world with drunken eyes, how beautiful these things are. But the mist will always dissipate, and life will only appear smaller.

Smoke

Looking at life through the mist, the blur is still lovely after all.

I see the firelight, I see the cheers of life. I see the smoke, I see the beautiful illusions.

One by one, ....

With it, I still feel empty; without it, I feel even more lonely.

Life is a mystery, and the rings of smoke may also ignite your thoughts of answering, you will conjure up thousands of answers, although perhaps they will slowly fall empty.

The mist is irregular, and who can figure it out!

What is contained in the irregularity is regularity. Millions of rotations, millions of advances, millions of retreats.

Sometimes, it's like a pool of quiet emotional water; sometimes, it's like a raging tide of ten thousand horses galloping.

Isn't a cup of light green tea, a cup of strong coffee, just as endlessly delicious?

Slow pace or fast pace, let's temporarily isolate reality! Heaven overturns, the earth is covered, I hope everyone is crazy.

Rotate, rotate, where is the end, and who can tell!

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 125

— Ye Jingfeng

What is this if not a challenge? If Pingzi does not answer these questions, then it is a split; they will part ways, each establishing their own banner; whether it is a struggle in the open or a fight in the dark, it will be fine. If she answers these questions clearly, that is tantamount to surrendering? Because everyone has secrets, why shouldn't she be allowed to keep her secrets? After she reveals these secrets, what special privilege does Tsurumi have not to reveal his own secrets? This is obviously unfair.

Pingzi did not waver much after hearing Tsurumi's words, and only smiled slightly, "Before I answer you, I have two questions, please explain them to me first; because these two questions exceed my ability to answer: "If I answer these three questions to you, without any deception, on my part, would it be betraying secrets to my father and your father, and Master Aoki? If I betray secrets, would it be betraying my personality?"

"What other question is there?" Tsurumi asked again.

"Is there any more?" Pingzi was a little hesitant, as if she couldn't say it; but immediately she seemed to muster up her courage, "Brother Huo, in case... after I answer these three questions, in case... these three aspects, of course including me, - the positions of these three aspects, happen to be contrary to your ideas, and all go against her, you will naturally understand everything about me; but I don't know anything about you; at that time, do you think I will still have hope? ..."

"What kind of hope?" Tsurumi did not know what Pingzi could hope for, referring to love, but he did not knowingly ask, Tsurumi was not so cunning and despicable, because the relationship was too important, there could not be a trace of ambiguity, so he had to ask clearly.

"Brother, my thoughts, in these twenty hours since we met, my actions and words have been expressed very clearly, maybe Brother did not take this expression seriously, but I personally think it is very serious - Brother has worked on the mainland for five or six years, and of course there are many women chasing after him, maybe Brother has a very reasonable object in mind, maybe more than one. But what I ask for is that Brother Huo also allows me to participate as a member, as one of the candidates. I can't take care of failure or victory now, and I will never care about it in the future. ... Even if I fail!" As Pingzi said, her head gradually lowered, and her voice became lower and lower, with a hint of resentment.

Hearing these words of love, Tsurumi's heart must have resonated with some sympathy, and he seemed to be unable to bear to listen any longer, so he left Pingzi and turned away, walking back and forth at a distance of three or four steps. Pingzi was still standing there with her head bowed, like a volunteer waiting to be announced as selected or not. Tsurumi paced back and forth for a while, and then returned to Pingzi's side:

"Pingzi, these two questions of yours are difficult for me to answer, but I have to answer you after all, don't I? For the first question, you explain the ideas of you and Elder Aoki, etc., you think it is betraying secrets, but I think it is just some guidance in friendship. Originally, I didn't have to ask you directly like this, at most I would only have to spend a few more hours of work, and a few indirect words would be enough to find out. But now that you have asked me, and you think it is betraying secrets, betraying one's responsibilities, then you have to bear it yourself....

### Taxes

— Shao Fu

Taken from the people, used for the people. Very fair, and everyone supports it. But the people are poor and their pockets are empty, so you can't say "I'm still spending it on you" and forcibly extort them. A foreign reporter praised Mayor Wu's famous saying: killing the chicken will not get you eggs. If taxes have forced the people to death, who will this money be raised for and spent on?

For example, the house tax, the dilapidated house in the alley where I live, located remotely on Jiangwan Road, has to pay tens of thousands of yuan this quarter. I have always been very confused and afraid of trouble, and I am even more sincerely obedient to the law, so the day after the notice arrived, I obediently went to pay. After paying, I thought carefully, this burden is really too heavy. An average of nearly ten thousand yuan a month in house tax, what kind of proportion is this for personal income! Moreover, averaging one house at ten thousand yuan a month, if there are 500,000 houses in Shanghai, the municipal government's income from house tax alone would be 5 billion, which is amazing!

Also, the business tax on the book industry, the Ministry of Finance has now decided that textbooks can be exempted, the intention being that other books should not be given preferential treatment, which is also extremely unreasonable. Recently, the book industry has been becoming more and more depressed, and is basically facing a situation where it cannot be maintained. Even if the business tax is waived, it will still be necessary to hold cultural loans to enable them to stand firm, otherwise, there is only one way to close down. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, culture has already been devastated, and the decline in the level of knowledge is evident in the students of all levels of schools today, which is really terrible. How to catch up quickly and find ways to remedy this is the responsibility of the publishing industry, and even more so the responsibility of the government authorities.

Also, there is also income tax, and the method of calculating it is also worth studying.

Yesterday, the Municipal Council already had a new decision on the municipal construction donation (house tax), which will not be doubled in winter, and will be reduced by one-third compared to autumn, which is really a bright measure, speaking for the people, and seeking to reduce the burden on the people. At the same time, the municipal financial authorities are also saying that if citizens have opinions on the valuation, they can request a revaluation.

The saying "the government is desperate for money" is very popular, and the authorities must consider what the people can afford, otherwise this saying will really become a fact and spread even wider.

### Although Signing Checks is Invalid, Pen Merchants in the Courtyard Compete Fiercely

— Translated by Shen Boxin from the December issue of "Reader's Digest Continued".

Several brands of ballpoint pens already exist in the Shanghai market. Their advantages have already been introduced in several articles. Below, let's discuss some fragments of the history of invention and the competitive situation among manufacturers.

The ballpoint pen originated in Hungary. The inventor was a versatile veteran named Biro, who had studied medicine, was skilled in painting, and was adept at writing. Dissatisfied with the various shortcomings of fountain pens, he and his brother, the chemist Georg, began to research and create a better writing tool. The initial design was quite bulky. Subsequently, in 1939, they continued to experiment in Paris. Soon after, the war broke out. In June 1940, Biro fled to Buenos Aires, South America. By that time, he was penniless. He sought capitalists everywhere in Argentina. As a result, an Argentinian and a British person became interested in his pen-making plan and provided funding.

It was not until 1943 that the first pen was made in Argentina. He began to use a capillary action ink supply system and achieved success.

The Opportunity Arrived Just in Time

At the end of 1943, a pen made by Biro was sent by airmail to Mr. Mousse, the manager of the Eberhard Faber factory in New York (the factory is famous for pencils, etc.). After a trial, it was immediately put aside, but Mousse had to try it again every few days. Finally, he handed it over to his engineers for research. In May 1944, he went to South America to negotiate the purchase of the production and sales rights of this new pen in the United States. It just so happened that the military expressed interest in purchasing 10,000 non-leaking fountain pens (because ordinary fountain pens would leak ink automatically at high altitudes due to low air pressure) for use by the air force. As a result, the three major pen manufacturers, Eversharp, Sheaffer, and Parker, simultaneously competed with the E. Faber factory to purchase the production and sales rights in the United States. In the end, Eversharp won with the highest price—calculating a figure $300,000 higher than the $200,000 offered by E. Faber, and also allocating 5 and 1/2 percent of the sales revenue in the United States to the inventor. The factory immediately mobilized engineers to improve the structure of the ballpoint pen and actively promoted it.

At that moment, the Gimbels department store in New York published an advertisement in October, stating: "The long-awaited new wonder pen has begun to be sold in our store." Everyone thought it must be the one invented by the Hungarian. In fact, it was not. The Eversharp factory was still painstakingly experimenting with the new pen, and the model was still being improved. What the department store was selling was made by another friend, Reynolds (Milton Reynolds), who had taken the lead.

Good at Business

Reynolds is now 54 years old. He was quite successful in the tire business when he was young. He became rich at the age of 26 and went bankrupt at the age of 27. Since then, he has experienced both wealth and poverty. During this war, he transported 250,000 silver lighters from Mexico to the United States and sold them out quickly, making a profit of one million.

In April 1945, Reynolds saw ballpoint pens for sale in a shopping mall in Buenos Aires. He bought half a dozen and immediately gathered engineers and lawyers familiar with patent regulations to study them after returning home. As a result, they believed that it was possible to avoid using the structure patented by Biro to make a ballpoint pen. In a hurry, he completed a model before Eversharp. On October 29, Gimbel's department store sold 60,000 of Reynolds' pens in New York. Within a week, 25,000 pens were sold, each for $12.50. At the same time, the door of Reynolds' office was crowded.

Reynolds promoted it even more aggressively. He offered a $33,000 prize to hold a ballpoint pen display competition. As a result, 5,000 stores participated. He also offered many prizes to encourage sales. There were many types of prizes, from household washing machines to pearl necklaces. The prize catalog printed in four-color plates had 48 pages. The publicity expenses in the first year reached a huge sum of $848,000. At one point, Reynolds specially sent someone to give ballpoint pens to politicians, reporters, and social celebrities. He himself flew all over the world, planning to open branches in England, France, Australia, and other places. He also made many transactions along the way. Once, in the restroom of an airplane crossing the Indian Ocean, he demonstrated writing on thin paper (toilet paper, etc.) with a ballpoint pen to a fellow passenger. As a result, he received a large number of orders.

When Reynolds was making a lot of money from ballpoint pens, other manufacturers were preparing to overwhelm him in terms of quality. Indeed, Reynolds' ballpoint pen had unsatisfactory shortcomings. Within seven months, 104,643 pens were returned. Eversharp factory spent $2 million on research work. Sheaffer factory had tested it 5,000 times, including 30 different models. Parker factory also spent nearly $300,000 on testing. Eversharp's "CA" pen did not appear on the market until April, with a price of $15, and large-scale publicity was carried out at the same time.

Effective Promotion

Eversharp's salesmen had various skills, such as pouring water on the writing paper, writing in the water, wiping off the water stains, and the words still remained. There were also demonstrations of writing on thin muslin handkerchiefs, or shaking the ballpoint pen vigorously to show that it did not leak, etc.

Eversharp factory estimated that the sales volume in 1946 could reach $20 million, then the invention tax drawn by Biro would be more than $1 million.

Now, the battle of ballpoint pens is in full swing. There have been five or six lawsuits in court. Reynolds sued Eversharp and E. Faber factories for violating the "Anti-Trust Law" and demanded compensation of $1 million. The two factories also countersued Reynolds, demanding compensation of $1 million, accusing him of "seizing" the market they were preparing. This year, all pen factories spent a total of about $3 million on publicity, most of which was aimed at each other. When Sheaffer's ballpoint pen was born, the title of the advertisement was "Not grown in the greenhouse—already complete!" and so on.

Now Eversharp factory has made five or six colors of ink, and you can choose the color core you like and replace it.

At the same time, cheap brands have also appeared one after another. Now the total daily output of various factories in the United States is probably more than 60,000 pens.

The pen invented by Biro is indeed a landmark transformation of writing tools. The blind exploration in the past few years, and the current struggle. These are all part of the price we pay for striving for progress.

### Teacher and Millionaire

— Translated by Zheng Ling

A teacher attempted to do an important scientific experiment, but could not proceed. So he visited a millionaire, but was rejected. The following conversation began between them:

Millionaire: "It's really strange, I only see teachers always coming to find millionaires, but I've never seen millionaires going to find teachers?"

Teacher: "Because teachers understand that they have no money, but millionaires never think that they lack knowledge."

Millionaire: "Then why are millionaires willing to help the blind, the lame, and other disabled people, but they don't like to help poor teachers?"

Teacher: "Because they are afraid that they may become blind, lame, etc. in the future, but they will never become teachers!"

(Translated from the Esperanto "Basic Grammar")

### The Organization of Beggars 18

— Huang Jiamo

Bleeding · Begging for Blood

After a wicked beggar comes to the door and "gets bloodied," the shop or residence where the incident occurred will naturally panic. Because this beggar is bleeding because he couldn't get money, it is obviously my fault. So they are more generous and give more money, satisfying his desires and letting him leave. The beggar then supports his bloody face and walks to the door of the neighbor. At this time, there must be many children and passers-by following him. When the shopkeeper sees this hideous face, he is unwilling to let this person stay outside the door for a long time, so he has to quickly give money to send him away. Then he goes to the third and fourth house. Once "bloodied," it is very easy to get money. But each time he only begs on one side of the road, and absolutely does not beg at the shops on the opposite side of the street on the same day. The reason why the gang adopted coercive begging is because they are confident that the previous emperor specially allowed them to "beg at every door." If you don't give him money, the fault lies with the people. The gang also has a hard-line method, in addition to begging for money, other daily necessities, such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, can also be "apportioned" to people when there is a shortage.

This kind of bleeding, self-inflicted suffering scheme is naturally terrible in the imagination of ordinary people. Especially since a lot of blood has to be shed each time, it seems to be detrimental to health, and it cannot be recovered without resting for many days. But the people in the beggar gang regard it as commonplace, because they have undergone special training and have swallowed various grains and special secret recipes from an early age. They have developed the habit of breaking their foreheads. Although their skin and flesh are injured, they do not feel pain. In fact, their forehead bones have long been broken and have become a large cave. Each time they get bloodied and shed some blood, the wound is extremely easy to heal. The next time they "break ground," it is still the old wound. Only some blood flows on the surface, but the observers are shocked, thinking that the forehead bone has been broken and the situation is serious.

Due to the vastness of Shanghai, the beggar boss divides the area into several districts, each with a leader to manage the beggars. The seniority can be divided into seven or eight levels. But no matter which group goes out to "do the street" (begging) or "goes alone" (begging alone), the money they earn each day must be handed over. Then it is distributed according to a percentage. The distribution percentage varies according to seniority. Senior beggars can get 50% (fifty percent). Low-level beggars only get 20%. The beggar boss enjoys as much as 80%, which is really extremely exploitative. But the beggar boss also speaks with conviction. Because in the past, there were beggar factories, and all food and lodging expenses were controlled by the beggar boss. If there is severe winter with rain and fog, beggars can be exempted from going out to "do the street" when they are sick, but porridge is still supplied as usual. Low-level beggars are mostly people with low abilities, and their income is extremely limited. But their appetite is the same as that of other beggars, so heavy exploitation is inevitable.

The "hard-core" beggars absolutely do not allow any shortage in the amount that should be handed over each day, and they absolutely dare not reduce it. A group of new beggars who have just started out in the business think that the beggar boss is not observant and cannot know how much they beg each day, so they deliberately hide a part of it. Who knows that if they deceive him one day, the case will be solved sooner or later. When the beggar boss first realizes that the handover is too small, he pays attention. When he sees that their expressions are wrong, he conducts a full body search. As a result, "concealing stolen goods" constitutes a crime and they must be punished.

News Figure

### One-Legged General Chen Ce

— Gan Lai

General Chen Ce, the former mayor of Guangzhou, took the road to Beijing after resigning. It was initially rumored that he would be appointed as the deputy commander-in-chief of the navy, but this was later proved to be inaccurate. Recently, it has been rumored that this naval veteran, who is already 53 years old, may be appointed as the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Whether this is true will be known after the government is reorganized.

General Chen, whose courtesy name is Zhishuo, is from Qiongshan County, Hainan Island, Guangdong Province. He graduated from the Huangpu Naval Academy and has held important naval positions. He is a romantic and unrestrained person who does not stick to appearances. When it comes to the nickname "Uncle Ce," he is well-known in South China.

Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, General Chen happened to be in Hong Kong as the chairman of the Kuomintang Hong Kong and Macau General Branch. Before the fall of Hong Kong, Chen, with the help of the athletic Xu Ting, swam across the sea and escaped to Chongqing. This story is a famous episode in the War of Resistance.

Mr. Chen has one leg amputated, but he has an artificial leg designed by a British doctor. His movements are flexible, and he is no different from ordinary people. When he wears a suit and trousers, it is simply impossible to see any flaws.

More than ten years ago, when the central government's power had not yet reached the two Guangdong provinces, Mr. Chen had already been inclined to the central government. He fell out with Chen Jitang, the "King of Southern Heaven" at the time. However, because Mr. Zhishuo also had considerable prestige in Guangdong Province, the invincible "King of Southern Heaven" could not do anything to him.

Before the victory, General Chen had been appointed as the mayor of Guangzhou. He resigned less than a year after taking office. It is said that the reason for his resignation was a conflict of opinion with his superior, Luo Zhuoying, the chairman of the province. He resigned in a fit of anger, living up to the true colors of a soldier.

The General is highly valued by President Sun Zhesheng, and he is also very compatible with Situ Meitang, the leader of the Minzhi Party.

Currently, General Chen is still staying in Beijing, probably waiting for a new appointment from the central government.

### Who is Misleading Students?

— Xu Ming

After reading the insightful comments of Mr. Shengjie and Mr. Fangcheng on "misleading students" in this journal, I feel that one is speaking from the student's perspective, and the other is "defending" from the teacher's situation. Both sides have their own subjective reasons; however, in fact, they both overlooked a major person who caused "misleading students." If we use today's housing disputes as an analogy, Mr. Shengjie is like a subtenant who pays a high rent but cannot live in a good house; Mr. Fangcheng is like a landlord who has a good house but cannot receive a decent rent. The reason is that between the landlord and the subtenant, there is a black-hearted second landlord who profits from it. Mr. Shengjie and Mr. Fangcheng overlooked the school owner, who is equivalent to the second landlord, the main person who caused "misleading students."

"Cheating" teachers should be kicked out of the school gate. From the student's perspective, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this, and it is a matter of course. But school owners are welcoming such teachers, the only reason being that these teachers can be hired at the lowest price. In this way, school owners can use a small part of the tuition revenue as the teacher's salary, and use most of the tuition revenue as capital for speculative trading, or engage in usury. Under the influence of greed, running a school in the minds of school owners is a tool for planning speculative capital. Students' studies and teachers' lives are naturally not in their "consideration."

The hardship of teachers' lives is an undeniable fact today. Teachers take on more classes to maintain their livelihoods, resulting in "misleading students." In theory, this should not be the case, but in fact, it is a need for survival; but the "executioner" who causes teachers to have to take on more classes for the sake of their livelihoods, resulting in "misleading students," is the school owner who aims to make money by running the school. Now I can give two more examples to illustrate: There is a Mr. Wang who opened a primary and secondary school on ×× Road, and put more than 40 million yuan of tuition revenue out for short-term interest. Unexpectedly, he suffered a "bad debt," so teachers who could not "find another job" had to "endure hardships" and "struggle through the years," following the unlucky boss "working for the public on an empty stomach." There is also a Mr. Shen who opened a primary and secondary school on ×× Road, and most of the teachers he hired were either from the same hometown or relatives, either the school principal's "godson" or the school principal's "adopted daughter." Everyone is there to "help out," and "give some money casually" is the reality. Other subjects that cannot be taken care of have to be taught by "outsiders," so "outsiders" have to wait for the principal to release the tuition money and receive the interest before they can get their salary. These facts all show that the suffering of teachers comes from the exploitation of the principal. So, isn't the fact very clear? Who is the real culprit of "misleading students"?

Among the many schools in Shanghai, although there are many schoolshops that "mislead students," there are also many schools that are working hard to cultivate talents. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of "misleading students," I suggest that news reporters should investigate the actual situation of all schools in this city for our second generation, and give a true and honest introduction of the good and the bad, so that students can choose accordingly. But there is a very important question here, that is, the report must be absolutely true.

This is my view on "misleading students." Whether it is right or not remains to be seen by the criticisms of the diners.

### The Hardships of the Employees of the Two Railways

— Cai Lin

The railway job, which is generally regarded as a "golden rice bowl," is actually not something that can be said out loud. It's like a "gilded box with a white copper lock," good-looking on the outside but empty on the inside.

Yesterday, an employee of the two railways who had served for many years and had excellent results also sighed about his hardships. He said, "We employees of the two railways are almost like cats and dogs. Why? Look! (He pointed to his uniform with the index finger of his right hand) We wear one suit of hair in the cold and summer, alas! Since the victory, only one black cloth uniform has been issued. No matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter, we wear it all year round. We have no chance to change it. In the summer, the smell of sweat is overwhelming, and in the winter, we can't resist the cold, alas! And the color has changed to neither yellow nor black, and there are holes everywhere. We don't look neat, and at a glance, you know that we are the 'second class'."

He breathed a sigh of relief and continued, "It's kind of a joke, but we work in the same organization. Why is there always a two-week difference between the date of salary payment at Shanghai North Station and the date of salary payment for us? Now prices are rising every day and night. Can we afford to have half a month's difference? Not to mention anything else, just take coal balls as an example. Last month and this month? They are almost twice as expensive. I heard that the authorities originally did not have any difference in the date of salary payment for employees. It has always been uniform. How does the accountant explain this?"
