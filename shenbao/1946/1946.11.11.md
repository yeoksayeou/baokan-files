Hong Lanyou Reports to Reporters on the Preparations for the National Assembly

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The National Assembly Preparatory Committee held a press conference on the second floor of the assembly hall at 3:00 PM on the 10th, presided over by Hong Lanyou. Hong first reported on the preparations, (1) The National Assembly was decided in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935) to be held on November 12th of the 25th year (1936), but it could not be realized.

(2) The powers of the National Assembly were passed by the Legislative Yuan in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936). It is to create a constitution, not to implement a constitution. This year's resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference determined that it was to create a constitution. (3) The election affairs were largely completed in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), and then the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee decided to establish the National Assembly Preparatory Committee in the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939). (4) The assembly hall began to be built in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), and then rebuilt at Fuxingguan in Chongqing in the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), and then changed to the Nanquan Central Political School. After the restoration, it was still built on the current site, that is, the site that was hurriedly sought in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). The place was originally the place where people were preparing to run the Cultural Theater, so it is not applicable. The capacity is at most 2,500 people. (5) Because the reporter seats are smaller due to the smaller site, there is no way to place more seats, so 120 are fixed, or 60 to 100 more have not been determined. (6) There are five residences for representatives in total, and some areas are reserved for representatives from various parties to participate. There are currently 60 large vehicles, which can barely be used for transportation.

(8) The preparation expenses are roughly as follows: construction and equipment costs are 1.3 billion, and travel and accommodation costs are 2.8 billion. (9) The seating arrangement in the venue has not been finalized.

### The Chinese Communist Party Insists that the National Assembly Must Be Cancelled

Spokesperson of the CCP in Nanjing Speaks

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation stated on the evening of the 10th that the Communist Party believes that the upcoming National Assembly must be cancelled in order to conduct negotiations. If the government decides to open the meeting on the 12th, it will promote a comprehensive split and make the ceasefire practically ineffective. When asked by reporters whether the government has decided to convene the meeting as scheduled, will the situation be decided within one or two days? The spokesperson said: "Yes," the convening of the National Assembly will make the situation unmanageable. As for the so-called withdrawal issue, it is very simple. If we cannot talk anymore, there is nothing to do in Nanjing. When asked by reporters about the ceasefire issue, the spokesperson said that since we did not receive prior notice, we believe that it cannot achieve practical results.

At the same time, he announced another so-called ceasefire order. This ceasefire order, like all previous ones, is not a ceasefire order, but an order to continue fighting." He continued, if Mr. Chiang wants to prove that he has sincerity for peace, then he should: (1) Order the cancellation of the so-called National Assembly monopolized by one party and convene a democratic National Assembly on the basis of consultations among all parties in accordance with the content and procedures of the Political Consultative Conference. (2) Withdraw the troops that have invaded the liberated areas, stop mobilizing troops, and restore the position of the first ceasefire order in January. The Communist Party declares that we are willing to participate in any negotiations for the purpose of true peace, and we oppose all acts of deception.

Subsequently, he gave instructions to the transferred military officers of various departments of the Corps, saying in brief: Everyone has participated in the National Revolutionary Army in the past, completed the Northern Expedition, and strived for the final victory of the War of Resistance. They have struggled hard for nearly 20 years. It can be said that they have fulfilled the responsibilities of revolutionary soldiers for the Founding Father and the martyrs. However, it must be known that the purpose of the National Revolution is to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Now that the military period is over, the great cause of nation-building is about to begin. It is a very valuable opportunity for everyone to leave military life and participate in the work of nation-building. I hope that everyone will recognize the sacredness of the mission they bear in the future and engage in the political, economic, and social construction at the grassroots level with the determination and effort of the past Northern Expedition and War of Resistance to lay the foundation for a modern country, and then we can complete our mission of the National Revolution. The Chairman's speech lasted for 20 minutes, and everyone listened respectfully and was deeply moved. The Chairman then led everyone to recite the party member code. After that, he left the Corps with Minister Bai and others.

General Chen Cheng, the Deputy Corps Commander, gave instructions, pointing out that the first revolution was to strive for the realization of nationalism, and in the future, we must complete the realization of democracy and people's livelihood. If democracy and people's livelihood are not realized, then the revolution cannot be said to be complete.

### Convention of the Labor Association Representatives Opens: Important Proposals Passed; November 11th Designated as "Industry Day"; Chairman to Receive All Representatives Today

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Chairman is scheduled to receive all members of the Chinese Labor Association at the National Government on November 9th, inquiring about the state of industry in various regions. The representatives will first go to the Ministry of Economic Affairs tomorrow morning, where they will be led by Minister Wang Yun-wu to the National Government to participate in the Central Memorial Week, and then meet with the Chairman. At today's convention, the following was passed: a request to the government to designate November 11th as "China Industry Day," and a resolution to hold the next convention in Taiwan.

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The National Industrial Association continued its meeting on the 10th. In the morning, it divided into five groups to discuss association affairs, including proposals related to industry and mining, laws and regulations, economic construction, relief, and compensation. In the afternoon, the convention successfully passed nearly 200 proposals from the various groups. The representatives are scheduled to meet with the Chairman on the morning of the 11th, and in the afternoon, they can [space].

Demand for Swift Allocation of Emergency Loans

The representatives spoke enthusiastically about requesting the government to quickly allocate "Industrial Emergency Loans" to promote production and construction. They generally believed that since the national banks failed to provide low-interest loans to industry after the war, they had to resort to high-interest loans from the black market, resulting in interest accounting for as much as 40% of costs. Furthermore, real estate could not be used as collateral, leading to the exhaustion of working capital. In addition, due to poor transportation and sluggish sales of similar products, they had to bear huge expenses, resulting in financial difficulties and a sense of helplessness. They hoped that the convention would request the government to order national banks to swiftly implement emergency industrial loans and allow real estate as collateral.

Import Tariffs Should Be Adjusted

Another important proposal was that the current import tariffs fail to protect nascent industries. They requested that the government consider the country's manufacturing capabilities and supply situation and adjust the tariffs to reclaim benefits. The measures are: tariffs should be increased on luxury goods and foreign goods that the country can produce itself; tariffs on finished products should be increased, while tariffs on semi-finished products or components should be reduced or exempted; import of agricultural, industrial, and mining machinery and ships, vehicles, and transportation equipment not for resale should be exempted; and instruments, medicines, and small experimental machines required by educational and research institutions should be exempted.

Government Exchange Rate for Equipment Orders

The most valued proposal in terms of economic construction was: When the industrial sector orders equipment from abroad for development needs, the government should approve foreign exchange at the official rate based on the contract to facilitate cost accounting and project implementation. The measures are: Please allow various industries to [space] apply for foreign exchange for contracts ordered from abroad and settle the accounts at the official exchange rate at any time, without time limit.

Light Industries Transferred to Private Sector

Another important proposal was to request the government to transfer or entrust the light industries it operates to the private sector ahead of schedule. The measures are: (1) Request the government to transfer companies such as China Textile and China Silk, as well as those currently planned, to the private sector, absorbing floating capital and channeling it into industry; (2) Distribute or lease the light industries taken over from the enemy and puppets to the private sector as much as possible to lay the foundation for industry.

Donations and Taxes Also a Focus of Discussion

The representatives generally advocated for improvements to business tax, income tax, and stamp tax, and requested the government to simplify collection methods.

Private Factories Form Compensation Committee

The most important proposal from the compensation group was that the General Association of Industry take the initiative to organize a wartime private factory compensation committee, verify and liquidate the findings according to the investigations, and request the government to convey them to MacArthur and Paul Reynaud, the person in charge of the Far East Compensation Committee, to strongly urge Japan to pay compensation.

### Xi'an Grain Prices Soar; Black Market Rice Exceeds 70,000 Yuan Per Dan

Black market rice exceeds 70,000 yuan per dan, and flour is 33,000 yuan per bag, doubling the price at the beginning of October. The Provincial Land and Grain Office is urgently shipping 100,000 bags to try to stabilize prices.

### Guangxi Province's Budget Insufficient; Executive Yuan Subsidizes in Full

### Shanghai Bookstore Delegation Completes Mission; Exemption of Business Tax for Bookstores; Methods Still Under Study; Ministry of Education Has Agreed to Forward Request to Ministry of Finance for Approval

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Shanghai bookstore representatives, including Li Bojia and 16 others, who came to Beijing to petition, have completed their mission in Beijing and left in batches on the 9th and 10th. Except for one or two people, they will all return to Shanghai. According to Xu Boxin, one of the representatives, to the reporter: During this trip to Beijing, they successively met with the economic, financial, and educational authorities to appeal. They were kindly received by Minister Wang Yun-wu and others. The relevant authorities were extremely concerned about the current difficulties of the bookstore industry and stated that the issue of exempting business tax was not entirely impossible, but the methods still needed to be studied. Textbooks already have tax exemption regulations, and other books may also be exempted by analogy. The Ministry of Education has agreed to this matter and has agreed to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The financial authorities will also discuss it with its subordinate Direct Taxation Department. After the representatives return to Shanghai, they will consult with the municipal government and its Finance Bureau to enable the Shanghai Municipal Council's resolution to exempt bookstore business tax to be realized. He also stated that in addition to requesting the authorities to exempt business tax, another urgent problem to be solved by the bookstore industry is the difficulty in postal delivery. Currently, the post office has restrictions on the volume of parcels accepted for delivery, and delivery also takes time. Often, one must go to queue as early as 3 a.m., which affects the circulation of books. It is truly a significant issue, and it is hoped that it can be improved.

### Taiwan Representatives Arrive in Suzhou to Investigate Commercial Conditions

Hope the Government Abolishes the Economic Blockade Policy

[Our Suzhou Office, 10th] Xie Chengyuan, Jiang Weichuan, Huang Zaishou, and Li Ziqi, the four representatives of Taiwan Province to the National Federation of Commerce, arrived in Suzhou via Nanjing on the evening of the 10th. Local business leaders went to the station to [space] welcome them. They stayed at the Lexiang Hotel and plan to go to Shanghai on the 11th after observing the current commercial situation in Suzhou before flying back to Taiwan. Local journalists flocked to interview them and inquired about the commercial economy of Taiwan. The representatives shared their opinions. A summary is as follows: The commercial economy of Taiwan still maintains a special status, with no connection to the mainland. The biggest regret and pain is that there is no normal communication. For example, surplus materials in Taiwan Province such as sugar, rice, coal, salt, and camphor cannot be fully transported and sold to other ports, while lacking materials such as fertilizers and foreign cloth cannot be supplied continuously. Secondly, all factories in the province are shut down under receivership. Those who use production do not reach two-tenths, resulting in an unemployment population of 600,000 to 700,000, with technical personnel being the most numerous, accounting for 12% of the population. It is the most painful issue for the people of Taiwan. The reporter inquired about the current education situation. According to the reply: Education in Taiwan Province was originally very developed, and parents invariably regarded educating their children as the most important obligation. However, today the future of education in Taiwan Province is fraught with two crises: (1) Teachers cannot receive their salaries, and (2) Poor children cannot go to school, which is truly lamentable. The representatives sincerely stated: Today, the six million Taiwan compatriots in the province unanimously hope that the government will abolish the economic blockade policy so that the land can be used to its full potential and goods can flow smoothly. The reporter inquired about the current living standards of the Taiwan compatriots. The representatives said: Cries of cold and hunger can be heard in the streets [space] and they gave an explanation, and so on.

### Yantai Relief Work Progresses Smoothly; Mr. Wang Shiliang Arrives in Shanghai from Yantai to Seek Instructions on Future Work Directions

[Our City News] General Wang Shiliang, director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) office in Yantai, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Yantai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he told a Central News Agency reporter that UNRRA's relief work in the Communist-controlled areas is progressing quite smoothly, and he will strengthen the strength of UNRRA's relief agencies in the Communist-controlled areas. He also pointed out that the work he conducted in Yantai previously has achieved good results, which can be divided into four points: (1) The work of the UNRRA Yantai office is now proceeding as usual without any obstacles. (2) The staff members who stayed in Yantai in the past are still continuing to carry out relief work in the Communist-controlled areas. The distribution of materials in the Communist-controlled areas is proceeding smoothly and has not encountered any difficulties. (3) The Communist Party has accepted the various points previously suggested to the Communist Party by UNRRA: A. The food and lodging of UNRRA Yantai staff are the responsibility of the Communist Party; B. UNRRA Yantai will set up its own radio station; C. The ratio of "North Sea Currency" to legal tender has been reduced from 16:1 to 8:1. Finally, Mr. Wang stated that his purpose of returning to Shanghai this time is to ask UNRRA for instructions on the future work plan of the Yantai office. Before leaving Yantai, Mr. Wang held meetings with representatives of the Communist Party and UNRRA to discuss various issues related to the progress of relief work in the Communist-controlled areas in the future. The results were good. In addition to reporting the progress to UNRRA, he will also discuss future work directions and strengthen UNRRA's work agencies in the Communist-controlled areas.

### Hualien Port, Taiwan; Coffee Farm; Planning for Reorganization

[Central News Agency Hualien Port, 10th] The Hualien Port Ruishui Coffee Farm is the largest coffee plantation in Taiwan Province. During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, the Wangtian Co., Ltd. was organized to engage in cultivation, with an area of 250 acres and an annual output of 20,000 catties of coffee. During the war, it was unable to take care of it, and it has been abandoned for six years, and now it has become a wasteland. After we took over, the farm was operated by Dongtai Industry Co., Ltd. According to the investigation, 170 acres of the 250-acre coffee farm are completely abandoned and cannot be restored for a while. The remaining 80 acres can still be produced if reorganized quickly. The company has now formulated a five-year plan to restore the old appearance and increase production.

### Contradictions Between France and Vietnam Not Eliminated; Difficult for Our Overseas Chinese to Do Business

[Central News Agency Hanoi, 10th] Although the situation in various parts of Vietnam is said to be good after the implementation of the Franco-Vietnamese New Treaty, all contradictions between France and Vietnam have not been completely eliminated. The overseas Chinese living here are caught between the two major powers and still feel at a loss. Most of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam are engaged in business, and the French and Vietnamese have the most disagreement on issues such as tariffs and transportation. After France implemented the unified foreign exchange settlement method for import and export goods on November 1, the French immediately implemented strict inspections in Haiphong Port. Due to the ambiguity and simplicity of the methods promulgated by the French, the interpretations were different during implementation, and most of the overseas Chinese remained hesitant, resulting in most of the merchant ships entering and leaving Haiphong in recent days being empty. The Vietnamese government then promulgated methods to restrict the transshipment of goods to the interior, making the overseas Chinese in Vietnam who are engaged in business subject to French control over import and export trade and then to Vietnamese restrictions on sales to the interior, causing the commercial activities of overseas Chinese in Vietnam to be stifled. Overseas Chinese in Haiphong have formed a Commission for the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Overseas Chinese to formulate detailed countermeasures and request our authorities and the consulate stationed here to negotiate with both France and Vietnam to protect the rights and interests of the overseas Chinese. The committee will also put forward suggestions on the free trade zone in Haiphong and the Sino-French Commercial Treaty based on the actual situation for the authorities to consult.

### National Record Set in 5,000-Meter Race in Shanghai-Taiwan Friendship Games; 10,000-Meter Race Also Breaks Old Record

[Central News Agency Taipei, 10th] In the friendship games between the sports team sent to Taiwan by the Shanghai Three People's Principles Youth League and the Taiwan team, Wang Zhenglin of the Shanghai team broke the national record for the 5,000-meter race with a time of 16 minutes and 56.2 seconds.

In the 10,000-meter race, Wen Ao of the Shanghai team won the championship with a time of 33 minutes and 44 seconds, which also broke the old national record of 35 minutes and 1 second, but was inferior to the new record of 33 minutes and 15 seconds set in the Qingdao Games last month. In the ball games between the Shanghai and Taiwan teams, the Shanghai team won in table tennis and the Taiwan team won in basketball. The Shanghai team arrived in Taiwan on the 1st and is scheduled to return to Shanghai by ship on the 11th.

### Editorial: Review of the Japanese Reparations Problem

The Allied Control Council for Japan is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the distribution of Japanese assets and property as reparations to the Allied nations. According to an Agence France-Presse report from London on the 8th, the U.S. State Department has already invited the member states of the Far Eastern Commission to consult with the U.S. government on this issue and hopes that each country will address the following two issues: (1) the immediate distribution of 15% to 20% of Japanese assets as reparations; and (2) the submission of recommendations regarding the final distribution of the remaining 80% to 85% of assets. After approval by the Far Eastern Commission, it will be submitted to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, General MacArthur, for implementation. Therefore, in the past few days, the Japanese reparations problem and how its assets will be distributed have once again become the focus of world attention.

Japan's invasion of China was the fuse of World War II. Later, Japan took the British and Americans by surprise and suddenly attacked Pearl Harbor and Singapore, unveiling the bloody curtain of the Pacific War. Therefore, Japan is the culprit of this war and should bear the same guilt as Nazi Germany, which is beyond doubt. Although the United Nations' demand that Japan pay a huge amount of compensation is not due to a desire for revenge, it ultimately feels that Japan's provocation, which led to a catastrophic disaster, should be severely punished. At the same time, in addition to the role of punishment, there is also the most important role, which is to use this to limit the revival of Japan's war-making capabilities to prevent the resurgence of Japan's aggressive forces and cause a new war in the Far East. This is the unanimous demand of the United Nations for Japan, and there is originally no problem. However, how to calculate the reparations? Because the losses suffered by each country in the war against Japan, whether on the government side or the people's side, are difficult to calculate accurately. At the same time, the losses suffered by each country are also different, and there is really no objective standard. In addition, how much ability does Japan, after its defeat, have to pay compensation? It is also a serious problem. For example, the German reparations problem after World War I has been under discussion for more than 20 years and has not yet found a solution. As another example, the German reparations problem after World War II has not yet been settled. Therefore, today's Japanese reparations problem is not a simple problem. It really has value worth studying.

Among the countries that suffered significant losses during the war against Japan, the four major countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are the first. The opinions of the four countries are completely consistent in demanding compensation from Japan and demanding that Japan use its assets as compensation. There are no other problems. However, the opinions of each country differ on how to distribute them, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union. In view of this, the U.S. and Soviet authorities decided to establish a Far Eastern Commission during the meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Moscow in December last year. The commission is composed of 11 countries, including China, Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, India, the Philippines, and New Zealand, and is responsible for "formulating policies, principles, and standards that Japan should strictly abide by when fully fulfilling the terms of surrender." Solving the Japanese reparations problem is, of course, one of the tasks of the Far Eastern Commission. However, the Soviet Union's removal of Japanese industrial equipment from Northeast China and Korea caused friction between the United States and the Soviet Union over the Japanese reparations problem. On the Soviet side, it was believed that the Japanese industrial equipment was the Soviet Union's "spoils of war" and could no longer be regarded as Japanese assets for use as compensation. However, the United States insisted that the Japanese materials removed by the Soviet Union in Northeast China and Korea could not be regarded as "spoils of war" and should still be regarded as Japanese assets, and this batch of materials should be deducted from the compensation obtained by the Soviet Union. At the same time, the United States also sent Truman's reparations commissioner, Paul Reynaud, to Northeast China and Korea to investigate the materials removed by the Soviet Union, and there is already a complete list. In addition, Paul Reynaud wrote to MacArthur in May of this year, advocating that the assets of the Japanese in Northeast China and Korea should remain in place for compensation to those countries. Paul Reynaud's move was clearly aimed at the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union refused to participate in the Japanese reparations committee, making it difficult for the Far Eastern Commission to start work.

As for our country's compensation from Japan, although it has not yet formally made a request, it has already been decided in principle: that is, "Our country has resisted for the longest time and suffered the most damage. Our country should enjoy a superior proportion and priority in receiving compensation for Japan's compensation to the Allied countries. The government should put forward a complete compensation plan in accordance with this principle, and should also obtain strong participation in the compensation mechanism to be established by the Allied countries in order to realize our country's compensation requirements." When the 21-nation peace conference was held in Paris in September of this year, our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie made a frank statement on the Japanese reparations problem: He said, "Although China suffered heavy losses during the war, it will not make a claim for compensation that exceeds Japan's ability to pay." This enlightened and generous attitude has won the attention and importance of various countries. It is reported that the Chinese government has already written a meticulous plan and will submit it to the Japanese Reparations Committee, the content of which roughly states: China suffered the most serious losses during the war against Japan. From the July 7th Incident to the end of the war, the total loss of public and private materials in China amounted to 4.5 trillion U.S. dollars. This number does not include deaths, injuries, and military expenses. Therefore, China requires that it should receive at least 40% of the total amount of Japan's future compensation to the Allied countries for the purpose of postwar reconstruction. This plan is really the fairest and can definitely win the sympathy and adoption of the countries concerned.

From the above, the solution to the Japanese reparations problem is already imminent and cannot be delayed any longer. Japan, after its defeat, is in a state of rapid development day and night. In less than a year, it has entered the recovery stage from the demobilization period. According to the report of the US delegation investigating Japanese industrial groups, the Japanese financial groups still control huge wealth and economic power, and the industrial group system is so powerful in the domestic economy that it is unmatched by any capitalist industrialized country. Therefore, the continued existence of its potential power is not enough to prevent the revival of Japan's war industry potential. This shocking report makes it all the more necessary to resolve the Japanese reparations problem as soon as possible. According to the speculation of American diplomatic circles, if the Far Eastern Commission's discussion of this issue reaches a deadlock, then this issue will be submitted to the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion, and China will also have to send representatives to participate. From this, it can also be known that the U.S. authorities are also eagerly hoping for the solution to this problem, but looking ahead, there is really no room for optimism. Therefore, we have to shout loudly here and urge the politicians and diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union to use their great wisdom and ability to achieve a fair and reasonable solution to this problem as soon as possible and lay the most solid foundation for the great plan of peace in the Far East. Do not be shortsighted, selfish, and only see your own interests, and do not know the importance of peace in the Far East, competing with other countries for profits everywhere and risking stagnation, which will only benefit Japan's economic recovery and allow its potential forces to have the possibility of making a comeback. The Allied countries must take precautions against this early on. The U.S. proposal to immediately distribute 15% to 20% of Japanese assets first and then discuss the distribution of the remaining 80% to 85% at a later date is still not enough in our opinion.

### Review of Policies Regarding Studying Abroad

The results of the Ministry of Education's examinations for government-sponsored and self-funded students studying abroad were recently announced. The general public and those concerned about education have once again discussed the merits and demerits of policies regarding studying abroad. Recently, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Education, in a statement to news reporters, discussed policies regarding studying abroad, stating that during the eight years of war, European and American academia advanced rapidly, and the extent of their progress was beyond what we could imagine. To catch up with the times, we must start on two fronts: on the one hand, we should actively improve the equipment of our universities to seek a fundamental solution, and on the other hand, we should also select talented young people and send them abroad to study. "However, if there are no restrictions, the children of the wealthy can freely go abroad, which will inevitably lead to abuses." The Ministry of Education, considering the major plans for national and ethnic construction, welcomes opinions from society and is willing to consider them humbly. This frank and sincere attitude is worthy of our admiration.

First of all, we feel that it is a pity that we still have to discuss the issue of policies regarding studying abroad. China's dispatch of students to study abroad dates back 70 years. Wu Tingfang, Tang Shaoyi, Zhou Shouchen, Zhan Tianyou, and Yan Fu all studied abroad in this early period. But even now, our country is far from catching up with others in terms of academics, leading to the phenomenon that "European and American academia is advancing rapidly, and the extent of their progress is beyond what we can imagine." This truly makes us feel ashamed. We do not even have the qualifications to imagine their rapid progress. Shouldn't this be concerning? In the 70 years from the initial dispatch of students to Europe and the United States to the present, we have not been without achievements in education and academia, but we still have to discuss policies regarding studying abroad today. Shouldn't this be regrettable?

Studying abroad, in its essence, is a disgrace. It is a sign of a country's backwardness in academic education. When a country's academic education is developed, there should not be a large number of students going abroad to study. Japan and we simultaneously dispatched students to study in Europe and the United States. Later, we had to send students to study in Japan instead. In the 19th century, Americans also considered studying in Europe as an honor, but after American universities and academic education developed, this trend declined. Our current need to send students to study in Europe and the United States indicates that our country's academic education has not yet reached a developed state, which should be a shameful thing. However, the large number of students going abroad to study is a fact. The Ministry of Education manages students going abroad to study with extremely strict restrictions, and they must pass a rigorous examination before they can go abroad. The intention behind this is undoubtedly not questionable; however, the result of this restriction is that those who aspire to go abroad but do not want to take the examination, or those who fail the examination, have to seek other ways, leading to all kinds of abuses. All of this is a fact that cannot be concealed. Therefore, it is not useless for us to review the merits and demerits of our country's policies regarding studying abroad at this time.

Regarding students going abroad to study, we must point out several important points: First, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Education said, "However, if there are no restrictions, the children of the wealthy can freely go abroad, which will inevitably lead to abuses." We do not understand whether the adoption of a policy of controlling studying abroad is to prevent "the children of the wealthy from freely going abroad, in order to avoid abuses." What is the relationship between the children of the wealthy and abuses? Indeed, the children of the wealthy inevitably have some bad habits, but it is not necessarily the case that all those with bad habits are the children of the wealthy. Are there no children of the wealthy who are diligent in their studies? Therefore, the control of studying abroad should not be differentiated based on whether one is wealthy or not. Second, we must also acknowledge the fact that the stricter the control, the more the abuses. The children of the wealthy or those with power can still achieve the goal of studying abroad without taking the examination, by using various pretexts or different methods. As a result, it can be said that it is encouraging the bad habit of making false pretenses and suppressing good, pure-minded, studious young people.

Therefore, we doubt whether the state's policy of controlling studying abroad is a good strategy. At this time, if the state adopts a strict management policy and does not allow students to go abroad freely, while at the same time not actively improving and enriching domestic university education, it is tantamount to undermining the nation's vitality. That is why we feel gratified when we see the statement made by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education regarding policies regarding studying abroad; because the Ministry of Education also sees the necessity of actively improving the equipment of our universities to seek a fundamental solution; at the same time, it should also select talented young people and send them abroad to study. Here, the problem lies in the selection; are all those who pass the examination truly talented, and are all those who fail the examination incapable of being cultivated? If there are also talents among those who fail the examination who can be cultivated, then there should be a flexible solution within the strictness, so that the declining habit of making false pretenses can be slightly stopped, and true talents will not be abandoned. If handled too extremely, the result of strict control may not necessarily be as ideal as expected. The task of cultivating talents, as the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education said, should be considered from the perspective of the major plans for national and ethnic construction, and should not be based on emotional decisions. When our country's academic education is developed, the system of studying abroad can also be abolished without being banned. For the sake of our country and nation, we hope that it can come soon.

### Commander of Suppression Personally Enters Taihu Lake and Encounters Fierce Battle with Bandits, Capturing Bandit Leader Alive and Seizing Weapons and Ships

[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 10th] According to a telephone call from Mudu: Major General Chuan Jinfang, the commander of the Taihu Lake suppression, accompanied by Deputy Commander Liu Hongde, led a company of soldiers on speedboats on the 8th to personally patrol and sweep Taihu Lake. On the morning of the 9th, they encountered a group of scattered bandits on Pingtai Mountain. A fierce battle broke out between the two sides. One of our Disciplinary Corps cadres, Zhao Rengui, was killed in action. Fifteen bandits were captured, one light machine gun, two rifles, and two speed machine guns were seized, and two bandit ships were seized. In addition, a female hostage from Wuxing was rescued. It is reported that the bandit leader Liu Shenlin was originally a former subordinate of Liao Bingnan, who had already surrendered. He independently raised the banner of rebellion, which ultimately led to his capture alive. The Taihu Lake Command has telegraphed the Wuxi Command for instructions on how to handle the case, and it is likely that he will be executed.

[Yixing Dispatch] Scattered bandits are lurking in the southern mountainous area of Yixing, disturbing the local area. Since the establishment of the command headquarters for the suppression area on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the mountainous area has been divided into five districts: Zhangzhu, Taihua, Mingling, and Shanjuan, which are suppressed by the 4th Independent Engineer Regiment of the Army. For a month, the remnants of the bandits have been hiding. Recently, in order to thoroughly clear them, the command headquarters has formulated a second phase of suppression measures, which will continue to be carried out by the 4th Engineer Regiment. On the 1st of this month, Wu Zhongxiang, the regimental commander of the regiment and deputy commander of the Qing District on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, led his troops into the mountains to supervise the suppression, and also mobilized administrative party groups to strictly secure the Baojia system and information network, joint security pledges, etc. After days of advancement, most of the work is about to be completed.

### Anhui Northeast Recovered Area, Politics Has Become Stable, Li Pinxian Meets with Our Newspaper Reporter and Talks

[Our Hefei Dispatch on the 10th] Governor Li Pinxian of Anhui Province stated during an exclusive interview with our newspaper reporter: (1) The political situation in the recovered area of northeastern Anhui has become stable; because the provincial government had prepared county-level personnel and advanced with the army. (2) In early spring of this year, the dike on the north bank of the Yangtze River was built through government orders, which created a bumper harvest on both banks of the river this autumn. However, the dike construction on the Huai River in northeastern Anhui failed, and the Yellow River was not blocked, so the flooding caused by the Yellow River was even more severe than in previous years. (3) The salaries of public education personnel at the provincial and county levels are meager. Because the number of personnel is fixed, it cannot be reduced. The annual revenue is too small to increase salaries, resulting in serving the public on an empty stomach, just like the hardship in Dabie Mountain in those years. Among them, some township and Baojia personnel above the county level inevitably disturb the people. I hope that examples of oppression of the people will be reported at any time so that they can be improved.

### Zhenjiang-Shanghai Telephone Can Be Connected in One Hour

Zhenjiang Telecommunications Bureau Improves Business

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] After domestic telegraph and telephone rates were increased tenfold compared to the original price this month, our newspaper reporter inquired with the person in charge of the Zhenjiang Bureau to understand the actual situation of the local telegraph and telephone business. It is reported that: (1) For long-distance calls, the Zhenjiang-Shanghai call is the most congested. In the past, there were only two telephone lines, so the waiting time was often more than three or four hours. Recently, three carrier wave lines have been installed between Zhenjiang and Shanghai. Together with the original one, there are a total of four circuits. Now, the Zhenjiang-Shanghai call can be connected within one hour. In addition, the circuit between Zhenjiang and Nantong has also been opened, and one circuit has been added between Zhenjiang and Wujin, with a total of two circuits, which can be called at any time. (2) In terms of telegraphs, the bureau can send telegrams as soon as they arrive, and send and receive them as soon as they are received. Special express telegrams between Zhenjiang and Shanghai, Zhenjiang and Wuxi, and Zhenjiang and Changzhou can arrive within half an hour, and the delivery fee is still 2,000 yuan, and has not been increased. (3) For local calls, the bureau is handling them in accordance with the restrictions. However, due to the increase in the number of local agencies in Zhenjiang, there are recently more than 700 households. Now, in order to promote the connection work, in addition to repairing the machine lines at any time, inspectors are also dispatched to test the phones outside to urge the switchboard operators to pay attention to the connection and repair the user's equipment.

### Hangzhou Cultural Evening

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The "Cultural Evening," which broke the silence of the Hangzhou cultural circle, opened at the Youth Center on the night of the 9th. The meeting was sponsored by three units: the Hangzhou Alumni Association of the China Journalism School, the Zhejiang Provincial Association of Outlying Reporters, and the Hangzhou Office of our newspaper. More than 300 people from universities, newspapers, news agencies, magazines, and the cultural circles attended, making it an unprecedented event.

### On the Jinghu Road Train, Grain Merchants Encounter Nian Yang, Going Back and Forth Again and Again

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Zhang Shiliang, a grain merchant from Suzhou, originally from Shanghai, met a young man whom he did not know on the train while going to Shanghai a few days ago. He claimed to be a shareholder of Qin Chang Tobacco Shop on Dama Road outside Lumu Gate in Suzhou, named Zhu Songbai. They chatted along the way to relieve boredom and were quite congenial. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhu followed Zhang to a hotel. The next day, he suddenly claimed to have an urgent need and borrowed 50,000 yuan from Zhang. He then followed Zhang back to Suzhou and even went to Zhang's home with him. A few days later, while Zhang was out, he used sweet words to deceive Zhang's wife out of 100,000 yuan, and then disappeared without a trace. Zhang realized that he had been deceived and went to the area outside Lumu Gate to investigate for days. At noon on the 8th, he finally met Zhu on Hengma Road and twisted him into the police station, accusing him of deception. Unexpectedly, after Zhu was twisted into the police station, he suddenly wailed loudly, claiming that he had swallowed a pair of small screws into his stomach and that there was no hope of survival. The police station rushed him to Bu Xiong Hospital for treatment. After Dr. Zhang personally examined him, he found that his complexion was normal and his pulse and heart were beating without any sign of swallowing screws. The police then took him back to the police station. Because he deceived again and again, which was very hateful, he will be severely punished.

### Pinghu Rapeseed Cake Coin Case Transferred to Hebei District Court for Investigation

### Reviving the Tea Gardens in Western Anhui, Proceeding in the Form of Work Relief

[Our Lu'an Dispatch] The counties in western Anhui suffered a lot during the Anti-Japanese War. Due to the sluggish sales of tea and low prices, tea farmers generally mismanaged the tea gardens, resulting in a year-by-year reduction in tea production. In view of this, the Anhui Branch of the Relief Administration and the Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry have jointly formulated specific plans and cooperative methods for the purpose of revival and relief. The first phase will temporarily include three counties, Lu'an, Lihuang, and Huoshan, as the implementation area. The work period is temporarily set for three months.

### Zheng Tonghe Goes to Northern Jiangsu to Inspect and Will Seek to Eliminate the Canal Water Disaster

### A Master of Unparalleled Skills Commits Countless Crimes: Shandong's Flying Thief, Yanzi Li San, Arrested for the Third Time in Jinan

[Our Jinan Dispatch] The flying thief Li Shengwu (Yanzi Li San) had already been lurking in Jinan during the occupation, residing in Qinglong Street, Dongguan. In four years, he shot and killed three people and repeatedly robbed wealthy families and gold shops. He was once arrested after the victory, but unfortunately, he escaped en route during transfer. He then made an appearance at the Yusheng Dongtu Gao shop in the Daguanyuan. He remained at large for the past year, finally being arrested at the Maolai Inn on Guanyi Street in this city at 9 PM on the fourth of this month. A reporter, awed by the great name of the notorious flying thief Li Shengwu, who had roamed the north and south of the Yangtze River and committed countless crimes, visited Li Ximeng, the leader of the detective team of the police station that arrested Li, on the fifth to understand his true nature. He was led into Captain Yang's office, where the interrogation was taking place. There, in Captain Yang's office, he saw this figure with unparalleled skills. Li Shengwu was of medium height, with a long, round face. He was wearing only a black sleeping cap and a black short coat. He spoke with a Shandong Yucheng accent. His eyes were bright and piercing, and he sat on the sofa with such ease, listening to Captain Yang's detailed questioning, to which Li replied calmly.

Learning Skills Outside the Pass, First Taste of His Abilities

According to Li Shengwu, he is twenty-six years old this year and is from Li Village, Yucheng, Shandong. As a child, he attended private school for several years, but due to his mischievous nature, he could not get used to the rigid life and left home alone for Harbin. At the age of twelve, he met an extraordinary person and became his apprentice. There were three apprentices in total, one surnamed Hu, two surnamed Wu, and he—Li Shengwu—was the third. Later, in the martial world, he took the nickname "Yanzi Li San." At the age of sixteen, after mastering martial arts, the three apprentices joined together to roam the martial world. They displayed their unique skills in major cities and wharves in the nine northeastern provinces and officially entered the profession of theft. In 1933, they entered the Guannei (the region south of the Great Wall) together and operated in various places north and south of the Yangtze River. They committed countless major cases, relying solely on their martial arts, and never got caught. The name Yanzi Li San became even more famous. Later, the two elder brothers died one after another, leaving him alone. He continued to engage in this cost-free business until 1943 when he came to Jinan.

The Past Two Arrests

During his four years in Jinan, he committed many crimes, too many to remember. The main targets were gold shops and wealthy households. He only took gold, silver, cash, and valuables, nothing else. He remembers that in 1944, he stole more than thirty taels of pure gold from the Xinhengli Gold Shop. Unfortunately, the West District Police Precinct in the city found out, and he was arrested and sent to court, where he was sentenced to six months in prison. After escaping from prison, in early September 1945, he broke into the Ermei Swiss Watch Shop and stole more than forty pens and 400,000 yuan in cash. Afterward, in early August, the detectives Xue Liwen and Zhang Shouting discovered the clues and followed him to No. 38 Shenjia Hutong, Qinglong Street, Cheguandong (Li Dian's house). This was his second arrest. At that time, he was handcuffed with two pairs of foreign handcuffs and tied to a rickshaw, preparing to be escorted to the headquarters. He knew that his crimes were too serious, so he constantly thought about escaping. When the rickshaw went from Dongguan to the east end of Xiandong Lane Beitou Dongxicaiyuanzi, he seized the opportunity when the escorts were momentarily distracted and jumped onto the houses and escaped again.

Three Murders, Ruthless and Vicious

From then on, he harbored resentment towards Xue Liwen (the detective who arrested him) and prepared to retaliate at any time. In May 1946, one day at noon, he secretly carried a pistol to Xue Liwen's house on Xiaowangfu Street, claiming to have something to discuss. Coincidentally, Xue was out on business, so he sat in the house waiting. He smoked two packs of Qianmen cigarettes but Xue Liwen still didn't return. Growing impatient, he took out his pistol and shot both his grandmother and his mother, leaving three bullet casings on the table, intending to let Xue know how formidable I was. This matter, besides Xue himself, was known in great detail, so from then on, Li Laotou often used this as blackmail to ask me for money. After thinking it over again and again, I thought that if this continued, he would inevitably leak the secret to outsiders, so I decided to kill Li Laotou. One night, I led Li Laotou out for a walk, from Quehua Bridge to the base of the South City Wall of the South Gate. Seeing that no one was around, I shot and killed Li Laotou at the entrance of the Jiujunmen Alley, firing five shots in total. I then walked back to the commercial port and returned to Yucheng the next day.

Opening Fire in Daguanyuan to Resist Arrest

I remember one day, I was wearing a yellow railway worker's uniform and carrying a Nanfei-style pistol. I went to the Yusheng Dongtu Gao shop in Daguanyuan to smoke opium (it is said that Li met a pair of flower sisters in the Tu Gao shop). Originally, this pistol was Zhang ××'s, and I was going to pass it on to Captain Nie of the pseudo-Garrison Force. Unexpectedly, while I was smoking, I heard a commotion outside. The waiter loudly told everyone not to panic, that the Tu Gao shop was being investigated. Suddenly, I noticed several burly men behind the waiter, who turned out to be detectives. I immediately dropped my opium pipe, pulled out my pistol. Although some detectives had already entered the opium couch, they turned around and ran out when they saw me holding a pistol. I hurriedly grabbed my clothes and ran to the kitchen, then climbed to a high place from the kitchen, crossed over several civilian houses, walked to the north end of Daguanyuan, followed the scaffolding built by a house under construction, walked to Weier Road, and escaped again.

Left Leg Wounded, Finally Caught in the Net of Justice

A few days ago, I returned to Jinan from Yancheng, intending to buy some groceries to take back for business. I stayed in the east room of the Maolai Inn on Guanyi Street, because the owner was an old acquaintance, a friend introduced by my fellow villager Li Sitong. But because of my secretive movements, I was finally discovered by the detectives. So, the day before yesterday, under a tight encirclement, this tiger with wings was wounded in the left leg, unable to leap onto the roof and use his old tricks, and was put in shackles and pushed into the iron cage of national law.

### Handling of Students from the Temporary University Preparatory Class

—Reply from the Ministry of Education Regarding Students in That Class—

Dear Sir: In order to help students from specialized schools and above in the recovered areas to continue their studies, the Ministry previously established temporary university preparatory classes in Peiping, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, and other places. Students who had studied at pseudo-specialized schools and above were enrolled in these classes to receive preparatory training and examination. After the preparatory period, students with excellent conduct and examination results that met the following standards would be assigned to schools by the Ministry.

(1) Those who passed all subjects in the preparatory and basic courses would be promoted and assigned.

(2) Those whose grades in all specialized preparatory courses were above 75 points, and students who took basic courses and failed one subject or failed two basic courses but had grades above 75 points in all preparatory courses, would be assigned to repeat the grade.

Those who did not meet the above conditions would not be assigned and should take the school entrance examination themselves. The Ministry had already established the "Measures for the Graduation Examination and Assignment of Students Upon Completion of Preparatory Training in Temporary University Preparatory Classes" and notified all classes. Students in Peiping, Qingdao, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and other preparatory classes who had completed their preparatory training had already been reviewed and assigned by the Ministry. As for the students in the Wuhan Temporary University Preparatory Class, they only studied the teachings of Sun Yat-sen and the speeches of Chairman Mao, Chinese language, English, Chinese history, Chinese geography, and selected one or two of the following subjects: general algebra and algebra, analytical geometry and geometry, introduction to philosophy, jurisprudence, general biology, physics, chemistry, and introduction to calculus (some did not select any). Of the 77 students recommended for admission without examination by the class, 15 were found to have false academic qualifications or forged documents, 5 attended original schools that were not at the university level or did not meet the admission requirements, 5 did not submit documents or had problematic documents, and 48 were from schools that had already started and should return to their original schools (a small number of these also had problematic academic qualifications). Another 5 students were assigned to other schools. The remaining students who did not meet the standards should still take the school entrance examination themselves in accordance with the regulations. According to the academic qualifications they filled in, 68 of them could return to their original schools. However, recently, some students have been circulating printed materials and sending appeals to newspapers under the name of the "Wuhan Temporary University Petition Group" (the Ministry only has preparatory classes and has not established this type of university). The Ministry assigns students to schools in accordance with the original regulations. All students whose academic performance is not excellent should make extra efforts to study in preparation for taking the school entrance examination again. As for the small number of students with false academic qualifications or forged documents, their student status cannot be recognized in accordance with the regulations. To prevent the public from misunderstanding the truth, this letter is hereby sent for your reference, hoping that you will publish the original letter in the "Reader's Opinions" column. (Ministry of Education, Higher Education Department)

### Public Servants' Work Morale

I remember at a recent meeting, our county magistrate said in his report, "In recent days, the efficiency of this government has not only failed to improve but has also declined imperceptibly. Most of the daily office hours are not in accordance with the regulations. The morning office hours are from 7:30 AM, but often no one arrives in the office until 9:00 AM. The afternoon office hours are until 5:30 PM, but often everyone leaves before 5:00 PM." In this statement, I deeply feel why there is such negligence. How could Magistrate Hu not understand that the main reason is the meager salary and the lack of proper management, which makes people lack the spirit and morale to work? Everyone is just thinking of getting through the day. Speaking of salary, it is really pitiful. At the county level, senior staff earn an average of 70,000 yuan per month (self-supplied), junior staff earn 50,000 yuan per month (self-supplied), and public laborers earn 25,000 yuan per month (self-supplied). But the prices outside are increasing rapidly. The county magistrate always says at every meeting that he will try his best to increase salaries, but in reality, it still requires the financial authorities to believe that the financial revenue and expenditure are balanced and that the finances are sufficient before there can be a real improvement. Otherwise, the result is still a pie in the sky that cannot satisfy hunger. It is always said that with the current prices increasing without end and our extremely low income, even if we were given twice the salary, it would still not be enough. What can we do with this little money?

As for our food, it is even more pitiful, needless to say. What we eat every day really has no nutritional value—because the pressure of salary and life is overwhelming, many people have left recently, holding onto hope is like waiting for a rabbit to fall from a tree, completely hopeless! The most pitiful are our junior staff, who put in the greatest effort in their work, but the rewards they enjoy are far less than those of laborers! However, we hope that the wise authorities will consider improving the situation for us junior staff. As the saying goes, everyone has a sense of compassion! (Jin Jiaxiang)

### Heavy Penalties for Excess Baggage

We are all educated people who were displaced by the brutal and unreasonable invasion of the Japanese invaders, causing us to lose our jobs. Although the Japanese invaders have now surrendered, the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists has not ended, and most businesses have not yet recovered. To make a living, we have no choice but to work as peddlers like beasts of burden. But there are a few questions. As far as we know, personal baggage (1) is allowed to weigh 20 kilograms per person. If it exceeds 20 kilograms, a baggage ticket must be purchased. (2) Baggage tickets are managed by the so-called "black hats" (porters). (3) There is a receipt for the purchase of a baggage ticket. However, the Jiashan Station is the opposite. Baggage tickets are managed by railway police. Even if the baggage is less than 20 kilograms, a baggage ticket is required (4,000 yuan). If it exceeds 20 kilograms, there is no baggage ticket, and a fine of 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000 yuan or more is imposed, but there is no receipt. Alas! After being fined tens of thousands of yuan like this, we have to make three or four trips for nothing! Recalling the time of the enemy and puppets, doing business as peddlers required "buying a passage." Now that victory has been achieved, although there is no "buying a passage," there is unreasonable fining. How can this be justified! The railway authorities must strictly prohibit this! (Jiashan Peddlers Chu Kuixing, Ling Qian Shi, Li Pinghua, Lu Chen Shi, Zhang Yuncai, Xu Wenzhen, Wang Ruyu, Fu Yifang, Chen Jinqing, Shen Sibao)

### Earlier Time for Emptying Night Soil Buckets

In the vicinity of Minguo Road and Dajing Road in the southern part of the city, every morning around nine o'clock, night soil carts are lined up on the streets, and the stench permeates the air. Passersby cover their noses and pass by. This not only hinders the business of shops but also affects traffic order. Moreover, Shanghai is for international observation, and this really harms the essential principles of hygiene. If the time for emptying the night soil buckets is advanced, the above-mentioned shortcomings can be reduced, and the health habits of early rising among citizens can be promoted. It is rumored that the city has recently implemented a cleaning campaign, so the health authorities should seriously consider this issue. (Zhou Wuxing)

### Throwing Garbage on the Roadside

This afternoon, while passing by the vicinity of the railway station on Triumph Road, I saw a truck loaded with garbage (license plate number Hu 30245) dumping a full load of refuse on the vacant land beside the road. I hope the relevant authorities will pay attention. (Zhang Li)

### US Notifies China, Britain and 16 Other Countries: Negotiating Tariff Reduction Agreements; International Trade Conference Scheduled for Next Spring

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] The US State Department will today formally notify China, Britain, Australia, France, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, India, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Poland, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, and the Soviet Union, a total of 18 countries. They will be informed that the US is willing to negotiate mutual tariff reduction agreements with them. However, it is not yet known whether the Republican Party will support this economic policy. Deputy Secretary of State Clayton said that the Republican Party has not yet expressed support for the government's political or economic policies. However, it is generally said that many influential Republicans support the system of international free trade in order to abolish military barriers, excessively high tariffs, and deliberate discrimination. The conference proposed by the US will be held in Geneva next April. After the conference, even if an agreement is not reached with the 18 countries, the US will conduct negotiations with each country individually in order to reach an agreement. Clayton also said that the US is willing to allow countries whose industries are still in their infancy, such as India, to maintain protectionist trade policies for a specific period of time. However, it is believed that the maintenance of this policy must have a definite time limit. According to Acting Secretary of State Acheson, the US government's announcement is another step forward in the plan for international economic cooperation, and it is the largest-scale negotiation on mutual trade agreements. The US will ask other major countries to make concessions on tariffs and other items on most of the goods exported by the US. In the negotiations, the US will also collect information on restrictions or discrimination encountered by US export trade. The US wants the proposed trade agreement to contain a clause similar to the US trade clause, namely, that if domestic industries suffer serious damage due to unforeseen circumstances, the provisions of the concessions may be revised or revoked. According to Brown, Director of the Commercial Policy Department of the State Department, the 18 countries were recommended by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, and other countries are welcome to join in the future.

### UN General Assembly Passes Resolution to Locate Permanent Headquarters in the US; Membership Applications of Afghanistan and Two Other Countries Approved; Resolution on Conference of Non-Self-Governing Peoples Also Passed

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] After a slow-moving committee meeting on the 7th, the UN General Assembly reconvened today to discuss various agendas for four hours. The situation of the meeting is recorded as follows: (1) After behind-the-scenes coordination by our country's representative, Xian Weijun, the General Assembly unanimously accepted the membership applications of Iceland, Sweden, and Afghanistan; (2) The General Assembly resolved to reconsider the permanent headquarters of the United Nations being located anywhere within the United States; (3) The General Assembly verbally voted to pass Egypt's proposal to include the draft resolution on forcing and discriminating against human rights on the agenda of the General Assembly.

The General Assembly also accepted the Secretary-General's report stating that the Security Council will no longer deal with the Spanish question, and therefore requested the General Assembly to postpone the discussion until the next General Assembly.

### Bulgarian Troops Gather on Greek-Turkish Border; Aircraft Appear Overhead

[United Press, Athens, 10th] The Greek Propaganda Department issued a bulletin today stating that Bulgarian mechanized units and aircraft are concentrated near the border between Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. The bulletin did not estimate the number of Bulgarian troops there, but only stated, "According to a report from the command of the Thracian Defense Force, Bulgarian mechanized units are seen concentrated near the border between the three countries, and new aircraft have appeared over Bulgarian airfields in the area." The bulletin also stated that, according to a report from the Soufli Defense Force command, a Bulgarian military officer named Lieutenant Colonel Korokanov, "formerly held an important position in the Bulgarian Army Department, and has recently 'automatically surrendered' to the Greek advanced defense forces on Mount Beles."

### Portuguese Prime Minister's Speech Praises Soviet Achievements

### Czech Foreign Minister Broadcasts in Support of the United Nations

[United Press, New York, 10th] Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk said in a broadcast here today: "There is no path to peace other than through the United Nations organization. Republicans and Democrats alike can seek peace. Freedom of thought, speech, and the immortal soul is the path to peace."

### Wallace's Speech: Focusing on Vandenberg; Advocating Truman Should Remain in Office

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace told reporters today that although President Truman will face a Senate and House of Representatives controlled by the Republican Party, for the sake of the national interest, Truman should continue to serve as president. He is better than either Vandenberg or Byrnes. Wallace continued to mention his policy of "not being too tough on the Soviet Union" and said that before the election, he traveled throughout the country and felt that if the Democratic Party could adopt a true American policy aimed at peace, instead of adopting Vandenberg's tough policy, the election results for the Democratic Party might not have been so tragic.

### World War II Memorial Unveiled in London Yesterday; King, Queen, Former Prime Ministers Participate

[Reported] Paris, 10th, Broadcasting from London: The memorial for the fallen soldiers of World War II was unveiled here today. After two minutes of silence, King George VI unveiled the monument. A monument with the words "1939" engraved on the right, and a monument with the words "1945" engraved on the left. Thus, the memorials for the fallen soldiers of the two world wars stand side by side in one place.

Some troops marched in front of the military band and saluted. After the King, Princess Elizabeth and the Queen, Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother stood beside. Members of the royal family all stood to participate. Prime Minister Attlee and wartime Prime Minister Churchill were also present. Finally, representatives from various autonomous territories such as India and Burma all offered flower wreaths. The ceremony was presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

### Jewish Secret Radio Station Claims to Expand the Scope of Terror; Riots Erupt Again in Jerusalem Yesterday

[Special Dispatch] London, 10th, Broadcasting from London: Riots broke out again in Jerusalem today. The train station was bombed, causing many deaths and injuries.

[United Press, London, 9th] The police headquarters has dispatched additional police to guard major government buildings today to prevent unlawful acts by Jewish terrorist groups. A Palestinian Jewish secret radio station announced that Jewish terrorist groups will expand their activities outside of Palestine.

[Reuters, London, 10th] According to reports from Vienna, it is rumored that Jewish terrorists in the area intend to demonstrate in Vienna on the anniversary of the occupation of Vienna by Germany. British troops and German soldiers have taken strict precautions.

### Attlee Delivers Speech: Britain Strives for Peace, Must Maintain Strength While Universal Security Remains Unestablished, Solving the German Question is Key to European Prosperity

[Reuters, London, 9th] Prime Minister Attlee addressed the traditional Lord Mayor of London's banquet today, declaring Britain's determination to continue advancing towards its peaceful goals and to alleviate the heavy burden of armaments on the world's people. The Prime Minister, when speaking of the United Nations organization, particularly emphasized the point of transferring sovereignty. He reiterated that a satisfactory solution to the German question is essential for European peace and prosperity. He also solemnly declared that until a sense of security and trust is re-established in the world, Britain must maintain its defense forces and preserve its national strength. He stated that the British government bears a great responsibility to the people at home and in the Commonwealth and Empire, and cannot relinquish this responsibility until a more certain security is secured to replace the current situation.

Hopes for the United Nations

I believe many people are disappointed with the way the United Nations has been operating. The entire mechanism is mired in distrust due to unreasonable attacks and obstruction in the assembly. We can assert that if the United Nations organization is used as a forum for debating prejudices, it will undoubtedly fail. Only if this organization can guarantee the safety and freedom of all countries and their way of life, while contributing to the benefit of the entire world, can the United Nations organization succeed. We believe that when discussing each issue, we must first ask ourselves, "Will this solution contribute to the advancement of peace and understanding?" I believe that the people in every corner of the world long for real peace and disarmament, so that the various problems of the world can be resolved on this basis.

Actions Demonstrate Endurance of Accusations

For this reason, my friend, Foreign Secretary Bevin, whether in United Nations meetings, when receiving reporters, or in broadcast speeches, has tried his best to avoid responding to those who attack Britain. It is better to demonstrate with facts than to reply with words. Our actions in India, Burma, and elsewhere in the colonial empire can vividly demonstrate that the British Empire and the Commonwealth are not motivated by imperialism. We must continue to strive towards our peaceful ideals and reduce the heavy burden of armaments on the world's people. However, I must make it clear here that disarmament cannot be unilateral. While widespread trust and security are being established in the world, we must maintain our defense capabilities and remain strong.

Regarding Germany: Considering All Aspects

Continuing on the German question, he said that a satisfactory solution to the German question is the key to European prosperity, peace, and stability. We must not allow Central Europe to become a base for cheap, malnourished, and lazy labor, as such phenomena can lead to a lowering of our living standards. Therefore, we must act cautiously, but we will also never allow Germany's industry to become an arsenal for promoting new wars again. We should carefully consider both of these points when implementing our policy towards Germany. We have considered various possible solutions and have also proposed our own, and we are willing to discuss them openly. In short, establishing a Europe where many countries can coexist peacefully, each enjoying its traditional culture and ideas, is a necessary condition for world peace, and resolving the German question is the most important key to dealing with the entire issue.

### Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting: Review of One Week's Work, Trieste Issue to Promote Direct Negotiations, Soviet Union Still Insists on Opposing Danube Navigation

[Reuters, New York, 10th] After a week of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in New York, there are still no signs that the previous difficulties can be resolved. On Trieste, the Danube, and other thorny issues, the four powers have only reiterated their previous positions without any changes. The border provisions of the Italian peace treaty have not yet been discussed by the four powers. Some observers believe that the four powers intend to give Italy and Yugoslavia sufficient time to conduct direct negotiations. Judging from recent developments in Rome and Belgrade, the two sides seem to be getting closer. What is currently lacking is full cooperation between Rome, Belgrade, and New York, so the removal of domestic politics by the Italian or Yugoslav government may at any time conflict with the four powers' encouragement of compromise between the two countries. For example, Tito's suggestion of exchanging Trieste for Gorizia seems to have little connection with the approach taken by the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Tomic in New York. The four foreign ministers' step-by-step discussion of the Romanian peace treaty did not show that the Soviet Union was willing to change its previous position and abandon its opposition to the Western countries' participation in the issue of Danube navigation rights being included in the treaty. In addition, an important principle has been established. Molotov has repeatedly raised the opinions of the minority countries rejected at the Paris Peace Conference during the week, meaning that the Soviet Union is at least prepared to recognize that the Foreign Ministers' Meeting may adopt final decisions on the suggestions of a minority or majority in the Paris Peace Conference.

### London Holds Lord Mayor's Show: Annual Parade

Two-Mile-Long Procession, Only Seen After the War

[United Press, London, 9th] London's new Lord Mayor, Smith, will take office next year. Today's Lord Mayor's Show parade was two miles long, the longest seen in years. The crowds thronged to the Lord Mayor's residence. The new Lord Mayor came from humble beginnings, starting as a $7-a-week bellboy and rising to become the manager of a West End hotel.

### US Revokes Price Controls: Rent, Sugar, Rice, and Livestock Among Them, Truman to Deliver Broadcast Speech Today

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] President Truman announced last night that all national price controls, except for rent, sugar, and rice, will be lifted from today. He said that the current method of price control is not effective, and returning to a free economy will promote healthy production. Since some goods are still in short supply, prices may increase after the price limits are lifted.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] President Truman, due to the results of the general election, said that the people of the whole country have expressed their disgust with the wartime price control policy. Today he ordered the abolition of all asset and price restriction regulations, except for rent and sugar. Rent may be raised appropriately. The President's decree stated: From now on, the law of market supply and demand will be used freely, which will be better for the people than the government's continued control of commodity prices. The parity law was originally forced, and now that it has lost the support of the people, it cannot achieve practical results. The Price Administration is temporarily retained, and the transmission host should be appropriate.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th Special Dispatch] The White House announced today: Truman will issue a statement on policy on the 11th. White House Secretary Ross said: This statement has not yet been drafted, so it cannot be detailed. Most people believe that the US foreign policy remains unchanged, so the statement is expected to mainly address domestic issues. According to Senator Kerr, a visiting Democratic Party member who visited the US President today, Truman will announce his plan on the restoration of peacetime status on foreign and domestic affairs in the short term.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] According to people close to President Truman: The President is scheduled to deliver a broad speech to the people of the country on the 11th of this month, at which time he will announce that he will place the interests of the country above all personal and party interests. At the same time, he will also issue a brief statement to the press, calling on the Republican Party to cooperate with the government.

### Gandhi Appeals to Muslims: Please Protect Hindus

Three Hundred Killed in Chirala Riot

[Agence France-Presse, Chandernagore, India, 9th] The All India Radio Station issued a message saying: Mahatma Gandhi went to the areas in Bihar Province where Hindu-Muslim conflicts occurred to inspect. He convened a meeting of local officials here today, delivered a speech saying: I always hope that India can implement Pakistan (the partition of India and Pakistan), but I do not want to achieve this goal at the expense of millions of people. The minority ethnic group in Bihar Province is composed of Hindu Indians, not Muslims, so Muslims should protect their Hindu compatriots and must try their best to make the people happy and united. Saint Wei had a little fruit for water today. His followers were all pleased when asked about it, but he is still prepared to fast at any time.

[Our Report] London, 10th Radio: Conflicts in India occurred again today and intensified. In the Chirala area, 300 people died and countless were injured.

### Afghanistan Accepts Invitation: To Participate in Pan-Asian Conference

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 9th] The Afghanistan College in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and the Malaya Gu Cultural Organization have accepted the invitation of the Indian Provisional Government to attend the Pan-Asian Conference to be held in New Delhi next spring. The reactions of other Asian countries are not yet known.

### Sending Delegation to Visit: US Naval Equipment

### French National Assembly Election: Westward Democracy or Eastward Communism, Results to be Known After Public Voting

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] France and its overseas territories today elected the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic. This is the ninth time the French people have held elections in two years. The National Assembly includes 619 members, 32 more than the Second Constituent Assembly. The allocation of seats is as follows: 544 seats in mainland France, 30 seats in the North African Algerian territory, and 45 seats in overseas territories. After the general election on the 14th, that is, on the 24th of this month, the country will also elect members of the Council of State of the Republic, which is the second chamber of the National Assembly, including 315 members. The Council of State will hold its first meeting on December 24 this year, but the two chambers must convene a formal meeting in early January next year to elect the President of the Republic, who will appoint the Prime Minister of the Cabinet. The government institutions of the Fourth Republic will then begin to operate, and the task of the provisional government will come to an end.

### 26 Million Voters, 3,000 Candidates

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] France's 26 million male and female citizens are scheduled to elect the first parliament after liberation today. There are 3,000 candidates in France and overseas territories, competing for 618 seats in Congress. The main political parties running for election are the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the People's Republican Party, the Radical Party, and the conservative Republican Freedom Party. There is no doubt that the three major parties will continue to hold leading positions, but whether the Communist Party can obtain the most seats in Congress is of great concern to the general public. Semi-official sources, according to estimates from the Ministry of the Interior, say that the Conservative Party, the Radical Party, and the Communist Party can gain more seats, the Socialist Party has no gorgeous entry, and the People's Republican Party will lose seats.

### No Matter Which Party Wins: Will Eventually Form a Coalition Government

[United Press, Paris, 10th] Like other European countries after the war, French voters will choose between Eastern Communism and Western democracy, which is the root cause of the first congressional campaign in the Fourth French Republic. The People's Republican Party said that the Communist Party accepts Moscow's command; the Communist Party said that the People's Republican Party only listens to the Roman Curia. (The People's Republican Party also calls it the Catholic Progressive Party.) The People's Republican Party said: This is a struggle between matter and spirit, dictatorship and freedom. The Communist Party said: This is a struggle between democracy and reactionaries.

In the previous two elections, each party showed that it had more than five million party members; in the most recent constituent assembly, the People's Republican Party occupied 166 seats out of 576 seats, and the Communist Party occupied 153 seats. Neither party was able to obtain a majority party position. This time, the Congress has 618 seats, 31 more than the Constituent Assembly, so it wants to be a majority party. You must obtain 310 seats. Under France's multi-party system, no party has the opportunity to obtain such a majority. No matter which party wins, it must contact the smaller parties to form a coalition government.

### Political Balance of the Three Major Parties: Unlikely to be Shaken Due to Elections

[Also from the 9th] France and its territories are scheduled to elect the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic tomorrow. This election is largely a contest between the Communist Party and the People's Republican Party. Both parties have stated: If they can obtain a majority in Congress, they will exclude each other from the new cabinet. Although the People's Republican Party wants to win the support of the de Gaulle faction and promises to form a centrist government after winning, political observers predict that the results of this election will not shake the political balance jointly maintained by the Communist Party, the People's Republican Party, and the Socialist Party. The new government will generally still be a coalition government of various parties.

### World's Largest Transport Plane: Test Flight Results Good, Weighs 92 Tons, Speed 300 Miles Per Hour

### Japanese Assets in China and Korea: Soviet Union Still Refuses to Use as Compensation Items, US Has Notified Soviet Union of Its Opinions on This Matter

[United Press, Washington, 9th] United Press has exclusively learned from blind sources today: The United States is conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union on the matter of dividing up Japanese assets in Korea. The State Department has informed the Soviet Union, stating that it is willing to leave this asset in Korea, but only on the condition that this asset be left for the use of Koreans, and the Soviet Union must not interfere. This matter was first initiated by the United States' suggestion that the Far East Commission discuss the issue of Japanese compensation. The Soviet Union immediately claimed that this meeting was not within the scope of discussion on all Japanese assets abroad, especially in Korea. The US responded by saying: It is willing to leave Japanese assets in Korea to the Koreans, but it cannot be given to the Soviet Union. This dispute has not yet been resolved. Further compromises can be made only after the Soviet Union clarifies its attitude towards whether the Far East Commission has the right to discuss Japanese legacy issues. The State Department invited countries from the Far East Commission to convene a Japanese compensation meeting, and only the Soviet Union refused to participate. The Soviet Union is now asking to participate on the condition that Japanese assets abroad not be discussed. Its intention is probably not only to limit the meeting to Japanese property in Korea, but also to ensure that the Japanese industrial equipment that the Soviet Union has fully loaded from northeastern China will not be raised for discussion. In addition, in order to speed up the distribution of Japanese compensation outside the Far East Committee, the United States has asked the countries concerned in the East Committee to consult with the United States in order to draft temporary instructions to inform MacArthur how to proceed, and to distribute 15% to 20% of Japanese domestic assets that have been designated for compensation to countries that claim compensation first.

### The Soviet Union Fought Japan for Six Days: Gained Greatly in the Northeast

No Wonder Most of the Countrymen are Filled with Anger: Bowley Survey Team Member Declared Yesterday

[United Press, San Francisco, 9th] Mining engineer Clement of the Japanese Legacy Survey Team led by Bowley said at a banquet at the Federal Club here today: The Soviet military occupation of the East Jiulong provinces of China caused chaos in the industry there, causing resentment among the Chinese. After the industrial equipment in the East Jiulong provinces was moved away, the seeds of social unrest were sown. China resisted Japan for eight years, and the Soviet Union only fought Japan for six days, but gained greatly. It is no wonder that most of the people are filled with anger and extreme fear for the future.

### Chaplin Films: New Film "Landru"

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] According to rumors here, Hollywood's veteran comedian Chaplin will settle in France and spend his old age there as soon as the new "Landru" is finished. The new film is based on real events. After World War I, there was a French pervert, Lundreu, who married many wives one after another. One of his wives was found burned to death in the stove, and Chaplin played the protagonist in the story.

### A Look at Yankee Industry and Agriculture: A Prediction of the American Economic Future

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

[New York Airmail, October 9th] Some economists in London pessimistically predict that the United States will experience an unprecedented economic "depression" in the near future. The reason for this depression is due to economic imbalances and a sharp decline in the massive wartime national income, which will completely disconnect production and consumption mechanisms. British economists even predict that the depression will be even more terrible than in 1929, to the point where Wall Street banks will all close, factories will shut down, and stores will go bankrupt? Then, it will gradually recover, similar to the situations in 1933 and 1934.

The predictions from London have caused extreme resentment in New York and Washington. American economists, especially the experts of Roosevelt's "New Deal," have put forward many forceful defenses. They acknowledge that the American economic recovery is difficult, but national consumption remains at its original level. The general national income will not suddenly decrease in the recent years, although "there are many difficult factors involved." The economic problems of the richest countries are the most difficult to solve. No country in the world has a more deformed and chaotic economic situation than the United States today. There is no gasoline, no white sugar, no pork; these are the major shortages, and even milk is not easy to buy. A few days ago, there was a truck driver strike, and even matches were unavailable. Now that the truck strike has just ended, the sailors are now striking. After the sailors got a raise, the dockworkers are also "refusing to work." Many factories have stopped working; factory owners would rather have their machines sit idle and rust than produce at a loss.

Congress is debating economic problems all day long. Michigan Republican Congressman Hoffman is roaring like a madman: "Please let the government disclose the truth about price controls! Thousands upon thousands of factories are gradually shutting down; raw materials cannot be bought, and finished products have price limits. This is the end of America." He publicly stated: "We Republicans cannot stand these strange things. The Republican Party is determined to overthrow the OPA (Office of Price Administration)!"

What methods will the Republican Party use to overthrow the OPA? No matter how Congress roars and how much ability they use, the Office of Price Administration still stands firm. The head of the Office of Price Administration, Paul, is not only the "it" person in Washington today but also one of Truman's economic advisors. A few days ago, there were rumors that Paul would be appointed Secretary of Commerce, and the "New York Daily News" surprisingly wrote: "Oh, my God! This is terrible!"

In fact, the current government of the Democratic Party will not change its current economic policies. The Department of Commerce has been continuously publishing various statistics, proving the improvement of the post-war economic situation. For example, in August, the total transaction volume of department stores across the United States reached $1,625,510,000, an increase of 20% compared to August 1945. The turnover of manufacturers nationwide for the three months of June, July, and August increased by 36.7%. The turnover of retail stores nationwide in August increased by 44% compared to August of last year and also increased by 11% compared to July of this year. Another report from the Department of Commerce stated that exports of industrial manufacturers across the United States increased by more than $30,000,000 in August, creating a new record of $1,830,000,000 in total production value; however, among many manufacturers, there was no increase in the automobile industry or the hardware industry; the canned meat industry, the soap industry, and the leather industry even saw a decrease.

Among industrial manufacturers, the fastest-growing and most profitable industries are the cigarette industry and the paper industry. The leather industry in the United States is almost "hopeless." During the war, it was impossible to buy leather suitcases, leather bags, and leather purses for women in the American market. After the war, although many leather factories resumed operations, there was still a shortage of raw materials. The head of the "Mobilization and Reconversion Bureau," Timon, recently hosted Washington reporters and said: "The Mobilization and Reconversion Bureau has decided to reward leather manufacturers for importing raw cowhide from abroad to strengthen the leather industry. The finished products will not be subject to price restrictions." According to estimates by those in charge of the leather industry, 30% of the leather currently used in the United States comes from overseas. As for the export of leather finished products, he shook his head and said: "At most, one percent."

Besides leather, the United States is also lacking rubber. During the war, most of the rubber in the United States was transported from South America (especially from Brazil). The weather, geography, and environment of the United States do not allow for the cultivation of high-quality rubber trees, just like not being able to cultivate high-quality tung oil trees. Recently, the United States ordered 60,000 tons of rubber from England, to be delivered before the end of this year. In addition, a trade agreement was signed with England, allowing British businessmen to grow forests in Malaya.

What is overproduced is cotton. This year's cotton harvest in the southern United States is again abundant, and the sales of cotton will definitely be in surplus. The National Production Bureau of the U.S. government plans to gradually reduce cotton production each year to avoid affecting the price of cotton and the cotton textile industry. The first step is to reduce by 10%, and then gradually decrease each year.

The cotton problem is not the core of the economic illness. The key to the current economic imbalance in the United States still lies in the disconnect between industrial production and how to adjust wages and costs. According to the recent business report from the Federal Reserve Bank, companies in many cities across the country have made huge profits in September; however, companies that have always relied on factories as their main source of income have been greatly impacted. In Pittsburgh, the largest heavy industry center in the United States, the business of shops throughout the city decreased by 71% in September due to the power workers' strike. As a result, many small shops have closed down.

The situation in agriculture is the most stable and optimistic. American agricultural economists have always advocated reducing the rural population to increase the individual cultivated land of farmers. As a result of the four years of war, 4,000,000 American farmers left the countryside due to the war; however, agricultural production did not decrease due to the reduction in the rural population. On the contrary, the total value of agricultural production increased by a quarter compared to before the war. The industrialization of agriculture across the United States and the large-scale use of machinery and new-style farms are one reason; the other reason is the good facilities for water conservancy and irrigation, which have established an unshakable foundation for the countryside.

In order to balance the 1947 federal government budget, President Truman reduced two-thirds of the next year's "water conservancy expenditure," totaling approximately $500,000,000. A group of congressmen from rural areas were greatly angered by this. They formed a subcommittee to ask Truman to explain in person. The two leaders of this group were Senator McKellar and Senator Stewart from Tennessee, the home of the TVA. In addition, there was Congressman Whittington from Mississippi, Congressman Harris from Arkansas, and Congressman Bauken from Alabama. "Why take frugality measures on water conservancy? Moreover, a reduction of 65% is being made!" Congressman Beall from Maryland described Truman's frugality as "municipal council"-style accounting. Congressman Bauken from Alabama said very vehemently that the president had no right to cut the water conservancy expenditure approved by Congress. He said: "We have many ways to balance the budget. Why not send less supplies to Yugoslavia?"

President Truman personally attended their meeting. The President admired their sincerity in seeking happiness for the farmers. The President said very apologetically: "I will definitely accept your opinions. Let me consider it again at length."

This case was considered to have come to a conclusion in this way. A Chinese reporter who was listening in could not help but be particularly moved. We are a country that "establishes the country on agriculture." What should we do?

### The Hardoon Estate is in Dispute Again: Twelve Relatives are Preparing to Sue in Court Again, Demanding Treatment According to Iraqi Law and Equal Distribution of Three-Quarters of the Entire Estate

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hardoon estate case, which has been in dispute for fifteen years, has been revived after its victory. Twelve Iraqi relatives of Hardoon, after months of preparation, are planning to file a major lawsuit again, submitting their petition to the local court of this city, demanding an analysis of the estate. A reporter visited the attorney representing them, Song Yunhui, yesterday. According to him:

The crux of this case is the issue of Silas Aaron Hardoon's nationality. Hardoon was never naturalized as a British citizen but was instead an Iraqi Jewish national residing in our country. He was born in 1853 in the city of Baghdad, Iraq. At that time, Iraq was a French protectorate. After Silas Aaron Hardoon passed away in June 1931, the French authorities certified and issued Silas Aaron Hardoon with a "Certificate of Loss of Nationality." At the same time, the British High Court only referred to Hardoon as an Iraqi national under British protection. The British Consul stationed in this city also certified that there was no record of Hardoon being naturalized as a British citizen. As such, Hardoon's nationality as Iraqi is extremely obvious.

Since Hardoon's estate is in China, according to international law, it should be handled in accordance with Chinese law. Article 20 of Chapter 4 of the Law Application Regulations in Chinese law states: "Inheritance shall be governed by the national law of the deceased." Article 21: "The essential requirements and effect of a will shall be governed by the national law of the testator at the time of its establishment." Article 14: "The essential requirements for the establishment of an adopted child shall be governed by the national law of the parties concerned, and the effect of an adopted child shall be governed by the national law of the adoptive parents." Therefore, the Hardoon estate should be handled in accordance with Iraqi law.

According to Iraqi inheritance law: If the deceased has no direct descendants, the spouse shall receive one-quarter of the total value of the estate, and three-quarters shall be equally divided among close relatives.

Hardoon Family Genealogy

Attorney Zhu further narrated the family genealogy of Silas Aaron Hardoon, stating: Hardoon's grandfather was named Abraham (Lo Rhim) and had three sons. The eldest son, Aaron, was Silas Aaron Hardoon's biological father. The second son, Abrabi, had two sons. The eldest son, Mir, only had one son named Sion, who is Silas Aaron Hardoon's grandnephew. In 1932, the Baghdad court ruled that he was one of Silas Aaron Hardoon's twelve legal heirs. The other eleven people are Sion's cousins Ezra, Yaronb, Naham, Sanl, Homgui, Saleh Abrahin, Saleh Yaconb, Moechi, and the grandsons of Silas Aaron Hardoon's three paternal uncles, Ezra, Nahom, and Ibrahim.

Five years after Silas Aaron Hardoon's death, one of these twelve people filed a lawsuit in the British court against Hardoon's wife, Luo Jialu, demanding the analysis of the estate in accordance with Iraqi law. However, at that time, the British government coveted this huge amount of inheritance tax and wanted to fight for the right to vote for the former Municipal Council. Therefore, it forcibly recognized Hardoon as a person under British protection and stated that he should be subject to British law. As a result, Luo Jialu won the case. In November 1941, another person filed a lawsuit with the British Procuratorate stationed in this city. However, due to the outbreak of the Pacific War, this case was shelved without being heard.

Denial of Adopted Children

Luo Jialu's death in October 1941 and the victory of our country's War of Resistance against Japan, which abolished consular jurisdiction, have transferred the Hardoon estate dispute to another environment. Therefore, the twelve Iraqis recently commissioned Attorney Song to prepare to file a lawsuit and requested two points from the authorities: (1) If the authorities deem it necessary to form another management office to manage the Hardoon property, one of the twelve people must be invited to participate. (2) Those who claim to be Hardoon's adopted children must not participate in the management of the Hardoon estate. They also sent a letter to the Land Administration Bureau requesting it to stop the transfer of the estate.

The Hardoon estate was estimated to be worth approximately £4,000,000 in 1931 (the amount acknowledged by Luo Jialu). After the war, the currency of the Allied countries depreciated, and real estate prices soared. Therefore, the current value of the estate cannot be accurately estimated, but it will definitely be an astronomical figure. What these twelve people are currently considering is that the amount of the estate is too large. If this is used as the subject matter of the lawsuit, the litigation costs will also be an alarming figure, which they are unable to bear. After much consideration, it has now been decided that lawsuits will be filed individually to reduce litigation costs. Moreover, if they lose the lawsuit, the other eleven people can continue their long-term struggle.

### Three Groups, Including the City Council, Host a Banquet for the Siamese Delegation: Piri Expresses Nostalgia for the Scenery of Beiping; Today Departing from Shanghai to Manila, Flying Directly to the United States

[Report from Our Newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan, City Party Headquarters Chairman Fang, and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Standing Committee Member Xiao Jishan hosted a banquet for Siamese Elder Piri and his party at noon yesterday at Zhang's residence at No. 74 Shaoxing Road. In addition to Piri himself, the Siamese delegation members who attended included Mrs. Piri, Luan Suoshen, Yuecha Lachachai Shititiehua, Nai Witesiwayenuan, Zheng Guangsheng, Nai Su Guliang, and Nai Suomuji. Dozens of local officials and people from all walks of life attended, along with several female guests, gathered together in a lively atmosphere, chatting and laughing, and dispersed at around 2 p.m. Mr. Piri had a very good impression of Beiping and was especially nostalgic for the ancient sites and famous scenic spots of the former capital. He said that it was a pity that the time was too short to visit Tianjin.

Increase Sino-Siamese Relations

[Also Reported] When Siamese Elder Piri was interviewed by a reporter from this newspaper, he stated: He discussed issues related to increasing Sino-Siamese relations with Chairman Chiang several times in Beijing and firmly believes that there is a historical friendship between the two countries, which will definitely strengthen day by day in the future. The pro-Japanese regime should be responsible for the anti-Chinese incidents in Siam in the past. The current government has adopted effective measures to protect the interests of overseas Chinese, so their safety is not a problem. As for the issue of increasing cultural exchanges between China and Siam, I also exchanged views with the authorities of your country while in Beijing.

Diplomatic sources: There has been significant progress in Sino-Siamese relations recently. The reasons are: (1) Politically, Siam hopes that our country can provide support in the future when requesting to join the United Nations and negotiating with other major powers. (2) Economically, Siam is eager to develop its export industry. 70% of its annual rice production is exported abroad, and our country, with its geographical proximity, is the most ideal market. In addition, there are many other areas of mutual economic need. (3) Siamese newspapers are gradually reporting on China more accurately, and misunderstandings are gradually decreasing.

Piri and his party are scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Manila on a special plane of the U.S. Air Transport Command today, flying directly to the United States. Mr. Piri's trip to the United States is at the invitation of Washington. After arriving in the United States, he will be a White House consultant. Afterwards, he will definitely visit England first. If the territorial dispute between France and Siam can be resolved smoothly, Mr. Piri will conveniently visit Paris. According to unconfirmed reports, Mr. Piri may also travel to Moscow.

### National Father's Birthday Commemoration: Various Sectors to Take a Holiday Tomorrow

Tomorrow is the 81st anniversary of the National Father's birthday. All agencies, schools, and banking businesses in this city will take a day off to celebrate.

### National Flag Covers the Casket: Donner's Funeral Held Yesterday; Chairman and Mrs. Chiang Present a Chrysanthemum Cross

[Report from Our Newspaper] William Henry Donald, Chiang Kai-shek's personal advisor who devoted himself to China for forty years, was laid to rest peacefully yesterday at 3 p.m. in the International Cemetery of Hongqiao, amidst the silent prayers of Mrs. Chiang and his friends.

The funeral arrangements for Donald were entirely handled by the Lizi Society. After Donald passed away at the Hong'en Hospital at 1:15 a.m. the previous morning, he was immediately transported to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, where he was made up by the funeral home. Starting at 9 a.m. yesterday, people from all walks of life went to pay their respects. The body lay quietly in a teak casket, covered with the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, revealing only the head and upper body. He was wearing a navy blue suit, a blue-gray shirt, a dark blue-gray striped tie, and a white handkerchief in his pocket. His expression was dignified, but because the makeup on his face was too pale and the lighting in the room was so dim, people who knew Mr. Donald felt as if they were seeing a wax statue of an old man sleeping under the yellow light!

The casket was placed in the center of the hall. Behind the casket, in the center, stood a cross composed of yellow and white chrysanthemums, presented by Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang. A white ribbon was tied on it, with English words written on one side and "Eternal Remembrance of Mr. Donald, Respectfully Mourned by Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling" written on the other side. On both sides of the cross, the Chinese national flag was placed on the right, and the Australian flag was placed on the left. On both sides of the casket and on the walls, yellow and white chrysanthemum wreaths were hung, and more than ten pots of yellow and white chrysanthemums were placed on the ground. A eulogy poem by Ye Gongchuo especially increased the mourners' grief. The poem reads: "You came when I was already ill, you left while I still exist. The vast calamity is difficult for people to reverse, your self-respect is honored in the literary world. Your words are as heavy as breaking gold, the strategies you presented left traces in history. Sighing and mourning is extremely late, what can comfort the nine springs?"

After 1 p.m., the people attending Mr. Donald's encoffining ceremony arrived one after another, and were led into the hall by the staff of the Lizi Society and Mr. Donald's friends to pay their last respects. Mrs. Chiang, supported by Kong Lingkan, accompanied by Ms. Kong Lingwei, arrived at the funeral home at 1:50 p.m. Mrs. Chiang had a sad expression on her face. She wore a black wool coat, a long black silk cheongsam, leather high-heeled shoes, black gloves, and carried a black leather bag. After entering the hall, she remained silent and sat quietly in the central seat of the first row facing Mr. Donald's body. Soon, Mayor Wu and his wife and Kong Xiangxi also arrived one after another.

Encoffining Ceremony

At exactly 2 p.m., the encoffining ceremony began. Six of Mr. Donald's friends who were prepared to carry the casket, Tian Boli, Chennault, Huang Renlin, Dr. Zheng Zumu, Qi Bomen, and Shi Beilei, stood on both sides of the casket. British priest Qu Weituo stood in front of the guests in the outer room, reciting a prayer. Everyone stood up and bowed their heads to pray for the deceased. The ceremony lasted for about twenty minutes. After the ceremony, Director-General Huang reported and asked the guests to pay their last respects to Mr. Donald's remains before leaving. Mr. Donald's remains were quietly hidden under the tightly closed coffin lid. The national flag and the gift from Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang, the chrysanthemum cross, were still covered on the coffin lid.

Holding the Burial Ceremony

Mrs. Chiang and others stood outside the door waiting. Tian Boli and the other five people helped carry the casket onto the car. In the funeral procession, Reverend Qu led the way in a car, followed closely by the hearse, followed by the car of the pallbearers, and then by Mrs. Chiang and her entourage of more than ten vehicles, which drove to the International Cemetery of Hongqiao. The burial site had been carefully arranged in advance, and the surroundings of the grave were covered with green grass. After the casket was placed on the leather straps, it was slowly lowered. At that time, Reverend Qu continued to recite the burial prayer, and Mrs. Chiang and others also stood silently in front of the casket. At 2:45 p.m., the funeral ended. Director-General Huang thanked the guests on behalf of everyone. After everyone had presented more than twenty flower wreaths at the tomb, Mrs. Chiang returned to her residence.

Mr. Donald's encoffining and funeral yesterday were as simple as possible. However, the deep mourning emotions were not diminished because of this. Those who went to mourn included Gu Huijing, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Daofan, Bei Yu, Qian Dajun, Xuan Tiewu, and more than a hundred of Mr. Donald's Chinese and foreign friends. Yesterday, the police sent dozens of the most well-trained special police officers from the bureau, led by Inspector Yan Xianghu, to guard and take care of everything. In addition, Central Committee Member Zhang Daofan specially wrote an article to mourn Mr. Donald, ending with "Respectfully Mourned by Zhang Daofan, a Chinese friend who loved and respected him."

### Mrs. Chiang Postpones Return to Nanjing

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mrs. Chiang came to Shanghai from Nanjing this time to visit Mr. Donald's illness. After Mr. Donald passed away, she presided over the funeral. Originally scheduled to return to Nanjing after Mr. Donald's burial was completed yesterday afternoon, she will stay in Shanghai for one or two days because Marshal Marshall's daughter, Mrs. Wyeth, will arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 12th. After Mrs. Wyeth arrives, she will return to Nanjing with Mrs. Marshall and others.

### On the Shanghai-Minhang Road: Visiting the Puji Sanatorium – Housing Various Types of Mentally Ill Patients – Some Crying, Some Laughing, Some Cursing, Some Swearing

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The bus bumped along the Shanghai-Minhang Road towards the Puji Sanatorium. The reporters traveling in the same bus, initially complaining about the long distance and rough road, were silenced as the bus entered the gate of a red, multi-story building and stopped beneath a solemn statue of the Virgin Mary. Upon seeing the various kinds of mentally ill patients, their complaints were replaced by a strong sense of interest.

Greeting Through Iron Bars

It is unfortunate to fall ill, especially to suffer from mental illness. These patients are constantly immersed in the painful thoughts of their altered state, leading to various abnormal, ridiculous, and even frightening behaviors. Among the many patients we saw, the most interesting was a male patient who claimed to be a Bachelor of Arts graduate of Shanghai University's class of 1936. It was said that he suffered a concussion after being thrown from a rickshaw by a car, leading to a diagnosis of incurable epilepsy. During his periodic seizures, he would completely lose consciousness. However, when lucid, he would constantly demand to be discharged. Yesterday, as we passed his ward, he was sitting in the corridor reading a magazine, with several red mercurochrome-stained wounds on his forehead. Seeing us, he jumped up and, addressing someone (it was unclear who) through the iron bars, said in English mixed with Shanghainese: "Hey, don't you recognize me? 1936, MA, ××× is my classmate, and ×××, don't you know? I want to be discharged. Wang Xiaolai's Weixing Coal Mine needs my help, but the doctor won't let me go. Tell my brother to come and get me, okay?" Suddenly, he took a wooden stamp from his pocket and angrily said to the doctor, "I can stamp things myself, why does my brother have to come?" The doctor reassured him, "Because your brother is your guardian." Hearing this, he put the stamp back in his pocket, a helpless bitter smile forming on his lips. "German education… it's all German education!" he muttered.

Like a Matchmaker in Peking Opera

The scenes in the large ward were even more varied. The first thing we saw was an old woman with three small braids in her hair: one on top of her head and two on her temples, resembling a matchmaker in Peking Opera. She stood on a stool, gesticulating wildly and singing a tuneful little song. Nearby, a middle-aged female patient was loudly shouting and cursing. This woman was quite beautiful, with a strong build and naturally rosy cheeks. If not for being in this mental hospital, anyone would believe she was perfectly healthy. But now, she was constantly uttering incoherent vulgar slang. She protested to the nurse about the old woman singing songs, saying, "She can sing, but I'm six-oh-six... burned to the ground, the fire trucks left... we're traitors, come and catch us..."

This Group of Westernized Scoundrels

From the ward across the way came sobs. In the distance, several girls around ten years old were leaning on the windowsill. As we walked past, one of them began singing a folk song, "You are so strange!" And as we were leaving the ward, we heard the middle-aged woman's hysterical laughter: "You bunch of Westernized scoundrels!"

Many of the patients with milder conditions were strolling in the gardens, including a number of foreigners, all of whom appeared very quiet and polite. Some who were recovering were hardly distinguishable from ordinary people. Many of them were even "artists," with one studio's walls covered in landscape and figure paintings. Yesterday, Central Committee member Kong Xiangxi and Tang Xizhi, representative of Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department, were also visiting. One patient pointed at Kong and smiled, saying to a reporter, "Is that Kong Xiangxi? Hopefully, the hospital's funding will be sorted out."

The Superintendent Reports on the Situation

Due to time constraints, we were unable to examine things in further detail, and the hospital began a tea party and conversation. The Superintendent, Lu Yinggeng, first reported on the general situation of the hospital. Puji Sanatorium was founded in June of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) by the late philanthropist Mr. Lu Bohong in cooperation with the Catholic Church. Land was purchased at Beiqiao Township South, and fourteen new-style sanatorium buildings were constructed. Each building is surrounded by gardens and lawns, with excellent air and light, and all facilities are complete. The hospital has a total of 500 beds, with 326 patients currently. The fees are 30,000 yuan per day for first class, 20,000 yuan for second class, and 10,000 yuan for third class. Treatment includes drug injections and also focuses on analyzing the patient's psychology in order to guide them back to the right path.

From its establishment to the present, Puji Sanatorium has admitted a total of 2,411 patients, of whom 246 have died, 1,839 have been discharged, and 1,581 have fully recovered.

In the dim twilight, we boarded the bus again. The electric torch on the Virgin Mary statue gradually disappeared from view as we returned to the world of bright lights and extravagant entertainment.

### Shanghai Fine Arts Association: Zhang Daofan Sees His Teachers Off, Welcoming the Two Great Painters Qi Baishi and Pu Xinyu, Gu Chunfan Composes Poems to Add to the Festivities, Two Female Writers Kowtow to Become Disciples

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Fine Arts Association welcomed the renowned painting master Qi Baishi and the renowned painter Pu Xinyu at the Zhabu Road Cultural Hall at 3:00 PM yesterday. Over a thousand people attended, including Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters, figures from various art circles, and individuals from all walks of life. Even the Siamese elder, Bili, joined the meeting. Zhang Daofan, recently in Shanghai to recuperate and newly accepted as a disciple of Qi Baishi, presided over the event and delivered a welcoming speech, stating: "Today, we welcome Mr. Qi and Mr. Pu. One is an artistic giant of eighty-six years old, whose artistic achievements are renowned both domestically and internationally. The other is also a great painter celebrated throughout China. This welcoming event was originally scheduled for the 12th, because that day is not only the birthday of the Father of the Nation but also an unprecedentedly auspicious day in Chinese history – the opening of the National Assembly for Constitution-Making. However, Mr. Qi is eager to return to Beijing, and Mr. Pu is a representative to the National Assembly and must travel to the capital tonight, so we moved the event forward to today."

Hoping to Enrich the Artistic Treasure Trove

"There is no need to say more about the character, knowledge, and everything else of the two gentlemen. What we admire most is Mr. Qi's spirit of researching art and engaging in art, which has remained consistent for decades, allowing him to become a giant in the art world. As for Mr. Qi's noble character and lofty integrity, they are even more worthy of our admiration. Mr. Pu, on the other hand, is a nobleman from the Qing dynasty, but even before the founding of the Republic, he looked down on aristocratic life and devoted himself to the study of literature and art. After the September 18th Incident, he repeatedly resisted the enemy's coercion and enticement. This shows that he has a clear understanding of the great Chinese nation and does not engage in activities that harm the nation. After the July 7th Incident, Mr. Pu remained secluded on Longevity Hill, and his poetry, calligraphy, and painting reached their peak. We hope that Mr. Qi will continue to create more paintings to enrich the artistic treasure trove. We hope that Mr. Pu will also help us and guide us more in the future." At this time, everyone in attendance stood up and applauded, expressing their welcome to Mr. Qi and Mr. Pu. Zhang Daofan's beloved daughter, Zhang Lilian, and Miss Wang Weiwei presented flowers.

Flowing Clouds and Water, Emerging from Nature

Zhang Bantao then delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of Mr. Qi Baishi and introduced the lives of Mr. Qi and Mr. Pu in the old capital during the period of the Japanese occupation, stating that Mr. Qi did not leave his house for eight years, and his residence was surrounded by barbed wire, like a prison. Mr. Pu did not descend from Longevity Hill for eight years. Mr. Pu Xinyu also delivered a speech, saying that he dared not accept the various praises and that upholding righteousness and remaining unyielding were the basic principles of being a person.

Finally, representatives of the guests, Chairman Fang and Speaker Pan, delivered speeches. Mr. Fang elaborated on the points of making life artistic, making society artistic, and completing the truth, goodness, and beauty of life. Speaker Pan praised Mr. Qi's works as being like flowing clouds and water, emerging from nature. He also expressed his respect for Mr. Pu's loyalty, self-preservation, and artistic achievements. He elaborated on Confucius's words, "Rest in the Dao, wander in the Arts."

After the speeches, Miss Lang Yuxiu performed songs, and the Technicolor film "Unsubmissive China" was screened to add to the festivities. The Guotai Film Company filmed news footage of the day's events.

[Another Report] At 6:00 PM last night, Zhang Daofan hosted a banquet at the "Literary Respite" on Tanggu Road near Luguan Road to see off Mr. Qi and Mr. Pu. Over a hundred dignitaries from all walks of life attended. During the banquet, Ms. Lei Peizhi, wife of Lang Jingshan, and female writer Zhao Qingge kowtowed to Qi Baishi to become his disciples. There were also various other entertainments. Director of the Bureau of Finance Gu Chunfan also composed two poems to present to the two contemporary painters. They are included below: "Master Baishi, the modern painting master, How few share his carefree spirit in seclusion, He idled his hands that could once record heroes, Painting only gourds and insects." Another poem: "Old Pu, your paintings were known of old, Returning after ten years of chaos, The mountains and valleys in your heart remain, You are not a prince, but a painting master." The guests and hosts dispersed joyfully after 10:00 PM.

### US Under Secretary of the Navy Flew to Qingdao for Inspection – Will Return to Shanghai and Head Back to the US

US Under Secretary of the Navy Kenney and his entourage flew to Qingdao yesterday morning aboard a special plane with Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Navy's Seventh Fleet, for inspection. They will stay in Qingdao overnight and, if time permits, will return to Shanghai today before heading back to the United States. The purpose of their trip is to inspect the conditions of various US naval bases in the Pacific and to visit China. Due to the short timeframe, they may return to the US via the Philippines tomorrow.

### Government Agencies Occupying Enemy Property – Unable to Relocate, Auction Cancelled – Evicting Ordinary Citizens? Thirty-Nine Unit Residents Appeal Again

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to residents of the Chenghai Villa on Weihaiwei Road and residents of other enemy property houses who spoke to reporters, residents of enemy property houses can be roughly divided into the following five categories: (1) Those who have a lease contract that has not yet expired. These residents are protected by Article 425 of the Civil Code. (2) Those who have a wartime contract that expired during the war but has, in fact, become an indefinite continuing contract. They are also protected by Article 451 of the Civil Code. (3) Those who resided there before the victory and still do not have a contract but are also protected by Article 422 of the Civil Code. (4) Pre-war tenants who returned to their original residences after the victory. Based on all restoration circumstances, they naturally have the right to continue living there. (5) Public school teachers and staff who returned after the victory and veterans who contributed to the war effort. These people who contributed to the nation should naturally have the right to reside there.

The opinions of the residents of these enemy property houses can be roughly summarized into the following three points: (1) The authorities will cause public resentment by enriching the national treasury at the expense of the people being displaced. (2) Auctioning off houses and evicting current residents who enjoy lease rights is inconsistent with law, reason, and human sentiment. (3) The auction of enemy property houses used by various government agencies has been cancelled because they have nowhere to relocate. If government agencies have nowhere to move, where can ordinary citizens find housing? Therefore, we once again appeal to the authorities that the auction of enemy property houses should still retain the lease rights of the original residents.

The association has scheduled physical examinations to begin on the 16th and will hold an opening ceremony at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM today.

### The Rise and Fall of the Shanghai Opera Scene

Special Report by Our Newspaper

Mei Lanfang and Yang Baosen have already taken the stage at the China Grand Theatre, while Cheng Yanqiu and Tan Fuying are about to perform at the Tianchan Theatre. The completeness of the cast in these two performances is rare in recent years. This time, the China Grand Theatre and the Tianchan Theatre are competing fiercely, creating a sensation, and the "Zhou Langs" of Shanghai (talent scouts or enthusiastic fans) are almost overwhelmed.

Recently, Peking Opera has been gradually declining. American movies flood the market, and low-class popular local operas such as "Diddly Bums" and Shanghai Opera have snatched away many audiences. Peking Opera can only use mechanical sets as its selling point. Even when performers come from the north, only "pi" (fighting scenes) and "fang" (spinning scenes) can draw a crowd. Judging from the disastrous ticket sales of Tan Fuying's performance at the Queen's Theatre this time, there is deep concern for the future of Peking Opera.

Why has Peking Opera created such a phenomenon? First, the fees for the actors are too high, which forces ticket prices to increase. In these years of soaring prices and difficult livelihoods, how many people can afford to spend 20,000 or 18,000 (currency unit) to see a play? Second, the quality of the plays does not suit the tastes of the audience. After eight years of war, the social situation has changed greatly. The audiences who used to sit elegantly in the theater boxes are now mostly without surplus funds to be patrons. Those who have taken their place are the middle and lower classes, who have money, but when they spend it, they flock to pornographic and low-level entertainment. Peking Opera, which has been prosperous for more than a hundred years, has been abandoned by them. In the past, Kunqu Opera was hit by Peking Opera because Kunqu Opera itself was too "classic." Now Peking Opera is declining again because of the low level of the audience.

This grand performance in two locations is indeed a grand event in the Shanghai theater scene, but looking ahead, is this a sign of revival? Or a last blaze of glory? Recalling the past glory, one cannot help but feel a bit emotional.

The Evolution of Tea Gardens, Stages, and Theaters

In Shanghai, the theaters were initially named after tea gardens, such as Yingchun, Danggui, and Chungui. Later, they competed to imitate Western-style architecture and changed their names to stages. Today, most Peking Opera theaters still use the name "stage." As for the so-called "theaters," they were initially places for showing movies, and gradually some of them changed to performing Peking Opera, still using the old name. Newly established theaters also adopted the name "theater." From tea gardens to stages to theaters, these are the three stages of the evolution of Shanghai's theaters.

Why were theaters called tea gardens? Indeed, the interior of the theaters at that time was somewhat similar to tea houses. Inside, there were many square tables, and when a guest arrived, a bowl of tea was a must, and there were also dishes of melon seeds, fruits, and snacks placed in front. But the intention of the guests was not to taste tea. It is said that most of the people in the old capital were "connoisseurs." They went to the theater to listen and drink, just like tasting tea in a tea house.

Another theory is that during the reign of Emperor Qianlong in the late Qing Dynasty, theaters in the old capital sprang up everywhere. The imperial family, nobles, and members of the Eight Banners sang and danced without any restraint. Emperor Gaozong ordered the closure of theaters, and the sound of singing and music ceased. Later, during the Empress Dowager's birthday celebrations, actors entered the palace to perform. From then on, the ban gradually eased, and singing and dancing were revived, but they did not dare to openly violate the imperial decree, so they changed the name to tea gardens. Shanghai also used this name, not calling them theaters.

Tea Garden-Style Theaters

Now, west of Guangdong Road and Shandong Road is commonly called "Mantingfang." The three characters "Mantingfang" are the name of the earliest Peking Opera theater. Mantingfang was opened in the fifth year of the Tongzhi reign (1866) between Baoshan Street and Ningsui Street, completely imitating the style of Beijing. After the opening of Mantingfang, business boomed. Liu Weizhong saw this and followed suit, establishing the Danggui Tea Garden on Baoshan Street, and later setting up a Southern Danggui branch at Xiaodongmen. In addition, there were Tianxian, Yingchun, Chungui, and others, all of which were tea garden-style theaters.

In the tea garden-style theaters, the center of the ground floor was lined with many square tables, each with six seats, which was the main hall. Behind the main hall and on both sides were side boxes. The upstairs was also divided into boxes, each seating a dozen people. The stage and the audience area were lit with gas lamps, which were not very bright. Later, gauze curtains were added, and when electric lights came out, gas lamps were gradually eliminated.

The construction of new-style stages began with the New Stage on Nine Acres of Land in the city. In the late Guangxu period, Xia Yueshan, Xia Yuerun, and others planned to build a new-style theater. At that time, the Governor-General of Liangjiang and the Shanghai Daotai also paid attention to the Chinese market, so the Zhenshi Company was organized, and the stage was located on Nine Acres of Land. The internal structure of the New Stage was both spacious and novel, and the layout was orderly, which was very different from the tea garden-style theaters. Unfortunately, before the opening performance could last for ten days, Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Guangxu passed away one after another. Due to the national mourning, the performances were suspended for twenty-seven days, which was a major blow. Later, it was taken over by Kaiming, and the Xia brothers starred in The Biography of Jigong. Initially, business was quite prosperous, but it did not last. After 1929, the land was redeveloped into city buildings, and there was no trace of the New Stage from then on.

The History of the Stage

After the New Stage was built, the Danggui Tea Garden was renovated, and other places also rebuilt new-style theaters one after another. The tea gardens were no longer visited. Among the current theaters, the architecture of the Great Stage is the newest, completed in 1935. The Tianchan Stage is the largest, accommodating more than 4,000 spectators. It was originally named the Shanghai Stage, but after Gu Zhuxuan took over, it was renamed. The previous Tianchan Stage was located at the Seven Heavens of the Wing On Company, with the main entrance on Jiujiang Road. As for the China Grand Theatre, where Mei Lanfang is currently performing, it was originally called the Samsung Stage. Later, due to disputes, it was taken over by the Gengxin Stage, which was previously opened in Zhabei, and renamed the Gengxin Stage. It was only in recent years that it was called the China Grand Theatre.

As for the theaters that were called "theaters," they initially showed movies, and later performed Peking Opera. Some even kept the same name. Like the Golden Grand Theatre, it was previously a third-rate movie theater, and after it changed to performing Peking Opera, it still used this name. At that time, other places used new scenery and new plays as their selling points, while the Golden Grand Theatre exclusively performed old plays, which was praised by the general "opera fans" in Shanghai. The Carlton was also a movie theater, which previously only occasionally performed singing and dancing, but its architecture was quite close to a stage. Later, Zhou Xinfang performed Peking Opera in that theater for a long time.

The Lyceum is the Best Opera Theater

The Lyceum, which has a purely Western flavor and only occasionally performs Peking Opera excerpts, is also worth mentioning. Because it is the most complete modern theater in Shanghai. The one at the corner of Elsie Road and Rue du Consulat is already the third location. In 1867, the Amateurs Dramatic Club, established by Westerners, built a new-style theater on Museum Road, which was a wooden building, unfortunately destroyed by fire. In 1872, it was rebuilt with bricks, and the performances continued until 1929. The building, which had been around for more than fifty years, was sold by the original owner of the Lyceum in 1929 for 175,000 taels, and a new one was built in the former French Concession, which is the current Lyceum. The new Lyceum opened on February 5, 1931. Although it only has more than 700 seats, the sight lines and sound waves have been studied, and the seats are spacious and comfortable, and the lobby is magnificent. The whole theater is clean and quiet, which is unique in Shanghai. Unfortunately, it mainly shows movies, but sometimes it is borrowed by drama groups. It is really the best opera theater.

Shanghai Opera Schools

Opera schools are the birthplace of actors, and formal training is the proper way for actors to start their careers. Like the Fuyuncheng in Beijing, a well-established opera school, Tan Fuying, Ma Lianliang, and others all trained at Fuyuncheng. Later, some were called schools, such as the China Opera School in Beijing and the Shanghai Drama School in Shanghai.

Fifty years ago, Shanghai had already established an opera school called "Tianhua Jin Xiao Jing Ban." It was founded by Gu Chongde from Tianjin, who originally made a living by selling horses. Because he failed in a lawsuit, he could not stand in Tianjin, so he came to Shanghai to seek a way out. At that time, Peking Opera was quite prosperous in Shanghai, so he found a city house in the Hujiazhai area, renovated it into a theater, and recruited a group of children to train. The students' stage names all began with the character "Sai," such as "Sai Changgeng," "Sai Yeling," "Sai Lü Bu," and "Sai Diaochan," specializing in fierce and tumbling acrobatics. Later, when they performed, they initially sold tickets for three jiao (currency unit). At that time, Wang Guifen was performing at Tianfu, also selling tickets for three jiao, so business was not good, and then it dropped to one jiao, but still no one came. At the same time, Gu Rongzong often abused the child actors. Many felt injustice in their hearts. One of them accidentally cut Gu's lower body with a dagger, causing his death. Gu's son knew his father's guilt and did not pursue the matter. Instead, he burned all the contracts of the child actors. From then on, this opera school also disbanded.

In 1939, the Shanghai Drama School was established, which was a very good opera school. In just a few years, it trained talents who had already gained some reputation, but it eventually disbanded due to unbearable burdens.

The Shanghai Drama School was initiated by amateur actor Yu Xiaogu and veteran actor Liu Songji, and was located next to the Old Dahua Ballroom on Avenue Foch. Chen Chengyin served as the principal, Yu Xiaogu served as the director of general affairs, and Guan Hongbin served as the director of academic affairs. More than 100 child actors were recruited and training began. In the beginning, the economy was very tight, so most of the faculty and staff were of a semi-voluntary nature. Because many of the students were children of professional actors and already knew how to sing at home, they felt very hopeful after half a year of hard work. The school then spent 30,000 (currency unit) to purchase costumes and props, and made its debut at the Golden Grand Theatre on October 12, 1940, which surprised all walks of life. After that, they performed at the Golden Grand Theatre every Wednesday and Saturday, using the income to supplement expenses.

After the opera school disbanded, these novice actors began to travel around, officially starting their stage life. Among them, Guan Zhengming, Wang Zhengkun, Gu Zhengqiu, Zhang Zhengfang, and others have made considerable progress in their art. However, Gu Zhengqiu assisted Tan Fuying in his performance at the Queen's Theatre, and the ticket sales were disastrous. This setback also served as an encouragement for her future.

### Boy Actors: In an Instant, Hats and Beards are Exchanged, Making it Difficult to Distinguish Between Male and Female

A small troupe takes the stage, graceful and charming, selected early to enter the theater. A melody of light steps and thin silk, like wanting to lift the fairy skirt in the wind. Suddenly, a delicate voice sings a changing tune, a slanting hat and palace flower, pressing diagonally on the trembling hair. In an instant, hats and beards are exchanged, making it difficult to distinguish between male and female.

This song by a Song Dynasty poet praising female actors can be a portrayal of boy actors. Whether there were female actors in the Song Dynasty is not known in detail. But sixty or seventy years ago, there were no women in the opera scene. The so-called boy actors' plays began in Shanghai during the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, and became a fashion for a time. Later, as women became more open-minded, female actors gradually increased. Now, there is a trend that a troupe cannot be formed without female roles.

It is said that during the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, there was a famous clown in the north named Li Mao'er, who was good at comedic plays and paired with the female lead Xie Baolin. Their performances were always hilarious. In addition to comedic plays, Li Mao'er also played the square-hatted clown, which was full of charm. Later, he performed in Shanghai and won much praise. Although Li Mao'er was a famous clown, his salary was only thirty-odd (currency unit), and his life was quite difficult. Later, he thought of a way to make a living by gathering several poor women from his neighborhood, aged between eleven or twelve and sixteen or seventeen, and teaching them to act. Regardless of male, female, painted face, or clown, he taught them all alone. After a year of training, they actually became a female child actors' troupe. He used the two characters "Mao'er" from his own name as the name of the troupe, and performed in various places, which was very popular. Later, the name Mao'er Xi was changed to Mao'er Xi (both pronounced the same), which was actually a written error. Mao'er Xi in those years specialized in providing performances for the celebrations of wealthy gentry and merchants. Each performance consisted of four plays, with a remuneration of sixteen (currency unit), plus additional rewards. One play was requested, and another four (currency unit) were added. The plays performed were all civil plays involving three or more people, such as "San Niang Teaches Her Son," "The Emperor Playing with the Phoenix," "Wulongyuan," and "The Second Entry into the Palace." The costumes and props were rented temporarily, and the stage was also temporarily built. Later, as business became more prosperous and they were overwhelmed with requests, they purchased young actors and increased the repertoire, and thus the scale gradually took shape. The price for performances also increased from sixteen to twenty-eight (currency unit).

Finally, there was the establishment of female theaters, which were surprisingly prosperous. However, the intention of most people was to see the "old man" (a euphemism for seeing women). Currently, small theaters in Shanghai such as Xiaoguang, Changle, and Shidai mainly feature female actors, which has the flavor of boy actors' plays. However, there are also female roles in general large theaters. Female roles who can take on major roles are no weaker than male roles, and there is a trend of confrontation. This was something that Li Mao'er had not anticipated at the time.

### Famous Actors, Popular Actors, Trendy Actors: Veteran Actors Rely on Skill for a Living, New Artists Rely on Support to Make Money

Actors are divided into famous actors, popular actors, and trendy actors. Although there is no clear "gulf" between them, their boundaries can be roughly seen.

Among the students who train in more than a hundred opera schools, only a few can be listed as famous actors upon graduation. It can be seen that famous actors are very rare. They must have a good voice, a good appearance, and must have gone through thousands of trials and reached the point of perfection before they are qualified to perform on stage. Mei Lanfang, who performs in "China," has had a great reputation for more than thirty years without declining. Even though he is over fifty years old, it is no easy task to still play the role of a graceful woman on stage. He is worthy of being the leader of contemporary actors and honored as a "doctor" without shame.

Since Shanghai opened to trade, the population has gradually increased, the market has become more prosperous, and the theater business has also flourished. Famous actors from the north have regarded Shanghai as a place to spend money and have come south to perform their skills. In the early years, Tan Xinpei, Sun Juxian, Wang Guifen, Yu Shuyan, Yang Yuelou, Wang Yaoqing, Wang Changlin, Gong Yunfu, Cheng Jixian, etc., all came to Shanghai to perform. Recently, Yang Baosen, Xiao Changhua, Jiang Miaoxiang, who performed with Mei, as well as Cheng Yanqiu, Tan Fuying, etc., who will soon perform at Tianchan, all have their own strengths, whether they are leading or supporting roles, and can be included in the ranks of famous actors.

Although Peking Opera originated in the north, famous actors are not necessarily from the north. Zhou Xinfang's dialogue does not get rid of the southern accent, but his appearance and expression are also commendable. Li Chunlai's martial arts skills were highly praised by Yang Xiaolou. The Guan Gong of Lao San Mazi and Wang Hongshou was jointly promoted by the north and south. Kunqu opera singer Yu Zhenfei, who went to sea as an amateur, is also one of the rare young actors today, elegant and unrestrained, seeming to be above Jiang Miaoxiang. These are all famous actors from the south.

Although famous actors have sweet voices, beautiful appearances, and highly skilled artistry, some have never become famous in their lives. The only surviving old servant Rui Debao in the south and the veteran actor Zhang Rongkui are both wandering and teaching opera for a living. Gui Junqing and Gao Qingkui also came to Shanghai to sing, but eventually died in depression. Fate! Fate!

Popular Actors

Popular actors refer to people who can enjoy great fame in the art world. Famous actors are not necessarily "popular," and popular actors are not all super-skilled. Someone said: "Veteran actors rely on skill for a living, new artists rely on support to make money." This is the annotation of famous actors and popular actors. In 1939, when Wang Yurong was singing at the Golden Grand Theatre, she brought out her teacher Wang Yaoqing, and the advertisement even used the words "Wang Yaoqing's old servant personally supports the stage" to appeal to the audience. Isn't this borrowing the name of the teacher to increase his own value?

Although popular actors do not have outstanding skills, they must have their strengths. They can use their strengths, so they can create a new style and new style. Ma Lianliang is listed as one of the four major beards. Watching his performances, his playful performance, his side-style appearance, and his improved costumes are purely using his strengths, saving effort and attracting audiences, killing two birds with one stone. This kind of popular actor is certainly not as good as famous actors in terms of "capital" and "skill," but the magic power of attracting audiences may be greater than that of famous actors.

The fate of popular actors who are not famous actors on the stage is often not lasting. For example, Mao Shilai, Qiu Shengrong, Gao Shenglin, etc., were also popular for a while. Although their artistic qualifications were still shallow, if they worked hard, it would not be difficult to join the ranks of famous actors. Unfortunately, they did not know how to cherish themselves, and the "red" color gradually turned "black." Gao Shenglin is now at the Golden Grand Theatre, singing beard students, which is quite appealing. It is still hoped that he will cherish himself.

Whether an actor "becomes popular" is entirely a matter of opportunity. For example, Jin Shaoshan, who was a painted-face actor, was just a basic actor who sang the opening play at the Old Common Stage in Shanghai. Because he played the Overlord in Mei Lanfang's Farewell My Concubine, he became popular in one performance. According to the old practice, the Overlord was played by a martial arts actor. At that time, the martial arts actor of Mei's troupe was Sun Yukun, and he should have played it. That day, Jin Shaoshan was singing The Assassination of King Liao on stage, and the person in charge of the play asked Mei Laolian: "Who will sing the Overlord in Farewell My Concubine tomorrow?" Mei Laolian heard the Huang Zhong Dalu (the grand and resonant music) sound on the stage and asked, "Who is singing on the stage?" The person in charge of the play replied, "It is Jin Xiushan's son, Jin Shaoshan." Mei Lanfang had a flash of inspiration and called Jin Shaoshan to play the Overlord. In the previous scene, Mei Lanfang still paired with Sun Yukun in a Changbanpo to comfort him. He was really thoughtful.

Trendy Actors

As for the so-called trendy actors, they completely use opportunism to cater to the audience. When Tong Zhiling performed at the "Queen," she was more popular than Tan Fuying. This is the magic of her signature "splitting" and "spinning." The Common Stage advertised heavily in the newspaper, and it was full every night. This kind of appeal to pornography is the most common practice of trendy actors. Another example is Li Wanchun, who has been jailed. Li Shaochun, who is currently performing at Tianchan, is both literary and martial arts, and he sings without acting, which shows that he is versatile, but in fact he is also a trendy actor. Recalling when Li Wanchun first came south with Mei Lanfang, he was still a fifteen or sixteen-year-old child, and he was already very popular. He and Lan Yuechun performed a play of Two Generals, which was more popular than Yang Xiaolou's Lianhuan Tao. Judging from his acting skills, he can be called a good one, especially since he rarely performed the same play a second time in more than a month, so although the fire was not as good, he could be included in the ranks of famous actors. But soon he acted in civil plays, changed from a famous actor and popular actor to a trendy actor. After the victory, he was imprisoned. In his life, he not only played characters on the stage, but also played various different actors, which is also a strength.

Mei Lanfang: Assassinating the Tiger

### The Masters of Shanghai: Qin Player Chen A'jin, Drummer Zhao Songshou

In Peking Opera, the accompanying instruments, the huqin and the drum, are the most important. The qin players and drummers in the opera world often enjoy great fame. For example, the qin of Mei Yutian and Sun Zuochen, and the drums of Li Wu and Liu Shun are all extraordinary. In the Shanghai scene, there were also two people in the past, qin player Chen A'jin and drummer Zhao Songshou, who can be called the outstanding figures of the time.

One year, Wang Guifen came to Shanghai, and his qin player was unable to play due to illness, so the troupe leader replaced him with A'jin. However, Gui himself believed that his singing style could not be properly supported by others, so he had a contemptuous attitude towards A'jin. After going on stage, when singing to the middle, the strings of the qin suddenly broke. Gui Fen could not help but feel anxious, and looked at A'jin frequently with displeasure. Everyone on stage and the staff backstage were sweating for A'jin, but A'jin was unusually calm, as if nothing had happened, and actually played a single string to finish the song. After the matter, A'jin apologized to Gui Fen, and Wang quickly smiled and welcomed him, saying: "Today I know how high your qin skills are, and your reputation is well-deserved."

Drummer Zhao Songshou was the grandfather of the famous dan Zhao Junyu. He was proficient in the "six scenes" and was good at compiling new plays. He was not only famous in the world for his drum skills. When Mei Yutian came south with Lao Tan, he was especially humble and eager to learn, fearing that there were also famous players in the south. He inquired among the artists in the troupe and found Zhao's name, so he personally visited him three times. The two met and became friends. Whenever Yutian asked, he taught him wholeheartedly. Zhao drew diagrams of all the gongs and drums and the names of the tunes with colored pens and added annotations. When he was at home, he held a pen in one hand and buried himself in writing, as if he were a great writer.

Praising Actors

The scholars praised the actors, and the articles published in the newspapers from the past were often like a raging fire. Not to mention anything else, taking Mei Lanfang as an example, try reading Zhang Jizi's Nine Records, and there are quite a few letters written to him. Zhang Jizhi also had a "Post-Luoshen Fu," which was also written for Mei Lanfang, saying something like "The divine light flutters on the Yue female, and the aftersound lingers on the Han E," which was better than his Golden Hall Strategy. Zhu Guwei and Kuang Zhoufeng watched Mei's play together. The play "Cai Ying Pei" was being performed on stage, and the two of them linked up sentences under the stage, with the words "I hate not to make myself a beggar, Tianchan is only a short distance away, but it is at the end of the world. It is a pity that you and I are not as good as him." The last sentence was "I have no choice but to go home." It can be said that they were extremely infatuated.

There was a period in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China when Feng Chunhang and Jia Biyun were praised. There are still many poems left in the Nanshe Congkan.

### Shanghai Actors' Organizations

The Jingzhong Temple is an actors' organization in Beijing. The head of the temple is a banner, and all of them are served by first-class figures in the opera world, such as Cheng Changgeng and Yang Yuelou. Not only are their acting skills superior, but also for the opera industry away from home, searching thousands of miles away, with no relatives to look to. Xia's imitated the Jingzhong Temple in Beijing and prepared to create a guild.

At that time, the organization of southern actors was limited to Kun classes, and the Liyuan Guild of Kun class actors was in Suzhou. The Liyuan organizations in Shanghai can be regarded as the first of their kind. The Liyuan Guild was purely a trade organization of Peking Opera actors, but there were also a few Kun class actors such as Zhou Fenglin and Qiu Ruiqing who participated, because the Kun class was declining at that time, and there were few actors, so they had to join the Peking Opera class.

The Liyuan Guild is a Blessed Place for Actors

The Liyuan Guild was near the West Wood Bridge in the city, which was a two-entry bungalow, with a shrine to the Patriarch. On the first and fifteenth days of each month, the actors had to come to offer incense. They usually entered and exited through the side door on the east side, but on the birthday of the Patriarch, the main gate was opened wide, which was a grand occasion.

After the revolution, the Liyuan Guild was changed to the Actors' Federation, because the federation was very popular at that time. For every industry, there was a federation, and the Liyuan Guild was also changed to this name. The chairman was Pan Yueqiao. At that time, Pan had quite revolutionary ideas. During the Second Revolution, he participated in his plan and stored military supplies in the Federation. When the Jiangxi-Ningbo uprising occurred, Pan fled to Hubei and relied on Li Yuanhong to avoid disaster. The Actors' Federation was dissolved invisibly due to the hostility of the officialdom. It was not until the Yunnan uprising and the establishment of the Protectorate Government that the Actors' Federation raised its head again and re-elected Xia Yuerun as chairman.

This only organization of the Shanghai Liyuan industry has undergone many twists and turns before becoming the "blessed land" of today's actors. The interior has various public welfare undertakings such as righteous schools, public cemeteries, widow's rations, poor old age rations, apartments, and funerals, with considerable monthly expenditures.

Zhenling Elementary School, an Righteous School for the Liyuan

Zhenling Elementary School is an righteous school for the Liyuan, initiated by Pan Yueqiao and Xia Yuerun. The earliest principal was Ouyang Xu from Wu, who was later replaced by Sun Yusheng, who created a few talents. Later, the guild hired veteran actors to teach a group of poor and destitute children, so that they could learn art to make a living in the future, which was indeed an opera school.

Under the keen management of Pan and Xia, the Shanghai Liyuan industry organization gradually made progress. For the placement of unemployed colleagues, the relief of disabled and old men, and the resolution of disputes among colleagues, the two did not tire of the trivial matters, worked hard and complained, and benefited the opera industry greatly. Later, Qilin Tong, Lin Shusen, etc., also served as chairmen successively, carrying on their legacy.

### The Evolution of the Yarn Allocation System: Practical Amounts and Allotments Cannot Be Reconciled; Re-allocation Work Also Feels Overwhelmingly Difficult

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the restoration, the yarn and cloth market has been very turbulent. Prices were still sluggish this spring. Since summer and autumn, it has begun to run rampant, with yarn prices almost rising in a straight line, while cloth prices have changed more. Even in the last four weeks, yarn prices have remained firm and high, but the factory prices of cloth are not enough to cover costs. Last Thursday, at the cloth price review meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau, the cost and market price were compared, and the former was still lower than the latter. Five or six days ago, the textile factories complaining were everywhere. Because although cloth sales were slow, it was not convenient for factories to stop work. Cotton yarn was not continuously supplied, so they had to purchase it from yarn factories. And the selling price of yarn factories was not as flexible to cut as cloth factories. In recent days, bankruptcies of cloth and yarn firms have been heard frequently. On the one hand, cloth factories have to bear high-interest loans, and at the same time, they often sell cloth at prices that do not cover costs in order to turn over capital, and those with hollow bottom lines are increasing daily. People in the industry often use the term "leveling off" to describe the end of a factory or firm. There will be many "leveling off" this winter. In view of the seriousness of the crisis, cloth factories and other cotton yarn replica industries have launched a campaign since spring to stabilize yarn prices and mutually protect legal profits.

The Start of Joint Allocation On August 30th, under the auspices of Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Textile Industry Management Committee finally ordered the State-run Textile Construction Company and private yarn factories to handle joint allocation. It was agreed to allocate 30,000 bales of yarn per month, with the State-run contributing one-third and the private contributing two-thirds. In the one month of September, it was superficially maintained. However, the State-run still listed prices at the Textile Construction Company, and large and small factories often had no time to allocate based on different grades. The private sector's allocation methods gradually aroused accusations from all sides. Although it was forcibly allocated according to the original method in October, the black market rose daily, making it increasingly difficult for practical factories and normal yarn firms to receive their allocations. How much of the originally planned 30,000 bales per month actually reached practical factories? Both the allocating and receiving parties had no way to specify the exact numbers. Moreover, according to the allocation method of the Yarn Factory Association, purchase orders were first received, and prices were only announced in the evening. Purchasers had no way of knowing the prices in advance, and could not cancel their orders after the prices were announced. Even the listed price was the listed price, and the selling price was the selling price. Yarn users were burned out. Those with foresight in the yarn factory industry never failed to want to correct this, but with myriad threads, it has been unresolved for a long time.

Improvements in Allocation In late October, yarn and cloth rose even more. Dong Yunjhang, the director of the Textile Management Committee, felt quite troubled. Therefore, he made representations to higher-level agencies, and Mayor Wu concurrently assumed the position. At the beginning of his tenure, Mayor Wu launched a change in the allocation mechanism. He ordered the industry associations of replica industries such as dyeing, weaving, knitting, underwear, towel blankets, handkerchief weaving, and handmade cotton weaving to handle the allocation matters themselves. Each period, the Yarn Factory Association, namely the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Industry Association, would prepare a form to allocate yarn, which would be handed over to the Cotton Yarn Replica Industry Association allocation committee, jointly formed by the various replica industry associations, to supervise the respective associations to allocate according to the register they had submitted to the Textile Management Committee. Thus, the actual work of allocation was added to the shoulders of the re-allocation committees formed by the receiving factories. This can be said to be a major change in the allocation mechanism. What the results are remain to be proven by facts. However, there is a common belief on all sides that it is an improvement. Even the yarn factories feel interested in this. The Textile Construction authorities, in particular, are deeply supportive, as it may reduce misunderstandings.

Difficulties of the Re-allocation Committee In terms of the re-allocation committee, logically speaking, they should be satisfied. However, those familiar with the details say that they also feel very difficult. One is that the responsibility came suddenly. Preparations were insufficient, and fair allocation was not easy. In the past two weeks, two allocations have been made, and the headquarters of the re-allocation committee and the various constituent associations have done their best to cope with this matter. Still, it is difficult to feel at ease. They feel helpless and uneasy about those who failed to declare or did not participate in the allocation. Small factories that used to rely on squeezing Textile Construction yarn for their business are now unable to benefit, as the re-allocation committee measures based on the amount of practical use. Large factories still say it is not enough, as the Textile Management Committee only allocates 60% of their requested ammounts. From the next allocation onwards, a certain amount will be allocated within the original allocation quota to factories that have filed supplementary declarations. However, with too few resources and too many claimants, it will become even more inadequate. The second is that the source of yarn comes from yarn factories, and the matching of counts and the delivery of warehouse warrants are said to be difficult to describe in a few words. If sincere understanding cannot be obtained, it is inevitable that there will be other changes.

The New Method This Time Today (11th) is the day of the third allocation of the third period. The third period refers to the first period of September. The total amount is still 6,000 bales plus some remainder. The Textile Management Committee has already sent a document to the replica industry the night before. The authorities intend to allocate four times a month, not dividing it by weeks. The second time was accidentally chosen to be every Monday. If it remains unchanged, it will cause a month to exceed four times. Therefore, the following allocations will be on the 21st of this month and December 1st. The authorities consulted with the re-allocation committee on this matter in advance and they agreed. This is the first change in the method. The allocation quota remains the original number, but factories that have filed supplementary declarations will also receive allocations. Then the allocation quota for the original households will be further reduced. The amounts that supplementally declaring households receive will still be unsatisfactory. This matter has been agreed to by the Textile Management Committee after consultation with the re-allocation committee, and it is also an unavoidable expedient measure. This is the second change in the method. The qualifications and usage standards of each factory receiving the original allocation and the supplementary declaration have been reviewed again and reduced significantly. It is expected that some supplementally declared applicants will still not be able to receive allocations, and some original allocation factories will have their standards lowered. This is also something that the re-allocation committee has already reported to and followed the instructions of the Textile Management Committee to handle strictly. This is the third change in the method.

Further Improvements Needed in the Future According to news from the Textile Management Committee and the re-allocation committee, this is still a temporary expedient measure. There should be more practical improvements in December. According to the data from the re-allocation committee, the allocation amount will be increased by one-third. Those who do not directly replicate finished products in this city will be thoroughly reorganized. And the amount of practical use for each factory will be closer to reality. According to qualified people, it is necessary for yarn factories to cooperate in order for things to work out.

### Interview with the Chairman of the Yarn Industry Association: The Impact of Yarn Management Policies

According to Tang Zhiliang, the chairman of the Yarn Industry Association, in an interview with reporters, regarding the black market for cotton yarn, the Textile Management Committee has adopted a coercive policy, so although prices have been reduced, they have not been completely eliminated. Manufacturers and intermediaries have all accepted Mayor Wu's four measures, but the other party's method of refunding or compensating for differences at a price of 1.75 million per bale is that the Textile Management Committee's opinion is that manufacturers should directly compensate the people holding warehouse warrants, but according to the opinion of merchants, it should be compensated to the person named on the warehouse warrant, because the manufacturer sells the warehouse warrant to the person named on it (the intermediary), and the person named on it then sells it to the person holding the warrant, who may be a user or an intermediary. For example, when the black market yarn price is 2.2 million, the person named on the warehouse warrant purchases a warehouse warrant from the manufacturer, but when the person named on it then sells it to the person holding the warrant, the black market price changes again, either rising or falling. It is actually unfair and unreasonable for the person holding the warrant to directly return 350,000 to the manufacturer at the price of 1.75 million. In fact, according to commercial custom, once a transaction is completed, the gains and losses are not related to each other. At most, the current loss is too great, and both parties agree to find a way to make up for it in the price of the next transaction, but the price of the previous transaction can never be changed. Therefore, although refunding or compensating for differences is beneficial to this industry, it will inevitably affect commercial customs and merchant credit. Therefore, since this method has been implemented, it has been difficult for intermediaries to purchase spot goods. Those who purchase them are all two-week futures. Calculating the current high-interest two-week interest rate, it has already increased to 1.89 million. I have talked to Mayor Wu about this matter, and Mayor Wu believes that he can order manufacturers to only sell spot goods. If they sell futures, the interest should be deducted at a rate of 15% every two weeks. However, if this is done, manufacturers can refuse to sell, making it even more difficult for intermediaries to buy cotton yarn, which is by no means a solution. Currently, manufacturers are planning to transport it to other places to find another way out. If this continues, yarn prices in other ports may fall, while the yarn shortage in this city will become even more serious.

### Qian Dui Industry: Engaging in Deposit Business; Planning to Convert All to Banks

Since the government stipulated the price of US dollars, the transaction has been dull in the Qian Dui industry in this city. The industry had previously submitted a request to the Central Bank to allow the restoration of pre-war small industrial and commercial deposit business, and requested eight points: (1) Small industrial and commercial deposits are limited to the 185 registered Qian Dui firms; (2) To prevent peers from replacing them, it is not allowed to change owners; (3) Imitate the Qian industry system, so that the competent authority can check; (4) Hand over 20% of deposits to the Central Bank; (5) All Qian Dui stores should be changed to banks; (6) Previous licenses continue to be effective; (7) Stipulate the minimum capital amount for each store; (8) Imitate the Hangzhou Qian Dui industry method, and also engage in currency exchange. According to Wang Yuncheng, the chairman of the Qian Dui industry, the above eight articles have been personally approved by the president of the Central Bank.

### Joint Allocation Association: Cotton Yarn Conversion Method

The Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation Association sells cotton yarn with 20 counts as the standard, but the counts sold by each factory are not all standard yarn. For example, in this period, there are only 3,375 bales of 20-count yarn, and there are various counts of other counts. As for the conversion method, according to the person in charge of the association: it is based on the actual number of spindles opened by each factory in July, carefully reviewed, and the conversion method is stipulated. The method is as follows:

10 counts 187.5% 16 counts 125%

20 counts 100% 32 counts 75%

42 counts 60%

The above conversion numbers are based on 20-count yarn as a percentage. Assuming that the yarn factory should allocate 100 bales of 20-count yarn in this period, the numbers are increased or decreased depending on whether 16-count or 32-count yarn is being converted. That is, 125 bales of 16-count yarn and 75 bales of 32-count yarn should be allocated.

### UNRRA's Supply of Cattle and Sheep: The Plan Has Not Been Abandoned; The Quantity Has Been Slightly Reduced

[Our Newspaper's Report] The UNRRA's plan to supply cattle and sheep to our country was cancelled before due to the difficulty of purchasing them. According to reliable information from relevant parties, the original plan has not been abandoned, but the funding has been reduced from the original US$5 million to between US$600,000 and US$1 million. In December of this year, it is hoped that 400 frozen Friesian dairy cows will be transported to our country. UNRRA originally planned to supply 800 cattle to our country from Australia, but it has now been changed to supply 400 cattle, and the other 400 will be offset by 1,000 sheep. In addition to this, UNRRA plans to provide 1,000 water buffaloes. After these livestock are transported to our country in the future, the water buffaloes will be sold, and the dairy cows and sheep will be allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

### Adulteration Discovered in Grain Allocation: The Company Investigates the Truth

The discovery of adulteration in the first phase of rationed sugar in this city has attracted considerable attention from the public. According to the person in charge of the company who spoke to reporters, the first batch of rationed sugar in this phase totaled 7,962 bags of medium-grade sugar. The Nantucket Goods Industry Association of this city separately sent personnel to the second wharf and the fifth wharf of the China Merchants Bureau to ship the goods, and the person in charge of the shipment from the association took samples from each bag before shipping them out of the warehouse. At that time, they were all pure Taiwan sugar. After the rationed sugar was shipped out of the warehouse, the adulteration occurred. The company believes that it is very strange and is now thoroughly investigating the truth to clarify the responsibility.

### Water Heating Pipes: Many Demolished, Few Arriving; Very Few Are Prepared to Install Them

(Our Newspaper's Report) Winter is approaching in the blink of an eye, but the market conditions for water heating pipes have not improved. According to people in the hardware industry, during the enemy and puppet period, all the water heating equipment in major buildings, apartments, hotels, etc. in this city was almost completely demolished. However, the price of coal is surprisingly high, and the installation price of water heating equipment is also not cheap. On the industry side, there is also a shortage of goods. Therefore, there are almost no people who have started to restore the installation. After the victory, only Shenchang and Bu Neimen foreign firms, etc., have installed a small amount of water heating pipes from abroad. The original water heating seats and stoves have not been shipped. According to reports, the market price of half-inch diameter water heating pipes once reached 3,000 yuan per foot when there was a shortage of goods. The recent market price is 20,000 yuan per foot. A one-inch diameter pipe is 2,600 yuan per foot. The largest six-inch diameter water heating pipe is 20,000 yuan per foot. Among these, small-diameter pipes are relatively popular. The original water heating seats are priced based on the size of each piece of area. Ordinary water heating seats have an area of ​​between three square feet and five square feet. The wholesale price of each square foot is about one US dollar. The market price is about two US dollars per square foot. It is estimated that an ordinary two-story Western-style house with complete water heating equipment, including water heating pipes, water heating seats, and stoves, etc., requires about 30 million yuan. At such a high price, even the Western-style house class will probably be discouraged.

### Redemption of Four Types of Government Bonds: Lottery to Be Drawn in Shanghai Today

The Ministry of Finance has decided to hold a public bond lottery for the redemption of the following four types of government bonds at 9:00 a.m. today (11th) at the Shanghai Office of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, located on the fourth floor of the Central Trust Bureau at 74 Renji Road: the 25th year of the Republic of China Unified Government Bond Type D Bonds, the 28th year of the Republic of China Military Supplies Government Bond Phase 1 Bonds, the 30th year of the Republic of China Military Supplies Government Bond Phase 2 Bonds, and the 32nd year of the Republic of China Allied Victory Government Bonds.

It is reported that once the above government bonds are drawn, the ministry will redeem the principal within a limited time. If you hold the bond documents, you can go to the designated bank to collect them within the limited time, and it will be resolved with the national treasury.

### The Voice of the Flour Industry: Daily Trading Is Limited; Profits Are Too Thin to Cover Expenses

In the flour industry, in addition to the manufacturers, there are also flour dealers, which are divided into wholesale and retail industries. After the wholesalers obtain the flour from the flour factories, a small part is resold to retailers for retail sales, and the majority is sold to various gangs from the north and south. Because Shanghai is a major production area for flour, before the war, the total daily flour production of each flour factory in Shanghai was about 100,000 bags, so the business of wholesalers was quite developed. Moreover, most of the wholesalers are brokers of the flour exchange, and they also buy and sell futures on behalf of customers, so their business is even more prosperous.

After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, the flour exchange stopped operating. Futures trading could not be carried out, but spot goods could still be traded as usual. Later, as the war zone gradually expanded, the business was inevitably affected, but it was not very depressed. Until the outbreak of the Pacific War, the entire Shanghai fell into the hands of the enemy, and all kinds of important materials were put under control. Flour is the main food, and of course it was strictly controlled, so it was impossible to trade freely, and the business of wholesalers was stagnated. Retailers had to sell rationed flour to struggle to maintain their lives.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the flour dealers all had great hopes, regrouped, and dreamed of the pre-war business, and announced their resumption of business one after another. The Flour Bran Commercial Industry Association was also organized. There are more than 300 members who have joined. Among them, wholesalers account for about one-quarter, and retailers account for three-quarters, but the products of the flour factories in Shanghai are not made by buying wheat themselves, but are commissioned by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to produce them, and they directly flow to the people without going through the hands of flour merchants at all. Fortunately, at this time, the flour merchants transported some miscellaneous brand flour from Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places to Shanghai for sale. When wheat was launched this year, in addition to producing relief flour for the UNRRA, the flour factories also purchased wheat to produce and sell flour. The harvest of wheat was still good this year, so the flour price was still stable in May and June. Although the price has inevitably continued to rise, other prices have risen sharply, and compared to the general rise of prices, the price of flour was no exception. However, it is not enough for our country's flour to rely solely on domestic wheat for manufacturing. Before the war, every autumn, a large number of foreign wheat imports were relied upon to supplement it, so after a few months, the amount of wheat exported gradually decreased, and the price gradually increased. Therefore, the flour price also rose step by step. In view of the people's food, the authorities restricted the retail price of flour from August 19th, and each bag should not exceed 14,300 yuan. Later, it was slightly increased to 14,700 yuan, and each flour factory was ordered to supply 9,000 bags of retail flour to the city every day. Unfortunately, at that time, only the export of flour was prohibited, and wheat could still be exported. As a result, the wheat reserves were depleted day by day, and the price of good wheat rose to nearly 40,000 yuan per load, while the 9,000 bags distributed by each factory every day could not be fully supplied, and Sunday was also a day of suspension of distribution, so supply could not meet demand, and they had to be supplemented by sales from other ports. And because the price of wheat was rising every day in other ports, the price of flour also rose, so the cost of transporting it to Shanghai alone required more than 18,000 yuan per bag. The purpose of merchants' transportation and sales is to make a profit, and the current interest rate is also ridiculously high, so everything is passed on to the buyers, and this has created the so-called black market.

Now, the authorities are also aware of the shortage of wheat reserves and have allowed manufacturers to temporarily increase the flour price to 20,000 yuan per bag, plus 300 yuan for transportation, and 200 yuan for profit, and the retail price per bag is 20,500 yuan. Each flour factory must maintain a daily distribution of 12,000 bags, and the export of wheat is also prohibited. The association will designate more than 100 retail stores to distribute this allocated flour, which can only be sold to merchants who manufacture various products with flour, such as bread, biscuits, noodles, flatbread, fried dough sticks, and various snack shops and steamed bun shops, etc., and they can all purchase flour with certificates. The profits obtained are evenly distributed among the 300 members. In addition, flour transported from other ports can be traded freely, but the price per bag must not exceed 20,500 yuan. As a result, the black market has disappeared.

But, what about flour dealers? There are now more than 300 members in the same industry. Every day, 12,000 bags (according to the recent number of flour bags from various industries, the average is 6,000 to 7,000 bags), the profit per bag of flour is 200 yuan, and they have to pay 100 yuan per bag to the designated retail dealers who distribute the flour. The actual amount they receive is only 100 yuan per bag. Even with 12,000 bags, a total of 1.2 million yuan, and an average distribution of 300 households, they only receive 4,000 yuan per day. Excluding four days without flour distribution on Sundays each month, there are only 26 days, and each household receives more than 100,000 yuan per month. Now, there are more than a dozen partners in large flour shops, and two or three in small shops. What are they going to do with a mere 100,000 yuan?

According to the above, then the more than 100 designated retail stores that distribute flour do not have an additional subsidy of 100 yuan per bag? However, they need to prepay for the distribution of flour. The interest rate is so high now, at least 15%, and they borrow money to prepay. If they pay for the goods today and pick them up, and sell them all tomorrow, it won't be a waste of effort. However, in fact, after two or three days, they still have a small amount of flour left, and the retailers cannot sell the flour to others, so they have to secretly pay the interest.

Therefore, flour merchants strongly hope that the authorities will adjust the stipulated profits and consider improving the current distribution methods.

### Accounting Issues for Last Year's Profit Tax

— Gan Yunshou

After several consultations between the tax authorities and the persons in charge of the chamber of commerce on the simplified collection of profit tax in the 34th year, it has been decided to collect it based on the net profit concluded last year, plus 50%. Standing from the perspective of tax law and tax theory, we certainly cannot think it is reasonable, but in order to suit the tax revenue budget, the authorities have no choice but to implement it regardless of the law. However, looking back, because the accounts of industrial and commercial institutions have been long overdue last year, the net profit has already been distributed. The payment of this tax will inevitably cause many questions in the account books. Based on what I have seen, I will briefly discuss it below for reference by various industries:

After checking, most of the net profits of various industries in the 34th year have been distributed. Before the distribution, there was occasional legal provision for tax payments, but it would never exceed the net profit of that year. Now, the payment of taxes depends on the situation of each industry, and the accounting treatment will be different. Three situations are listed below:

The first situation – that is, if each industry's account lists items such as public reserve or rolling surplus, and the amount exceeds the tax amount for that year, then the amount of public reserve surplus can be offset by the tax amount due. The debit and credit entries are a debit to public reserve or rolling surplus and a credit to tax payable. Assuming that a company obtained a net profit of 1 million yuan in the 34th year, and the tax payable for that year was 1.5 million yuan. However, all the net profits have been fully distributed, and its account lists 400,000 for tax payable and 1.2 million for public reserve. At this time, the tax payable is still short of 1.1 million yuan, and 1.1 million yuan should be debited from the public reserve and 1.1 million yuan credited to the tax payable.

The second situation – although the account shows that there is a public reserve rolling surplus, it cannot offset the tax payable for that year. This difference can be transferred to the prior period profit and loss adjustment number, or the donation and tax item, listed as the loss of the 35th year, or transferred to the temporary payment item, to be written off when there is a surplus in the future. If the public reserve of a company mentioned above is only 500,000 yuan, and it is not enough to offset the tax payable, which is short of 600,000 yuan, then the insufficient amount can be debited into the prior period profit and loss adjustment number, or the donation and tax or temporary payment item.

The third situation – the amount of public reserve or rolling surplus listed on the account is very small, or even there is no listing of public reserve surplus or tax payable. In my opinion, the net profit and capital of that year should be calculated to calculate the legally tax payable amount, and debited into the capital owner's current account, or the tax receivable item, which is responsible for payment by the capital owner or shareholder. Since the net profit of that year has been fully distributed by the shareholders, and no consideration is given to making provisions for retaining the enterprise, the shareholders should be recovered. As for the difference from the tax bureau's regulations, it can still be debited into the prior period profit and loss adjustment number, or the donation and tax, or temporary payment item. For example, if the tax payable by a company according to law is 400,000 yuan, but the tax payable is 1.5 million yuan, the entry should be: debit the capital owner's current account, or tax receivable item, 400,000 yuan, and the prior period profit and loss adjustment number 1.1 million yuan, and credit the tax payable 1.5 million yuan.

Of course, the best of the three situations mentioned above is to be able to offset the public reserve surplus with the tax payable. If it cannot be offset, then it is only appropriate to transfer the account to the prior period profit and loss adjustment number or donation and tax item and list it as the loss of the 35th year. In principle, the levying of income tax should be below the net profit, and there is absolutely no reason to exceed the net profit. Now, the government has the pain of having to collect more than the net profit due to the change in currency value, the delayed collection of taxes, and the inability to match income and expenditure. However, the loss or gain of industrial and commercial enterprises is also an undeniable fact. Therefore, some people believe that it is not inappropriate to list it as a loss item in the 35th year if it exceeds the tax payable amount according to law. As for listing it as a temporary payment item, it is purely a prudent countermeasure. If the tax authorities allow it to be listed as a loss item in the future, it can be transferred to the temporary payment item. Otherwise, it can only wait for a surplus before it can be offset.

### Customs Officer Explains: Procedures for Collecting Goods Tax on Behalf of Importers

Since the newly promulgated regulations on goods tax were implemented, the customs has been collecting goods tax on imported goods from abroad. However, the general public is not very clear about the collection procedures. A reporter yesterday specifically interviewed a customs officer. According to him, the customs' collection of goods tax on goods imported from abroad is purely to simplify the collection procedures. The method is that when goods that should be subject to goods tax are imported from abroad, the merchant must fill in a goods tax payment certificate and submit it to the customs together with the foreign goods import declaration for inspection. After the customs verifies that the documents match, it intercepts the second, third, and fourth copies of the goods tax payment certificate and hands them over to the merchant to be deposited with the public treasury or the customs tax collection office. The first copy is sent to the competent goods tax authority for record on the next day after the merchant pays the tax. After paying the goods tax, the merchant must hold the second and third copies of the goods tax payment certificate to the customs for review. After the customs verifies that it is correct, it will return the third copy to the merchant for travel with the goods. At the same time, the customs officer will indicate "goods tax collected separately" on the import declaration and cut off the third copy of the goods tax payment certificate for reference. The customs should allow the merchant to first transport the taxed goods with the second copy of the goods tax payment certificate. When the goods arrive at the place where there is a goods tax authority, the merchant should apply to the goods tax authority for verification, and then exchange it for a goods tax payment certificate and paste a stamp. The customs collection of goods tax should be reported to the general affairs department every month for accounting, and a list should be sent to the customs department for verification.

### Rise in American Cotton Prices

[United Press, New York, 9th] Today, cotton futures rose by up to four dollars per bale due to purchases by textile mills and a lack of sellers. Closing futures prices were unchanged at the lowest and up two and a half cents at the highest. Also, a dispatch from New Orleans on the 9th reported that cotton futures closed steady today, rising seven and a half cents per bale at the lowest and three dollars and five cents at the highest.

### Trial Planting of Tung Trees: Unsuitable American Climate; Disappointments in British Africa, India, Australia, etc.

Reuters, London – Mr. Bray of the Imperial Institute recently presented a paper stating that the entire commercial supply of tung oil has always come from China. However, most of the Chinese production is still shipped to the United States. In the first six months of 1946, China's exports were only 4,000 tons. The United States began tung oil production as early as 1905. The American Tung Oil Company has continuously improved early planting methods. Currently, the area planted with tung trees in the United States has reached 100,000 acres. However, the American continent is not an ideal area for tung oil production due to early frost concerns. In 1943, U.S. tung oil production was only 23,000 tons, and in 1944 it decreased to 1,100 tons. The British Empire has trialed tung tree planting throughout the empire, but by 1933, the results were mostly disappointing. In 1939, South African tung tree production was 15 tons. Although the oil production figure reached 270 tons in 1943, the results were still not satisfactory. Currently, the annual output of Nyasaland is only about 60 tons. Although Indian tung production was once tried, it still lacks large-scale commercial operations. There are also better hopes for Burmese tung production, with an area of 750 acres planted with tung trees promoted by local gentry. Between 1938 and 1939, Burma exported 62 tons of tung seeds. Australia has also devoted itself to experimental work, but the results seem insignificant.

### Current Situation of the Yumen Oil Mine: New Machinery Arriving Soon

[Report from our newspaper] A person concerned told our reporter: The recent reduced quantity of oil imports is due to transportation difficulties. The responsible authorities attach great importance to the development of the Yumen Oil Mine. The first batch of machinery shipped from the United States after the war has arrived in Luoyang and will arrive in the mining area in a month, at which time production will be able to increase. The boilers previously lost on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway will be replaced. Recently, due to weather conditions, Yumen oil production has slightly decreased. If the oil produced by the mine is refined with equipment, it can be used for aviation purposes; however, the current policy is that while not neglecting quality, increasing production is more important. In the Northeast, the Japanese used to operate a large-scale oil refinery in Jinzhou, but unfortunately, the important machinery was removed after the victory. The Petroleum Company is currently taking care of it and rectifying it, and work will begin after replenishment next year. As for the shale oil refining project in Fushun, it has not been restored; although the Japanese had this experiment in the past, the production cost was very high.

### Petroleum Company Sends Personnel to Explore Oil Sources in Taiwan

[Report from our newspaper] In order to increase our country's oil sources, the China Petroleum Corporation dispatched an exploration team to Taiwan two weeks ago to begin exploration work in the western part of the island. A person concerned told our reporter: Taiwan may have oil sources in its geological structure, but although exploration was conducted during the Japanese rule, there were no results. Our country's exploration this time is different from the Japanese in terms of region and technology used, and we hope to have good results.

### Ministry of Education Cables Provinces to Report on Time: Excellent Teachers in National Schools; Originally Stipulated Bonus Changed to Award Certificates

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] In order to reward the hard work of excellent central national schools, national school principals, and teachers in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education previously promulgated the "Measures for Setting up Bonuses for Excellent Central National Schools, National School Principals, and Teachers." Articles 4 and 7 of the measures originally stipulated that the most outstanding would be given a bonus of 500 yuan, which has now been changed to the Ministry of Education issuing certificates of merit. Also, Article 4 of the previously promulgated "Measures for Setting up Bonuses for Counties and Cities with Excellent Achievements in National Education" originally stipulated that the three most outstanding counties and cities would be given a bonus of 10,000 to 15,000 yuan per county and city, which has now been changed to the Ministry of Education issuing children's reading materials. The Ministry of Education has also cabled the provinces, instructing them to handle the selection and submission in accordance with the regulations and report to the Ministry of Education for verification before the end of November this year.

### Excellent Private Elementary Schools Can be Converted into Substitute National Schools: Ministry of Education Has Formulated Measures

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] In order to actively promote national education and strive for universal access, the Ministry of Education has formulated a "Measures for Substitute National Schools" in accordance with the regulations of the National School Law and circulated it to the education administrative authorities of all provinces and cities in the country for compliance. It is understood that the purpose of these substitute national schools is to enable private elementary schools in counties and cities that have not yet universally established national schools, which have excellent performance and have been verified by the competent county and city authorities, and with the consent of the private elementary school board of directors, to be renamed "County," "City," "Township," "Town," and "Bao" substitute national schools in the location where the school is located, and they are still managed, supervised, and guided by the competent education administrative authorities of the county and city governments or the directly administered municipalities to which they are subordinate. The organization, funding, personnel, and name aspects are explored and recorded below:

Organization Aspects

The original private elementary school is limited to the implementation of simple education for school-age children. Since the conversion to a substitute national school, the school shall set up two departments: children's education and education for out-of-school people. Children's education is based on grades one, two, three, and four. If possible, grades five and six may also be set up. Education for out-of-school people is based on the operation of primary adult classes and women's classes. When necessary, advanced classes may also be set up. After being converted into a substitute national school, the curriculum, teaching materials, equipment, teachers, and all facilities shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the National School and the Central National School Law.

Funding Aspects

After a private elementary school is converted into a substitute national school, its funding shall be borne by the competent education administrative authorities of the county, city, or municipality directly under the central government. However, the original property of the private elementary school shall still be managed by its board of directors and shall not be taken over by the public.

Personnel Aspects

After a private elementary school is converted into a substitute national school, its principal shall be appointed by the county and city government. However, the original principals and teachers shall continue to be retained in principle unless their qualifications are not met or one of the circumstances listed in Article 12 of the Measures for the Appointment, Treatment, Advanced Studies, and Guarantee of National School Teachers and Staff exists.

Name Aspects

If the competent education administrative authority cancels its substitute name, or the private elementary school requests to restore its private nature, it shall be restored to its private status with the consent of the competent education administrative authority and the private elementary school board of directors. If the private elementary school board of directors is unwilling to continue running the school and donates all the school's property to the public, the words "substitute" may be cancelled and the school may be changed to a national school.

### Wu Zhaotang Returns to Nanjing to Discuss the Current Situation of Education in Xi'an

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Wu Zhaotang, a supervisor of the Ministry of Education, who went to Xi'an to inspect higher education, has now returned to Nanjing after completing his official duties. According to him, the Northwest Institute of Technology is currently holding classes in Xi'an and Xianyang. The first-year students are in Xi'an, and the second, third, and fourth-year students are in Xianyang. The school building problem has been gradually resolved with the assistance of the military headquarters and local authorities. The Northwest Institute of Technology was originally the Peiyang Institute of Technology. The Jiaozuo Institute of Technology has been approved to reopen, but it has not yet materialized. Northwest University is being expanded, with dormitories and dining halls for faculty and staff being added, and it is also planned to merge with the private School of Pharmacy to expand into a medical school. The professors of the Northwest Institute of Technology and Northwest University are extremely poor. The cost of living in Xi'an is very similar to that in Nanjing. Even the popular food youtiao costs 100 yuan per piece. However, the current salary of public teachers in Xi'an is only 360 times, so it is very difficult to maintain a family life.

### Thoroughly Eliminate Pornographic Literature

Guangzhou Authorities Strictly Prohibit Students from Reading

[Report from our newspaper, Guangzhou, 10th] The education authorities of this city have ordered all schools to strictly prohibit students from reading pornographic literature, and the police bureau and the social affairs bureau have jointly cracked down on sales in order to thoroughly eliminate them.

### India Sends Professor Bakshi to Peking University to Lecture

Bakshi has a doctorate in literature from the University of Paris and has taught history at the University of Calcutta. He is one of the few Indian scholars who is proficient in Chinese and has written a history of Sino-Indian relations in English. He plans to arrive in Peiping in March next year.

### Changchun University Closes Early

The Reasons are Coal and Money Shortages

[Changchun News] While universities in Guannei are preparing to start school, National Changchun University has decided to start winter vacation from November 15th. The reasons for closing so early are: first, a shortage of coal, and second, a shortage of money. Without heat and rice, it is necessary to wait until March next year before classes can resume. There are currently more than 1,500 students in the school, most of whom are from poor families or homeless, and they are hesitating and complaining.

### Hangzhou is Suffering from an Entertainment Famine

— Our Newspaper Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Hangzhou, November 1st

The early autumn this year was like a feast of soybeans, and after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the drizzling rain made people feel a desolate chill. Therefore, the osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong were mercilessly beaten by the rain, leaving only a few branches of flowers. The boats on the lake listlessly greeted the people coming and going.

These days, it is already the end of autumn. The weather in Hangzhou is clear and warm like spring. The lovely autumn of Hangzhou actually showed its face before the arrival of early winter, filling the whole day with smiles. The lush green shade on Su Causeway and Bai Causeway is just like West Lake putting on a deep green coat. People from Shanghai, seeing the warm weather, took time out of their busy schedules to come to Hangzhou one after another. As a result, the hotels were full again, and the local product stores and restaurants were doing good business again. The boatmen, the horse-drawn carriages by the lake, and the rickshaw pullers all smiled.

Like a Beautiful Girl Who Has Not Received Deep Cultivation

It is the best time to see red leaves in Xixi and maple leaves in Ninety-Eight Ravine.

Some people say, "Hangzhou is lively in spring and autumn because the climate is warm and the scenery of West Lake is pleasant. Everyone is willing to come to Hangzhou for a visit." Others say, "Hangzhou is only good for its scenery, nothing else is worth mentioning." I want to ask, "Is Hangzhou really only good for its scenery?" Yes, Hangzhou's appearance and substance do not match. I remember Mr. Gong Peicheng, the leader of the municipal inspection team organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, once asked me specifically, "Hangzhou is like a beautiful girl, but her soul has not received deep cultivation. Therefore, this beautiful girl can only be looked at, but cannot be talked to."

Today, if we want this beautiful girl to have cultivation, there are certainly many things to do, but the entertainment issue is indeed a very important point. I have met several people who came to Hangzhou, and they almost all said in unison, "When we come to Hangzhou, we swim and play in the water during the day. If there is no moon at night, we have to close the door and sleep."

Inferior Programs Sell Out, Singers Sing Decadent Tunes

Before the war, there was a large auditorium in the Inner West Lake that screened high-quality movies. When you ran into this theater, you were forbidden to crack melon seeds. It can be seen that the audience of this theater was sophisticated, and it staged very good dramas. At the same time, there was a stadium on the shore of West Lake where many people exercised after getting off work. After the war, lower-level dance halls and variety shows flourished for a while. Singers sang decadent songs, and theaters showed outdated plays. Especially in movie theaters, they were still showing films such as "Midnight Song Venue" and "Three Stars Accompanying the Moon". Some even showed "Double Pearl Phoenix", "Bi Yan", "The Golden Powder Family", "Pearl Tower", "Meng Lijun", "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai", etc., wishing they could put "Burning the Red Lotus Temple" on the screen. Although the theaters in Hangzhou were showing such plays, the audience was still very crowded. A movie theater that specialized in showing films like "Pearl Tower" was almost full every day. The most bizarre thing is that there is a vacant lot on a grand Zhongzheng Road (formerly Yingchai Road) that has been turned into a puppet show venue. This puppet show group is doing quite well, but they only set up some reed sheds, hang two small wooden boards in front of the door with red paper pasted on them, write the play's name, and beat drums as the only way to attract the audience. In addition, storytelling in various teahouses is also an important leisure education activity for the citizens of Hangzhou today.

What about the stadium by the lake? It was covered with houses by the enemy and puppets. Because the person in charge of the venue did not have money, they could not build it properly. The public stadium in the city was overgrown with weeds. Therefore, many good teams could not play when they came to Hangzhou, leaving a little regret for this beautiful lake and mountain city.

The high and low quality of entertainment can be used to judge the cultural level of a place. If there is no way to improve the standard of entertainment in Hangzhou, then Hangzhou will be a girl with a beautiful appearance but a stupid substance, and she may even gradually become degenerate.

The Mayor Talks About a New Plan, Creating an Oriental Hollywood

I have talked to Mayor Zhou Jinguang about this matter. He said that he has a plan to turn Hangzhou into an Oriental Hollywood, located in the Jiuxi Shiba Jian area. There, dozens of roads can be built and several houses can be built, but people with vision must be willing to invest. Secondly, there is the stadium. He means that there is a piece of land in Songmu Chang! It used to be prepared as a riding and archery field, but now it is barren and can be used as a stadium. He also invited Director Shen Jingchu of the Public Works Bureau to accompany me to see it, and showed me how to arrange the layout. I think this method is really good, and the plan is especially good, but it is too slow. Moreover, who is willing to invest such a large sum of money in this kind of undertaking at present?

Now, I want to make a specific proposal: the government should allocate funds to repair the stadium of the Provincial Educational Institution by the lake. If the place is too narrow, then a better basketball court should be built. This basketball court should have locker rooms and stands. If someone asks again where the money will come from? I propose to hold a Sunday Ball Club, holding basketball games every Sunday, selling tickets for each game, and using sports to promote sports. Some people say that Hangzhou may not be able to sell tickets. I say don't sell them too expensive. We can sell tickets for 500 yuan each, or even 200 yuan each. If there are good teams coming, we can sell more tickets. If there are wealthy people who love sports coming to Hangzhou, we can ask them to donate some money. By accumulating sand into a tower and gathering tiny hairs into a fur coat, we can also succeed soon. Don't you see that there is a very good stadium in Guiyang? It has stone stands and the latest type of basketball hoops and frames, and can be used for volleyball and tennis. This is the result of using the method mentioned above.

In addition, we should suggest that a model theater be built on this vacant lot on Yingzi Road. Regarding this model theater, we can first invite merchants to operate it, and the municipal government will supervise it, and after a few years, it will be publicly operated by the city. Various other relatively low-level entertainment activities should be actively improved.

If entertainment is improved in taste and sports are universally developed, then Hangzhou will not become a city with a beautiful appearance but an empty content.

### A Journey to Changhua

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

Taiwan, October 20th, Airmail

Taipei is the political and economic center, and also the special capital of Taiwan Province. My duties prevent me from leaving it. However, the actual problems discovered in the provincial capital cannot be solved without delving into the hinterland, especially the low voices of the people, which are isolated in the provincial capital, but deserve the respect of discussion. I am very grateful to Director Lin Zigui of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Headquarters for allowing me to travel with Zheng Zhengren, the editor-in-chief of Guoshi Daily. In fact, Mr. Lin still maintains his reporter's style, exploring the south and using various angles to measure the depth of progress in various places.

Taoyuan, Four Languages

Taoyuan, which has no peach trees, is the first stop on the express train from Taipei to the south. Three months ago, the Hsinchu County Government was driven by the municipal government to move to the northernmost town in the county. The county has a population of 400,000, of which 130,000 are Hakka people from Guangdong, tens of thousands are aboriginal people from the mountains, and the rest are Taiwanese people sandwiched between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. Among these people, the Hakka people use Hakka, the aborigines use primitive languages, the Taiwanese people use Minnan dialect, and I use Mandarin, which is now barely understood. In any gathering place, when speaking to fellow countrymen, at least two or more languages must be used, otherwise, it will be impossible for them to understand. Only one language is popular - Japanese, but this hostile and poisonous language is forbidden.

The Japanese in Taiwan never allowed you to speak Taiwanese. They would not only punish you but also use torture. From the time you were educated, you were not given the opportunity to speak Taiwanese. The method they attempted to use language to assimilate the people of this province has been at least 90% effective. People must believe that Mandarin has made great progress in Taiwan, but to be honest, apart from the fact that it is spoken in classrooms in various middle schools, how many people use it at home? This cannot be said to be a failure, it can only be said that the power of the province to spontaneously learn Mandarin has not yet been inspired. This power is the stability of life and the clarity of politics.

Taiwanese people don't understand Taiwanese, which seems like a joke, but it is the truth. In Taoyuan, I witnessed a Hakka-speaking chairman who used a Minnan-speaking translator to speak to people who didn't speak Taiwanese, which was awkward. The language barrier has fully explained that language is the main reason for self-isolation. No one does not believe in the importance of the widespread use of Mandarin, but no one can truly achieve it.

Hsinchu, Juvenile Prison

The pure Japanese-style Hsinchu Juvenile Detention Center (Juvenile Prison) is one of the "characteristics" of the city. It is the only one in the province, and almost everyone knows it. The reporters made a special trip to visit it on the morning of the 17th. The high walls built of cement are hidden under coconut trees. The long walls are reminiscent of the appearance of German concentration camps. In this small world of more than 3,700 square meters, 153 juveniles under the age of 20 and 279 adults are detained. At most, it can accommodate 518 people. It needs four bags of rice a day, using sweet potatoes and other non-staple foods. On average, each prisoner can get 364.32 calories of nutritional information per day. In the first five years when the Japanese managed it, the most common crime among juveniles was theft, with 330 people, followed by fraud with 50 people, adultery with 8 people, murder with 6 people, opium addicts with 4 people, and others. After the restoration, theft is still the most common crime.

Warden Lin Zipei allowed the reporters to visit the entire facility, including the detention rooms, classrooms, sports field, and auditorium. He also showed the prisoners with thin, withered bones tilling the fields, printing, typesetting, and binding in the printing room, learning to sew clothes, doing bamboo work, carpentry, and pasting cigarette labels for the Monopoly Bureau. These prisoners, whose fate had been decided, spent their days working to pass the days they had lost their freedom, except for one hour of exercise and one hour of class. More than a dozen female prisoners were squatting on the ground sewing torn clothes, looking like a family. Their detention rooms were even cleaner and more tidy than the male prisoners'. In the garden, several naked juvenile prisoners had stage III syphilis and were almost as thin as bamboo poles. The facility spends about 100,000 yuan a month, and the income from work can make up for 30-40% of it. In the first half of the year, 21 people died among the number of people admitted, because the work and food were normal, the mortality rate was very low.

According to the warden, he is very eager to hope that the people of the province can restore the organization of the Protection Association (the Japanese designated September 17th as Judicial Protection Memorial Day). In this association, they can pay for the travel expenses of released prisoners and introduce them to jobs. He definitely does not want them to come back because they need the support of the association and the government to grow up!

Changhua, An Ancient City

From Hsinchu to Changhua, it is a three-hour train ride. This is an intersection of a line parallel to the railway through Taichung. Because it takes five minutes to pass through the Shitouwu tunnel to Taichung, passengers prefer to take the coast line to avoid the smoke. The train passes countless small forks in the sea, crossing the coastal plains. Looking out the window, the blue sea is endless on the right, and the white waves are tightly connected to the sandy beach. Plump water buffalo graze through the white sugar cane flowers and head towards the plains. Ah, it is autumn after all, the poetic and tranquil edge of the sea.

As soon as you get off the train, you see the dilapidated remnants of the wartime scene in Changhua City. The southern Chinese-style ancient buildings are set off by the stalls set up with bamboo sheds, selling retail food. The road is paved with stones and full of mud and ash. The afternoon weather is still so hot that it makes people dizzy. We first went to see the oldest Confucian temple in the province. Only the main hall still stands majestically, and the front courtyard and the two wings are dilapidated. Changhua is praised as the birthplace of culture, but apart from the fact that there are four middle schools and four national schools, there are no more signs to be found.

Mayor Wang told reporters that the city has only 60,000 people (40,000 in the urban area). In the past, there were 300 staff members, but now there are only 110. Because the scope is small, the finances are not difficult, and salaries are paid monthly. There are more than 200 poor households in the city, at most 500 people are unemployed. If the sugar factory 6 kilometers away resumes work next year, there will be no problem with employment, he said: It is very reasonable to make Changhua a self-governing city. The local councilors demanded the abolition of Changhua City and the relocation of Taichung County here, on the grounds that it was the county seat 52 years ago and is located in the center of Taichung.

There is Bagua Mountain in the city. The Japanese arranged it as a scenic area, but in reality, there is only a pavilion and two hostels. We spent the night in the Central Guest House. Mr. Guo Yaoting, one of the representatives of the Kuomintang, told me that they had suffered hardships here. Twenty-six years ago, the Japanese arrested more than 1,000 anti-Japanese elements, and some were arrested here. There is a natural water source on the mountain, but because the reservoir is not enough, the city's daily water supply of 4,000 tons has become a problem, and the water supply is stopped in the afternoon.

### The State of Pig Production

— Wang Han'ou

Special Dispatch from this Newspaper

Recently, there has been a pork panic in Shanghai and other places, with market prices soaring, and occasional laments of "no meat" heard. Speaking of pork, one cannot help but pay attention to its production area – northern Jiangsu. The major pig-producing areas in northern Jiangsu are in Rugao, Jingjiang, and Hai'an counties. Currently, pig production has sharply declined, and the situation has suddenly changed, which not only affects the meat-eating problem of people in southern Jiangsu, but also severely impacts the economy of rural northern Jiangsu. This sudden change is accompanied by more than a year of internal turmoil in northern Jiangsu.

The important export commodities of northern Jiangsu are grain, followed by pigs, chickens, ducks, eggs, etc., with pigs being the largest. The large-scale pig exports include the Huai pigs from the Lianghuai area and the Zhuang pigs from the local area. Relatively speaking, Zhuang pork is more tender because they are fed barley, bean cakes, pigweed, etc., which are rich in nutrients, so they can grow faster. Families with the most cultivated land raise the most pigs, with some families raising twenty or thirty pigs. Families that can raise so many pigs must be middle peasants and rich peasants. Their family financial situations must not be bad.

In the rural areas around the western part of the county, it was not uncommon for farming families to raise twenty or thirty pigs. The reason for this is that the county has a high population density and little arable land, so farmers who have spare money cannot buy land and prefer to raise pigs to increase production. The conditions for raising pigs are building pigsties, storing barley and bean cakes, buying piglets, or raising an old sow to breed piglets from time to time. If you calculate it, how much capital does it take to raise a pigsty full of pigs?

When raising pigs, you have to get up early every morning to cut pigweed and grind barley. Mix the two together, cook them in a pot, and feed the pigs bucket by bucket, two or three times a day. When they grow into "Erkaizi" (half-grown), they need to be fattened, then grind bean cakes to feed them. Pigs don't like to eat other food after eating bean cakes, but bean cakes are expensive, so farmers will never easily feed them bean cakes unless they need to be sold when they grow up.

If the Zhuang pigs are infected with plague, the farmer's hard work and capital will be completely in vain. Farmers all regard pigs as their own children and lives, and various pig-raising superstitions are popular in the countryside. Also, because pigs are an important asset for farmers, when children get married, they first inquire about how many Zhuang pigs there are in the family's pigsty. For example, farmers in the western rural areas of Rugao and Hai'an work hard in production, and every family raises a lot of pigs, so every family is rich, so in the past there was the saying "Golden Rugao and Hai'an".

When pigs are raised to a certain stage, if something happens in the family and they need money, they can easily "transfer" the pigs to others, which is more convenient than farming. When the pigs are big enough and sold to pig dealers, it is called "Chu Quan" (leaving the pigsty), and neighbors are invited to eat "He Shi" (shared meal) as a celebration. The pig money is paid in installments, and the dealers only give him "piaozi" (notes), with many long terms, giving him a layer of exploitation. However, the farmers don't object to it, because after the pigs "leave the sty", they get a large amount of cash, which is easy to be stolen. It is better to have the "piaozi" in hand and slowly exchange them for food or other items on the street. It is useless for robbers to rob the "piaozi".

When the pseudo "Central Reserve Certificates" were popular, the currency inflated extremely, and prices continued to rise. Cunning speculators created slippery firms specializing in "piaozi" business, taking away the farmers' cash and giving the farmers "piaozi" with long terms, and hoarding goods or lending them out for interest. When the farmers took the "piaozi" to exchange for goods, the price of the goods had already risen a lot, and the farmers sometimes could not calculate the losses on it. Merchants who opened exchange houses all over the country made a living from "piaozi", and countless people and their families were supported. Moreover, with the "piaozi" circulating around, it sometimes affected the "money supply" and market price fluctuations in various places. It can be seen that the Zhuang pig in northern Jiangsu is related to the market economy.

During the occupation period, the enemy and puppets went to the countryside to ravage, and the loss of pig products and other by-products in rural areas was great, but the farmers still continued to concurrently manage; because this was related to their lives and wealth, and they struggled for survival, they could only fight to the end. Therefore, although there were times when pork was disconnected in various parts of southern Jiangsu due to traffic problems, it was not as panic-stricken as it is now. The current pig shortage situation has another major reason:

Since the Communist army of northern Jiangsu "liberated" several cities in Rugao last year, they have noticed that pig exports are a major economic link in northern Jiangsu, and they have listed it as one of their "industrial and commercial management" policies, designating several counties in Rugao that produce pigs as a "Special Zone of Subei" to manage pig exports and earn foreign exchange. However, because the farmers did not believe in his "Anti-Japanese currency" and control policies, they secretly talked business directly with pig merchants, exchanging each dan (a unit of weight) of pigs for a certain amount of barley or sesame oil. The barley and oil were delivered when the pigs were sold. However, when the pig merchants transported the Zhuang pigs to Shanghai to sell for legal currency and returned to exchange them for "Anti-Japanese currency" with the "Central China Bank", the price of barley had already risen sharply, and the price of a pig often did not even cover half a pig. Those pig merchants with bad intentions then "slipped away"! The farmers suffered losses and did not have barley to feed the pigs, which naturally affected pig production. This is one of the initial reasons.

Secondly, since the beginning of spring this year, the various movements launched in the "Liberated Areas": "struggle against landlords", families that raise pigs have not suffered deeply from the enemy and puppets, they must "have colluded", and their grain and pigs are fined; "disaster relief", families that raise pigs have a large amount of barley stored, and they are asked to donate a portion to "disaster relief"; "land redistribution", the land is scattered, and there are no middle peasants and rich peasants, and everyone is not qualified to raise a large number of pigs. In addition, farmers, because of their aversion to the "Liberated Areas", have massively exported Zhuang pigs since the spring and summer of this year, exchanged them for funds in the recovered areas, and fled outside, not flowing the funds back. Zhuang pig production has been severely hit and sharply reduced. This phenomenon was not felt by everyone when the pigs were massively exported in the summer until the "end of the map is revealed" and the famine situation emerged.

In addition, there are currently troops everywhere in northern Jiangsu, and transportation is not smooth! Guest troops gather, and meat consumption increases sharply; there is only consumption and no production. If this continues, although it will not be completely extinct, the future of meat consumption for people in southern and northern Jiangsu is not optimistic. Therefore, the only way to solve this problem at present is to quickly pacify the local area, so that the villagers in various places can return to farming as soon as possible; and the government should try to provide loans to support and restore pig production; this is also one of the important policies for stabilizing the countryside and relieving farmers in the future.

### The International Illustrated Magazine for the Paris Peace Conference's Propaganda Agency is Exquisite

— Reported by Hongfu from Paris

Airmail dispatch on the 25th

Since the beginning of the First World War thirty years ago, countries have been engaged in propaganda, with smaller efforts aimed at increasing the prosperity of a nation, and larger efforts aimed at influencing the destiny of the world. Having experienced and compared various situations, I feel that the clarity of guidance and the agility of methods have never been as impressive as the French government's propaganda organization at the Second Paris Peace Conference in 1946. The French have demonstrated their ingenuity in every way, and have not missed this once-in-a-century opportunity.

The "Hotel de Seillery", the most exquisite and magnificent building in the center of Paris (Note: Seillery was the pen name of the third wife of King Louis XIV), served as the residence for American officers and the meeting place for United Nations reporters during the war. The French government, taking advantage of this convenience, has now borrowed the entire "first floor" for the Office of Press Information, directly under the Prime Minister, to carry out its work. Various sections have assigned specialists. The bureau, under the director, is divided into eight sections: (1) Secretary assisting the director with daily affairs, (2) Administration (internal affairs, also known as general affairs), (3) Missions (external affairs), (4) Liaison (spiritual assistance to attendees), such as answering questions from attendees, inquiring on their behalf, and responding to inquiries, (5) Facilitation (material assistance to attendees), such as assisting attendees in obtaining food ration coupons and reserving seats in theaters, etc., (6) Service d'accueil (small matters), including the hotel's special newspaper and magazine room and the reporter's studio, (7) Accreditement (certification of attendees' qualifications), and (8) Transnissionw (transmission, handling incoming and outgoing mail, inquiring about telegram rates, etc.), with a mail room for receiving letters on behalf of people and a copy room for sending letters on behalf of people. In addition, writing, printing, telephone answering, and dispatching services for drivers are all handled quickly and responsively. As for foreign guests seeking accommodation and sightseeing in Paris, the organization has employed 135 guides to receive approximately 1,600 male and female tourists. The most interesting aspect of spiritual assistance is addressing the occasional questions raised by those attending the conference. When the organization encounters matters that cannot be answered immediately, it uses telephones or telegrams, or long-distance calls, free of charge, to quickly investigate.

During the two-month conference period, as many as 9,760 questions were answered, half of which were answered immediately, one-quarter within two hours, and the remaining one-quarter within twenty-four hours. The most distant inquiries, which took the most effort to investigate, were answered within three days at the latest. Previously, elusive and wonderful ideas that could not be found anywhere were now found through this investigation. The general feeling towards the French government and Greater Paris has deepened because of this conference. The effectiveness of the French government's propaganda far outweighs the material pleasures. The highest achievement of our country's old-fashioned "hospitality" is only equivalent to one aspect of "material" assistance. How can it be like the Paris Peace Conference, which emphasizes both the spiritual and the material? The current trend of the world is progressing rapidly. Although "hospitality" is a small matter, if it is not diligently pursued, it can easily fall behind. How can the use of our eyes and ears be relaxed for even a moment?

Switzerland has always maintained a neutral position, mediating between the major and minor countries of the world. The freedom of newspapers and publications has always attracted attention. As for printing, it is particularly exquisite. The most refined printing is for illustrations. LIllustre, a newspaper published in Lausanne, Switzerland, is printed using Rotogravure, which can print 12,000 copies per hour, with three-color gravure illustrations. The illustrations are vivid and lifelike, making it a good model for the latest periodical publications. In 1921, after the First World War, the League of Nations, which was born out of the Paris Peace Conference, gathered representatives from various countries on the shores of Lake Leman. The lakeside newspaper arose in response to the times, widely selecting illustrations of international trends and creating historical archives of world events.

This year, coinciding with the grand peace conference, we see it again in Paris, and a 25th anniversary commemorative publication has been specially compiled. The internal structure of the newspaper is quite detailed. Visitors can start from the bottom floor. The basement is divided into two levels: the lower level is the storage room for rolled paper, and the upper level is the machine room for printing newspapers. Above that is the ground floor with a large entrance and the advertising department. To the left is the manager's office. Above that is the second floor, with the editorial department on the right and the Dactylos (typing room) on the left. Above that is the third floor, with the typesetting room for small samples of typesetting (Conpostiton Typos) on the right and the layout room for combining large samples (Miss en page) on the left. Above that is the fourth floor, which cannot be reached by elevator, with the photography room on the right and the plate-making room and retouching room on the left. The top floor has a rooftop terrace for sightseeing, and to the right is a wine bar for dining. In summary, the entire building, from top to bottom, has the model of a first-class American newspaper building. Readers should not underestimate it because of its small size.

### Interlude of the Jining Campaign

— Our Correspondent Song Shaobo

Fengzhen, October 5th

Generals on the Front Line

The senior generals of the Twelfth War Area do not have the pretentious Hitler-like airs. Except for Commander Fu, the division commanders all have nicknames. Comrades-in-arms use nicknames instead of names, and the officers do not feel insulted but feel very close. They usually live with the soldiers, and in wartime they also stand on the same line with the soldiers to fight. For example, the command position of General Huang Qiwu, commander of the "Lijin" Column, is always within the range of the enemy's artillery fire; General Sun Lanfeng, commander of the "Fuxing" Column, has commanded battles in Bailingmiao, Xinkou, Baotou, Wuyuan, etc. He was seriously wounded in the leg and is nicknamed "Crutch General". In this Jining Campaign, he personally led the cavalry to attack the city before the infantry arrived, in order to avenge the hatred of the Communist army using 50,000 infantry to seize Jining from the hands of the National army's 5,000 elite soldiers after the ceasefire order was issued on January 13th of this year.

Brigadier General Wang Jianzhong, deputy commander of the "Victory" Sub-Column, personally led two companies to break through the city, which is rarely seen in internal warfare; and Lieutenant General Liu Wanchun, deputy commander of the "Fengjin" Column, even went to the position of a platoon to command. In this Jining Campaign, Lieutenant General Liu Wanchun can be said to have traveled all over the mountains outside the city and through the streets inside the city. Whenever he saw a unit faltering, he would run there to persuade the officers and encourage the soldiers. With a deputy commander helping him command the combat mission of a company commander, how could he not win the battle? When the soldiers saw the lieutenant general fighting alongside them, how could they not advance bravely? Brigadier General Guo Jingyun, commander of the "Guoguang" Detachment, personally threw grenades to repel the enemy when the Communist army attacked the command post on the night of the 12th; Brigadier General E Youqi, commander of the "Qingshan" Detachment, always rode on horseback and fired a gun during every charge.

When Commander Fu was besieged in Guisui last year, he was on the front line in Balizhuang, where his overcoat was pierced by a Communist army bullet. After Datong was besieged, he flew alone to encourage the soldiers, and his wing was also hit. During this Jining Campaign, he did not sleep for four days and nights. The senior staff of the Commander's Department all had bloodshot eyes. On the 14th, the Communist army was still outside Jining, engaged in a mixed battle with our chasing troops, and Commander Fu ran to the houses of the people to visit the officers and soldiers and comfort the masses. Although the enemy withdrew from the Datong airfield on the 24th, there were still Communist troops entrenched east of Shaling, and he was the first to fly to Datong to comfort the soldiers guarding the city. This made the soldiers and civilians in Suiyuan and Yanbei feel that "our commander is always standing with us."

What the Executive Group Saw

The Jining Group of the Military Mediation Headquarters was still stored in the city during the Jining Campaign. At the beginning, the Communist army sent troops to closely supervise the American representative O'Quinn, the government representative Yin Hanchu, and the welcoming official Wu Yue of the Twelfth War Area. They pointed their guns at everyone's mouths with a prepared posture, as if the police were guarding prisoners. Therefore, O'Quinn demanded that the American flag be hung on the house of the Executive Group, but was rejected by the Communist army. Later, when the National army broke into the city and Yao Zhe was expelled by us from the "Military Region" headquarters, and he set up the command post under the wall of the Executive Group, he allowed the American flag to be hung on the roof. So that the shells would not fall nearby. Yao Zhe seemed to be following the moon, so he could not help but say that he had benefitted.

After the American flag was hung on the house of the Executive Group, O'Quinn took a telescope to observe from the roof. The heroic performance of many of the attacking troops was seen by this allied officer. Every time the "Victory" Detachment attacked a stronghold, there was always a squad of flag-raising daredevils in front, braving the enemy's machine gun fire and rushing towards the Communist army's stronghold. Like Sun Sikong, the Communist army soldiers were unable to resist. On the afternoon of the 13th, before our army had attacked the Mongolian Bank and the Police Bureau, these two strongholds were already flying the national flag, and two soldiers were smoking Yanghuo while holding machine guns. Later, we conducted an investigation. The warrior standing on the roof of the Mongolian Bank was Liang Chaosheng of the Third Battalion of the "Victory" Detachment, and the commander of the "Jinjin" Column, Chang Mianxu, promised to marry him a wife. The sergeant squad leader Gao Xuechuan of the Eighth Platoon of the First Battalion of the "Victory" Detachment, who was on the roof of the Police Bureau, has decided to change his name to Saijun Wei as a model for all troops.

Lieutenant Colonel O'Quinn is over ninety years old this year and has participated in the First and Second World Wars and the Pacific War, but he has never seen the National army fight so bravely. He said, "Stalingrad is a competition for strongholds, and the Jining Campaign is a competition for homes." This time, the Communist army was unwilling to give up their homes, and the National army desperately drove the Communist army out of their homes. Several times he saw the National army unable to resist, and the situation was about to falter, but at the critical moment, the National army always turned defeat into victory. Therefore, after the Communist army withdrew from Jining, Lieutenant Colonel O'Quinn saw the "Lijin" Column Commander raise his thumb and said, "No wonder General Wedemeyer said that Commander Fu's army can fight. The soldiers of the Twelfth War Area are really top-notch."

Defeated Soldiers Become Powerful Troops

The Communist army is by no means like sheep. When they are being escorted, they will flee as soon as possible. The National army is also not a heavenly soldier who can summon wind and rain. Therefore, in this great victory of the Jining Campaign, we also had many small failures. For example, on the evening of the 11th, the "Yellow River" Detachment faltered, the command post of the "Youth" Detachment was attacked, and the command post of the "Lijin" Column was also affected. The wounded soldiers only saw that our heavy machine guns were taken away by the Communist army, and did not see that the National army later used unlit hand grenades to smash the enemy's bags and regain them. Therefore, they spread these defeats, disrupting the morale of the army. Especially the miscellaneous soldiers such as cooks and grooms spread the news, confusing the reserve troops.

On the afternoon of the 12th, the National army, which was scattered from Luotuowanzi, retreated to the Tuyu area. Supply soldiers and medical vehicles were all over the ravines and mountains. There were more than a thousand scattered soldiers, all running towards Taolin. The rear officers of each unit lost their command ability and could not stop the retreating soldiers from fleeing backwards. The situation was very bad at the time. Coincidentally, Wei Chunmei, the commander of the Second Column of the People's Local Self-Defense Work, led the returning team from eastern Suiyuan to the outskirts of Jining. When the people saw the army retreating, they unceremoniously stopped them with guns. Commander Wei temporarily announced two reception chiefs, gathered them together, and after a speech, led the returning team to reopen the Jining front line.

If these more than 1,000 defeated soldiers had walked to Taolin, I don't know what kind of situation the rear would have been in. But under the supervision of the people, they became a vital force. They were all separated from other units at night, and the National army commanders did not see them losing contact, nor did the Communist army discover that they had left. They were a scattered force when they withdrew from Jining, and an orderly force when they returned to Jining. When the "Guoguang" Detachment was reinforcing from the southwest, they also returned to the camp from the northwest. This made both the enemy and us think that in addition to the "Guoguang" Detachment, there was another detachment in the army. Unexpectedly, these defeated soldiers gave our soldiers unlimited courage and gave the enemy's nerves a great blow in the Jining Campaign.

### Public Trial of Tianjin Corruption Case

— Special Correspondent Li Shaolin

Tianjin Telegram, 6th

Two sensational events have been investigated in Tianjin: one is the corruption case of Army Colonel Liu Naiyi, which has been transferred to the Beiping Military Training Office; the other is the case of the Tianjin Transportation Office of the Public Works Bureau accepting bribes. The actors involved include Wang Xijun, Director of the Public Works Bureau; Yao Zhenli, Director of the Transportation Office; Zhang Xiaochun, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Transportation Office; Zhu Shu'an, Chief of the Treasury Section; Wang Shisheng, Director of the Treasury; Jia Zhongqun, Staff Member; Luo Chengwei, Chief Secretary of the Public Works Bureau; Liu Jingda, Section Chief; and others, as well as Li Changtian, Manager of Dexingshun Coal Shop; Feng Yunshan, Manager of Juxing Printing Bureau; Wang Zhenting, Manager of Yudong Printing Shop; Liu Dianshi, Manager of Decheng Belt Factory, and a total of twelve people who purchased and sold stolen goods. This case was transferred by the investigation team to the Tianjin District Court, and a public prosecution was filed by the Procuratorate. The first hearing was held on the 21st. The trial began at 9:00 AM and lasted until 8:00 PM, with a two-hour break at noon. The defendants and subpoenaed witnesses, a total of 29 people, stood in a semi-circle before the judge's desk, extremely crowded. As many as seven lawyers appeared in court. After 6:00 PM, the courtroom suddenly lost power and was plunged into darkness. Later, bailiffs entered with candles for a night trial. Each defendant was interrogated one by one before the court adjourned. The conviction of the accused remains to be determined after further hearings.

An Account of Rice and Flour Embezzled from the Ministry of Relief

According to the results of the investigation by the investigation team, the District Court's Procuratorate determined that the defendants had committed thirteen counts of crimes: (1) Establishing the Transportation Office of the Public Works Bureau by reorganizing and taking over the enemy's Tianjin Transportation Co., Ltd., borrowing seven million yuan in legal tender from the city's banks in the name of resuming operations, which was jointly embezzled and divided by Wang Xijun, Yao Zhenli, and Zhang Xiaochun; (2) Falsifying account books and receipts for wages, fodder, and office expenses for the former Beiyang Army, with Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun jointly embezzling more than four million yuan in legal tender; (3) Stealing and selling 49 tons of raw coal and 27 tons of coke to Li Changtian, earning over three million five hundred thousand yuan in illicit gains, which were jointly divided by Wang Xijun, Yao Zhenli, and Zhang Xiaochun; (4) Stealing and selling 36 reams of paper to Feng Yunshan and Wang Zhenting, earning 900,000 yuan in legal tender, which was jointly divided by Yao Zhenli, Zhang Xiaochun, Luo Chengwei, and Liu Jingda; (5) Stealing and selling nine boxes of matches, earning over seven million yuan in counterfeit currency, which was divided by Yao Zhenli, Zhang Xiaochun, Zhu Gen'an, Xia Binsheng, Jia Zhongqun, and the warehouse keeper; (6) Stealing and selling sixteen automobile tires to Liu Dianqing, earning over 500,000 yuan in legal tender, with Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun jointly responsible; (7) Stealing and selling three live mules, earning over 200,000 yuan in legal tender, with Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun jointly responsible; (8) Stealing and selling over one thousand bags of flour, with Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun responsible; (9) Wang Xijun embezzled over ten bags of flour, eighty catties of rice, matches, sugar, and other items; (10) Yao Zhenli embezzled four hundred catties of flour, two hundred catties of rice, matches, cigarettes, and other items; (11) Luo Chengwei and Liu Jingda jointly profited from five bags of flour; (12) Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun altered the original register of the enemy's Tianjin Transportation Co., Ltd., in an attempt to conceal the investigation; (13) Five hundred bags of flour, rubber tires, snowmobiles, and other items in the warehouse were not listed in the handover receipts to the customs.

Deceptive Confessions, Wang Xijun Denies Receiving Bribes

During the court hearing, except for Zhu Shu'an, Jia Zhongqun, and Liu Dianqing, whose whereabouts were unknown, the remaining nine defendants were escorted to court at the same time for questioning. Wang Xijun, 36 years old, testified that he had studied at London University in England and Harvard University in the United States. He was appointed Director of the Tianjin Public Works Bureau on October 2nd of last year and took over the former Tianjin Transportation Co., Ltd. on November 20th, entrusting Yao Zhenli to handle the matter on his behalf. Regarding the Municipal Government's previous secret report ordering the Public Works Bureau to investigate Yao Zhenli's corruption, and the Public Works Bureau's reply that there was no corruption, Wang claimed that it was handled entirely by the Chief Secretary Luo Chengwei. He also flatly denied all allegations of dividing and embezzling received materials, claiming that he had not received them or knew about them, even though Zhang Xiaochun's "black ledger" recorded each time money and goods were delivered to him. Witnesses testified that the goods were delivered to his residence and taken away by servants.

Full of Lies, Zhang Xiaochun Exposed Many Flaws

The black ledgers, fake receipts, and original registers found by the investigation team were all seized from Zhang Xiaochun's desk. Therefore, when questioning this 54-year-old man, Zhang Xiaochun, although he repeatedly denied the charges, he had no way to escape the accusations, and many flaws were exposed, making him look ridiculous. Not only did the audience in the gallery burst into laughter, but even the presiding judge covered his mouth and chuckled. When the judge showed him the original register that had been altered and the original register that had not been altered, Zhang stammered, "There—there isn't much difference." When his black ledger was shown, Zhang said that it was not a ledger but a plan he made when he had nothing to do. The judge said that the ledger stated that the actual expenditure was over two million yuan, but the reimbursement was over seven million yuan, and there were falsified receipts. How could that be called a plan? Why was there a surplus of over five million yuan? He then confessed that it was for future public expenditures. The judge asked where such a reimbursement method existed. He replied, "It was not actually reimbursed." When asked if the millions of yuan listed on the ledger for a certain person were the proceeds from selling materials, he confessed, "That wasn't a division, but a subsidy for resettlement expenses." Regarding the payment of 1.6 million yuan for coal to Wang Xijun listed on the ledger, he confessed that it had already been recovered. When asked why it was not recorded on the mine's ledger, he confessed, "I probably forgot." The judge ridiculed him, saying, "Only you can understand this kind of ledger." As for the sale of mules, witnesses testified that they were live mules. When asked why live mules were recorded as dead mules, he confessed, "I only found out later that they were still alive when they were sold." Regarding the sale of various materials, he confessed that he had reported everything to Yao Zhenli. Regarding the matter of forging store seals, he claimed that they were difficult to find when he took over. Regarding the alteration of the original register, he blamed the Treasury Section. The corrupt account was repeatedly questioned by the judge until he was speechless.

Escorted from Shenyang to Tianjin, Yao Zhenli's Face Full of Cunning

Yao Zhenli fled to Qingyang before the investigation team came to Tianjin. After the case was exposed, he was arrested and brought to Tianjin. Yao, 51 years old, from Shenyang, had a cunning look on his face and gave deceptive confessions. The judge asked if Zhang Xiaochun said that he had reported everything to you regarding the sale of various materials. He confessed that the Transportation Office had no funds and had to find ways to spend money, so he had told Zhang that anything that could be bought back could be sold. He was also asked why the materials he received did not match the original register and the numbers handed over to the customs. He confessed, "I am responsible for what I received, but the register was made in October, and it was two months before I took over. Many items were stolen during that time." Regarding the division and sale of coal, paper, and the money received, Yao claimed, "I don't know, there is no such thing." Regarding the embezzlement of rice and flour, he claimed that they were rations. During the interrogation of the defendants, the judge repeatedly summoned witnesses to prove the crimes of the defendants. When the court adjourned, the judge announced that the trial would be adjourned and heard again at a later date. The prisoners were sent back to jail, and the seven lawyers left the courtroom with an almost listening attitude, because even the lawyers had been amused by Zhang Xiaochun's contradictory confessions, no different from the audience. This live drama of corruption was temporarily adjourned.

### Taking Pride in Being an Industrialist

Since China is embarking on the path of industrialization, it must first have industrialists who are dedicated to hard work. At present, being an industrialist is not easy, because he must have a strong will, a spirit of forging ahead, and make constant efforts in construction regardless of all difficulties.

Recently, Mr. Fu Jiajun and Mr. Wang Wei of the Xinguang Underwear Factory made a brief seven-day stop in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, where they were warmly welcomed by the local industrial circles. All newspapers used large headlines to report their arrival in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. This can be said to be the concern of compatriots for the industrial circles in Shanghai, and it can also illustrate that being an industrialist is the most glorious thing.

If China's industrialists all take pride in being industrialists and work hard in construction, then it will be of considerable benefit to the progress of industry.

### Problems of China's Textile Industry

— Deng Shaoqiu

The occurrence of a thing or a phenomenon must have a crux to it. In order to remedy or promote the occurrence of this thing or phenomenon, we must first understand the cause of the occurrence of this thing or phenomenon, that is, to thoroughly understand the crux of its occurrence. Only then can we find appropriate remedies by prescribing the right medicine. Similarly, in order to revive China's textile industry, we must thoroughly understand the factors of the rise and fall of the textile industry and the crux of its occurrence, and then seek remedies from the factors and crux obtained.

Now, let us first summarize some of the crux of the rise and fall of China's textile industry based on the past (see the first paragraph) development process of China's textile industry:——

(A) Regarding the problems of the textile industry itself:

(1) Machine problems.

(2) Equipment issues.

(3) Management issues.

(4) Personnel issues.

(5) Funding issues.

(B) Regarding other issues:

(1) National economic situation.

(2) The situation of the production and supply of textile raw materials.

The tool for the textile industry to compete is machinery, and in order to achieve the goal of winning the competition, the first requirement is the excellence of the machinery. However, most of the machinery in the textile factories in our country is 20 years old. Only a very small number of newly built textile factories have relatively new machinery. In addition, there are also a few factories that have been reorganized or renovated from old machines. This is the biggest weakness of our textile factories. Imagine competing with foreign factories that have new machinery with outdated machinery. How can we win?

Secondly, the equipment of the factory can also be said to be a prerequisite for a good factory. Good equipment leads to good work and efficiency. This is almost a natural law, but in the past, the equipment of our factories was very simple and was not well taken care of. All testing instruments, transportation equipment, etc. were all simple and crude. In recent years, due to the recession in the textile industry, all the simple equipment has not only not been improved, but has become even more barren. As a result, the resulting products cannot achieve good results.

The quality of work technology and the quality of talents also have a great mutual relationship, but in the past, various factories did not pay much attention to the issue of personnel selection. Most of the staff were introduced to the factory by relatives and friends. Therefore, how is this person's work skills? What about textile knowledge? Most of them are ignored and unquestioned, and a common phenomenon in Chinese factories is - various factions are born in the factory, so the evil trend of "intrigue, deception, and cunning" is promoted, which not only cannot promote the factory's own future prosperity, but instead promotes the factory's early closure. Even self-preservation cannot be talked about, so how can we talk about competition?

Funds are as important to a factory as blood is to life. If blood does not circulate, people cannot survive. If funds do not circulate smoothly, the factory will be difficult to exist. Therefore, to develop a factory, you must first have sufficient funds. However, in the past, the various textile factories in our country prepared too little working capital, so that once they encountered sluggish sales or too much inventory, they had to stop work and reduce production, resulting in great losses. However, when sales are extremely smooth, they feel that supply cannot meet demand. This is a common phenomenon in general factories in our country in the past, and how can this kind of "grabbing Peter to pay Paul" promote the factory's own business!

However, the main reason for the decline of the textile industry in the past was due to improper management by the factory, but the weak national economy, the withering of the rural areas, and the improper supply of raw materials were not the reasons why the textile industry could not prosper. Indeed, what various factories felt extremely painful in the past was the deformed phenomenon of "stagnant sales" and "expensive raw materials and cheap products." To eliminate this deformed phenomenon, we can only stabilize the national economy and prosper the rural areas. At the same time, the production and transportation of textile raw materials must also be well controlled. Otherwise, it will never be eliminated.

### Research on Colors in Factories

— Lin Han

Translated from "Scientific American" September issue

The use of colors in factories is now becoming a strong trend. Because it has been proven that the meticulous selection of colors in industry can improve the visual environment, thereby increasing production; in addition, it can also improve the atmosphere, increase safety, and facilitate factory management.

In fact, the concept of carefully using colors in factories is not new. Magazines have published articles on it almost ten years ago, and it is widely used today. For example, the National Safety News magazine published in the United States in 1937 published the following passage: "In the maintenance projects in recent times, colors with high reflectance other than white are often used, because they not only diffuse light, but also increase the excitement of employees. Color makes people happy, and its effect on workers is no less than the effect of attractively colored goods on customers. Now, the effectiveness of improving the atmosphere of factories and the good ideas of employees by the application of colors is increasing." "Machines with bright colors are easier to keep clean. In practice, it is now gradually tending to paint machines with a gentle Prussian blue, so that workers can see more easily and reduce the strain on their eyes, even when staring at machine movements for a long time." Although the application of colors in industry has made great progress since this passage was written, it is still equally applicable today. It actually represents the cornerstone of the history of industrial colors.

Increase production

The first thing to consider when using colors in industry is to increase production. The proper selection of colors can reduce the glare of walls and ceilings and improve the visual environment. When the colors on the machine are brighter, the light under the work and the light in the environment can be more average, which is a necessary condition for maintaining extreme vision.

The results of long-term research on psychological factors have proven that when the light at work is five times the light in the environment, the ability to see is reduced to 77% of normal. Conversely, if the light in the environment is five times the light at work, the ability to see is reduced to 44%. It is most appropriate when the light in the environment and the light at work are roughly the same. This situation can be achieved if the color is chosen appropriately. A factory in the southern United States that manufactures conduit fittings reported that a study showed that the output of its workers was reduced by one-third in the morning and about one-tenth in the afternoon. After repainting the colors in the factory, the output did not decrease even when working until 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.

Improve the atmosphere

Almost as important as the above is the role of colors in creating an atmosphere. Because workers in factories often spend most of their time in the factory, there should be a reasonable, happy, and attractive atmosphere around them. It has been proven that the efficiency of employees often increases due to constant changes in the environment or work. This change can be carried out by increasing wages, changing work, or changing the form of a new factory. In addition, painting the walls, ceilings, and machines with new colors is also a way to improve the atmosphere.

Cleanliness and safety

From a practical point of view, experience tells us that when machines, walls, and ceilings are painted with attractive colors, workers will keep this factory cleaner. Because workers will feel very proud of the beauty of their environment and will continue to maintain it. In this way, the cost of maintenance will not only not increase, but will be reduced instead.

The contribution of colors to safety is not small. According to the statistics of a factory, the number of individual injuries was reduced by 40% after the modern color work was done well. As long as the lighting is improved, colors will make a factory safer. Westinghouse engineers say their philosophy is to make "every danger visible." When dangerous parts are marked with striking colors, when continuous seams are marked with obvious boundaries, and when dark places and corridors are brightened with highly reflective colors, the safety index of this factory will be significantly increased.

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

Employee Psychology

If the work we do requires great observation, such as manufacturing watches, light bulbs, etc., then the tests we need to do should be aimed at observation.

The implementation of this test can be divided into two types. One is to test the existing employees. After checking the effect of the test, we can know what kind of training they need. The other type of test must be passed when hiring employees.

Speaking of this, we can easily think that general Chinese enterprises do not have detailed testing work when hiring employees. If they are hiring an office clerk, then at most they will ask him to write an article in Chinese or English. In places where chemistry or arithmetic is needed, then they will ask a few exam questions about chemistry or arithmetic, and then add an oral test and physical examination. As for the person's character, they can only observe some during the oral test, but how can the person in charge of the exam see a person's character in a few minutes? If it is in a factory, then hiring workers will not have strict tests either. Sometimes the foreman is responsible for finding suitable workers to take on the work.

There is also a bad habit among Chinese people, which is a great obstacle to the operation of business organizations, that is, hiring private individuals or using recommendations. As a result, people are generally embarrassed to offend others, and many rules are difficult to implement. In many larger enterprises, there are personnel departments (or personnel management committees) that specialize in managing personnel matters. Under this circumstance, the competent authorities can avoid many difficulties, because when relatives and friends recommend employees, they can notify the personnel department to handle it. In fact, it can also receive better work efficiency.

When testing, the following points should be studied in terms of psychology. The tests can also be based on the following points as standards, and can be increased or decreased in combination with the work done: (1) honesty, (2) loyalty, (3) concentration, (4) cooperation with colleagues, (5) ambition, (6) creativity, (7) thoroughness in doing things, (8) agility, (9) management talent, (10) memory.

Each point will be discussed in detail next time.

### The Genius Woman Poet of Africa: A Biography of Phillis Wheatley

— Lu Shixiong

Throughout history, the success of poets has often been attributed to their environment and material resources, whether growing up in a land of picturesque mountains and clear waters or emerging from a family with a strong scholarly tradition. At the very least, they had access to some form of education, enabling them to observe nature and generate emotions, express themselves through beautiful language, and give voice to their inner thoughts through poetry. Therefore, while poets were not necessarily from wealthy and idle classes, they were generally able to live a comfortable life.

Now, the female poet I want to talk about, "Phillis Wheatley," lacked all the above qualifications, yet she became a poet of her generation in England and America. The background of this female poet was that of a very pitiable person. She was born in Senegal, Africa. In 1761, she was brought to Boston, USA, on a slave ship and sold. A tailor named "Wheatley" bought her to serve his ailing wife. "Phillis Wheatley's" original name was "Phillis." Because she was sold into the "Wheatley" tailor's family, she added "Wheatley" to her name. As she was kidnapped and sold at a young age, she was also unsure of her age, estimating it to be between 1753 and 1754. Although this female poet was like a wildflower blooming in a desolate land, her temperament was gentle and docile, intelligent and quick-witted, and innocent and lively, making her very endearing. Therefore, she was well-liked by the younger members of the tailor's family. The children had no concept of master and servant, so they mingled together, living a very democratic life.

At that time, although "Phillis Wheatley" performed humble tasks, her budding interest in literature naturally emerged without anyone's instruction. In her spare time, she would often take charcoal and scribble on the walls, trying to write. At that time, she couldn't recognize a single character. When the mistress of the house saw this, she was not only without blame but also amazed by her talent for learning, so she had her study with the mistress's daughter. In just under a year and a half, "Phillis Wheatley" was already able to recite and understand the most difficult and profound passages in the Bible.

"Phillis Wheatley" lit a lamp at night after work to read and write. With her extraordinary talent, she was able to write fluent English by the age of eight. At the same time, because of her kind personality, like a lamb, many female friends formed literary connections with her, and letters were frequently exchanged. Her daily writing, from a young age, was not in the style of rigid, lengthy articles. She loved to write short, fragmented pieces. Her works were often rich in poetic sentiment. At the young age of fourteen, she was already able to compose very beautiful poems, and her works were comparable to those of the great English poets. She immersed herself in the study of ancient Greek and Latin poetry. In a short poem she composed about "Washington," there was a strong resemblance to the style of the great Roman poet "Virgil."

When "Phillis Wheatley" was nineteen, her unique creations and other works were acutely emotional, with profound, intense, sharp, delicate, and passionate descriptions, excelling in all aspects. Her output was prolific and widely circulated. In the mid-eighteenth century, she was known as the Poet Laureate of Boston. The extent of her reputation can be imagined. In addition, she was well-versed in astronomy, geography, Eastern history, and various classics. Therefore, her position in the academic world at that time was also renowned, ranking among the first-class scholars. Once, because she was ill, the doctor advised her to take a sea voyage, so she sailed to London. Due to her poetic fame, she received a warm welcome from the local mayor, nobles, and celebrities while in London. During the eighteenth century, feudal ideas in Europe were quite strong, and class distinctions were deeply entrenched. However, "Phillis Wheatley," with her background as an African female slave, received preferential treatment from the dignitaries, which was as difficult as ascending to heaven. The status of poets and the power of literature are truly extraordinary! "Phillis Wheatley's" husband was named "John Peters." This man had worked as a barber and grocer and had also studied law. Because he was intelligent, he knew a little about everything. People even called him Dr. Peters. His temperament was strangely lazy, and he achieved nothing. Therefore, when this female poet married him, it was, if not like a phoenix following a crow, at least an unhappy and unpleasant union. She had three children, all of whom died prematurely. The couple spent few years together before John Peters died. "Phillis Wheatley," in the midst of cruel fate and sorrowful emotions, also shortened her lifespan and died on December 5, 1784, at the age of about thirty-one.

Looking back on "Phillis Wheatley's" life, she never received a formal education, but she became a great poet admired throughout history. This was partly due to her unique talent and partly due to her own diligent study. The American Young Women's Christian Association recently wrote an article praising this great female poet in commemoration. The author translates her biography with the humble intention of encouraging both myself and out-of-school youth!

### Flowing Clouds and Running Water

— Xu Shiqi

The creation of scenery in traditional Chinese painting emphasizes ethereal vastness and expresses secluded feelings. It has a considerable distance from the realization of life's realm. The artist's perception of natural space and color is both spiritually connected and formally detached, possessing his personal style and artistic conception. The three masters, Jian Jiang, Shi Tao, and Qu Shan, all painted Mount Huang, each depicting its majestic and secluded landscapes, and each capturing the view of flowing clouds and running water. Qu Shan's portrayal of pine trees is like that of a reclusive hermit, proud and aloof. Shi Tao's splashed ink creates a landscape of smoky clouds within a small space, conveying a myriad of appearances. Jian Jiang's writing is pure, unique, cold, and elegant, like an orchid growing in a secluded valley, devoid of any artificiality, completely unpolluted.

Recently, I observed Mr. He Tianjian's landscape paintings. He learns from nature but possesses a unique understanding, creating works that are majestic, profound, simple, and independent. He corrects the mediocre and imitative style of modern Jiangnan artists, not confined by objects, revering what he values, and able to express his inner spirit. His monumental works, such as "Map of Restored Rivers and Mountains," "Map of Mountain Passes," and "Deep in Mount Huang," are ingeniously conceived, magnificent, and exquisitely crafted. He is full of imagination and possesses the spirit of a poet, using brush and ink to express his suppressed emotions. The more he explores, the more skillful he becomes (interpreting "exhaustively searching and widely collecting"), rather than becoming skillful only after becoming impoverished.

"There is this realm in the heart, not necessarily existing in the world. There is this realm under the brush, not necessarily existing in ancient times." His attitude towards artistic creation can be grasped through these few words. "Perilous Cliffs and Flying Waterfalls," "Evening Mist at Mountain Passes," "Autumn Dawn at Stone Gate of Mount Hui," a total of over two hundred pieces, "The heart is like a vast valley storing boundless things, freely searching for ten thousand unique wonders; this is also a landscape in the chest, people will suspect it is the autumn of Jianmen." This is his inscription. Ten years of meticulous work are gathered in one place. I personally appreciate it and express it with joy, to inform the connoisseurs in Shanghai today, where the spirit is exhausted and the art scene is barren.

### Memorandum of Stupid Things

— By Carnegie, Translated by Shi Xiaoyun

"There are three hardest things: steel, diamonds, and knowing yourself."

(The author of this article, Dale Carnegie, is a contemporary American expert on self-cultivation and dealing with people. His articles are vivid and fluent, deeply loved by the public. Many of his works have been translated into Chinese. This article was originally published in the October issue of Your Life magazine. The author's method of self-cultivation is very worthy of our emulation).

In my personal briefcase, I always keep a small notebook: Memorandum of Stupid Things. It records many of the stupid things I have done. Month after month passes, I have never stopped or paused. Sometimes I instruct my secretary to record them for me, but some things are so stupid that I am afraid he will laugh at me, so I usually copy them myself.

I prepared the "Memorandum of Stupid Things" fifteen years ago. In these long years, if I could completely and honestly record my stupid things, then my briefcase would have burst open long ago. – Indeed, as Hubbard said, "Everyone is a fool for at least five minutes a day, intelligence is completely useless at that time."

Every time I reread these records, I always get great inspiration and assistance. Its value is far beyond any of King Solomon's proverbs. It helped me solve one of the biggest problems: the method of self-control.

On July 31, 1944, a celebrity died in a drugstore in New York. His name was Howard, and his death shocked the entire market because he was a leader in American finance.

I am very familiar with him. He used to be a member of my public speaking class. He had not received a formal education. His career began as a clerk in a village store. Later, he worked late at Carnegie Steel Company, but twenty-two years later, he was the manager of United States Steel Corporation (this is the world's largest steel company, reorganized from Carnegie Company—translator). He already had status and power.

One night, he lectured in our public speaking class. In his words, he revealed one of the reasons for his success.

"For many years, I have always kept a memorandum recording my daily actions. On Saturday nights, I have a time for self-examination. During this time, I review the work of the past week."

"After dinner, I leave the dining room alone, open the memorandum, and recall the meetings, discussions, and gatherings of the week. I ask myself: What mistakes have I made? What valuable things have I done? – What methods can I use to make myself more successful?"

"Sometimes this recollection makes me feel deeply unhappy. Sometimes I am even shocked by the stupid things I have done. Of course, year after year, these stupid things gradually decrease. Now I am quite satisfied with my progress. This method of self-examination has really benefited me infinitely."

Howard's method was probably learned from writing to Franklin. The only difference is that Franklin reviewed himself every night, not necessarily on the weekend. He found that he had thirteen serious shortcomings, three of which were: wasting time, nitpicking, and liking to argue with people.

He knew very well that if he did not remove these defects, he would never have greater achievements. So at the beginning of each week, he would choose one of the shortcomings to fight for a week. The next week, he would challenge another shortcoming. By the time the Sunday bell rang, he had overcome his opponent.

Franklin continued such battles for two years, no wonder he succeeded as a great man beloved by generations. But he wrote: "There are three hardest and most difficult things: steel, diamonds, and knowing yourself."

Suppose someone scolds you as a "fool"—what will you do? Angry? Scold back? Or fight? Here is a story of Lincoln.

Stanton was Lincoln's chief of staff. Once, he angrily scolded Lincoln as a complete "blockhead" because the president signed a troop withdrawal treaty to please a selfish politician. This was a serious mistake. Stanton refused the order.

When Lincoln learned of this, he said very calmly: "If Stanton really scolded me as a fool, then I must be a fool. He never makes mistakes. Let me review it again."

Lincoln went to see Stanton. He was persuaded by Stanton, so he canceled the order. Lincoln always welcomed serious and sincere comments very much.

We should also welcome such accusations because we really cannot guarantee that three-quarters of what we do is right. Therefore, President Roosevelt once said such words in the White House, and Einstein did not dare to have such expectations. He said that ninety-nine out of his hundred conclusions were often wrong! What is there to be ashamed of about our stupid things and worth hiding without correcting?

Memories of Xiashi

If I hadn't heard the passengers in the car talking to each other that this was "Xiashi," I would have suspected that what I was seeing was definitely not the Xiashi town I had visited before. However, then I saw a mountain peak with a pagoda on top, and like the surrounding area, the scene was very desolate. I remembered more than ten years ago when I went from Hangzhou to Shanghai and got off the bus here to see my late brother. Originally, Xiashi had no position on the map, and there were four places with the same name: Shilu Gorge, which hinders the river crossing in Jinji, Yellow River, is called Xiashi, and the northern path of the Huai River through the mountain gorge is called Xiashi, as well as the Xiashi Pass in Henan. This place is neither a river nor a Huai River, but only the confluence of the Qiantang River's tributaries, perhaps resembling the form of a water gorge, and also being the first town of Hangzhou, it has become a hub for merchants. Therefore, the Second District Business Tax Bureau of Zhejiang Province was located in Xiashi, which was my late brother's former post. At that time, there were indeed many masts at the mouth of the water. My late brother accompanied me for an entire evening, and we climbed the mountain peak, listening to the distant bell sounds, lingering for a long time. Now, after revisiting it more than ten years later, Xiashi is so desolate that I don't recognize it. Withered grass, dilapidated walls, and not a single sail in sight. Where is the first town of our Zhejiang? Of course, it is not easy to recover in just one year. Moreover, the more places where industry and commerce compete, the deeper they have suffered from enemy destruction. And it has been many years since my late brother's death. Following Wu Jizha's words: "The bones and flesh return to the earth, that is fate, but the soul and spirit go everywhere," my late brother died in the chaos of war, and his bones were buried in a foreign land in chaos. "A mass of depression in the chest is difficult to call for wine, a covering of mountains and rivers is temporarily stopped." I remember singing this elegy, and my mood became even more gloomy. Looking at the old mountain peak, I don't know its name, I don't know if it is called Shenshan? (According to Shenshan, Shen Jing of the Song Dynasty was buried northeast of Haining)

Lonely Tower of Shenshan Watches Floating Clouds
Faint Spirit Wind, Blurred Sight
Traveling Alone Again, I Too Am Old
Where Is the White-Clothed Man Crying at Pigeon Plain?

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 89

— Ye Jingfeng

And since he risked his life for this trip, it would be too unreasonable not to leave a souvenir. Now back to the original topic, Brother Hu wanted to eliminate the root of the evil of the Tongxian pseudo-autonomous region, Yin Ni. If he hadn't killed that Sasaki Gen, he might have tried it with plenty of time. Now even searching for where he is hiding is difficult. This goal can only be temporarily abandoned.

Such huge military equipment must contain a huge amount of ammunition. If he could find it, it would not be difficult to destroy some of it; but when he just discovered the power generation room, he realized that there were many basements here, and they must be large-scale buildings. However, where to start exploring in a short time? This plan also had to be abandoned. Another option was to set a fire and burn down one or two of these large buildings, which would serve as a warning to the arrogant Japanese army, but none of the buildings he had seen were made of cement and steel. What could they use to burn them down? This was also a fantasy.

These gasoline drums, he was just afraid they were used empty drums, otherwise, there would be an article to do. Thinking of this, he explained to Brother Hu, to check those round drums first. They explored forward one in front of the other as before; in nine minutes, they reached their destination. At a glance, he could see that this was a gasoline terminal. In addition to the piles of oil drums, there were also many pressurized pump devices for refueling. Looking north in a row, he couldn't see clearly, but estimated that there were at least about twenty or thirty of them. He tried knocking on the oil drums, and they were indeed full of oil.

He further inspected the ground, which was paved with cement; needless to say, it must be a very strong underground oil pool. In a short time, and without tools, there was no way to move it. Behind the oil drums, separated by five or six zhang, was piled a coal ridge, stretching north, he didn't know how long. When they reached the foot of this coal pile, they measured the top of the pile, estimating it to be at least four or five zhang high. Fortunately, the slope of the coal pile was not very steep, and it was all piled up with large coal blocks, making it easy to climb. He told Brother Hu to go to the top of the pile first to see the situation; because they wanted to start working here, they had to understand the local situation first, so they could avoid it if there was an alarm. He hoped that this place was like the east side, with roads, forests, stone walls, and even a small stream outside the walls.

When Brother Hu heard him tell him to go up the coal pile to observe, he just answered softly and, like an ape, used his hands and feet together, and quickly reached the top of the pile and lay there. He was estimating what method should be used to destroy these gasoline drums when he suddenly heard a soft hiss, Brother Hu gave the alarm. He ducked and looked in the direction where Brother Hu was lying, and saw Brother Hu waving at him, telling him to come up.

Was this area of coal ridges really just piled with coal blocks? That was far from the truth. He felt that these coal blocks were piled too neatly along the slope of the coal pile, making it inevitably suspicious. Just as he reached the top, Brother Hu gestured, pointing to the slope to the west and quietly said, "Look!..." This place could be said to be completely dark, the clouds in the sky were extremely low, and the pile was full of coal blocks. What was he supposed to look at? But Brother Hu's pair of night owl eyes must have seen something.

At this time, Brother Hu had already gone down the western coal slope. So he followed his route. Just as he got down to two-thirds of the way, he suddenly found a wide groove indented on the side of his foot. Straining his eyes, he took a closer look and gradually distinguished it. This groove was actually a neat gun emplacement, with most of the gun barrel buried in the coal pile, but the muzzle was pointing west, slightly southwest. Wasn't that southwest point the area around Beiping?

### Ramblings by Lamplight

— Shaofu

Chinese people who work for foreigners, including foreign firms, tram companies, ordinary shops, etc., generally harbor some resentment towards their superiors; this resentment is more fully expressed as patriotic fervor during strikes, which is quite touching to onlookers. However, when you are riding the tram, paying your water and electricity bills, or shopping in foreign stores, they put on a "quasi-foreigner" face, repeatedly saying: "Chinese people are always making a mess, so annoying!"

Amidst the voices of increased donations, taxes, prices, and a sluggish market, the authorities repeatedly deny the rumors, saying: "There is absolutely no such thing as issuing Sun Yat-sen notes. It is probably caused by the sensitive speculation of some merchants." From this, we can see a kind of hope among the merchants in despair; but as the recent economic situation has developed, after prominent figures in the business community make the usual pronouncements, they shake their heads and say: "We have no hope at all!"

These past two days, the High Procuratorate is investigating and interrogating "pro-Japanese Chinese film" actors who defected to the enemy. However, reports say that Zhang Shankun, the boss of "pro-Japanese Chinese film," is still living comfortably in Hong Kong, managing several private film companies, and even sent people to Shanghai and other places to invite actors; it is said that he is able to be so carefree entirely due to the protection of "a certain dignitary." Since the dignitary can bestow favors on those who are left behind, why not simply grant amnesty to those charming "stars" as well, allowing their boss and colleagues to cooperate again, singing and dancing in peace, so that "Spring River" no longer "harbors regret," and the dignitary will be "eternally famous!"

Shanghai has been very energetic these past few months: starting with the enthusiastic election of Miss Shanghai, followed by mourning the death of the panda, opposing the import of merchant ships with the Japanese flag, the opening of the chrysanthemum exhibition, and up to the recent announcement by the Urban Planning Committee that Shanghai will become the world's largest city, our hearts are filled with light and excitement. But now, when we walk on the streets, there are still many places that are full of holes and garbage; however, dreaming of the beauty of "Shanghai soon becoming the largest city," we seem to have become very forgetful again!

### Bayer Trademark vs. Zhang Tianshi's "Magic Talisman"

— Mamo

Among the enemy assets received after the victory, in addition to those originally belonging to Japanese residents and soldiers, the assets of German merchants, such as "Defu's" pigments and dyes, and "Bayer's" Western medicines, etc., can probably be listed as the second largest number. However, since they are inventory, no matter how much there is, there will eventually be a day when they are sold out. After a year of continuous bidding for "Bayer" pharmaceuticals, the newspapers recently said that the authorities, seeing that the inventory is about to run out, are considering the issue of using the "Bayer" trademark rights. At first, it was said that it would be reserved for use by the government or government-run institutions, but recently it has been said that it is being considered to be given to the private sector. However, the question is not who will use it, but how it should be used and whether it should be used at all.

It is a fact that the "Bayer" trademark has strong credibility and a wide market in China. It is not an exaggeration to say that no Western medicine merchant in China has surpassed it in the past century. However, a trademark is just a symbol. In the past, the "Bayer" trademark was merely a mark of its excellent, fresh, and reliable technology, raw materials, and equipment. "Bayer" does not use its trademark like Zhang Tianshi uses a magic talisman to cure people's diseases.

Moreover, today, the original research and technical personnel of the German "Bayer" have long been recruited by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, respectively, and the "Bayer" raw materials stored in Shanghai have been used up. Now, there is no hope of importing them from Germany again, and the original assembly equipment is old and broken and can only be supplemented locally. In short, the "Bayer" in China and the disintegrated "Bayer" in Germany will be difficult to connect tightly in the future.

Then, isn't the so-called "trademark usage right" just the five letters "BAYER"?

I think: For example, if "Bayer" has a special method for manufacturing "aspirin," then wouldn't it be great for the government to publicly grant it to the Chinese new medicine industry at no cost? And if (in fact, it's not "if") China is already able to make equally good "aspirin" on its own, then why must Chinese goods be launched on the market under the Bayer trademark? Is it possible to increase "credit" by signing in foreign languages on Chinese banknotes? Don't forget: "No science, no national defense," and under this principle, this clearly includes: "No pharmaceutical industry, no national defense," of course, "aspirin" is a military necessity in war! Should we encourage Chinese people to manufacture it? Or should we use foreign trademarks to suppress the budding of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry?

The question not only includes the establishment of China's medical and pharmaceutical industry but also includes the establishment of Chinese people's self-confidence and self-esteem!

Grain Administration in Jiangxi Province

### It's Better to Work in Grain Management Than Politics

— Xiaotian

"It's better to work in grain management than politics." This saying was most prevalent among the people in the rear areas during the War of Resistance. Unexpectedly, the joke "It's better to work in grain management than politics" is also prevailing in Jiangxi today. This is indeed a strange phenomenon in our country.

Since Cheng Maoxing, the director of the Jiangxi Provincial Farmland and Grain Administration, committed suicide, followed by the case on the 29th of last month where Zou Bingnan, the head of the Xinyu Lianzhi station of the Gan Provincial Storage and Transportation Office, drowned himself in the Zhang River (as reported in the Xin Kai Bao on the 7th), it was because Station Chief Zou had embezzled and owed more than 40,000 dan of surplus grain. Unable to repay this huge amount (estimated to be over 70 million yuan at the current price), and with government grain inspectors pressing him relentlessly, he chose death to repay his debt. It's quite telling about the grain administration in Jiangxi that a small station chief could embezzle over 40,000 dan of surplus grain. I cannot help but sigh for the politics of saving the country!

Originally, Jiangxi had already been impoverished and exhausted after six years of bandit suppression and eight years of the War of Resistance. Although the National Government had ordered the exemption of farmland taxes this year, which is certainly something to be grateful for, the disguised grain levies, military grain levies, and prisoner grain levies have not alleviated the suffering of the people. They are like sharp blades aimed at the dying populace. Corrupt officials manipulate the system from top to bottom, and cases of illegal sales emerge endlessly. The so-called storage station chiefs and warehouse directors are all wealthy, using the people's hard-earned money for extravagant and licentious pleasures. Hence, the joke "It's better to work in grain management than politics, and it's better to be a prostitute than to work in grain management" came into being.

Life Sketches

### Beyond Money

— Li Baozhen

Waiting in vain for the trolleybus on Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road, I hailed a pedicab. I specified a round trip to Caojiadu for 5,000 yuan in legal tender. Coincidentally, another young woman who couldn't squeeze onto the trolleybus also needed to go to Gordon Road. Since I had already chartered the pedicab for a round trip, I invited her to join me. However, the driver demanded an extra 2,000 yuan on top of the 5,000. The young woman naturally refused, and they started yelling at each other. In the end, she jumped out, leaving me to go alone. I couldn't help but feel a bit worried about this driver's temper. Not long after, another pedicab driver behind us accidentally broke his canopy. He got out of the pedicab to take a look, drove for a while, and finally got out again, grabbed the other driver, and berated him severely. Only after the passersby intervened did he stop. I felt even more apprehensive about his temper.

I waited for quite some time in Caojiadu and then waited for a long time at Hongren Hospital. Finally, he asked me to increase the fare by 2,000 yuan, and I immediately agreed to add 1,000. Then I asked him about his circumstances. He said that renting a pedicab cost 4,000 yuan per eight-hour shift, and buying one cost 1.5 million, which he couldn't afford. As he lamented his plight, his face softened, his eyes became gentler, and it seemed that my value in his eyes had also changed. Because it was lunchtime, I asked him to take me to the Da Zhonghua Restaurant, paid him the full 6,000 yuan, and suggested, "I'm going upstairs to eat now and will be down in 20 minutes. Didn't you say you haven't eaten? Go eat something too. After you're done, can you take me to the Bund? But if you have a good fare, go ahead and take it; don't wait for me."

To my surprise and delight, he was indeed sitting there waiting for me. And he seemed very happy to pull me away. When we arrived at the Bund, I waited at the Bank of Communications for ten minutes before he took me to Jardine House. I handed him 1,000 yuan, and he accepted it without a word.

I think I know why his attitude changed. When he was cursing and shouting, it was his expression of struggling to survive. He wanted to live, so he wanted money—by any means necessary. But once he realized that there are things in the world beyond money—a little sympathy, a little sincerity, a little politeness, and a little kindness—he entered the cultural era from the savage era. The instinct for self-defense was no longer needed, replaced by gentleness and even the joy of work. My exhausted compatriots, how I wish I possessed the wealth of the world so that each of you wouldn't have to suffer, and how I wish each of you could live in selfless love!

### Myth

— Qian Fanfu

Reading the news lately feels like reading mythology.

The myth arises in Guangzhou: when discovered, it was a "golden brick"; when tested, it turned into a "copper brick"; recently, when publicly auctioned, it was renamed "gold brick."

In the past, I worried about government officials: the official career is full of dangerous situations, personnel changes are frequent, positions are insecure, and one's job is precarious.

Today, I seem to need to congratulate them: it turns out they are all merchants who know how to do business.

When in power, they are officials, with unmatched authority; when out of power, they become merchants, with enough wealth to last a lifetime.

"Official" and "merchant"; "bureaucrat" and "capital"—it seems they are inextricably linked! Heh, ha!

### More on Occupational Insurance

— Ji Shui

About half a month ago, I wrote a short article titled "Protecting Salary Earners, Promoting Occupational Insurance." I originally thought it was just a drop of water in the ocean, disappearing in the river of articles without any "response." Unexpectedly, Mr. Chen Songyao, a military officer who had achieved success and was about to retire, sent me a letter full of light and warmth. He is willing to join me in taking on the responsibility of promoting this cause, and I am happy to work with him in a practical manner.

Now, I will tell everyone my ideas first. If there are any aspects that cannot be implemented, please send a letter to point them out!

1.  Solicit friends with the spirit of "Everyone for me, and I for everyone," at least thirty people, the more the better. Everyone should unite, fulfilling the obligations that should be fulfilled and enjoying the rights that should be enjoyed.

2.  Friends who agree should contribute one, two, three, or four percent of their income each month, depending on the amount of income.

3.  Elect two friends who are capable of handling matters without taking a salary, one responsible for managing finances and the other responsible for introducing jobs. Their role is simply to connect and entrust work.

Salary earners who share the same ideals, why not join us!
