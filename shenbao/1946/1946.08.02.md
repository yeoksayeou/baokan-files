### Chairman Receives Ambassador Stuart, Exchanges Views on the Attack on American Soldiers, Refrains from Drawing Conclusions Before the Truth is Clear

(Our newspaper's Kuling dispatch, 1st) Ambassador Stuart, just recovered from his illness, took a walk in the garden this morning. He was able to eat a little for breakfast and lunch. After a short nap at noon, his spirits improved. He then went to see the Chairman at 5 p.m. with Chuan Jingbo, advisor to the American Embassy. The conversation ended at 6:15 p.m. The Chairman was very pleased to see the Ambassador's recovery and expressed his concern and care for the Ambassador's convalescence. He repeatedly urged, "As an old friend, I hope you will rest and recuperate in the mountains for a few days." The Ambassador, deeply touched by the Chairman's kindness, agreed to stay in Kuling for a few days, but still hopes to return to Nanjing before next Wednesday.

(Central News Agency, Kuling, 1st) Ambassador Leighton Stuart paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at 5 p.m. on the 1st, and the meeting lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes, ending at 6:15 p.m. Forty-five minutes of the meeting were devoted to exchanging views on the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps on the Pingjin Highway, as both the Chairman and the Ambassador had received a great deal of relevant reports and information from the Peiping Executive Headquarters and the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing. Other issues were not discussed. However, the Chairman expressed deep concern for the Ambassador's recent recovery from illness, saying to the Ambassador, "I am not speaking as the head of China, but as a longtime friend, urging you not to leave Kuling until your health is fully restored." The Ambassador, unable to refuse the Chairman's kindness, will rest in Kuling for at least two or three more days. According to Jingbo, the Ambassador's personal advisor, who also accompanied the Ambassador during his visit to the Chairman today, both the Chairman and the Ambassador considered the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps on the Pingjin Highway to be unfortunate and expressed great concern. Before the facts are ascertained, they are unwilling to draw conclusions hastily. If the incident was a premeditated ambush or a planned act, it must be regarded as serious. Marshall's sudden departure from Kuling a few days ago was related to this incident. When reporters inquired about the exact number of American Marine Corps casualties, Chuan said it was difficult to say, only knowing that a lieutenant-level officer fluent in Chinese stepped forward during the attack and asked the other side to stop shooting, but was unfortunately shot and killed.

(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) The Communist Party's explanation for the Xianghe incident is that on the morning of the 29th, the Eighth Route Army's defense area near Anping Town, Xianghe, was suddenly attacked by troops of unknown origin, followed by the participation of more than 60 American soldiers. Both sides suffered casualties in the battle. In the afternoon, American reinforcements arrived, and the Communist army withdrew on its own.

### Communist Army Admits to Attacking American Soldiers, Peiping Executive Headquarters Conducts Thorough Investigation, Government Demands Surrender of Perpetrators

(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) After Chairman Chiang's telegram ordering Li Zongren, Director of the Peiping Executive Headquarters, to strictly investigate the attack on American soldiers on the Pingjin Highway arrived, Li summoned Sun Lianzhong, Commander, and Zheng Jiemin, Committee Member of the Military Mediation Department, on the afternoon of the 1st to discuss solutions. After Commander Sun left, the reporter visited Director Li for an interview. In addition to Commander Sun sending his Deputy Chief of Staff, Feng Songyuan, to lead Huang Rencai, Commissioner of the Fifth District of Hebei, to conduct a thorough investigation at the site of the conflict in the Da Xiao Shahe area of Xianghe County, it was also decided to negotiate with the Communist side through the Military Mediation Department regarding responsibility. Furthermore, to prevent similar unfortunate incidents from happening again, sufficient troops will be deployed along the Pingjin Highway to protect it. In addition, Sun Lianzhong specially sent his Chief of Staff, Song Kentang, to the American military hospital on the morning of the 1st to express condolences to the wounded American officers and soldiers.

(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) In the conflict in Xianghe where the Communist army attacked American soldiers, a Communist army doctor was injured and captured by the American army. The Communist Party has admitted that they were involved. Regarding whether the 25th investigation team sent by the Military Mediation Department has already departed, both the government and Communist Party sides in the Military Mediation Department were evasive. According to high-ranking officials on the government side, this unfortunate incident involves diplomatic issues, and the government attaches great importance to it. It will demand that the Communist Party hand over the perpetrators. The government also intends to provide compensation for the dead and wounded, but it is not yet known whether the American army will accept it. Zheng Gongmin, Committee Member of the Military Mediation Department, sent personnel yesterday to deliver fruit to the wounded American soldiers as a token of sympathy, and Li Zongren will also send personnel to express condolences in the coming days.

(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) The Xianghe County area of the Pingjin Highway has always been a Communist army guerrilla zone. Before the conflict in which American soldiers were attacked, only merchants traveled on the highway. National army or government vehicles had never used it. The American army's trip was the first time, and the unfortunate incident occurred immediately. In the future, after the National army deploys along the highway, the highway may be passable without obstruction.

(Our newspaper's Kuling dispatch, 1st) In view of the recent attack on American soldiers on the Pingjin Highway, the authorities believe that it is necessary to immediately strengthen the security of railways and highways in North China to ensure the safety of transportation. According to news from North China, it is possible that the entire Pingjin and Jinpu railway lines will be opened to traffic in the short term.

(Central News Agency, Peiping, 1st) Regarding the attack on American soldiers on the Pingjin Highway, it is reported that the Chinese Communist side has admitted that it was committed by the Communist army. The Military Mediation Department intends to send a special team to investigate. The Communist side has no objection, but the American side insists that the team should depart to investigate after the Marine Corps' report and information are compiled.

(United Press, Tianjin, 1st) The U.S. Marine Corps motorized patrol has been greatly strengthened since the ambush on Monday. The patrol now carries tanks, rocket launchers, etc. It is said that the patrol will continue to patrol once every three days as before, but yesterday's patrol was an exception. Several incidents occurred two or three days ago, when the U.S. Marine Corps stationed at the Tianjin East Arsenal was shot at several times, and one soldier was injured. It is reported that the shooter ordered civilians to use as cover. The rumor that the U.S. Marine Corps will withdraw from the arsenal is not true.

### Xu Yongchang and Zhou Enlai Exchange Memoranda

(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) According to military sources: Xu Yongchang and Zhou Enlai, representing the Nationalists and Communists respectively in the Military Affairs Sub-Committee, exchanged memoranda today. The Communist side submitted Memorandum No. 110, and the government side submitted Nanjing Document No. 9595. The content is unknown, but it may be related to the war situation.

### Military Mediation 9th Team Completes Agreement Outline

(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) Regarding the agreement obtained by the Military Mediation 9th Team in Laohekou, as reported by yesterday's telegram, the specific points of the agreement are as follows: (1) Li Xiannian's Communist army will cease moving, and the National army will cease pursuing. (2) The team will designate "suitable areas for stationing" for the troops after contacting Li Xiannian's representatives. (3) The government troops will retreat ten miles west from the conflict line, and the Communist troops will retreat ten miles east. (4) Regarding the concentration of scattered units of Li Xiannian's troops, the team will designate a concentration point, and the National army will allow the Communist army to pass through the defense area to the designated concentration point. (5) Request the 32nd Team to assist in providing food and accommodating wounded soldiers to both the National and Communist armies. It is reported that the main force of Li Xiannian's troops is currently in the Shangnan area of Shaanxi. The 9th Team is still working hard to contact the troops.

### Chairman Invites Dean Dai and Others to Lunch at the Executive Headquarters Tomorrow

(Our newspaper's Kuling dispatch, 1st) Chairman Chiang has scheduled a lunch at the Executive Headquarters on the 3rd, inviting Dai Chuanxian, Li Jishen, Zhou Zhongyue, Wei Daoming, and Dai's son, Anguo.

### Chen Lifu Refutes Zhou Enlai, Zhou's Slander and Attacks are a Consistent Propaganda Tactic, Who is Wantonly Destroying the Political Consultative Conference Resolutions is a Matter of Fact

(Central News Agency, this city dispatch) It has been rumored that Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, will visit Lushan in the coming days. Upon hearing the news, the reporter immediately went to his residence to pay a visit. Chen received the reporter. The reporter asked, "I heard that the Minister is going to Lushan soon. I wonder if there is any important mission?" Chen replied, "I am indeed going to Lushan because the Lushan Summer Camp has invited me to give a lecture." The reporter, referring to the Reuters Nanjing dispatch of July 30, which reported Zhou Enlai's first public statement after meeting with Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, in which he said: "The Communist Party's proposals do not go beyond the scope of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, so if the government can accept them, it will not be difficult to establish peace. The main obstacle lies in the elements within the Kuomintang who want to resolve the issue by force, as evidenced by Chen Lifu's recent remarks," asked the Minister for his opinion on this. Chen replied, "I am one of the first and have always been in favor of and will implement a political solution to the Kuomintang-Communist issue. I have briefly mentioned this in my previous remarks. Zhou and I know the details of this matter best, and he should not be so forgetful. If Zhou has no intention of overturning his previous advocacy of peace and unity, then why would he slander and attack someone like me who has always advocated and has implemented a political solution? Therefore, I hope that Zhou's remarks are only his consistent propaganda technique of 'blaming others' and do not want to draw deeper inferences. The prerequisite for peace and democracy depends on the restoration of transportation and the nationalization of the army. If these two cannot be achieved, the situation of armed separatism will always exist, and the threats to peace and obstacles to democracy cannot be removed. If you try to compare the efforts made by the government and the Communist Party on these two matters, you can know who is seriously implementing the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and who is wantonly destroying them. The facts are there, and they have been widely heard and seen at home and abroad. There is no need to argue with words." The reporter further asked whether the Minister knew that Zhou had recently indicated that he would not consider answering the Minister's letter of inquiry. Chen said with a solemn expression, "It is regrettable that a responsible person of a political party does not have a responsible attitude towards his defamatory remarks against others. However, I also deeply understand that Zhou has no way to take responsibility for his own remarks in recent years." The reporter, seeing that Minister Chen had many visitors waiting to be received, excused himself and left. Upon shaking hands in farewell, the reporter asked one last question, "Then will the Minister take the next step on this matter?" Chen waved his folding fan and smiled, quoting Mencius, "If someone treats me with rudeness, then a gentleman must reflect on himself... If, upon reflection, he is loyal, if, upon reflection, he is polite, and the rudeness remains, then the gentleman says, 'This is also a foolish person.' In that case, what choice is there..."

### National Army in Xuyi Reaches Jiangba, Qutang Recovered Yesterday Afternoon, Communist Army Cleared Near Yangtai Highway

(Our newspaper's Jiangdu dispatch, 1st) According to an urgent telegram from Taixian, Qutang was officially recovered by the National army at noon today. The Communist army's arsenal in the area was not damaged. The National army seized more than 10 pieces of large and small machinery, more than 20 light and heavy machine guns, killed hundreds of Communist soldiers, and captured more than 100 people. The Communist army retreated to Haian. The National army marching north from Rugao will continue to advance. A joint force in Haian can be realized.

(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) According to military sources, the National army in northern Jiangsu is advancing in a fan shape. The National army marching north from Rugao and the National army from Taixian will join forces in Haian within one or two days. The Communist army near the Yangtai Highway has been cleared, and the area near Jingjiang is calm. The National army in Yangzhou is currently mopping up the Communist army near Shejingsi Temple in the northwest township. The Yangchang Highway is expected to be open to traffic soon. In the Xuyi area, the National army has reached Jiangba (about 20 kilometers east of Xuyi) and Licheng Town (about 38 kilometers southeast of Xuyi), directly threatening Gaoyou, the old nest of the Communist army in Huaiyin, and the National army marching south from Suqian is reported to have reached the outskirts of Siyang.

(Our newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch, 1st) Official news: (1) The National army in Xuzhou is advancing from Jiangjiaba and Gaoliang towards Chenji. A portion of the National army has crossed Chenji, and the Communist army in Huaiyin feels greatly threatened.

(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) Regarding the addition of a landline to the Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone, the Ministry of Communications has recently submitted the plan to the Executive Yuan for approval. If it can be approved and foreign exchange is obtained, the equipment will not be a problem and it can be completed within one year. Currently, only ten long-distance telephone lines between Beijing and Shanghai can be used simultaneously. If the entire plan is completed, the first step will be to have at least thirty lines that can be used simultaneously, and the second step can reach two hundred lines, greatly facilitating telephone calls for users in Beijing and Shanghai.

### Invited by Chairman Chiang and His Wife, Admiral Cooke Arrives in Kuling, Visited Marshall in Beijing and Had a Long Conversation

(Our newspaper's Kuling dispatch, 1st) Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet in China, arrived in Lushan at 6 p.m. on the 1st with his wife, a son, and a daughter, at the invitation of Chairman Chiang and his wife. However, Admiral Cooke only intends to stay for two days and then return to Beijing with his family. When reporters inquired about the attack on American soldiers, Admiral Cooke declined to comment.

(Central News Agency, Kuling, 1st) Mrs. Marshall hosted a banquet for Chairman Chiang and his wife, and Admiral Cooke and his wife, at 40 Hexi Road at 8 p.m. on the 1st.

(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet in China, flew from Shanghai to Beijing this morning, arriving at 10:20 a.m. After a short rest at the naval residence on Beiping Road, he went directly to 5 Ninghai Road to visit Marshal Marshall, accompanied by Navy Attaché Colonel Conan. Cooke and Marshall had a very long conversation and had lunch together. Admiral Cooke then took a special plane to Jiujiang and Kuling at about 1 p.m. Marshal Marshall also went to the U.S. military reception center on Xikang Road at 7:30 p.m. tonight. It is reported that Marshall's return to Beijing this time is mainly to take care of matters related to the U.S. military stationed in China, so he had meetings with U.S. military officials in Beijing. The content is unknown.

### Marshall Met with Zhou Enlai Yesterday, Inquired about the Attack on the U.S. Marine Corps, Scheduled to Leave Beijing for Kuling This Weekend

(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) In the atmosphere of the stalemate, Marshall finally invited Zhou Enlai to meet at 4 p.m. today, giving those concerned about the situation a glimmer of hope. According to the Communist Party delegation, Zhou visited Marshall this afternoon as scheduled for nearly three hours. The main topic of the conversation was Marshall's inquiry about the attack on the U.S. military by the Communist army in Anping, eastern Hebei, because Marshall had received a report from the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin. Zhou said that this was an unfortunate incident and not a predetermined policy. If this happened, it was due to a misunderstanding. Zhou has now telegraphed Yan'an to conduct an investigation. If it was committed by the Communist army, they should be responsible. Secondly, he reported that he had been in Kuling for several days and had not had many meetings due to Ambassador Stuart's illness. There was no new development in the negotiations. The conversation lasted for three hours.

(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) Regarding the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps in the Anping area on the Pingjin Highway, the Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an claimed that it was the U.S. military attacking the Anping Liberated Area, including the sentence "seriously protesting the illegal act of armed interference in China's internal affairs against the United States." However, when Zhou Enlai met with Marshall, it was reported that Marshall told him that he had received a report, and Zhou said that he would "wait for investigation." We still remember that Zhou has repeatedly stated recently that he demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. military stationed in China, and in a certain meeting between Zhou and Ambassador Stuart, he clearly stated that U.S. aid to China was fueling the Chinese civil war. It can be seen that the Communist Party's anti-American attitude has now become superficial. It is heard that Marshall made a verbal protest to the Communist Party delegation, but the spokesman of the Communist Party delegation denied it.

(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) Marshall is scheduled to go to Kuling this Saturday to spend the weekend with nature. It is not yet known whether he will meet with Zhou Enlai again on the 2nd. However, judging from the current situation, the topic of conversation seems to have moved from the stage of political negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to the "Anping Incident."

(United Press, Nanjing, 1st) After returning to Beijing from Kuling, Special Envoy Marshall met with Zhou Enlai for the first time today for a sincere and long conversation. All parties are speculating that Marshall is now making renewed efforts to promote a coalition government to resolve China's difficulties. Most observers believe that China's military situation has completely lost control, and only the realization of a coalition government can remedy it. The Communist Party has raised objections to some points of the coalition government, such as the number of seats in the National Government Committee and the distribution of ministers in the Executive Yuan. However, if the Communists continue to argue, they may not gain anything, so they may tacitly approve the organization of the new government, unless such drastic steps are taken quickly, otherwise the future of the overall situation is bleak.

### New British Ambassador Arrives in Beijing Yesterday, Negotiations on Sino-British Commercial Treaty Will Begin Soon, Pays Courtesy Call to Vice Minister Gan Today, Will Go to Kuling to Present Credentials in the Coming Days

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st) Sir Stevenson, the newly appointed British Ambassador to China, and his wife arrived at Zhongshan Wharf in Xiaguan at 10 a.m. on the 1st aboard the destroyer HMS Consort. Li Jun, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Jia, Australian Minister Kobran, British Prime Minister's Representative General Wyatt, and many staff members of the British Embassy were at the wharf to greet them. The Ambassador is scheduled to pay a courtesy call to Vice Minister Gan Naiguang, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, at 10 a.m. tomorrow and is scheduled to go to Lushan to present his credentials.

At 11:30 a.m. today, Stevenson received reporters at the Ambassador's residence, saying that one of Britain's aspirations in China is to rebuild Sino-British trade and, if possible, strengthen it. For this reason, Britain hopes for unity and stability within China, because unity and stability are the basis of prosperity. Referring to the conclusion of a new Sino-British commercial treaty, the Ambassador believed that a new treaty was necessary due to general changes in the situation. It is said that according to the new Sino-British Treaty of 1945, the Sino-British commercial treaty was to be signed within six months after the end of the war. It happened that the Chinese government returned to Nanjing after the end of the war, which delayed it. It is believed that both China and the United Kingdom will begin negotiations soon. The Ambassador also said that the British people greatly admired the Chinese people's hard resistance for eight years under the leadership of their heroic leader. After the war, the British people universally economized and responded to the relief and rehabilitation work of the United Nations. One percent of the total national income has been donated to the United Nations, which can help countries in more difficult situations. As for its policy towards China, the British government has adopted the same policy as the United States, and the United Kingdom also supports the "open door" policy for trade with China.

(Our newspaper's Kuling dispatch, 1st) General Wyatt, Private Representative of the British Prime Minister, will come to Kuling from Beijing at noon on the 3rd.

(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) Soviet Ambassador Petrov and his wife are scheduled to go to Kuling on the 3rd to escape the heat.

### Beijing Garrison Headquarters Officially Established Yesterday Morning

Xu Zhenqiu is the head of the military law group, Chu Chengzhi is the head of the executive group, and Guan Yuan is the head of the foreign affairs group.

### Postal and Telegraph Losses Too Great; Ministry of Communications Considers Price Increase

The Plan Has Been Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] According to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Communications, the postal and telegraph services are currently facing a significant difficulty. The monthly income barely covers employee salaries and expenses. The postal service is losing 4 billion yuan each month, and the telegraph service is losing 5.7 billion yuan. While the national treasury is trying to make up the difference, it is impossible to pay for engineering expenses and new equipment. Furthermore, due to the large discrepancy between income and expenses, it has become necessary to delay employee salaries, leading to instability among employees and making improvements in work difficult. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has recently proposed a price increase, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The price increase will be more than double the current prices but can only be implemented after it is approved by the Executive Yuan. In the meantime, we hope that the public will provide opinions on the price increase.

### Reporters Stationed in Guling to Welcome Minister Peng Today

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 1st Dispatch] Representatives from Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jiangxi are holding a meeting to determine that on the afternoon of the 2nd at 6:30 PM they will hold a banquet at the Hu Jin Fang Hotel to welcome Minister Peng and Mr. Beale.

Although Lieutenant General Yang Lide, who was arrested, has been interrogated several times, it is said that no torture was used. The verdict is expected to be announced in the coming days. Dozens of other suspects have been thoroughly interrogated. It is said that Liu Shukun, Chief of Staff of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, is serving as the presiding judge. The confessions obtained from the suspects were submitted to Commander-in-Chief Gu yesterday for processing.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 1st Dispatch] It is said that the murderer in the Li and Wen case has been captured in Qujing and is currently under intensive interrogation.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 31st Dispatch] The Yunnan Provincial Government held a grand banquet at the Provincial Government at 8:00 PM this evening to welcome Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, Commander Zhang Zhen, Director Tang Zong, and Deputy Chief of Staff Leng Xin.

### Qin Decun Returns to Shanghai after "Big Problem"; Shares Feelings About Japan Trip With Reporters; Says Responsibility for Aggression Does Not Lie With the People

[Our City News] Qin Decun, Deputy Minister of National Defense, who was invited by the Far East International Military Tribunal to testify during the trial of Japanese war criminals Doihara and Matsui, has completed his mission in the north. He returned to the country by Air Force Eighth Group B-24 bomber from Tokyo at 10:20 AM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 4:40 PM. He landed at Dajiao Airport. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Major General Zou Renzhi, Director of the Department of Prisoner Management of the Ministry of National Defense, and Yao Gengsheng, Director of the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Chinese Delegation to Japan. Mr. Qin looked rested and full of spirit. After getting off the plane and exchanging greetings with the welcomers, reporters approached him to inquire about his feelings on attending the international tribunal in Japan.

The Situation of the Far East Tribunal's Trial

He said: "The public trial of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal, like the Nuremberg Tribunal, is a manifestation of mankind's highest wisdom in seeking to prevent war from recurring. This kind of trial can have a far-reaching impact on world peace and security. When questioning important Japanese war criminals, diplomats and politicians from allied countries familiar with the war crimes were often invited to testify. Because I had personally witnessed the Lugou Bridge Incident and other atrocities committed by the Japanese, I was also one of the witnesses. The trial adopted a majority rule system. For each war criminal, while preventing them from escaping justice, they were still allowed to present sufficient evidence in rebuttal to make a favorable defense."

The Japanese People Are Mostly Pure and Kind

Regarding the responsibility of war criminals, Qin said: "During my trip to Japan, I traveled to Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, Yokohama, and other places, and I deeply felt that the majority of the Japanese people are pure and kind in their thoughts. Therefore, I believe that the responsibility for launching the aggression does not lie with the Japanese people, nor with the soldiers who were conscripted into the army (excluding individuals who committed atrocities during the war), but rather with the few militarists who initiated the aggression. For example, the Japanese conspiracy to invade China was actually orchestrated by Doihara, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was advocated solely by Matsui. The responsibility is very clear."

### Chen Ce Fitted with British Artificial Leg; Walks Without Cane

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st Dispatch] The artificial leg that the British government presented to General Chen Ce was delivered by Major Watson, dispatched by the Hong Kong government, and was personally fitted for Mr. Chen at the Naval Association. After being fitted with the leg, Mr. Chen was able to walk without a cane, and his steps were almost indistinguishable from those with a real leg.

Four Major Areas of War Criminal Trials

When asked when the Far East International Tribunal would end, he said: "The trials of Japanese war criminals are divided into four major areas: the Northeast Incident, the North China Incident, the atrocities of massacres, and economic aggression. Recently, the trial of the 'Nanjing Massacre' case is underway, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The verification procedures and trial process are quite complex and require a long time to handle." Regarding whether the Japanese Emperor would also be listed as a war criminal, Qin explained that as of now, the International Military Tribunal has not made this decision, but representatives from two of the eleven countries' judges have made this proposal.

Shibuya Incident Vented Hatred

At this point, the reporter raised the issue of the tragic killing of Taiwanese compatriots by Japanese people in the Shibuya Valley incident, inquiring about his views on behalf of the public. Qin said: "The details have already been recorded at the [Taiwan] Representative Office. I believe that the occurrence of this tragedy was due to the fact that Taiwanese compatriots had been subjected to 50 years of hateful rule by the Japanese in the past, and they inevitably took this opportunity to vent their feelings. However, the Japanese police cannot escape responsibility for excessively using their defensive powers. After the tragedy occurred, our delegation to Japan reported the details to General MacArthur's headquarters and repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side. The Japanese government paid great attention to this matter and sent personnel to express to our delegation that they would replace the police chief. Recently, during a meeting of the State Council, the committee members expressed their admiration for Chairman Chiang's attitude of 'repaying evil with virtue' and unanimously passed a resolution to thank the Chinese government. All of this shows that the Japanese government is quite apologetic about the Shibuya incident." Mr. Qin is scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing tonight. Whether he will go to the Northeast will depend on the needs of the situation in Guangdong and Rehe.

### Two Major Aggressors Against China; Isoya and Tani Are Escorted to Shanghai; Detained at the Jiangwan Gaojing Temple Detention Center

[Our City News] Isoya Renriki and Tani Hisao, two Japanese war criminals who strongly advocated aggression against China, were arrested by General MacArthur's headquarters in Japan this spring after our country proposed them as war criminals. The Ministry of National Defense then telegraphed the delegation in Japan to inform the U.S. side to hand them over to China for trial. These two criminals were escorted from Sugamo Prison in Tokyo by Chang Jiakai, a member of our delegation in Japan, and other personnel, and flown to Shanghai on a special plane. They arrived at Dajiao Airport at around 6:00 PM yesterday (the 1st). Major General Zou Renzhi, Director of the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense, specially dispatched Xu Yisan, the chief of the group, and four soldiers to escort them to the Jiangwan Gaojing Temple General Detention Center. This is the first time our country has extradited war criminals from Japan for trial. It is said that the Ministry of National Defense also intends to extradite other war criminals to China for public trial and sentence them to the crimes they deserve.

Tall and Short

After the plane carrying the two criminals landed at Dajiao Airport, the two criminals appeared in the window of the aircraft, and our personnel in charge of escorting them stood guard on the side. Isoya was burly with thick eyebrows, while Tani was short, wearing a hat, with a small head and hunched back. The difference in their height made for an amusing sight. The two criminals were wearing green spring military uniforms and black leather shoes. They even waved their hats in greeting after getting off the plane, apparently unaware that those at the airport were all there to escort them to China. Their luggage consisted of three bundles and a small leather suitcase. Tani spoke fluent English and answered reporters' questions in English. The index cards in his small leather suitcase were also all in English. According to the two criminals, they had been interrogated by the British several times since being detained this spring. They were taken from prison and put on the plane yesterday afternoon, not knowing where they were flying to. They only found out it was Shanghai when they arrived at the airport. The two criminals were then taken by special car led by Xu Yisan, chief of the group, and the soldiers to the Gaojing Temple War Criminals General Detention Center in Jiangwan, where Director Yao Kaibai and Deputy Director Jiang Wenhe, among others, inquired about them before detaining them. Whether the two criminals will be transferred to the Shanghai Military Tribunal or sent back to Nanjing for trial is currently under consideration.

Crimes of the Two

Isoya Renriki, 64, is a well-known China expert in the Japanese army and a strong advocate of aggression against China. He issued a secret booklet called "Observations on China," strongly advocating the use of force to invade China. He was arrested by the U.S. military stationed in Japan on February 3 this year. Tani Hisao is the protagonist of the Nanjing Massacre and the number one criminal in the attack on Nanjing. He is 65 years old this year. When Tani first came to China, he was the Chief of Staff of the 3rd Division of Nagoya and launched the Jinan Massacre. He was stationed in China for ten months. After the July 7th Incident, he served as the Lieutenant General Commander of the 6th Division of Kumamoto and led his troops to station in North China. After August 13th, he landed in Hangzhou and advanced on Nanjing. When Nanjing fell, he was the first to occupy the city and ordered his troops to massacre, resulting in the unprecedented Nanjing Massacre. After staying in Nanjing for three days, he attacked Wuhu. Later, he was transferred back to Japan and served as the commander of the Hiroshima district. He was arrested by the U.S. military on January 17 this year and imprisoned with Isoya in Sugamo Prison.

### Sun Zhongyuan "Missing"; Turns Out to Be a "Misunderstanding"; Sun Has Officially Left the Democratic League

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st Dispatch] Last night, reporters went to Sun Zhongyuan's residence and were received by a Ma Shanyun. Mr. Ma explained the "misunderstanding" surrounding Sun Zhongyuan's disappearance as follows: on the afternoon of July 18, Sun was strolling near Nanchizi with his wife's younger sister, Wang Lizhen, and his daughter, Lequn, when he ran into Bao Shilai, an old friend of ten years. Overjoyed at their reunion, they warmly exchanged greetings. Wang Lizhen and Lequn, not seeing them, proceeded ahead and became separated from Sun. That evening, Sun was invited by Bao to his private residence in Shifangyuan and, after a long conversation, his old brain ailment recurred, so he temporarily stayed at Bao's residence to recuperate. Sun has now recovered from his illness but has also received two anonymous letters. For his personal safety, Sun sent a letter to Director Li of the General Headquarters, requesting protection. Later Sun himself appeared, of medium height and quite robust, but seemingly fatigued, with a limp and using his hand to support his head, saying his brain ailment had not healed and his leg was also numb. He also said: "I didn't get lost, it's a misunderstanding." Having secured travel expenses, he will return to Chengdu. Sun, along with his wife's younger sister Wang Lizhen and daughter Lequn, left Beiping by plane this morning. Via Xi'an they will return to Chengdu. Sun has also officially withdrawn from the Democratic League and will soon publish a letter to that effect.

### Communists Plan to Issue Bonds; Reform Current "Land Policy"; Zhang Dongsun Says Democratic League Is Not Acting as Tail of the Communist Party

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st Dispatch] Zhang Dongsun said today that people close to the Communist Party have revealed that the Communist Party Central Committee is studying the issuance of bonds to reform the Communist Party's current land policy. According to this policy, after removing the land that landlords should retain for their own cultivation, they will be forced to sell their other land by purchasing bonds. This land will then be distributed to the proletariat. As for the amount of land each person should retain and the interest rate on the bonds, nothing has been heard. Zhang also said that the Democratic League is not acting as the tail of the Communist Party and that some fundamental differences exist. He opposes the Communist Party's current land policy, and especially opposes using the temporary impulses of the "struggle" and "liquidation" of the masses as the basis for various decisions. He believes this is lawless.

### Local Dispatches; Commander of Communist Army in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces Convened Secret Party Committee Meeting

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou Dispatch] Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Communist Army in the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan military region, recently convened a secret meeting of the party committees of each county in the third military sub-district, at which the following was decided: (1) Use the militia to control territory and use all the forces of the third military sub-district to support the current situation. (2) If the National Army in Xuzhou is coerced and launches a counterattack against the "liberated areas," the Communist Army should immediately eliminate the "stubborn" forces in the controlled areas. If the main force cannot hold, prepare to retreat using a scorched earth policy. (3) The third military sub-district and the Southern Shandong "liberated area" should be defended at all costs. If it is impossible to support them, then try to detour to the rear of the National Army from the western section of the Longhai Railway to disrupt them and destroy transportation. (4) If deemed necessary, use part of the main force of the third military sub-district to attack Jieshan and Huangkou and destroy railway bridges.

Jiaxing - Please Exempt Field Tax and Reduce Actual Borrowing

Regarding the issue of exempting field tax and reducing actual borrowing in the Jiaxing area, the Zhejiang Provincial Fellow-Countrymen Association in Shanghai held a joint meeting and appointed Gu Suming and other representatives to go to the provincial capital to petition. The main points are: (1) In the past, the Zhejiang military used discounted currency. It is hoped that the government will continue to handle it according to the principle of Zhejiang West discounted currency. (2) Please exempt the borrowing of 1.5 dou. As for the 3 dou of actual tax and the 30% public grain attached to the borrowing, please reduce it appropriately. (3) The actual tax amount in Zhejiang Province is 5.4 dou per yuan, while in Jiangsu, the actual tax amount is only 2.4 dou per yuan after being calculated at a 40% discount. The difference is too large, so please the government to average and reduce it. (4) The purpose of the petition is to change the tax to 3 dou per yuan of Zhejiang currency. After discussion, Chairman Shen agreed to investigate the matter of 2.4 dou of actual tax in Jiangsu Province. If the information is accurate, he will strive for it with the Ministry of Food. The other requests for exempting borrowing and reducing the amount of actual tax and discounted currency are all established central government policies and must be submitted to the central government for decision.

Huzhou - Bandit Forces Still Rampant in Wuxing

Although the Bandit Suppression Committee has been established for more than a month, the bandit forces are still rampant. In the village of Wutang outside Guomen, two bandit ships suddenly arrived late at night on the 27th. There were more than ten bandits on board, speaking a local dialect, carrying three wooden-cased guns and three long guns. They landed from the west and robbed houses one by one. Although there was a task force in the countryside, they did not dare to pursue them due to insufficient weapons, and only fired a few shots as a warning. The bandits then fled with a howl. In addition, the Hongli steamboat of this city was sailing from Shanghai to Huzhou on the same day when it was only eight miles away from Lake, and suddenly about twenty bandits appeared, equipped with machine guns and rifles, ordering the boat to stop. They jumped onto the boat and searched each passenger one by one. The total loss is estimated to be about 8 million yuan. After the bandits achieved their goal, they left with a flourish.

Hangzhou - Zhejiang Field Tax and Grain Collection Will Begin Soon

Zhejiang Province has decided to proceed with the collection of field tax and grain, which will begin in the second half of the year. It is stipulated that the collection will begin in Eastern Zhejiang on September 1 and in Western Zhejiang on September 5. The amount of grain to be collected is 3.6 million shi of market measure, the amount of grain to be borrowed is 1.8 million shi of market measure, and the amount of grain for provincial and county public use is 1.08 million shi of market measure. Chairman Chiang is very concerned about the collection of grain. Yesterday (the 30th), he telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government from Guling, ordering the Provincial Government to explain and persuade the Provincial Assembly and social leaders that the collection of grain is necessary for the national economy and the people's livelihood and is a last resort measure, and that it must be collected this year and completed within the time limit without delay.

Taicang - Xihu Bus Robbed Again

Two Xihu highway passenger cars were robbed again on the morning of the 27th, from the Zhitang station to the vicinity of the Catholic Church. It is said that there were four bandits, two posing as passengers who boarded the car at Zhitang, and two waiting on the side of the highway at the Catholic Church. When the first car arrived there, the two bandits on the side of the road threatened the driver to stop with guns. They then jumped into the carriage, and the two bandits in the car also drew their guns, and robbed all the passengers of their gold jewelry, watches, cash, etc. When they tried to go to the car behind, the car happened to be carrying a certain adjutant from the Zhitang Self-Defense Force, who was equipped with quick and slow machine guns. Seeing that the car in front was being robbed, he fired a warning shot. The bandits did not have time to get on the car and fired back at the gun before escaping west. The losses of all the passengers are being investigated.

Hushuguan - Please Set Export Raw Silk Subsidy Price

### Establishing a "People's Peace"

——Reflections on Foreign Minister Wang's Speech at the Paris Peace Conference——

The globally anticipated Paris Peace Conference convened as scheduled a few days ago. Our representative, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, following [Pierre] Mendès France and British delegation leader Prime Minister Attlee, delivered a speech elaborating on the reconstruction of a lasting post-war peace and the policies embraced by our nation. The entire text is grounded in upholding promises and valuing justice, with particular attention to the potential impact on defeated nations in the creation of peace. It concludes that the creation of this peace should be a peace for ordinary people, not merely a peace for government representatives, unlike some past peace settlements. It truly reflects our nation's upright and peaceful approach and demonstrates the virtues of benevolence, love, trustworthiness, and righteousness cherished by our people. The adoption of this principle is a necessary condition for a lasting world peace. I respectfully offer these few words to express my sentiments.

Foreign Minister Wang's speech emphasized that the creation of a lasting peace should be a peace for ordinary people, not merely a peace for government representatives. This is a prerequisite for reconstructing a lasting peace, a point we must particularly emphasize. The Second World War was originally called a "People's War." After a "People's War," there must be a "People's Peace" to ensure lasting peace. What is a "People's Peace?" It means that the creation of a post-war peace should not only focus on the intentions of government representatives but should also be based on the aspirations of the people. Decisions should not be made in defiance of the people's wishes. It must ensure that the people's desires are satisfied for a lasting peace to be established. The proposal of this principle is rooted in painful historical experience. The peace created after the First World War was not lasting because it was not based on the aspirations of the people but was merely an expression of the personal will of a few leaders. Their own will could not gain the support of their own people, and the peace they created failed to grasp the intentions of the defeated nations' people. Therefore, the ink on the treaties was barely dry before they were torn up, and figures like Hitler ultimately rose to power. Looking back, we should emphasize establishing a "People's Peace" so that the peace created this time can truly be lasting.

In his speech to the representatives at the Peace Conference, Foreign Minister Wang specifically pointed out two points: (1) The victorious nations must strictly adhere to the promises they made during the war and the principles they put forward. For example, when referring to mediating conflicts over territorial claims, we must not forget the Atlantic Charter, nor should we restrict its implementation; (2) The victorious nations should not impose conditions on the defeated nations that would allow reactionary elements in the defeated nations to make a comeback while depriving democratic forces of any opportunity for rebirth or consolidation. The proposal of these two points is based on the premise that the peace created this time should be a "People's Peace." This is merely an explanation of how to create a "People's Peace," a method for creating a "People's Peace." The realization of the Atlantic Charter was the desire of ordinary people during the war. Now that the fighting has ceased, we should promote its realization to comfort the people's hopes. As for the victorious nations not imposing conditions on the defeated nations that would allow reactionary elements within the defeated nations to make a comeback and deprive democratic forces of any opportunity for rebirth or consolidation, this is something that China naturally feels particularly keenly about. China has been subjected to aggression by Japanese reactionary elements for the longest time. Therefore, China is especially unwilling to see the victorious nations propose any conditions that would allow reactionary elements in the defeated nations to make a comeback. Although the convocation of the Paris Peace Conference this time does not target Germany and Japan, the general principles for creating peace after the war must be established. Therefore, even without the participation of Germany and Japan, this principle should be widely adopted. All of this constitutes the fundamental conditions for establishing a "People's Peace."

However, when we think about the process of convening the Paris Peace Conference this time and the draft treaty proposals regarding Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland, and Bulgaria, as revealed in the newspapers, we cannot help but feel concerned about the recreation of peace. The path to the so-called "People's Peace" is still distant. As Foreign Minister Wang said: "...I believe that each draft should be discussed more fully by the General Assembly, as the topics designed have a great impact on the future stability of Europe. Anyone who tries to read these draft treaties cannot deny that many of the agreements reached are based on mutual compromise. If we can find ways to improve them, it is not for the narrow interests of any concerned parties, but for the broad and universal interests." From this, we can see that the drafting of this treaty is closer to a "peace for government representatives" and seems to have a considerable distance from a "peace for ordinary people." Here, we also see Australian representative Evatt's speech at the Peace Conference, advocating that the great powers should not harbor a spirit of revenge and force their will on others. He said: "Our goal is the word 'justice.' Men, women, old and young, around the world all hope to obtain a peace that meets the principles of fairness for them and their descendants. If we impose on them the burden of injustice and excessive humiliation, then we will violate the democratic spirit, and fascism may return." What he said resonates with Foreign Minister Wang's speech, complementing each other. The central idea is also to establish a "People's Peace" so that peace can be lasting.

Although the purpose of this Paris Peace Conference is to create a local peace in Europe, it is of great significance to the future global and lasting peace. We hope that the representatives gathered at the Paris Peace Conference can learn from the failures of past peace creations and be vigilant, so that they can create a lasting peace for the world and for humanity—a "People's Peace." Only then can the world be spared the devastation of war.

### All Twenty-One Nations to Participate in Paris Peace Conference Subcommittees; Rules Committee Passes Resolution Yesterday

[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: The Peace Conference Rules Committee met this morning. After intense debate, it passed a resolution allowing all 21 nations to participate in various subcommittees. The General Assembly will meet this afternoon to decide whether a two-thirds majority or just a simple majority is required for voting procedures.

[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: During today's meetings, the Soviet Union suddenly conceded, and Greece's proposal was accepted and passed unanimously. Any issue regarding the drafting of peace treaties, if proposed by one or more national delegations, can be included in the General Assembly's agenda. Molotov's concession allowed the procedural subcommittee to proceed smoothly, but a new problem arose due to a motion by the Netherlands. The Netherlands demanded that all 21 nations participating in the Peace Conference should not only be able to participate in the Steering Committee but also in all other committees. According to the original agreement of the Four Powers, only those who actually fought against a particular country could participate in the drafting committee for that country's peace treaty. Molotov then made another concession, proposing to allow all 21 nations to participate in all subcommittees, but only as observers without voting rights. He cited the US and France as examples, saying that when discussing the peace treaty with Finland, the US and France also participated but did not speak, as those two countries had not actually fought against Finland.

### Representatives from the Netherlands, South Africa, and Other Countries Deliver Speeches at General Assembly Yesterday Afternoon

[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: The fourth plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference continued this afternoon at 4:00 PM, with representatives from the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, New Zealand, and Sweden delivering speeches. First, Yugoslavian representative Kardelj spoke, saying that Yugoslavia could not accept the Four Powers' compromise solution regarding the port of Trieste. Kardelj attacked the so-called "French Line" based on political, ethnic, and economic reasons. He said, "This line places a large number of our people under Italian rule and oppression and takes a large piece of Istria away from Yugoslavia. The so-called 'French Line' is a complete violation of all ethnic facts." The Dutch representative then spoke, stating that not only should defeated countries thoroughly reform and change course, but victorious countries, both large and small, should also refrain from terror, selfishness, and intolerance. He especially opposed the procedural restrictions on the participation of certain countries in certain committees. He said that all countries invited to participate in this Peace Conference should be allowed to participate in all aspects of the conference's work based on a status of absolute equality and rights. All systems that only benefit certain countries and harm the rights and interests of other countries will hinder the peaceful development of the international community.

[Reuters Paris, 31st Dispatch] Yesterday's General Assembly meeting lasted for three hours, adjourning at 7:00 PM. Towards the end of the meeting, representatives left one after another, and the VIP seats were almost empty. When the Brazilian representative spoke, there were only a few reporters in the press box. Molotov, Attlee, [Pierre] Mendès France, and others were still in attendance.

### Italians Protest Against Harsh Peace Treaty Terms

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: According to senior Italian diplomats in Paris, under the economic terms of the Italian peace treaty, Italy will have to pay 666 billion lire in reparations. One diplomat said, "We fought alongside [the Allies] for twenty months, and it was all for nothing. When we carefully read the entire text of the treaty, we find it difficult to understand its true meaning and significance. If Italy had never fought against Germany, we don't know how much more severe the treaty would have been."

[Associated Press Vatican City, Day 1 Dispatch] The Pope met with Italian President Nicola today and told him that Italy's position between the two major powers of the East and West requires even greater responsibility and is even more dangerous than before.

### Bulgaria Plans to Make Territorial Demands on Greece

[Associated Press Paris, Day 1 Dispatch] The head of Bulgaria's informal delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, [Georgi] Kolarov, the country's second-ranking Communist leader, said today that the delegation will make territorial demands on the Greek province of Western Thrace. Bulgaria was one of the five Axis satellite states, and the peace treaty with that country is currently being drafted. Greece is one of the twenty-one victorious nations.

### Paris Opera House Stages Famous Play to Entertain Guests; Singing and Beards Reach a High Point

[Agence France-Presse Paris, Day 1 Dispatch] The Paris Opera House held a grand performance last night to entertain the representatives of various countries at the Peace Conference. As the representatives entered, they were greeted with diligent service by charming dancers. Two lines of guards in bright uniforms stood on the escalators. The representatives and their families sat in the boxes, while senior military officers, ambassadors, and diplomats sat in the main hall. US Secretary of State Byrnes and his family sat near the center. The box occupied by French President [Vincent] Auriol and his wife was three boxes away from Byrnes. Soviet representative Molotov sat behind his beloved daughter. Molotov's box was closer to the stage. The international celebrity [Alberto] Lleras Camargo, Director-General of the Pan American Union, arrived here yesterday afternoon and also attended the performance that evening. The singing and beards reached a high point.

### British Prime Minister Presides Over Cabinet Meeting; Returns to London Yesterday

[Report from This Newspaper] Paris Radio Broadcast: Prime Minister Attlee flew back to London today to attend an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss reports that President Truman had expressed "dissatisfaction" with the plan for Palestine. While this has not been officially confirmed, White House officials have strongly hinted at it.

### Bevin's Absence Diminishes the Peace Conference

[Reuters London, 31st Dispatch] A New York Times reporter said that Foreign Secretary Bevin's inability to attend the Peace Conference due to illness has greatly diminished the conference. It is still uncertain whether Bevin will be able to travel to Paris within the week or next week. There is a general feeling that Attlee is more quiet and reserved, and it is difficult to predict whether he will be able to cope with Molotov's barrage strategy at the conference. If the straightforward and outspoken Bevin were present, Molotov would have difficulty applying his techniques. Based on past experience, dealing with the Soviet Union requires a strong and uncompromising personality. Only Bevin possesses this, and Attlee is admittedly inferior.

### UN Agencies Publish Work Reports; Lie Points Out the Veto Power as an Obstacle to the Conference's Future

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, Day 1 Weary Broadcast: UN Secretary-General Lie, in his report on the work of the United Nations, sternly warned the world that the work of the UN agencies cannot meet our expectations, and emphasized that the veto power obliges the five major powers to reach agreements themselves, but this obligation has not yet been fulfilled. Lie said, "For example, the issue of atomic energy control is a choice between life and death. The failure of the United Nations is the failure of peace and the victory of evil." Lie pointed out that various problems have arisen in the General Assembly due to the inability of countries to reach coordination. He said, "It is absolutely necessary for the major powers to seek coordination in a spirit of mutual understanding and compromise. If I do not point this out when submitting this report, I am afraid it will be difficult to avoid the blame for neglecting the security of the world."

### Urging Decisive Action to Eliminate Fascist Remnants; Molotov's Speech Targets Franco

[Associated Press Paris, 31st Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today urged the Peace Conference to take decisive action against the Franco government in Spain, advocating a call to all freedom-loving nations around the world to declare war on fascism. Molotov said in his speech that if we still have to deal with the Spanish fascist regime, then the democratic countries' assistance to the Spanish people oppressed by the Franco government and the elimination of the legacy of Hitler and Mussolini, which endangers peace, will not be far off. In any case, the interests of all freedom-loving nations require us to end the war against fascism, which is the most dangerous aggressor of modern times. Molotov continued, the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers have been attacked by various reactionary elements, a point that should not be ignored. These reactionary elements are filled with absurd anti-Soviet prejudices, and all their estimates are based on the failure of cooperation between the major powers. Molotov also responded to the opening remarks of French Foreign Minister [Georges] Bidault, saying that we are only requiring the enemy countries that fought alongside Germany to compensate for a portion of the damage they caused. The Soviet Union also opposes any external interference that hinders their economic recovery. Molotov acknowledged the Soviet Union's sympathy for the satellite states of the Axis powers, but said that they cannot be allowed to go unpunished. Molotov allowed the opinions taken from the satellite countries, saying that these countries joined the fight against Hitler in the end, proving their identity, and the Soviet Union has also established friendly relations with them. Australian representative Evatt then spoke (speech reported in yesterday's newspaper). Finally, Brazilian representative [João] Neves de Fontoura spoke, advocating the establishment of a peace aimed at morally disarming the world and not based solely on hatred and revenge. Brazil's ambition is only to cooperate with other countries to establish a reasonable peace.

### Partition of Palestine; British Government Announces New Plan; Rumors of Truman's Dissatisfaction

[Reuters London, 31st Dispatch] Lord President of the Council Morrison announced in the House of Commons today the report of the joint Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on the Palestine problem. The main points include dividing Palestine into four regions, establishing a central government, allowing 100,000 Jews to immediately immigrate to Palestine, the US providing financial assistance for the transfer of European Jewish refugees to Palestine, and the US providing loans to the Palestinian government specifically for improving the social and economic life of the Arabs in the area. Morrison further revealed that Britain had notified Washington that it intends to use these proposals as the basis for negotiations. Britain will convene a conference of both Jewish and Arab groups, hoping that they will accept the basis of the partition plan. Morrison concluded by saying that the implementation of this plan depends on the cooperation of the United States, otherwise Britain will have to reconsider the overall situation. The main points of the proposals put forward this time are as follows: A central government should be established in Palestine, with two provinces and two districts under it. The two provinces are the Jewish Province and the Arab Province, with individual legislative and administrative institutions. The Jewish Province includes areas where Jews are concentrated. The remaining areas, except for the Jerusalem and Negev districts, are all part of the Arab Province. The Jerusalem district includes the Holy City, Bethlehem, and neighboring areas. The provincial boundaries only refer to administrative jurisdiction and do not involve defense, tariffs, or transportation, which are the responsibilities of the central government. Each province should elect a provincial council, from which the High Commissioner selects the governor and the heads of various departments. The High Commissioner, with the assistance of the Council, exercises the powers of the central government and retains emergency powers. The Jerusalem district should establish a municipal council, with most of its members elected and the rest appointed by the High Commissioner.

[Associated Press Washington, 31st Dispatch] It is widely rumored here that President Truman has expressed dissatisfaction with the British-approved plan for the partition of Palestine.

### 600 Jewish Terrorists Arrested

### Siamese-Vietnamese Border Dispute to be Submitted to the International Court of Justice

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 31st Dispatch] According to reliable sources, France has asked the United States to intervene in the Vietnamese-Siamese border dispute and prevent Siam from submitting the dispute to the UN Security Council, instead requesting arbitration from the International Court of Justice in The Hague. According to well-informed sources, President Truman has approved the French request. The request will soon be submitted to the Siamese government through US mediation. If the dispute is submitted to the International Court of Justice, France will no longer oppose Siam's accession to the UN and will be willing to end the state of war that still exists between France and Siam. While the International Court of Justice is reviewing this issue, the disputed territory will be temporarily administered by the United States. On the other hand, if France's request is supported by the United States, Siam will express its compliance.

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 31st Dispatch] A State Department spokesman stated that rumors that the US government had requested Siam to withdraw the Vietnamese dispute submitted to the UN Security Council are inaccurate.

### All-India Muslim League Leader Jinnah Issues Statement

[Reuters Bombay, Day 1 Dispatch] The All-India Muslim League has done everything possible and is now awaiting an expression from the British government or the Congress Party. The League's decision to resort to direct action does not mean declaring war on anyone.

### Atomic Energy Commission Holds Secret Meeting

Re-discussing the Soviet Proposal

[Associated Press New York, 31st Dispatch] The Second Subcommittee of the UN Atomic Energy Commission is scheduled to hold a secret meeting at 7:00 PM today (Eastern Standard Time) to re-discuss the Soviet proposal to immediately ban the production and use of atomic energy. It is rumored that several members will question Soviet representative Gromyko in detail about how to prevent the illegal manufacture of atomic bombs. Gromyko spent almost all of last week debating the feasibility of banning atomic bombs, and only briefly mentioned the issue of control. The only control method mentioned by Gromyko was a suggestion that countries pass laws stipulating punishment for those who violate international treaties.

### US Plans to Protect Against Atomic Bomb Attacks

[Report from This Newspaper] Washington Radio Broadcast: The War Department has revealed that General of the Army Eisenhower has drafted a plan for the United States to defend against atomic bomb attacks. Eisenhower emphasized that any nation with scientific resources and a murderous nature could inflict this destructive weapon on the most powerful country in the world. Therefore, we must take swift and effective defensive measures.

### Remains of Overseas Chinese to be Shipped Back to China for Burial Next Year

First Time in Fifteen Years

[Associated Press San Francisco, 31st Dispatch] Overseas Chinese representatives announced today that it is an ancient tradition for Overseas Chinese who die abroad to have their coffins shipped back to their hometowns for reburial. This will resume next year. The remains of 20,000 Overseas Chinese in cemeteries across the United States will be shipped back to China in October next year. This is the first time in fifteen years. Due to the current shortage of lead, timber, and labor, it has been postponed until next year.

### International Tribunal Continues Hearing Northeast China Incident Case

[Reconstruction Society Tokyo 1st Dispatch] The International Tribunal today continued to present documentary evidence by the prosecutor regarding Japan's invasion of Northeast China. Among them, a "Privy Council Record of Proceedings" dated September 13, 1932, was specifically pointed out by the prosecutor, noting that both defendants Hiranuma and Araki attended the meeting. It is noted that Japan formally recognized Manchukuo and signed the "Japan-Manchukuo" Protocol on September 15, 1932. Two days before, the Japanese side convened a Privy Council meeting, which was also attended by Emperor Hirohito. At that time, Saito was the Prime Minister, Uchida was the Foreign Minister, and Araki was the Army Minister. After the presentation of evidence was completed, Morishima, who previously served at the Consulate General in Shenyang, was called to testify. His testimony stated: At that time, Zhang Zuolin was the supreme military power in Northeast China. Japanese Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka was assisting Zhang, but Tanaka's policy of assisting Zhang was fiercely opposed by officers of the Kwantung Army led by Colonel Daisaku Kawamoto. They believed that Japan's interests should be maintained by force. Among the leaders of this Kwantung Army group who did not listen to reason were Colonel Itagaki, Lieutenant Colonel Ishihara, and Major Hanaya. They attempted to occupy Northeast China, establish a puppet government, separate it from China, and make it an appendage of Japan. At 10:30 p.m. on September 18, they received a phone call from the Special Service Agency stating that the South Manchuria Railway had been blown up. I then met Itagaki and Hanaya at the Kwantung Army Headquarters. Itagaki said, "The Chinese regular army has blown up the South Manchuria Railway, infringing on Japan's major rights and interests. Japan must use force and take appropriate defensive measures." I wanted to persuade them to take peaceful measures, but Hanaya immediately drew his sword and said, "Whoever interferes with the army's command will be killed." From the evening of the 18th to the 19th, Consul General Hayashi repeatedly called Colonel Itagaki, asking him to resolve the incident through peaceful negotiations, and at the same time handed the matter over to the consular officials for handling. However, Itagaki did not comply with the request. At midnight on the 18th, Zhang Xueliang's top advisor also frequently requested the Consul General to advise the Japanese army to stop the attack in order to conduct peaceful negotiations. Although these requests were notified to the Japanese army, they were still ineffective. All Japanese troops in Northeast China then began to act, and the Korean army also crossed the Yalu River to join the battle. In March 1932, the puppet regime was established."

### U.S. Celebrates Air Force Day Yesterday; MacArthur Urges Soldiers to be Fully Armed and Ready; B-29s Return Over Tokyo

[This Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 1st Broadcast: Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo, MacArthur, Commander of the Pacific Air Force, Lieutenant General Weyland, and Commander of the Occupation Forces, Lieutenant General Eichelberger, issued a joint announcement on Air Force Day to all officers and soldiers under their command, urging them to "be fully armed and prepared."

[United Press Tokyo 1st Dispatch] A B-29 aircraft squadron flew peacefully today over the land where they carried out a terror bombing raid one year ago. The Japanese people all came out of their homes to watch the aircraft group. This was a demonstration for U.S. Air Force Day. The aircraft departed from Okinawa in the early morning, and at twelve noon, twenty-three of them flew over Tokyo at low altitude. One year ago, there were hundreds of aircraft that dropped bombs on Tokyo. One of the aircraft participating in the demonstration crashed yesterday between Guam and Okinawa, but all thirteen crew members parachuted into the water and were rescued.

[United Press Washington 1st Dispatch] The U.S. Army Air Corps today celebrated its 29th anniversary, maintaining its position as the world's largest air force. Four hundred aircraft soared over major cities.

### Central and Northern Europe's Sentiments Towards the Soviet Union Develop from Doubt to Terror

[United Press Vienna 31st Dispatch] For a thousand years, Russians were highly regarded in European countries and enjoyed great prestige. This is a phenomenon that has only existed since the Bolsheviks came to power. Over the past twelve months, after visiting Central European and Scandinavian countries, a major change in this attitude has been observed. The feeling of doubt towards the Soviet Union has been increasing, and in some cases, this doubt has developed into terror. Today, discussions about how to make the Soviet Union lose the next world war are frequently heard. In the past three or four months, the prestige of the Russians has declined even further. The European people believe that Moscow should be blamed for the rampant activities of the Communist Party. They have also witnessed that in countries under Moscow's influence, important positions in the government, such as internal affairs, military affairs, education, news, and propaganda, are controlled by the Communist Party. Furthermore, in several countries, the ministers of food and foreign affairs are also controlled by the Communist Party. Because the Communist Party controls the internal affairs of various countries, it implements strict police control and a secret service system, and the Party has military departments in various countries to control the army, navy, and air force. Although the sentiments of various countries towards the Soviet Union are not good, these institutions can be used to organize rebellions to protect the existing governments.

### MacArthur's Headquarters Economic Section Announces Japan's Export Sweater Plan; Preliminary Negotiations Have Begun with Eastern Countries

[United Press Tokyo 31st Dispatch] MacArthur: Japan's trade under control with other countries in the East has already begun preliminary negotiations. Delegations from two countries have arrived in Tokyo. One delegation represents Singapore, the Federation of Malaya, Hong Kong, Burma, Ceylon, and North Borneo, and the other represents Australia. Major Bickel of the Department of Foreign Trade recently went to various Asian countries for trade liaison tasks and has now returned. It is said that Eastern countries need textiles and general daily necessities, while Japan hopes to exchange these exports for the raw materials it needs. Furthermore, according to Fleming, American trading companies will handle Japanese sales. Washington will give final approval to the trade plan, and goods will be directly exchanged between the countries concerned, with settlements made every six months. The International Committee will allocate important items, such as cotton and raw silk, to avoid direct barter. Negotiations are currently underway to study the urgent needs of Japan and its neighbors. It is expected that delegations from China, the Philippines, India, the East Indies, Vietnam, and Siam will come here one after another. The Japan Textile Association reports that the production of cotton yarn and pulp in June of this year has increased two-fold. It must increase month by month in the future to meet the industrial production plan for the second half of the year.

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo 31st Dispatch] Fleming, the economic director of MacArthur's headquarters, said that Japan's export industry plan is the most ambitious of all plans for defeated countries. In the three months of May, June, and July, the value of Japanese exports exceeded 100 million U.S. dollars. It is expected that it will reach 400 million U.S. dollars in the next six months. China can maintain a trade balance with Japan through the export of salt. The United States is still Japan's best customer and may exchange ornaments for Japanese products. The Soviet Union plans to exchange wool for silk. Eastern countries are willing to exchange phosphates, ramie, and coconut oil for Japanese textiles. This barter trade will be directly negotiated by the governments concerned.

### From the Palestine Question (Part 2) - Talking About Britain's Middle East Policy

— Xueyan, Special Correspondent in Britain for This Newspaper

The Anglo-American Inquiry Committee

Is an effort to solve the Palestinian dispute. The Anglo-American Investigation Committee inspected the situation of Jews in Europe and Palestine and listened to the opinions of Jewish and Arab representatives. They believe that most of the Jews in Europe now need to find a way out for them, and Palestine is now an armed military camp, which also needs urgent solutions. The investigation team therefore put forward ten suggestions, which can be summarized as follows: (1) Solving the displaced Jews in Europe cannot be accommodated by Palestine alone. It is hoped that other countries with surplus space in the world will also open up to accept them. However, for emergency relief, 100,000 people should be moved to Palestine this year. (2) Given the current crisis in Palestine, the governance rights should continue to be borne by the United Kingdom, and in the future, it may be handed over to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. (3) Governing Palestine should be based on the principle of equal coexistence of two ethnic groups, and not with the ideal of establishing a purely national state. (4) The governing authorities should actively take responsibility for improving the education and living standards of the Arabs. The expenses can be transferred from the Jewish tax revenue. (5) The restrictions on land purchase rights should be lifted and replaced with laws to protect poor farmers.

After this report was published,

The reactions in the UK and the US were quite different. The United States only approved the point of moving 100,000 Jews to Palestine this year, while the United Kingdom insisted on implementing the entire "recommendation as a whole," which means delaying the transfer of 100,000 people first. The US government is currently discussing with the US authorities, hoping that the US can jointly take responsibility, and inviting British and American experts to jointly discuss the details of implementation. It will not be implemented temporarily before the negotiations are completed. Britain's rule over Palestine was originally entrusted by the League of Nations, and the United States was not a member. The two can be said to be unrelated. But Britain's involvement of the United States everywhere is naturally due to the actual situation. The United States is the country with the most Jews and the source of aid to the Jews in Palestine. Therefore, cooperating with the United States to solve the problem can be more convenient. The current suggestions not only run counter to the views of the United Kingdom and the United States, but also contradict the current policies of the United Kingdom. There is little that can help Anglo-American cooperation. The method that the UK is currently using is to put aside and delay the so-called expert discussions, which can sometimes be very mysterious. Not to mention the various long-term plans for hundreds of years, which cannot be agreed upon by a few experts at once. Even if we say that 100,000 Jews will be moved this year, if we want to arrange their food, clothing, housing, and transportation, it may not be possible to implement it in one year. The so-called negotiation is probably a joke with the profession. When Bevin mentioned the Palestinian issue at the Industrial Annual Meeting, he said: "There are illegal armed forces in Palestine. If 100,000 more people are moved there, the United Kingdom will have to increase the deployment of a division to suppress them. The United Kingdom is not prepared to do this now." We believe this is a

Very honest explanation of British policy

What exactly does the UK plan to do to solve the Palestinian problem in the future? Does it have a concrete plan now? We don't know. But one point seems certain: the UK has no intention of allowing the Jews to establish a purely Jewish state in Palestine. In the vast area of the Middle East today, it is almost entirely the world of the Arabs, and most of them are British-affiliated colonies. With the development of national consciousness and the strengthening of unity among the various Arab countries, the British are already struggling to cope. Now, in order to solve the problem of hundreds of thousands of scattered Jews, it is exchanging for the hostility of tens of millions of Arabs, which is something the UK will not do. Bevin once said: The Palestinian problem must be solved under the general peace and security problem in the Middle East; in other words, it must be solved with the understanding of the Arabs. This is probably the truth. To understand Britain's attitude towards Palestine, one should observe it from this perspective.

It is not clear now what the original purpose of the United Kingdom in proposing to send a joint Anglo-American investigation team was; but the recommendations of the investigation team obviously run counter to the original intention of the British government, so the British government has adopted a delaying and perfunctory attitude. As for searching Jewish debate groups and arresting a large number of Jews, it is obviously an independent action unrelated to the recommendations of the investigation team. The direct purpose, although in an attempt to eliminate the roots of terrorist activities, the organization that resists the British authorities, but after cracking down on Jewish organizations, will it implement a pressure policy, or will it gradually implement the recommendations of the investigation team after it is slightly quieter? It is still impossible to predict at present. We should wait for the evolution of facts to prove it. (End)

### Traffic Problems Are Becoming Increasingly Serious; The City Government Meeting Plans to Improve Them; One Month of Preparation, Implementation Begins Next Month

[Taibao Dispatch] At 3 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu convened a meeting to improve traffic in the city government meeting room. First, Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Works Bureau explained that the most important thing to improve the current traffic congestion situation is to abide by traffic discipline and to have close cooperation from the citizens. The reasons for the difficulty of traffic are analyzed as follows: narrow roads, protruding houses on the roadside, insufficient traffic lights, and increased vehicles (after the war, the number of three-wheeled vehicles increased by more than 11,000, the number of rickshaws increased by 4,500, and the number of military trucks increased by about 4,000). Deputy Director Yu of the Police Bureau suggested: Adopt as many one-way traffic methods as possible. Consulting Engineer Lu Binhou suggested: Refer to the method of New York City in the United States, and relatively stipulate the opposite direction for parallel road lines (for example, vehicles on the first street are only allowed to travel east, vehicles on the second street are only allowed to travel west, the third street is east again, and the fourth street is west again, and so on). Consulting Engineer Ye Jiajun suggested: Use fast and slow vehicles as the standard to control them. For example, stipulate that only motorized fast vehicles are allowed to drive on certain main routes, and restrict rickshaws from driving in the central area. Many proposals were made at yesterday's meeting, but the meeting was only for exchanging opinions and was not decisive. Among all the proposals, Deputy Director Yu's one-way traffic is the most practical. In order to reduce traffic difficulties, it was decided: (1) Demarcate parking lots, (2) Stipulate the driving time of heavy vehicles, roughly stipulating three times a day in the morning, noon, and evening, (3) Empty vehicles are not allowed to drive in the busy city center, (4) Strengthen the training of traffic police, (5) After the traffic rules are determined, they will be announced by the city government. It is now decided that August 1st to 15th will be the internal preparation period for the new plan, August 15th will be the publicity week, and traffic knowledge will be instilled to the citizens for two weeks, and it will be effectively implemented in early September.

### Six Public Buses to be Opened Between Caojiadu and Ximen Road

[This Newspaper Dispatch] The preparatory office of the city's public bus company is planning to open six more public bus routes, traveling between Caojiadu and Ximen Road. The details of the routes have not yet been finalized. Due to the increase in service personnel and the addition of roadside equipment, it may be difficult to operate on schedule in August. It is expected to officially open to traffic in early September. It is reported that the fare will be at most 300 yuan.

### Plans to Widen Huashan Road

[This Newspaper Dispatch] In order to reduce traffic congestion and to connect the tram lines of the former British and French concessions, the authorities have drafted a plan to selectively widen Huashan Road, from Nanjing West Road to Xujiahui Road.

### More Than a Thousand Jeeps Are Currently Waiting for Ships to be Transported to Shanghai

[This Newspaper Dispatch] According to a news spokesperson for the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau yesterday: The Material Supply Bureau has established an office in Tianjin, responsible for the purchase and distribution of surplus materials left by the U.S. military in North China. Zheng Daqiang has been appointed as the director of the office and is scheduled to fly to Tianjin this morning to make arrangements. It is also learned that the Material Supply Bureau has allocated 150 jeeps to various cultural institutions in this city, and the allocation has been completed. All the institutions that had applied before but were not approved due to lack of goods have now been registered and will be notified after more arrive. Furthermore, there are still more than 1,600 jeeps from the surplus of the U.S. military on Okinawa waiting for ships to be transported to Shanghai.

### Guns Confiscated by Jiang Gongmei; The District Prosecutor's Office Cannot Retrieve Them

[This Newspaper Dispatch] When the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office was ordered to take over the puppet Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office in 1945, according to the court police: all the guns of the team were confiscated by Jiang Gongmei, the captain of the military police, in August of the same year, on the grounds that the situation was not yet clear and they might fall into the hands of bandits. Six submachine guns, ninety-five pistols, thirty-six rounds of ammunition, eight Mauser pistols, one hundred and thirty rounds of ammunition, forty holsters, and forty-five rounds of miscellaneous ammunition were confiscated one after another, which was consistent with the files of the puppet office taken over. Later, after the office completed the takeover of the puppet office, the guns should be recovered immediately to restore police force. It then sent personnel to negotiate and request their return. It was then heard that the military police team was ordered to reorganize, and Jiang Gongmei was detained again for the case. It then sent official letters to the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, the Songhu Garrison Command, and the Sino-British Military Police Command to inquire and contact, but there have been no results to date. The office is eager to strengthen the police force, but after frequent negotiations, the confiscated guns have not been recovered, so it is deeply regrettable.

### Representatives of Fujian and Taiwan Groups in Shanghai Report on Their Petition in Beijing

Fujian and Taiwan groups in Shanghai believe that Taiwan, which has been occupied for 50 years, will soon be one year since its recovery. However, the political facilities and social status under the administrative chief executive system of military and political centralization have not met the expectations of the six million Taiwanese people and have deepened their suffering. Therefore, after a joint meeting a month ago, Chen Rongfang, Yang Zhaojia, Chen Bisheng, and three others were selected as representatives to go to Beijing to petition the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Chinese Kuomintang, the Central Party Headquarters, the Supreme National Defense Council, and the National Political Council. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and specially invited reporters yesterday to bitterly describe the recent situation of the people of Taiwan and the results of the petition, requesting assistance from the public opinion community.

### Residents in Police Jurisdictions; Household Registration Will be Divided into Three Categories; The Municipal Conference Will Discuss This Today

[This Newspaper Dispatch] The main matters to be discussed at the municipal conference to be held at 9 a.m. today, as learned by reporters in advance, are as follows: (1) A temporary measure for the registration of land rights for foreigners, proposed by the Land Bureau, (2) A draft charter for the Shanghai Port Affairs Conference, proposed by the Public Works Bureau, (3) Rules for household registration investigation and registration statistics in this city, proposed by the Police Bureau, which will stipulate that residents in the police jurisdiction will be divided into three categories: 1. Class A household registration: Those who are of good character and have always been law-abiding, 2. Class B household registration: Those who have no special or suspicious circumstances, 3. Class C household registration: Those whose actions and lives are suspicious. After the residents in the area are classified, then decide on a periodic visit.

### Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong Hope to Save Electricity

[This Newspaper Dispatch] According to Mr. Hou Jiaxi of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company yesterday: The current rotating power outages in factories in Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong are not planned measures. Because the current electricity bills are cheap and the demand for electricity exceeds the supply, the boilers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company are overused and often damaged, so they often notify power outages, and there are no regular regulations. However, the factories have been considerably affected by this. If the situation of general households abusing electricity is not improved, there will eventually be a day when there will be widespread rotating power outages. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens can think of the public interest and try to save energy in order to get through the difficult stage.

### Rotary Club Dinner; Kong Xiangxi Attended and Gave a Speech

[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Shanghai branch of the Rotary Club held a dinner yesterday noon at the Dadong Restaurant and invited Dr. Kong Xiangxi to give a speech. More than 90 Chinese and foreign members attended. In his speech, Kong first praised the Rotary Club as a great worldwide unity with a spirit of mutual assistance. He said: "We have experienced two world wars and suffered hardships and destruction. Today, everyone hopes that peace and security can be achieved. The United Nations Conference is about to begin, and the Paris Peace Conference is in progress. People are extremely worried and deeply afraid that it will fail." Kong pointed out that this kind of fear can be eliminated and hard work can be overcome. "We only need to seek mutual understanding and help each other. We must have confidence, patience, courage, and contribute to the welfare of society." He concluded: "The distance between countries in the world has become closer due to the development of air transportation. We are no longer the people of one country or one province, but the descendants of the world. Therefore, I hope that the Rotary Club will dedicate itself to society with the past spirit of mutual assistance, and peace and security will surely be achieved through cooperation."

### China Merchants Continues to Send the Cai E Ship to Assist in the Transportation of Relief Goods; The Taikoo Yih Ho Ship Changes Its Route to Various Ports in Southeast Asia; Dutch Companies are Inevitably Affected

[Taibao Dispatch] The China Merchants Bureau is working hard to assist in the transportation of relief supplies and has sent civilian ships to transport old clothes, old shoes, medicines, etc. The ship will sail to Tianjin tomorrow. If the loading is not completed, it may be delayed. The situation has been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that the bureau yesterday continued to send the Cai E ship to Tianjin to transport relief supplies, which is expected to load 1,800 tons of flour and is scheduled to be exported on the 5th.

The Shanghai-Java line was previously the basic route of the Dutch Java Shipping Company. Now that British ships have joined the voyage, the company is inevitably affected.

### Arrival and Departure of British, French, and Norwegian Merchant Ships

[Special Dispatch from *Ta Kung Pao*] The first French merchant ship since the victory, the *Ying Guang An*, arrived in Shanghai around 7 PM the day before yesterday and berthed at buoys 10 and 11.

According to Team Leader Zhang, of the fifty days allocated, thirty-five are for this city and fifteen are for Zhejiang Province. Therefore, the inspection work in this city must be completed before the end of the month, and then they will go to Hangzhou on September 1st.

### Formerly a Pickpocket, Now a Chief Captain: Impressions of the Vagrant Vocational Training Center

If you often have the opportunity to walk on the streets, then you must often see many beggars, pickpockets, petty thieves, etc., being carried away in prisoner vehicles under the escort of the police. Did you ever wonder at that time where they were being taken? And what would happen after the war?

If you are particularly disgusted by the accumulated garbage in this city, then you must have read a small news item in this section recently—the Bureau of Health used more than 300 vagrants from the Caohejing Vagrant Vocational Training Center to clear accumulated garbage. At the time, you may have lightly ignored it, leaving only the impression that the garbage piles at the door can be cleared day by day, but have you ever thought about who these people who are sweeping the garbage for you are? And what exactly is the so-called "Vagrant Vocational Training Center"?

Recently, a reporter followed Director Zhang Wei of the Bureau of Health to Caohejing to visit the Shanghai Refugee and Orphan Shelter, which is the place where those beggars, pickpockets, petty thieves, etc., are taken in, and the origin of the Vagrant Vocational Training Center, as it was known by this name before the war.

After the police catch these vagrants, they are immediately sent to the Caohejing shelter. When they first arrive, they are covered in scabies and the lice in their hair are matted into balls. The first step is to wash them clean and then treat them. The most common disease is trachoma, with patients accounting for almost nine and a half out of ten. After some cleaning up, they are assigned to various groups according to their age. Those under fourteen are in the children's camp, those from fourteen to sixteen are in the junior camp, those from sixteen to nineteen are in the youth camp, those from nineteen to thirty are in the young adult camp, and those over thirty are in the senior camp. The daily schedules for each camp are different, but everyone has the right to study and the obligation to work.

Assigning Work, Each According to Their Strengths

In addition to being assigned to camps according to age, work is also assigned according to their strengths. Currently, there are sewing classes, carpentry classes, masonry classes, sandal-making classes, shoemaking classes, etc. Their clothes and the equipment in the center, such as tables and chairs, are all made by themselves. Cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc., are all handled by people dedicated to their duties. The perfection of the division of labor and the density of cooperation are unmatched by any other group. Their slogan is "Autonomy and Mutual Assistance," cultivating the concept of "community" from daily life. The principle of daily management is to emphasize both education and cultivation, and to combine work and study. They are taught skills and moved with virtue, with adult education focusing on production and talent being discovered as much as possible.

The refugee and orphan shelter occupies more than ninety acres of land, of which only thirty percent is buildings, and the rest is wasteland. After the hard work of the vagrants, the roads are now level and the fields are well-organized. The shelter has a long history. It is said that during the enemy and puppet occupation, machine guns were set up to manage it, which is very different from the current situation. Currently, there are more than 3,000 people in the shelter, the youngest being three years old and the oldest being seventy-one years old, most of whom are beggars who have fallen into the streets. After only a few months of training, everyone is reluctant to leave this land that belongs to them.

Self-Education, Excellent Results

The shelter was taken over from the enemy and puppet forces and, after reorganization, has been open for only eight months, but the results of these eight months are astonishing! The former notorious "Uncle" pickpockets are now chief captains and are responsible for training others. And now, those who live inside are no longer willing to reveal their past deeds. Unless you force them to answer, "Which police station sent you here?" "What did you do before?" Then they can only blush and blurt out the words "Discussion Record" between their teeth!

When Director Zhang, the reporter, and others visited the shelter, they had already gathered in neat rows on the large square. Under the command of the chief captain, they began the review. The good order and the neatness of the steps were unmatched by any school students! No wonder their director said: "When foreigners come to visit the shelter, we have never disgraced the Chinese people!" This is by no means a boast, but a fact placed before our eyes—they have a fixed schedule for their daily lives, and the corridors are full of wall newspapers. They self-publish textbooks and implement self-education. They have their own bank, court, and consumer cooperative. According to Director Zhang, he personally witnessed them eating, which was even faster and more orderly than monks.

After training, the able-bodied vagrants are eagerly hired by all sectors. Among them, 500 have been sent by the Bureau of Public Works to dredge the Huangpu River, 300 have recently helped the Bureau of Health to clear garbage, and another 500 will be sent by the police to the Northeast to serve as police officers. In the past, they were all dregs wandering the streets, but today they have become producers for society.

Financial Difficulties, Hope for Assistance

It is important to introduce Mr. Ju Zuwang, the director of the shelter. He is still a young man of 29, but he is willing to devote his precious years and youthful vitality to this great work. He sacrifices the enjoyment that young people should have, lives in the shelter, and lives with this group of vagrants. Constant contact has caused him to contract lice and scabies, but he has no complaints. He says that he does not want any reward for doing this work, but the administrative difficulties are indeed discouraging. The funds allocated by the authorities are not even enough for food, and all other equipment, such as medicine, clothing, stationery, and soap, are obtained by the director himself begging from all sectors, and all are in serious panic. Mr. Zhou pulled on a child's clothes and said to the reporter: "This is the only set of clothes he has. If he takes it off, he has no other set." And this only set of clothes was donated by the Shanghai Barber Industry Association. Because once, many barbers visited the shelter and were extremely moved, so they automatically donated a set of clothes to each person. In addition, medicines, etc., are urgently needed, but all are in panic.

We understand the financial difficulties of the municipal government, but a meaningful organization like this must be supported in every way. I believe that everyone, as long as they have the opportunity to go to Caohejing, to see how the vagrants who used to run rampant in the streets and do all kinds of evil are now studying, learning to read, and working peacefully, will be deeply moved. It is now said that the Central Film Studio has decided to make a film about them in the middle of this month, and at the same time, the shelter will host a large-scale reception for reporters. I sincerely hope that the reporters will not miss this opportunity. I also hope that the gentlemen and ladies will take the time to visit, and then I believe you will all extend your helping hands!

### Another Episode in the Rong Case: False Accusation Out of Grudge, Claiming He Was a Major Criminal; Ouyang Huang's Attempt Backfires

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Just as the Rong Desheng kidnapping case was nearing its end, the Laozha District Police Station suddenly received a secret report from Yao Gengsheng, stating that there was another major criminal in the case, a Cantonese man named Cai Borong, who lived at No. 6 Guangxue Building, Zha Pu Road Bridge, in the Yusheng Customs Brokerage. This person had received USD 35,000, and the informant himself had also received USD 20,000. However, because Cai had bad intentions, he swallowed all of the USD 20,000 that the informant entrusted to him to exchange for legal tender, so he was reporting out of indignation. The report also stated that Cai had previously been bought by the Japanese military to purchase bamboo rafts, gallnuts, kerosene, iron, and other materials. After the victory, he intended to abandon his evil ways and start the Yusheng Customs Brokerage as a false cover. This time, when Zhu Chansheng and Luo Wenqing secretly discussed kidnapping Rong, Cai was also present to plan everything. The police station, considering the case to be of great importance, immediately sent it to the police headquarters for handling. The Second Criminal Investigation Division then dispatched Section Chief Feng Qishan to investigate and arrested Cai Borong at No. 161 Gongjiazhai Road the day before yesterday. After detailed interrogation, it was learned that the report was not true. However, in his confession, it was learned that Ouyang Huang of the Meifeng Customs Brokerage on the third floor of No. 5 Sichuan South Road was very likely the informant in this matter. They pretended to be customers to investigate and asked Ouyang Huang to provide a handwritten note. After comparing the handwriting on the spot, it was found to be completely the same as the handwriting in the secret report. They immediately took him back to the police station. After repeated questioning, he confessed to the false accusation. He claimed that Cai Borong had previously worked in his shop, but after he set up his own Yusheng Customs Brokerage, he took away all of his clients, causing his business to plummet. He had no choice but to resort to this tactic to vent his hatred. The police station, considering the matter to be a false accusation, will send him to court for trial.

### Yu Geng and Chen Guowei Harmed Patriots; High Court's Interrogation Showed Continued Evasiveness

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The High Court held a preliminary hearing yesterday morning and a hearing in the afternoon for the case of Yu Geng and Chen Guowei. Yu Geng's father, Yu Daxiong, had served as a counselor in the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce and was later killed by our patriotic heroes. However, Yu Geng did not wake up but remained stubbornly attached to the enemy's military police force, serving as an informant. In July of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], Major Shen Yizhi of the Xi'an Central War Affairs Training Corps was dispatched to Shanghai to recruit students to receive training in the interior. His brother, Shen Suizhi, was a classmate of the second defendant, Chen Guowei, and leaked this information. Chen then colluded with Yu Geng to secretly report to the enemy military police on North Sichuan Road and lured Shen Yizhi to the Cosmopolitan Ballroom on July 11 of that year. The enemy military police, who had been lying in wait there, arrested Shen, and he was soon killed. Later, Yu Geng was transferred to serve as the chief clerk of the Nantong Branch of the puppet Political Security Bureau and the chief of the Special Higher Section of the puppet Danyang County Police Bureau, holding these positions until the enemy surrendered. After the victory, Shen Qin-sun, the father of the victim, reported the two to the authorities, and they were arrested. Yesterday, he personally appeared in court to describe what happened and requested redress. However, the two defendants still evasively denied framing Shen Yizhi. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further questioning.

### Retirement Fund for Six Major Public Utilities Agreed Upon Yesterday at the Social Affairs Bureau

The retirement fund for workers in public utilities in this city has encountered many twists and turns. For example, in July, the British Tramway Company had seventy-two employees requesting retirement, requiring a large sum of money that the company could not afford. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau specially convened representatives from six major public utilities, including the British Electric Water Company, Gas Company, Water Company, Telephone Company, French Water and Electricity Company, and French Tramway Company, to hold discussions. Director Wu presided over the meeting. After three hours of heated debate, a draft of the regulations was drawn up as follows: (1) Employees requesting retirement should be over 60 years of age, physically weakened, and unable to work. (2) If they are under 60 years of age but are indeed physically weak or unable to serve, they should be certified by a doctor. (3) Retirement funds totaling less than 5 million legal tender should be fully paid. (4) For retirement funds totaling 7.5 million legal tender, the excess of 2.5 million should be paid at 70% of the amount. (5) For retirement funds totaling between 7.5 million and 10 million legal tender, the excess should be paid at 50% of the amount. (6) For retirement funds over 10 million legal tender, the excess should be paid at 35% of the amount. (7) The number of people requesting retirement each month should not exceed one-tenth of the company's total monthly salary. (8) The above regulations are temporary in nature, and permanent regulations are still under discussion. It is reported that the above regulations will be submitted to today's municipal meeting for approval.

### U.S. Surplus Materials, Latest Machinery Help Develop Post-War Industry; Hsing Chung General Zhenru Machinery Factory Training Technicians

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Hsing Chung General Machinery Assembly and Repair Factory hosted a visit for the city's press yesterday morning. The factory is currently located on the former site of Jinan University in Zhenru. All kinds of engineering machinery and parts are U.S. surplus materials. Approximately 20,000 to 25,000 tons have already been shipped to the factory, approximately 50,000 tons have been unloaded in Shanghai, approximately 30,000 tons are moored on ships in the harbor, and in addition, there are 48 ships of machinery already en route to China, so the total number is quite considerable. These machines are already surplus materials in the U.S., but for our country, they are still new things. The factory's work includes four items: (1) Ensuring that all machines are available for use. (2) Assembling and completing various scattered machines by category. (3) Introducing the most suitable machines wherever needed. (4) Fully supplying the necessary fuel, lubricants, replacement parts, and tools for the use of various machines. As for training, the most important thing is to understand all aspects of technical talents and workers who can use the machines. Currently, many students from Zhongda, Jiaoda, and Su Gong are receiving training at the factory, and there are already more than 200 artisans. All work is gradually being carried out. Yesterday, the person in charge of the factory, U.S. engineer Mr. Heath, guided the tour of various parts and various oiling machines, cranes, mobile workshops, sprinklers, road repair machines, mud-digging machines, etc., and the trainees demonstrated their use. Machines were piled up like small hills everywhere on the site. Although most of them were mottled and rusty, they were still valuable materials for our backward country. According to Mr. Heath's words to reporters, the factory is determined to work in shifts to ensure that it is working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without a moment of leisure.

### Car Dealer Threatened with Extortion; Police Arrest One Perpetrator

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] On the morning of July 7, two men in military uniform and carrying weapons suddenly came to the Jinxing Car Dealership at No. 251 Zhongzheng East Road. They claimed to be the sixth team in the Jinghu District Garrison Headquarters and said that they were ordered by the team leader to arrest the boss, Li Yuanchun (also known as Li Zhizhu), because he had provided all kinds of transportation to the Ling Zhong team leader in the puppet organization, but discriminated against their team, which was very hateful. At that time, they were very fierce. After the shop assistants politely told them that Li had gone to Suzhou, they even took out guns to intimidate the assistants and automatically went up and down the building to search for about 20 minutes before leaving. The next night, a man named Zhang Guansheng came, pretending to inquire about the matter, and then offered to mediate. Three days later, Zhang came again and said that he had reached an agreement with the front, and that ten gold bars were needed to settle the matter. Li's wife and others repeatedly pleaded to reduce the amount. On the 14th, they first collected 1.3 million legal tender in cash and a check for 700,000 (dated the 20th) and sent them to Zhang Guansheng at No. 15 Tonghe Lane, Beijing Road, agreeing to pay another 5 million on the 25th at the same place. Afterwards, the shop owner returned to Shanghai from Suzhou and, together with lawyer Ma Junshuo, reported the matter to the Huangpu District Police Station. The police station arrested Zhang Guansheng on the 25th. During the interrogation, Zhang confessed that he was instructed by Zhang Ximing, who lived at No. 148 Shuntian Village, Chengdu Road. His accomplices were Cai Dezhong and Yang Zhimou. He had previously served as the puppet village chief of Xulu Township, Chuansha County. Cai Dezhong and Zhang Ximing had set up the Zhentaihua Company at No. 15 Tonghe Lane to cover up their enemy activities. It is reported that the main culprit, Zhang Ximing, is at large, and the police are pursuing him.

### Instructions for Using UNRRA Soybean Flour

UNRRA has recently shipped soybean flour as part of its relief food supplies. Misunderstandings can easily arise if the proper methods for consumption are not known. Soybean flour differs in nature from ordinary wheat flour, as it contains no gluten and has a low starch content, so it cannot be made into bread on its own. However, it is very nutritious. As for methods of consumption, when making steamed buns, cookies, cream soup, egg rolls, vegetable rolls, and meat rolls, soybean flour can be mixed with other flours at a ratio of 20%. A small amount of soybean flour can also be added when cooking porridge. It can be made into soy milk by mixing it with water, cooking for ten minutes, and adding sugar or salt. A certain amount of soybean flour can also be added before stir-frying fish or meat. Stored in a dry, cool place, it can last for a long time.

### Dispute Over Xinben Girls' Middle School Premises; Student Representatives Fly to Nanjing to Petition

[Report from this newspaper] Xinben Girls' Middle School, located at No. 57 Zhengjia Lane, West Ames Road, has been established for nine years. Recently, a dispute over premises has arisen because the landlord, Jin Handing (Director of the Third Inspection Group on Military Discipline of the Military Affairs Commission), has forced them to vacate. On July 6, when Xinben Girls' Middle School Principal Shen Ming returned to his hometown to attend a funeral, Jin took back all the premises and forbade students from entering. When Principal Shen heard the news and rushed back, the flag of the "Office of the Third Inspection Group on Military Discipline" was hanging high at the school gate. According to Principal Shen's statement to our reporter: When the school premises were rented, the landlord voluntarily advertised for tenants in the newspaper. At that time, because Jin Handing was not in Shanghai, everything was handled by his agent, Li Liang, who received a transfer fee and a large rental deposit. In previous years, the landlord had acknowledged five times that the school had difficulty finding new premises and allowed it to postpone the move. This time, the landlord gave no written or verbal notice before the end of the year and suddenly took back the premises, which is unreasonable in terms of both sentiment and reason. The school had sent representatives to plead with him several times, but Jin replied: "It is definitely impossible to run a school here. You should all transfer to another school as soon as possible!" But in these days of the school's most serious panic, to banish a group of students outside the gate of "Xinben," where do you ask them to go?

It is now learned that ten representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Joint Association of Primary and Secondary Schools, including Jiang Jizhou, Yang Yushen, and Yu Chuanding, flew to Nanjing yesterday morning to petition the authorities on this matter.

### Yuan Dunli Flies from Nanjing to Peiping; Remarks Before Departure; Entrusted by the Ministry of Education to Hire Several American Physical Education Teachers

[Report from our Nanjing Office] Yuan Dunli, President of the National Northwest Normal College, flew from Nanjing to Peiping on the morning of the 31st. Before his departure, he spoke to our reporter about his observations on the recent state of physical education in America, which is summarized below: In addition to studying education in America, Yuan visited and inspected twenty-nine physical education departments at American universities, five health education departments, two military academy physical education programs, three physical education colleges, eight county and city health education programs, three physical education facilities at veterans' hospitals, and nine research institutions concerned with child development. He also spoke with 400 people involved in health and physical education in America. The theories of American physical education have not changed.

Physical Education During Wartime

However, in order to adapt to the needs of combat, the army, navy, and air force have increased physical education training, with four to five hours of physical training per day, with a four-month period to complete the task and purpose. However, after the end of the war, this training was stopped and normalcy was restored. In addition, physical training for wounded soldiers was implemented. Each veterans' hospital had physical education instructors who used physical training and various recreational activities to keep the wounded soldiers happy and quickly restore their health. According to surveys and statistics, this can shorten the hospital stay of the wounded soldiers by one-third. Regarding the recreational activities of the American public, including sports, as well as art, labor, and music, public officials mostly go to recreational venues and public recreation centers in their spare time for beneficial physical and mental recreation. In terms of dance, American folk dances, Old America Dances, and Square Dances, have been revived, with dancers wearing ancient costumes and graceful movements. Modern dance is also very developed.

Physical Education

Yuan was entrusted by the Ministry of Education to hire American physical education teachers. After consultation with American physical education celebrity Mike Le, it was decided to hire five male teachers and two female teachers (emphasizing skills), and a cable was sent to the Ministry of Education through the embassy in early April to request remittance of travel expenses. When he returned to the country, he did not receive a reply, so he could not confirm it. After returning to the country, he learned that the money had been remitted in mid-June, but it was too late. Moreover, the current cost of living in our country is three times higher than in the United States, and the restoration of various schools is not yet fully underway due to transportation limitations. Therefore, the planned hiring of American physical education teachers will have to be delayed.

Lectures by Celebrities

Yuan contacted American physical education celebrities Mike Le and William to come to China to give lectures. Mike is currently in charge of physical education in Iowa, but due to pension issues, he cannot come to China on his own. Our country needs to request a leave of absence from American schools on his behalf. If he can come to China, he will come to China in the summer of 1947 to give lectures for half a year, but it is necessary to gather senior physical education practitioners in our country in advance to prepare for listening to and studying the lectures. The research topics are approximately physical education curriculum, human kinetics, physical education theory, physical education testing, and methods of physical education research. William is a professor in the physical education department at Columbia University and has now retired. If he comes to China, he can stay for one or two years. He is deeply aware of the hardships of China's war of resistance and its economic difficulties, and he hopes to find funding from the United States to come to China to work. However, it is first necessary to conduct a survey of the state of physical education throughout China and then formulate a national physical education plan, and to convene twenty or thirty senior physical education personnel to engage in lectures and research work. In addition, the American physical education community is enthusiastic about supporting our country. Under the leadership of Nasp, a fundraising campaign has been launched in the United States to donate physical education books to our country.

### National Games to Be Held Next Year on Double Tenth Festival; Location: Either Northeast or Nanjing; Ministry of Education Plans to Establish a National Central Stadium

[Report from our Nanjing Office] The World Games of 1948 will be held in London, England. Although we have already sent a letter to Dr. Wang Tingbao in the United States to represent us at the preparatory meeting for the World Games to be held in Venice in three years, our country must make full preparations for the future National Games in order to participate. Therefore, it is necessary to convene our country's National Games. The Ministry of Education also discussed this matter at the last meeting of the Sports Committee. Because there is not enough time this year, it is planned to hold the National Games on the Double Tenth Festival next year. Some advocate holding it in the Northeast, because holding it in the Northeast is more deeply meaningful, and the venue and personnel are more convenient. Others advocate holding it in Nanjing, but the Central Stadium has been completely destroyed. If it is held in Nanjing, it is necessary to quickly repair the venue. As a result of the discussion, the matter was handed over to the Sports Committee for special handling. In the future, it will be held in either the South or the North.

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 1st] The Ministry of Education plans to establish a National Central Stadium in Nanjing after the autumn of this year and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for an additional budget to facilitate its implementation.

### After Nine Years Away, Hu Shih Returns to the Old Capital

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Peiping, Song Shaobo

The cultural capital, which had lost its luster after a long period of occupation, has clearly gained a lot of vitality with the illustrious return of Hu Shih. Upon arriving in Peiping, Mr. Hu immediately took more than an hour to have a lively conversation with reporters in Peiping.

A little after five o'clock in the afternoon, Dr. Hu walked into the room, saying "Sorry, sorry!" while repeatedly clasping his hands in greeting. His face was full of smiles, and he seemed even more shy than he was nine years ago. Dressed in a gray silk long gown, silk trousers, and black shoes, and constantly waving a folding fan, his scholarly demeanor was now tinged with the air of a diplomat, which was something that wasn't there before. Fu Sinian, wearing shorts and a short-sleeved shirt, sat opposite him, adding a lot of humor to the on-site conversation, trying to chime in from time to time and help Dr. Hu out of some tight spots. In the end, he got Hu's eldest son (Zu Wang) to rescue Mr. Hu and get him out of there.

Mr. Hu made a very good impression on the reporters. First, he didn't use official jargon. Speaking of his departure from the old capital, he said with some emotion: "Two days after the July 7th Incident, I left Peiping to attend a meeting in Guling. On July 28th, Peiping fell. That day I went down the mountain to Nanjing. On September 20th, I flew to America from Hong Kong. This time, my return is exactly nine years later. The schools in Peiping have suffered little damage, and the scenery is still the same. I am very happy, especially since I have seen almost all of my old friends today. But my old friends Qian Xuantong, Ma Yuzhao, and Meng Sen (Xin Shi) have passed away."

(1) On Freedom, in Light of the Li-Wen Bloodshed Incident

Regarding the affairs of Peking University, Mr. Hu pushed everything onto Fu Sinian, thanking him for the assistance. As for national affairs, he said that he had been away for nine years and knew too little, so he would have to be a first-year student for a year and read nine years' worth of newspapers before he could speak. The topic then turned to the Li-Wen bloodshed incident. "I am not familiar with Li Gongpu, but I have been old friends with Wen Yiduo for more than ten years." He praised Wen's academic achievements, lamented Wen's death, and, moved by emotion, began to talk about the issue of freedom. He said: "People should have a spirit of tolerance, that is, Tolerance. One must have freedom for oneself, but must also respect the freedom of others. For example, I, Hu Shih, am an atheist, but I should fight for the freedom of belief for those who believe in God. Freedom of belief, expression, and speech is indispensable. The spirit of freedom of the Anglo-Saxons in Western Europe is valuable. This was the spirit of Peking University in the past, where Gu Hongming taught with a queue [Manchu hairstyle], and Liu Guanghan organized a security association for the royalist party and gave lectures as well, without excluding each other. This is the glorious and great legacy of Cai Yuanpei. Peking University will definitely continue to maintain this spirit in the future." Mr. Hu asked the reporters to promote this spirit.

(2) In General, China Has Progressed

Mr. Hu reminded people not to doubt the future because of individual trivial matters, and even more not to be pessimistic. He said: "In general, China has progressed." He gave an example: "In Nanjing, Mr. Wang Shijie and Mr. Zhu Jiahua both held tea parties for me. At these tea parties, I saw Communist Party members such as Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu participating. At the first United Nations General Assembly, Dong Biwu also represented the Chinese government. In Beijing and Shanghai, there was Communist Party intelligence circulating on the market. These are all symbols of progress, and I hope they will continue to develop." On this issue, Mr. Hu recalled that Mao Zedong seemed to have been an auditor at Peking University, but Fu Sinian interjected, saying, "No, no, we shouldn't take credit for that! Fan Wenlan was a more prominent scholar at Peking University."

Because they were discussing freedom, some reporters asked, for example, about the Shanghai Wenhui Bao being suspended for a week. Mr. Hu said that according to American practice, if one feels oppressed, one can sue. Then someone asked about the prospects for the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Before Mr. Hu could speak, Mr. Fu Sinian chimed in again. A reporter then said, "We are asking Mr. Hu, please Mr. Fu do not speak at this time." Mr. Hu then repeatedly said that Mr. Fu was his agent, but still avoided the question: "We who do historical research need to make a big deal out of small things, extending from a small problem to others. This problem is too big to examine."

(3) Two Major Obstacles to Vernacular Chinese

Someone asked Mr. Hu to review the New Culture Movement. He said: "This problem is too big to say, but I feel that in the New Culture Movement, there are still two major obstacles in front of vernacular Chinese. First, the government is too unliberated. Even now, official documents and telegrams are still written in classical Chinese. The second is the news media. Six or seven out of ten of the current newspapers are still written in classical Chinese." Mr. Hu believed that it would be perfectly fine to use vernacular Chinese for all of these, and he praised the vernacular news telegram from Puyang in the Ta Kung Pao as an example. He strongly advocated using vernacular Chinese to create one's own literary style and express one's own opinions. The language used in broadcasting is even more important. He said: "I saw an article by Mr. Hu Xiansu in the Ta Kung Pao the other day, and he actually used fifty or sixty sentences in vernacular Chinese in it! This is truly a great pleasure for me, Hu Shih!" Hu Xiansu was one of the strongest opponents of vernacular Chinese.

Because they were discussing vernacular Chinese in newspapers, some people asked Mr. Hu to criticize the Communist Party's newspapers. Mr. Hu said: "I haven't been to the Liberated Areas, so I can't comment." Then someone asked: "If you have the opportunity, will you go?" "I will definitely go!" At this time, Mr. Fu Sinian chimed in again: "When you go, you must ask Miss X to be your guide because Miss X has been to Zhangjiakou." The so-called Miss X was the person who asked Mr. Fu not to speak. And Miss X said: "Mr. Fu has been to Yan'an, so the guide should be Mr. Fu!" A small dispute was overshadowed by another question: "What do Americans really think of China?"

(4) No Change in US Policy Towards China

"The United States' policy towards China has been consistent for more than a hundred years. Although individual different views have been expressed, the basic policy of the 'Open Door' has not changed." Mr. Hu then explained the "Open Door" policy: "This is not equal benefits, but rather not allowing any one country to dominate China, because that would cause war. The majority of Americans hope that China will succeed in becoming a modern, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous country, so that there can be equal opportunity. The fact that someone with exceptional talent like Marshall came to mediate the problem is a reflection of this policy."

(5) He Wrote Poetry to Advise Zhou Zuoren

Mr. Hu stated that he would not criticize Zhou Zuoren, because "it would be painful to say anything to an old friend of many years at this time," especially when he is about to be sentenced. Mr. Hu said that at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he wrote a poem to Zhou, advising him to go to the rear, and Zhou also responded with a poem, saying that he could not leave now, but hoping that he would be believed that he would not do anything to let down his friends. Both poems were published in the newspaper by Zhou Zuoren.

(6) The Future is Long, Ask Me Less for Now

A female reporter asked Mr. Hu whether his criticism of women's university education in China was appropriate. Mr. Hu stated that the question should be left to experts to discuss, but said that the liberation of Chinese women was a great page in history. The least beautiful Chinese women in the past have now become one of the most beautiful women in the world. Seeing several female reporters present, he said that there are not as many female reporters in the United States as there are male reporters, but there are more female teachers than male teachers in primary and secondary schools. In China, men and women still do not have equal opportunities.

There were too many questions, and Mr. Hu felt that he could not answer them all, so he finally said: "I will not leave Peiping for a year or two. The future is long, ask me less for now." He said: "Shui Jing Zhu is my hobby, and has nothing to do with the War of Resistance, democracy, or peace. What I studied in America was the history of Chinese thought. The English lectures can be printed after a year. Doctors don't allow large-scale lectures. At the same time, it is difficult to maintain order, so it is best not to give lectures to avoid trouble." At this time, his eldest son came to urge him to leave. A female reporter joked: "Are you Hu Shih's son?" because she remembered Dr. Hu's poem "My Son." (July 29, 1946)

Brief Report on Civil Administration

### District Offices Reassigning Service Personnel; City Government Promulgates Three Salary Payment Methods Yesterday

Regarding how to handle the reassignment of service personnel because the salary scales of Class A districts were higher than those of Class B districts, the Civil Affairs Department submitted a report to the City Government for instructions, which were approved as follows: "Upon inspection of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Salary Comparison Table for District Security Personnel previously promulgated by this government, the salary scales for all levels of personnel are based on qualifications, which are inherently flexible and can be adjusted. As for reassignments, they should be handled in accordance with the Civil Servant Appointment Law and the Civil Servant Grade Regulations." The instructions are as follows:

If they are promoted to a higher position or as a supervisor, they may be promoted by one grade. (2) For those reassigned from a Class A district to a Class B district, regardless of whether they are reassigned to their original position, promoted to a higher position, or as a supervisor, their salary grade, even if it has been approved by this government during their tenure in the Class A district, should still be in accordance with the comparison table and should not exceed the highest salary grade stipulated for their original position in the Class B district, so as not to affect the budget. However, the original salary approved by this government during their tenure in the Class A district may be retained, and they may still be paid at the original salary grade if they are reassigned to a Class A district or other units of this government. (3) The salary for assistant staff members does not differentiate between Class A and Class B districts, and is uniformly compared from Grade 11 to Grade 8 of the commissioned rank.

### Q&A on Doubts Regarding Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)

(9) Q: Taking a concubine cannot be registered as a marriage, but how should their children be registered?

A: The registration of concubines should be in accordance with Article 12 of the Instructions for Filling Out Forms, which stipulates that concubines taken before the implementation of the Family Law of the Civil Code should be filled in as concubines, and those taken after should be temporarily filled in as family members. The children born to them should be registered as legitimate children only after they have been recognized or raised by the biological father in accordance with Article 1065 of the Civil Code. If the concubine is the head of the household, she does not need to be recognized in accordance with paragraph 2 of the same article.

(10) Q: How should Muslims who have only received religious education and studied Arabic be filled out in the education level column?

A: In the education level column, fill in "Studied Arabic for several years."

(11) Q: How should those who have received ordinary or professional training in central or local agencies and those who have graduated from various military academies be filled out in the education level?

A: If there is no academic qualification, those who have graduated from central training institutions should be temporarily regarded as having a university degree, and those who have graduated from provincial and county training institutions should be regarded as having a high school or junior high school degree, respectively.

(12) Q: According to regulations, those who are employed or serving in the military should be listed in the unemployed column, but how can the true number of unemployed people be clearly understood?

A: When compiling statistics, those who are studying and serving in the military can be replaced with different codes. When filling out the form, the three categories of unemployed, studying, and military service should be combined and recorded in the table, and the number of students and military personnel should be noted in the remarks column to easily understand the true number of unemployed people.

(13) Q: People's occupations and education levels change from time to time. After the first registration, how should changes be filled in?

A: After the first registration, when there are changes, stickers can be attached to the relevant columns. If there are further changes, the original sticker can be removed and a new sticker can be added so that there are no errors in the statistics.

### Quenching Thirst with Plums, with the Leftover Cloth; Old Illnesses and New Symptoms of the Cotton Cloth Industry; High Interest Rates and Heavy Pressure Force Closures

[Report from this Newspaper] Since the turmoil caused by the "Six Bonds Public Debt", financial institutions have tightened credit, which has hit factories and stores that usually rely on overnight loans and discounted bills for capital turnover. The impact has not yet subsided, and the cotton cloth industry is one of the hardest hit. Since the enemy and puppet regimes forcibly purchased yarn and cloth, inventories have been depleted. Only those stores that focus on operating silk, satin, woolens, and newly produced cloths and threads can barely maintain their business. However, due to the losses from forced purchases, their vitality has been greatly impaired, and their situation is not as good as before. Taking the three famous "Xiang" stores as an example, the quantity of their inventory and manpower is far from comparable to the past. As for wholesale stores, many have closed down. Those that have not removed their signs either intend to retain their qualification as a cotton cloth store to wait for an opportunity, or still hope that the government can fairly return the surplus of yarn and cloth that was forcibly purchased by the puppet regime. Among them, the three "Rixin" stores, which have always been praised by local and foreign merchants, are no longer what they were. Rixin Zeng has long been taken over and now sells general merchandise (including cotton thread products); Rixin Sheng's door is half-closed, looking bleak, almost like a desolate temple; and Rixin Chang has long been closed. According to sources from the Cotton Cloth Industry Association:

A Matter of Life and Death: Whether or not the confiscated yarn and cloth can be returned is a matter of life and death for the industry. It is still planned to make repeated efforts to make a strong appeal to the relevant parties. During the industry's decline, only the Zhengjia Bridge and Nanyang Bridge areas have seen a considerable number of newly emerging cloth stores with smaller scales in recent years. For several months before a month ago, there was superficially a period of activity. But since the "Gongda Cotton Cloth Store" ran aground, rumors and panic spread, and the market became very cautious. Based on the nature of small profits and quick turnover, the capital is too heavy and the interest rates are too high, so there is really nothing left to profit. Since the financial situation at the end of June changed, financial institutions tightened credit.

Lack of Capital: Those who are most affected in the cotton cloth industry are mostly these kinds of stores, because the reason why they have small profits and quick turnover is partly because they have to keep turning the capital over as many times as possible. Moreover, a part of them borrowed short-term loans to order foreign goods. The loans are now due, and creditors are demanding payment.

Order Cancellations Lead to Collapse: The crisis has been brewing, and Gongda is one example. Recently, another "Xiang" store has run aground, but its impact is not as great as that of Gongda. However, both those in the industry and those outside the industry are very disheartened. According to talks with those who are worried about the industry, interest rates are now too high, and what businesses in the industry earn is often not enough to cover the interest.

Spinning and Weaving Separation and Distribution: If spinning mills set up distribution points everywhere in other provinces, the road for merchants in the industry will become narrower. In this situation, with both internal and external strikes, it is really not a good situation. Recently, a large dyeing and weaving factory, with 200,000 yuan of capital that could not circulate, was forced by the Guanggang [Cantonese business community] to run aground. Therefore, the merchants are also wary of dyeing and weaving factories. According to informed sources, the factory is expected to resume operations soon. Dyeing and weaving factories are, after all, factories with real strength, which are different from shell stores, but they plan to implement measures to save expenses. According to sources in the financial industry, the most welcome for lending now are yarn factories, while the joys and sorrows of dyeing and weaving factories and the cotton cloth industry are in inverse proportion to the yarn factory industry.

### Gold Yarn Rises

Yesterday, the price of raw silk gradually stabilized. The industry and the Cantonese business community absorbed some of it, and it gradually improved. It opened in the morning at 1,872,000, and the levy did not change significantly. It struggled for a long time at around 1,870,000. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 53 items at a price of 1,867,500. After that, it was mediocre. Near noon, the currency situation, the industry, and the Cantonese business community paid the levy, and it rose to around 1,880,000. As a result, it rose by 5,000 compared to the previous levy. Gold ornaments and silver were flat, the silver dollar fell, and the dark discount was also set. The interest rate was around one-tenth and three-hundredths.

The opening trend of foreign currency was promising. Although the morning opening price of American yarn was below 2,500 yuan, arbitrage activity was continuous. The process gradually increased slightly in an extremely stable manner. At noon, the price rose to 2,520 yuan. In the afternoon, it was stable and unchanged. As a result, it rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous close. The arbitrage price for gold was calculated to be 746 yuan per ten taels. The Hong Kong dollar was initially flat and then stable, with sellers from the US dollar side. As a result, it rose by another 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still constrained by the report of 182 from Hong Kong, remaining at 550 yuan to 555 yuan. Indian exchange rates were mostly traded at 665 yuan. Both British and American exchange rates were calm and unchanged.

### Government Bonds See Some Trading

Government bond trading became more active, with slightly stronger demand. However, general bonds remained in a state of confusion. The morning opening was at 760 yuan, and a certain store on the 5th floor briefly became active. It fell from 770 yuan to 720 yuan, but rebounded near noon, hovering around 750 yuan. As a result, it closed the same as before. Class A, B, and D all rose by 10 yuan. General Bonds were the most colorful, continuing to rise by 40 yuan.

### China Trust Purchases Vietnamese Rice; First Batch Has Arrived in Shanghai

Second Ship Expected Next Week

[Report from this Newspaper] The French postal company's cargo ship Ying Guang'an, carrying 2,500 tons of rice from Saigon, a total of 25,000 bags, arrived at the port the day before yesterday evening and was docked at buoy No. 11 on line No. 2 of Yi Wharf. Unloading began yesterday. According to the company, the second ship, Auguste Ciavec, also loaded 1,500 tons of rice from Saigon and set sail yesterday, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Monday. The above mentioned foreign rice was all purchased by the Central Trust Bureau.

### 10,000 Yuan Notes; If Found; Definitely Counterfeit

A news agency reported that 10,000-yuan-denominated banknotes had been discovered in Shaoxing. According to the person in charge of the competent authority, the so-called 10,000-yuan banknotes are all rumors. The banknotes issued by the government still have a maximum denomination of 2,000 yuan, and there are currently no plans to issue new banknotes with denominations larger than 2,000 yuan. If these 10,000-yuan banknotes are discovered, they must be counterfeit or have the denomination altered.

### Refined Sugar Tightens

Yesterday, although there were goods shipped out from Chaoqing in the city, because they were destined for Zhong, the market price showed a firm trend, with offers increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The Shantou business community opened with Grade A refined sugar at 19,000 yuan, and Huanggang Qing was at 85,000-86,000 yuan, up by 1,000 yuan, and the next grade was at 84,000 yuan, with 200-300 bags traded. The Jian business community opened with Grade A Refined Sugar at 87,000 yuan, and the next grade was initially at 500-6,000 yuan, with 100+ bags traded. The Xinghua business community opened with the top grade Gongfen white at 134,000 yuan, and the middle grade was at 127,000-128,000 yuan. The Guangzhou business community opened with Louzhuang Pianqing at 77,000 yuan and Xiangzhuang at 80,000 yuan, with dozens of pieces traded.

### Xing Siyuan Rises

Because Xinghua Siyuan has been lacking in arrivals recently, and most merchants are holding firm, the market trend has turned upward. The top-grade Siyuan opened yesterday with an increase of about 10%. Other Quanzhou Tong'an goods have also tightened accordingly.

### Yarn and Cloth Remain Sluggish; Raw Cotton Rebounds

Yesterday, the yarn market was slightly more stable. The Guangzhou business community slightly increased their buying volume, but the amount was limited. Shuangma was priced between 1,280,000 and 1,290,000 yuan. The sales of small and medium-sized yarns remained sluggish, and prices continued to soften by about 10,000 yuan. 16-count yarn fell by about 20,000-30,000. People's confidence remained weak.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton wire suddenly soared by another 200 pounds. The prices were: the recent American gold was $33.74, the new long-term cotton was $30.85, and the current price of Midtlin cotton was $43.53. The two Shenxin factories in this port purchased Midtlin grade wool raw materials. Other factories remained on the sidelines. Stimulated by the sharp rise in American cotton, the market price rose by about 1,000-2,000 yuan.

The cloth market remains sluggish, and the market in other provinces is also weak. Merchants stand by and watch, so trading is very sluggish. The broadcloth market price is decreasing step by step. The China Trust's bidding continues unabated, and the chips are greatly loosened. It is becoming more and more difficult for the market situation to rebound. However, there are few high-quality goods, and the Seven Guardians have slightly absorbed them. The rest have fallen across the board. At noon, Bianjian opened for sale, with prices falling by 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan compared to the last time. There were few buyers.

### Financial Stability Maintained Throughout the Week

[Report from Our Newspaper] The financial situation in the city this week can be described as calm and stable, with no significant issues in the banking sector. On the final day of the week, the city's clearing house exchanged a total of over 63,000 checks. The total value of the exchanged checks was over 144 billion yuan. The total number of returned checks was over 2,000, with a value of approximately 3 billion yuan. These figures did not show any significant change from the usual daily operations and were all within normal ranges.

### Powerful Players Maintain Control with Ease: Evergreen Cotton Stands Out

Chinese stocks continued to follow the trend of the previous days. Evergreen Cotton stood out, while American-Asia plummeted. Major, influential players continued to manipulate the market with ease. However, after Evergreen Cotton reached a new high, there was a feeling that the market should be suppressed, and some inventory was released, causing a slight dip. During the day, Evergreen Cotton reached a high of 745 yuan, while American-Asia hit a low of 3,650 yuan. The three smaller stocks saw a balance of supply and demand, and the market wavered. The stock market has deviated from its normal path, and the chaos may continue to increase. Compared to the previous close, Evergreen Cotton rose another 20 yuan, while American-Asia fell by half. Among the three smaller hot stocks, Jingfu remained stable, while Xingguang and Qinxing saw slight declines. Among the less active small and medium-sized stocks, some gained and some lost. Established stocks remained stable.

Foreign stocks saw the emergence of a major player, Dacheng, who was waiting patiently to buy up shares of Ewo Cotton, which was the most eye-catching. Other stocks were also passively boosted. There were rumors that Ewo Brewery had a large amount of stock dumped from Hong Kong, but this was not confirmed. Ewo Cotton opened at 8,800 and rose to 9,700 before settling. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ewo Cotton rose by 10%, while Ewo Brewery remained unchanged. British and Chinese Corporation and Asiatic Petroleum Company each rose by about half a percent. Paper and Guangzhou also rose, but not by much.

### 7,000 Loads of Cooking Oil to Arrive Soon; Director Wu Meets with Oil Mill Representatives

Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau met with representatives Li Tingdong and Zhang Decheng yesterday morning to discuss the cooking oil situation in the city. He inquired about the reasons for the price fluctuations, and the representatives provided a factual report, detailing the mill's distribution methods, organization, and targets. Director Wu expressed satisfaction with the distribution system. As for how to suppress the rising prices, Director Wu believed that two measures should be taken: to streamline the source and increase production. The former involves the city government directly contacting the production areas to request assistance with exports, while the latter involves requesting the power company to make every effort to supply electricity. It was also learned that the mill had shipped 1,000 loads of crude oil from Hubei to Qingdao yesterday. At the same time, China Edible Oil Corporation loaded 7,000 loads at the same location, which will arrive in Shanghai soon.

### Rice Merchants' Appetite Greatly Reduced; Both Japonica and Indica Prices Decline

Yesterday, the total registration of goods and customers in the North and South rice markets reached 5,838 stones, with 3,702 stones in the North market and 2,136 stones in the South market. Rice merchants' appetite was greatly reduced, with supply exceeding demand in both markets. Rice merchants were reluctant to buy, and the market was in a slump. Prices fell across the board, with Japonica rice dropping sharply by 2-3,000 yuan, and Indica rice lacking buyers, continuing to fall by 3-4,000 yuan. Customer prices dropped by 4-5,000 yuan. The source of new Japonica rice was just over 100 stones, with a further drop of 3,000 yuan. The flour market was stagnant, with retailers watching and waiting. Imported flour continued to be sold, with morale low, dropping by 3-400 yuan. Although there were inquiries about wheat from Ningbo, transactions were few. There was a lack of transactions from Fujian and Shantou, and the market weakened by 4-500 yuan. Bran also followed suit, dropping by 1-200 yuan. Soybean production prices were high, with limited sources. There was some slight buying, and the market seemed firm, with a trend towards stability. Raw peanuts dropped by 1-2,000 yuan. The oil market was sluggish in the early morning, with a sharp decline. The market closed with a rebound due to excessive price drops and production prices being unreasonably low. Retailers replenished their stocks, and the market recovered. As a result, it was stronger than yesterday. Soybean cake sales were sluggish in rural areas, with some inquiries from Taiwan, and the market remained firm. The peak season for fertilizer sales is yet to come.

According to Director Wang of the Ministry of Food, this year's harvest is guaranteed, with the exception of Sichuan. The autumn harvest in the Yangtze River region could reach over 80%, the highest in 30 years. New grain has already entered the market in Guangzhou and other places, and grain prices have generally fallen across the country, with Chongqing being the lowest. Superior glutinous mountain rice is only 16,000 yuan per old peck.

Zhejiang is expected to have a bumper harvest this year, and rice prices have recently fallen from 45,000 yuan to 34,000 yuan. New rice from Zhuji is being sold at 25,000 yuan per stone. It is said that the rice produced in the counties along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is not only abundant but also has firm grains, due to the even rainfall and suitable temperature.

### Dagong Expands Business, Prepares to Build Spinning Mill

Dagong Textile Printing and Dyeing Machinery Manufacturing Company recently held its 17th shareholders' meeting, resolving to increase capital and expand its business. At the same time, the name was changed from Dagong Weaving and Dyeing Factory to its current name, and it is preparing to build a spinning mill. In addition to manufacturing some of the spindles in its own machinery factory, it has also ordered spinning machinery from abroad.

### Export of Yarn and Cloth to Be Delayed

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that the Executive Yuan will not consider the proposal to resume the export of cotton yarn and cloth for the time being. It is estimated that the production of various factories under the China Textile Construction Corporation and various private yarn mills is still insufficient to meet the demand in the domestic market. Promoting exports at this time would not be a wise move.

### US Commodity Exports To Be Significantly Limited

[Reuters, New York, 1st] According to US news reports, the US Civilian Production Administration will restrict exports and will issue a restriction order soon. It stipulates that manufacturers and wholesalers of scarce commodities whose monthly exports are greater than the average for any six-month period in the first half of this year will be restricted. It is said that 50-60 commodities will be affected by this order. It is still unclear whether the restriction will be based on price or quantity, but the former seems more likely.

### Seventh Preparatory Committee Meeting for Stock Exchange: Broker Qualifications to Be Re-examined; Listing Stock Information Not Yet Fully Submitted

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee held its seventh preparatory committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the stock exchange conference room. All committee members attended, chaired by Du Yong. The broker review subcommittee first reported in detail on the preliminary sorting of over 100 applications from corporate brokers and over 300 applications from individual brokers. It was decided that all applications would be returned to the review subcommittee for a second, careful review. It is said that special attention will be paid to the qualifications and reputation of each applicant. It is expected that this review work will be completed within a week, and then submitted to the eighth full preparatory committee for formal selection, and submitted to the ministry for approval and issuance of broker licenses.

Applications for listed securities have recently been decided to be initially sorted by the listed securities review subcommittee starting on the 10th of this month. More than 100 applications have been obtained, but only more than 20 have been completed and submitted. It is said that this concerns the rights and interests of each factory and company, so applications should be completed and submitted as soon as possible so that they can be collected and reviewed on schedule.

The city's insurance industry association sent a letter to the Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee providing its opinion, believing that the regulations on corporate brokers in the provisional fire insurance rules for the stock exchange should add insurance companies in addition to banks, money shops, trust companies, investment or enterprise companies, and securities companies. The association is also submitting a request to the ministry for instructions. Therefore, the Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee has now decided to file this opinion for future discussion pending instructions from the ministry.

The transaction tax rate and collection method are currently awaiting promulgation by the Legislative Yuan. It is generally hoped that the tax rate should be reasonable and the collection method should be simplified to facilitate transactions.

The internal construction of the stock exchange is expected to be completed in January and has been underway for a week. Telephone lines have been laid to the entrance of the stock exchange and are awaiting distribution and connection. The exact date when the stock exchange will officially open is still uncertain.

### Snippets from Mount Lu

— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu, Our Newspaper, Guling Aviation News

The daughter of the French ambassador went down the mountain to Beijing on the 28th. Madame Chiang Kai-shek specially gifted her two exquisite porcelain rice bowls as a souvenir. These two rice bowls are very beautiful, with red carved dragons on the outside and white porcelain on the inside.

On Sunday morning, there was heavy rain, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek and Marshal Ma and his wife bought rain gear to go to church for worship. The political department specially sent a photographer to capture the scene.

In addition to the part of Marshal Ma's attendants who went up the mountain, there are still many others in the official residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road in Nanjing. Some people go up the mountain to escape the heat, and some people stay behind to endure the heat, which seems unfair, so a rotation system is adopted, with shifts to the mountain.

Mount Lu is a small place, and the main street is less than half a kilometer long. It's always the same few people coming and going. Apart from the summer camp students, one often sees those wearing yellow khaki Zhongshan suits wandering the streets, and one can tell at a glance that they are the chairman's attendants.

Huang Renlin, the director-general of the Lixing Society, is known for "entertaining experts." Director-General Huang is a genius. Wherever he goes, the Lixing Society is exceptionally thorough and wonderful in its arrangements, equipment, and hospitality. Whenever Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart go up or down the mountain, he is there to greet them, but Huang is broad in mind and stout in body, and those around him feel sorry for him. The sedan chair requires sixteen people to carry him, and the bearers complain: "I would rather have eight people carry a widow than sixteen people carry him."

The walking stick business on the street is quite good, with each stick priced at 200 yuan. On the day Luo Jialun climbed the mountain, he bought four sticks and gave them to Zheng Yanfen, Liang Hancao, and Gu Zhengding.

The climate on Mount Lu is very different from that at the foot of the mountain, and there are many people suffering from colds and fever, especially when going up and down the mountain, with the sudden changes in temperature. It is not easy for those who are not in good health to cope.

Important people who climb the mountain dare not stay at the "Hu Jin Fang" Hotel, because they all know that the hotel is known as a press conference, to avoid "trouble."

### The Scenery of Chicago's Lakefront

— Special Dispatch from Chicago, dated the 20th of this month. Correspondent: Mao Shuqing

Chicago, the heart of America, is a distribution center for agricultural and industrial products. This metropolis of 3.5 million people stands on the shore of Lake Michigan. Though it is already mid-summer, Chicago remains chillingly cold. The day I left New York, friends all said, "No need to bring a coat," but upon arriving in Chicago, I was so frozen my nose dripped. On the tram, an American old man stared at me, and after a long silence, said, "Young Chinese friend, don't you have a coat? Though mine is torn, I can take it off and give it to you!" I was extremely embarrassed and explained with some effort: I did have a coat, but I had left it in New York! "I am young, this little bit of cold is nothing," I said.

Center of the Steel Industry

I left New York on a hot afternoon and arrived at Chicago's "LaSalle" station the next morning. The train took a full sixteen hours, crossing one-third of the United States from east to west. This area is the most densely populated and the richest region in the United States. Americans usually refer to the states of Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana as the "Midwest." In reality, spreading out a map of the United States, these states should all be called the East, or Midwest. The reason it has a "West" in its name is because it was named during the westward expansion movement of the 19th century, just as we call Shaanxi "Northwest." Lanzhou is the center of mainland China; Shaanxi is not only not Northwest, but actually East!

Many similar situations can be found in the geography of China and the United States. Chicago is undoubtedly like Wuhan in China. Wuhan is the center of China's water and land transportation, and so is Chicago. Wuhan is the center of China's coal and iron industry, and so is Chicago. In Chicago, opening your eyes, you do not see the skyscrapers of New York, the magnificent splendor of New York, nor the serene elegance of Washington. Although Chicago also has wide roads and green willows along both sides, my impression, no, any tourist's impression of Chicago, is of darkness. Not only are the colors of Chicago's buildings dark, but the elevated trains towering in the center of the roads are all made of dark steel frameworks. One day, I took a tram from the bustling city to 63rd Street to visit a friend. Just as I got off the tram, a gust of coal smoke rushed into my nose. The number of smokestacks in Chicago is absolutely unseen in New York and Washington. The total mileage of railway tracks in Chicago is more than all the railways in New England combined.

Of course, the center of the steel industry should first be Pittsburg (Pennsylvania). During the Civil War, President Lincoln's two biggest supports were Pittsburg and Chicago. This time, traveling west from New York, I bought a "Pullman" ticket. The train traveled along the Hudson River, up to Albany, the capital of New York State, then west along Lake Erie, through a corner of Pennsylvania, into Ohio, and then across Indiana to Chicago. This line is also called the "Horizontal Railroad." When it was built, it was constructed along rivers and lakes, avoiding the eastern hills of Pennsylvania and Virginia, so it did not pass through Pittsburg. Although it took a slightly longer route, it was still economically sound because it traveled faster.

Pullman Train

The "Pullman" train is considered one of the most popular among Americans. Not only does it travel fast and with less vibration, but the seats are also more comfortable. Passengers who are unwilling to spend a lot of money on "sleeper" tickets buy a "Pullman" seat ticket, and at night, turning the seat down can produce an effect quite close to a sleeper car. Therefore, whenever a "Pullman" train departs, reservations often have to be made in person a week in advance. The line for reservations is terribly long, sometimes requiring standing for an hour or two, but many people would rather wait than take another train. In a capitalist society, everything is privately run, and private enterprises create competition in service.

In New York, many Chinese friends were not used to the climate of New York. After arriving in Chicago, I felt that Chicago's climate was even worse. Chicago is humid, and when it is hot, the humidity is so intense that it makes your whole body feel greasy. Also, because it is near the lake, the climate changes easily, and there are many rainy days. I arrived in Chicago at eight in the morning, and by one or two in the afternoon, I was sweating all over. Friends invited me to go boating in Jackson Park. We rowed from the small river in Jackson Park to the shore of Lake Michigan. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, thunder rumbled, and lightning flashed, followed by a downpour. Although the boat did not capsize, several of us were drenched like chickens. That very night, the weather turned strangely cold, and the next day, the residents of Chicago all put on their black overcoats.

Americans or foreigners who are used to living in Chicago know to bring a raincoat when they go out, and many older people carry an umbrella. Generally speaking, Americans in Chicago are more simple and unpretentious than those in New York. If New York symbolizes a world-consuming city, Chicago symbolizes a producing city. In New York's Times Square, the crowds coming and going, though also in a hurry, are mostly pursuing pleasure and seeking consumption. Chicago is not like that. The crowds coming and going on the streets of Chicago all seem to be related to the city's ten thousand factories. On the streets of Chicago, large and small factories are marked with signs, and there are also explanations saying "Welcome to Visit." Large enterprises, such as slaughterhouses, newspapers, printing factories, and printing machine manufacturers, all have special staff to receive visitors. They explain each department and door, increasing the knowledge of the visitors and advertising their factories. Many rural Americans, old ladies, and children, once they have the opportunity to go to Chicago, are determined not to give up these opportunities to seek urban knowledge.

The foreigners in Chicago are not as diverse as in New York. The most numerous are the Japanese, but there are only six or seven thousand of them. They run small businesses, and you can often see them on the streets. During the war, they had no freedom. There are more than three thousand overseas Chinese, and like overseas Chinese everywhere, they form their own district. They created the universally consistent "Chinatown." Chicago's Chinatown is near 22nd Street, less than a mile from the most prosperous downtown area. In Chinatown, there is a standing Chinese palace-style building: "On Leong Chinese Merchants Association," which is much more magnificent than New York's Chinatown. It is said that this building was built during the period of American economic recession, costing $500,000, and is now valued at least at $2 million.

Current Living Conditions of Overseas Chinese

Like other places, overseas Chinese open restaurants and laundries, attracting a large number of American diners with non-Chinese "chop suey" and "chow mein." Machine laundry easily damages clothes, and Americans most admire the "hand laundry" of overseas Chinese laundries. These overseas Chinese, who started with nothing, are the basic cadres of the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association in Chicago. They work diligently, but ultimately lack knowledge. Consul General Chen Changle talked to me about the lives of the overseas Chinese with both excitement and sadness: "They can make money, but after they make money, they gamble. Gambling has become their most important leisure activity, becoming an almost impossible habit to break."

I did not have time to visit the actual situation of the overseas Chinese gambling. I heard a little from several overseas Chinese intellectual youths. Too few overseas Chinese children receive higher education. Many boys, after graduating from middle school, take up jobs as waiters in restaurants, because these jobs earn more money, even more than university graduates.

Of course, there are also overseas Chinese youths who are studying at universities. There are several at the University of Chicago. The University of Chicago is considered one of the best and strictest schools in the United States, along with Harvard and Yale. There are dozens of Chinese students, most of whom come from China. President Robert Maynard Hutchins of the University of Chicago is an educational philosopher. Since the end of World War II, he has consistently advocated "world government," echoing the views of the great scientist Albert Einstein. Students at the University of Chicago, from who knows where, all believe that their president will participate in the 1948 presidential election.

Diverse Universities

In fact, the University of Chicago has not only contributed to the war, but its academic cultivation also has a profound foundation. Oskar Lange, the Polish representative to the United Nations Security Council, one of the world's leading economists, had long obtained American citizenship and lectured at the University of Chicago before he entered politics. The students of the University of Chicago still miss Lange's abandonment of his academic career. The University of Chicago made the greatest contribution to American scholars' research on the atomic bomb. To this day, the gymnasium behind the University of Chicago is still tightly locked with iron gates, "No Entry," because this gymnasium is related to the structure of the atomic bomb. It is also said that the American military still maintains very close contact with several physics professors at the University of Chicago. Mr. Yang Zhenning, a Chinese government-sponsored student studying in the United States, assisted professors in research on atomic theory and was recognized as a promising genius.

The University of Chicago does not have much research and discussion on Chinese issues. It is said that there is a professor named McNair, who specializes in Far Eastern issues. In a lecture on the future of China, he said: After China abolishes extraterritoriality, it will strongly tend towards narrow nationalism. He also said that the Hong Kong issue will inevitably become the focus of the Chinese people's closest attention. He said a lot, all of which were "completely irrelevant," and I don't know where he got his "boundless empty theories" from his research in books.

The most incomprehensible thing for me is that the students of the University of Chicago, regardless of their nationality, all unanimously hate the "Chicago Tribune." This situation was absolutely unimaginable to me before I arrived in Chicago. They said that the Tribune's rhetoric is backward, and the Tribune is a inexplicably outdated newspaper.

The Beautiful Lake Michigan

Originally, I planned to visit the "Tribune" as soon as I arrived in Chicago, because, in any case, it is the newspaper with the most circulation in the history of American journalism. Chicagoans say that the situation has changed now, "Don't you believe it? Look at the Daily News and the Sun, they are so much better."

Another changed phenomenon is that New York newspapers have replaced the golden age of Chicago news in history. Now, Americans in Chicago subscribe to the New York Times, the New York Daily News, or the New York Evening Post. Once, on a lakeside train, I saw an elderly American reading the New York Times. I asked him if he lived in Chicago. He said, "Yes." He said, "Chicagoans reading Chicago newspapers is like drinking a glass of cold water. Reading New York newspapers is like drinking a cup of coffee or strong tea." He asked me if I agreed with him, and I nodded slightly.

The lakeside train stops at the intersection of Randolph Street. Between the train tracks and the lake shore, there is also a wide road, with fragrant grass like a carpet and lush greenery, reflecting the lake scenery of Lake Michigan. This lakeside road is the essence of Chicago and the only embellishment of this dark industrial city. I got off at Randolph Street Station, crossed Michigan Avenue, and returned to the world's largest hotel where I was staying—the Stevens Hotel. After a day of fatigue, leaning against the window sill facing the lake, looking at the rippling blue waters of the lake, there is an unspeakable sense of comfort and relaxation.

### Further Notes on Visiting the TVA

— Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, dated the 16th of this Month, by Correspondent Mao Shuqing

I never managed to visit the atomic bomb manufacturing site. I discussed it several times with Judge Berch of Belgium, wondering whether or not to make a verbal "request." After thinking it over, I always felt that I couldn't bring myself to say it. Even if they allowed it, they would only show us a few buildings. We are not specialists, "Why go looking for trouble?"

There is a lead manufacturing factory near the Fontana Dam, perhaps also due to the convenience of electricity. On the way to the Fontana Dam, we passed a steep cliff, a ten-thousand-foot mountain, with a clear green stream flowing deep inside, like a natural bridge in western Hubei. From there, we could see a small dam in the distance, the Calderwood Dam, also one of the twenty-six, but without a power plant, etc.

The Fontana Dam began construction on January 1, 1942, immediately following the Pearl Harbor incident, a masterpiece of President Roosevelt. It was completed on January 20 of last year, with the project taking exactly three years. Currently, in addition to the dam's power generation room, several pools and viewing rooms are being added, etc. An engineer on the dam, John Monahan, led us on a tour of the various locations. He said that before the completion of the Fontana Dam, there were 5,000 workers working here; now, only 400 people remain. He pointed to the cable suspension bridge erected between two mountains next to the dam, used to transport materials and steam locomotives during construction. He said that after the Fontana Dam was built, a large artificial lake was formed behind the dam. The water source flows from the mountain slopes into the lake, with 35 miles of still water. These 35 miles of natural power are all concentrated on the generators.

The artificial lake is 400 feet deep. John Monahan said that when everything is set up in the future, yachts can be arranged for people to fish. He said that the viewing room can be built in about nine months. I saw rumbling heavy trucks still transporting stone materials, and the dam still had a working atmosphere.

John Monahan took us to the newly arranged market behind, which is a new village in the mountains, called Welches. It is separated from the dam by a mountain. The new village is on the back of the mountain. Now, because the highway is open, coming and going is very convenient. In the new village, there are schools, shops, restaurants, and many "mobile homes," which were originally inhabited by staff and workers. Now that the engineering personnel have left, the government of North Carolina is renting them to tourists. Many Americans who visit the TVA bring their wives and stay here for a week, with rent as high as $40 or even $84 per week.

The existing dam staff all live in the new village. The mountain valleys are better than the city in summer. They work in this paradise and also enjoy the beautiful scenery of this paradise.

Norris Dam

The same situation is the same at the Norris Dam. Norris is 25 miles north of Knoxville. The new village of Norris is more beautiful than Fontana. Many people have moved to Norris specifically to live. They fish, swim, and boat here, enjoying their paradise-like life.

The Norris Dam was one of the first to be started after the TVA was established in 1933, beginning on October 1, 1933, and completed on July 28, 1936. The total cost was about 30 million yuan. The dam is 265 feet high and 1,860 feet long, much smaller than Fontana. The reason for using the name Norris is to commemorate Senator Norris, the father of the TVA. (I will introduce Senator Norris in another article)

The appearance of the Norris Dam is also different from the Fontana Dam. Fontana is located between two mountains, with the dam built on the front and the power plant in the middle of the dam. The Norris Dam is built between two hills, with the power plant on one side of the bank. Cars can also pass over the dam, and a large American flag is flying on the dam.

The Norris Dam has been fully completed. The material of the dam is also steel-reinforced concrete. There is an active iron gate under the dam. When the water level rises during the rainy season, the gate can be opened to allow excess water to flow out freely. Many of the stones used to build the dam were obtained nearby. One side of a stone mountain next to the dam was half-mined.

The power generation of the Norris power plant is also relatively small. The viewing platform has been fully constructed. The artificial lake behind is more beautiful than Fontana. Many tourists have already set out, and young men and women are swimming there. Behind Lake Norris is Norris Park, which has many trees and simple cabins. Many people spend the summer here, and there are also newlyweds on their honeymoon here. Mr. Coleby, a TVA employee who accompanied me on the visit, told me that there is an even clearer place eight miles upstream, where there are beautiful girls who often swim and sing in the summer. Sometimes, they lie by the river to sunbathe, and sometimes, they dance in the lush moonlit nights.

Coleby said: Norris is now not only a paradise for Tennesseans, but also a paradise for many American veterans. After fighting the war, they became government employees and settled with their happy families in this small village in paradise.

The small village has parks, post offices, various convenient transportation facilities, and an inexhaustible supply of electricity, as well as electric lights, electric fans, and running water powered by electricity. The small village now has a Water Resources Administration, a municipal government, and a public assembly hall. Each small family has their own garden, lawn, and vegetable and tomato gardens.

"But," Coleby couldn't help but sigh: "What kind of world was this thirteen years ago?" He said that he had been working here since the second year of the TVA's creation. He served in the military for four years in between, going on expeditions overseas. He had seen the TVA sprout and grow leaves. When he returned from overseas last year, he saw that this great undertaking had blossomed and even borne fruit! (Knoxville, July 16)

### Two or Three Things About Tibet

— Special Dispatch from Peiping, dated the 30th of this Month, by Correspondent Zhang Jianmei

"Political News of Tibet" relates recent news about Tibet as follows: Since Reting Hutuktu resigned, Tibet has been under the regency of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is only fourteen years old this year and cannot yet govern. The old Panchen Lama died of illness in Qinghai on the way back to Tibet. After his reincarnation, the new Panchen Lama's Zunzu has each found a reincarnation in Xikang and Qinghai. Luosang Jianzan, the attendant of the old Panchen Lama, also found a reincarnation in Xunhua, Qinghai, named Guanbao Cidan, who has already been enthroned at the Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai. The Tibetan side plans to take the two reincarnations to Tibet and then hold formal procedures to determine which one should inherit the Panchen. The reason why the central government has not yet given the official title to Guanbao Cidan, the reincarnation of Kumbum Monastery, is because he has not completed the procedures. In Lhasa, the central government agencies now have an office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, a transportation radio station, and a national primary school of the Ministry of Education. Since Shen Zongkang succeeded Kong Qingzong as director of the office in 1944, the relationship between Tibet and the central government has been extremely harmonious. The fact that the Tibetan National Assembly representatives arrived in Beijing before the representatives from various regions is an indication of Tibet's inclination towards the interior. After the Yunnan-Burma Road was cut off, Kang and Tibetan people once organized the Kang-Tibetan Transportation Company, using yaks and horses to transport materials from India over the Himalayas. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, this difficult transportation has ended. Although the Sixth Plenary Session had a resolution allowing Tibet a high degree of autonomy, the Ministry of Interior also convened relevant ministries to discuss this, but due to the ongoing domestic turmoil, this matter has not yet been finalized. Shen Zonglian suffers from heart disease and is not well-suited to the high altitude climate of Lhasa. This time, accompanying the Tibetan National Assembly representatives to Beijing, he has quite a bit of desire to retire, but the central government is currently trying to retain him. After Xirao Jiacuo was blocked from entering Tibet last year, he is now in his original residence in Qinghai.

### Postal Remittance Increased Fiftyfold

Dear Editor: The postal service's remittance fees have always been regulated. In the previous month, it only cost 30 yuan per ten thousand yuan remitted to Jiangdu County in northern Jiangsu, but this month, it suddenly soared to 1,500 yuan per ten thousand yuan, an increase of fiftyfold! This is truly shocking! For example, I am just a basic small clerk, earning a meager salary of 100,000 yuan per month, and I have to send it home to support my family's livelihood. First, the post office strips off 15%, which is truly miserable for us small clerks! I am writing to your newspaper to appeal to the postal authorities! (Huang Gong)

### Smuggler's Fate Uncertain

To the Editor: Three months ago, the Changshu County Government arrested over thirty opium smugglers, but cannot process their cases because the current county magistrate no longer concurrently manages military law. Furthermore, the court has not received orders from higher authorities to handle opium cases. In this situation where neither party is willing to accept the cases, the thirty-odd opium smugglers are being shuffled back and forth with no resolution. I believe that when the government handles cases, there should always be a receiving agency. Although there may be changes in the jurisdiction of agencies, these changes should be seamless in terms of timing. Otherwise, as in the situation described above, wouldn't it be a case of "neither heaven nor earth caring?" (Gan Han)

### Ignored for a Year

To the Editor: During the recent war, Binshan fell first, resulting in countless deaths and losses. Under the enemy's tyrannical power, they forcibly seized farmland to build airfields, driving residents away. The pitiful people, supporting the old and leading the young, fled to other places, suffering from hunger and cold, collapsing by the roadside, and being raped and slaughtered by the brutal enemy—a scene too tragic to bear witness to! Last autumn, our country was victorious, and the Japanese surrendered. The government took over the airfield long ago, but it has been almost a year now, and the national government has not inquired about the plight of the poor disaster victims. These people are also citizens of the Republic of China, and the government should provide relief. They have suffered eight years of hardship and should receive some comfort in terms of food, clothing, and shelter. Then, a thorough investigation of land ownership should be conducted, returning land to those who can farm it, and compensating those who cannot farm it at market prices. We, the thousand-plus disaster victims of Wangbang, have seen enemy and puppet property being seized and relief supplies arriving, but we have always remained silent. Sadly, no one has paid us any attention! We dare to ask your newspaper to represent the thousand-plus disaster victims of Wangbang and appeal to the authorities not to forget this group of pitiful people. (Wu Rende, Yuepu Town, Baoshan)

### Letter from Feng, Township Head of Jinshan

To the Editor: I recently saw in your newspaper's "Reader's Opinions" column on July 26th an article titled "Such a Township Head," purportedly written by a resident of Chashan Township in the Jinjie District of Jinshan County. It stated that "his relatives have repeatedly been framed by the township head using his henchmen, and he requests the authorities to uphold justice and conduct a thorough investigation." However, it was unclear whether the township head referred to was the head of Chashan Township or another township. As the head of Chashan Township, I must make a statement. I have been in office as the head of Chashan Township since December 13th of last year, which is now eight months. In these eight months, I am confident that I have not done anything inappropriate. The letter mentioned "accusing his relatives of being detained and extorted by roaming bandits and disbanded soldiers." This may have happened in other townships, but it has definitely not happened in Chashan Township. Since I took office as township head, I have never dealt with any roaming bandits or disbanded soldiers. As for "detention and extortion," how could that be possible? Furthermore, the township office does not have detention facilities. The claims of "losing over twenty dan of rice" and "the original plaintiff also losing over thirty dan of rice" are unclear as to who suffered the loss. Finally, the statement "fearing exposure and further framing, he was detained again" is unclear as to what it refers to. After investigation, our township has a total of six bao (neighborhoods), with a population of about five hundred households. Although I cannot say that everyone is law-abiding, no one has been imprisoned or detained for committing a crime. Therefore, what the contributor said has no factual basis. Because the letter was signed as a resident of Chashan Township, I fear that distant rumors are inaccurate. I hope you will publish this letter as a correction. (Feng Shuliu, Township Head of Chashan Township, Jinwei District, Jinshan County)

Nowraes Park

The park not only has [blanks] and [blanks] for picnics, but also outdoor cooking facilities. The park covers 3,887 acres and is adjacent to Nowraes Park, overlooking Lake Nowra. The lake is seventy-two miles long and is a great place for boating and fishing. (Special Correspondent Shou Shu, Sent)

### Three Xiang and Seven Ze Swamped with Famine - Wheat Flour Enters Rich Homes and Flows into the Black Market

— Report from Changsha, 21st — Huang Chao Ru

Changsha, which has undergone one fire and four battles, has only the remnants of broken walls and overgrown weeds left from its pre-war prosperity, fully demonstrating its desolation, depression, and poverty. Old Changsha residents speak of the Changsha of the past with a "white-haired palace maid" air. Indeed, today's Changsha is unrecognizable. Although the shops on the main streets have ostensibly reopened, the reality is that behind the shops is a desolate scene, with weeds growing above the knees. Being in it will make you doubt that it is in the wild mountains and graves. Although some shops are decorated luxuriously, the inventory in the counters will never be full. The universal struggle is to be outwardly lively while inwardly suffering, like a woman who has lost her youth, no matter how much powder and rouge she puts on her face, she still can't hide her haggard face.

The Land of Fish and Rice is Plagued by Famine

Changsha's desolation and depression are primarily due to the fires of war. However, cities that fell during the war have gradually moved towards recovery and prosperity after liberation. Why does Changsha still present such a bleak situation? There is another main reason for this, and that is that Hunan Province is experiencing an unprecedented famine this year. With the entire province trapped in famine, how can one hope that this agricultural city will recover its prosperity?

Speaking of famine, in scientifically backward China, everything is conquered by nature, and almost every year, there are one or two places suffering from famine, so it is not a strange thing. However, Hunan is the land of fish and rice, the Three Xiang and Seven Ze, and the Chinese people have always regarded it as the granary of Central China. Not only can it be self-sufficient, but it also has surplus grain to supply neighboring provinces. There was originally the saying that "when Huguang is rich, the whole country is fed." During the Anti-Japanese War, the southeastern half of the rice-producing area fell into enemy hands, and Hunan played a huge role in supplying food to the anti-Japanese army and civilians, earning the honor of being the "anti-Japanese warehouse." However, in today's post-war era, this land of fish and rice is plagued by famine, which is truly surprising.

Relief Officials Register by Township and Bao

The cause of the Hunan famine, in addition to the impact of the summer drought, is mainly the war. Because of the disaster, the people fled together and were displaced to other places, leaving their fields to be deserted. Especially in the mountainous areas of southern Hunan, rice production is not as abundant as in eastern Hunan, Hubei, and the lakeside areas. In addition, because of the abandonment of farmland, there will naturally be a grain shortage. Of Hunan's 30 million people, half, 15 million, are starving people without food. From this spring to the present, in Hengyang and Lingling in southern Hunan, tree bark and grass roots have been eaten, and people have starved to death. In some places, there are more than 20 people per bao. The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has been paying close attention to this matter in order to relieve the Hunan disaster. At first, porridge distribution centers were set up in places where disaster victims gathered in large numbers. Later, it was felt that it was difficult for porridge distribution centers to reach the vast rural areas, and there was a trend of too many monks and too little porridge. Therefore, it was changed to emergency relief, and batches of relief officials were sent out, carrying wheat flour, and distributing relief according to registration by township and bao. This good policy can be expected to make relief universal and prevent disaster victims from traveling long distances to eat porridge and leaving their hometowns. However, there were also many unpleasant incidents at the same time, namely:

Starving People in Changsha are Skin and Bones

(1) The distribution of wheat flour relies on the township and bao chiefs because of the limited manpower of the relief agencies. Among the township and bao chiefs, there are indeed those who are honest and law-abiding, but there are also those who are unscrupulous and commit crimes. Therefore, even though the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is "unable to live without relief," wheat flour still enters the homes of the rich and flows into the black market. Those disaster victims who are fortunate enough to receive some relief items have the feeling that they have received a pound of flour today and will not receive a second time until the year of the monkey. It is not as beneficial as having porridge twice a day. Due to the implementation of "emergency relief," the porridge distribution centers have stopped. Those disaster victims who are unable to return home or whose relief items received in their hometowns are insufficient still wander in the cities and live by begging. Not to mention other counties and cities, just looking at Changsha City, starving people who are skin and bones can be seen everywhere on the sidewalks. Some are on the verge of death, and some have starved to death on the roadside or in the rubble and grass. After a day or two, they are wrapped in straw mats and moved to be buried in the suburbs. This is truly a great irony for the relief work.

Three Thousand Tons of Flour Stockpiled in Changsha and Not Transported

(2) The disaster victims are pitiful and scattered everywhere. They do not know the source of the wheat flour. They are naturally fortunate to receive wheat flour, and they will naturally not ask for it if it is not distributed. The staff of the relief agencies, when distributing porridge, did not dare not put the wheat and rice into the pot on time because the disaster victims gathered together, which easily caused trouble. After the change to "emergency relief," they were happy to handle it calmly. Therefore, although the name is "emergency," it is actually "slow." Thus, ten days ago, there was a phenomenon of three thousand tons of wheat flour being stockpiled and not transported in Laodaohe, Changsha. The total amount of wheat flour distributed to Hunan by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is only one thousand tons per month, but three thousand tons are stockpiled in Changsha and not transported to the disaster areas, which is really puzzling. Fortunately, the "Hunan Disaster Emergency Relief Association," organized by local impartial gentry, found out about the matter and held an emergency meeting at Chairman Wang's official residence, and only then were the three thousand tons of wheat flour gradually transported out.

Autumn Harvest is Hopeful, Disaster Relief Cannot Be Relaxed

Regarding disaster relief in Hunan, some say that it is coming to an end because the new grain is approaching the time of harvest. The rainfall is still favorable this year, and the famine in Hunan will naturally be eliminated after the autumn harvest. This observation is roughly 90% or more true, so everyone thinks that the disaster relief in Hunan can be brought to an end after one or two months of effort. In fact, this view is too optimistic. This kind of optimism will give people more painful disappointment. For example, during the Anti-Japanese War, everyone thought that everything would be swept away as long as there was victory. Therefore, there was no plan for post-victory recovery at all. Who knew that the hardships after recovery were even worse than during the war. Those who are optimistic that Hunan will be in good shape after the autumn harvest will certainly fall into this bitter situation.

Now, let's first talk about the recovery of rice harvests in Hunan Province. In normal years of bumper harvests, the figures announced by the government are 121.6 million hectoliters, while consumption is 115.94 million hectoliters. Adding miscellaneous grains, the surplus rice in Hunan Province will not exceed 4.5 million shi.

This Autumn Harvest is at Most Only 70%

Although the rainfall in Hunan Province is favorable this year, the harvest will definitely not be full. First, there is too much wasteland in the recovered areas that could not be replanted in time. Second, the rainfall in early spring was unfavorable, and spring plowing was delayed. Land that could be harvested twice a year will have at most only the hope of harvesting once this year. Third, there is a general lack of plowing cattle, fertilizer, seeds, and other plowing resources everywhere, and there is no ability to increase production. Fourth, many strong men have been conscripted and killed in battle, or have not yet been demobilized, reducing the number of people plowing. Fifth, the disaster victims who are desperate for food are so widespread that it is difficult to save the dying, and they can only let the fields be abandoned. Sixth, the rural economy has collapsed, and many farmers have abandoned agriculture to switch to other industries, further reducing the ability to cultivate. Based on this estimate, there will be at most only a 70% harvest this year. However, the period of the western flood has not yet passed, and the water level in Shashi has exceeded the highest record of previous years. The fords in Gong'an and Shishou have already had water flowing back into the lake, and the embankments around the lake are in imminent danger. If there is an accident, the harvest is still not guaranteed.

The Fundamental Plan is to Quickly Resume Plowing and Reclaim Wasteland

Even if heaven grants our wishes and we can have a full harvest of 70%, then it will only be enough for consumption in the province. If a part is exported to offset the economy of goods imported from outside the province, then there will still inevitably be starving people. Furthermore, a bumper harvest is reaped by the landlords, and the starving people mostly belong to the tenant farmer class. Now, the practice of buying green grain is prevalent everywhere. One stone is borrowed, and two to four stones of grain are repaid after the autumn harvest. Looking forward to the harvest, they are all exploited. If there is another "cheap grain hurts farmers," then there is no need to say more. In this situation, who can guarantee that there will be no disaster victims in Hunan after the autumn harvest!

Based on the above views, we believe that the disaster in Hunan is just beginning to surge. In order to achieve the goal of eliminating the Xiang disaster, we cannot but hope that the wise provincial authorities will make a far-reaching fundamental plan. Quickly find ways to resume plowing and reclaim wasteland; actively manage the Yuan and Zi rivers; agricultural loans should simplify procedures and actually reach the hands of farmers. Finally, the 25% rent reduction should be implemented earnestly and quickly in Hunan. If this can be done, then there is hope that the disaster in Hunan will be eliminated by next year.

### Dispute Between France and Siam

— Gao Shiheng

Recently, since France has re-entered Vietnam, it has used the excuse of searching for rebels to invade the Siamese border. Siam also refuses to give in and rises up to resist, while appealing to the United Nations Security Council. In recent developments, France has clearly expressed its intention to reclaim the land it demanded from Siam in 1941, with the additional condition of demanding that Siam hand over a statue of the Emerald Buddha obtained from Lang Prabang in 1778. Although the world is at peace, the earth is still full of the smell of gunpowder. The dispute between France and Siam is an Asian affair. Unfortunately, we are unable to care for ourselves, and we cannot take care of it. The Chinese people are relatively unfamiliar with this issue, so I have written this article to resonate.

We must first understand that although the history of Siam's establishment is only over six hundred years, it is a small country. Before the Pacific War, it was the only completely independent and autonomous country in Asia. Siam was called Thailand before the war and renamed Siam after the war. The Thai people initially established the Nanzhao Kingdom in Dali, Yunnan, China, and dominated the southwest. In 1254, it was destroyed by the Yuan Dynasty, and the entire tribe moved south, driving out the Khmer people and occupying the current land. According to historical records, it went through the Sukhothai Dynasty, the Ayutthaya Dynasty, the Thonburi Dynasty, and the current Chakri Dynasty that rules Siam. At its peak, its territory included not only the mainland but also western Vietnam and northern Malaya. Since 1824, it has signed commercial treaties with the United Kingdom, which was the prelude to Europeans entering Siam. Since then, diplomacy has been eventful, and the history of the past hundred years has been almost entirely written for Europeans. Since King Rama I of the Chakri Dynasty, it began to lose land, first to Burma, then to Vietnam. Since the influence of Britain and France extended into the Indochina Peninsula, Siam became a battleground for the two countries. Until the last cession of land in 1910, for 113 years, it had only carefully dealt with the land demands of the two countries, especially the frequent demands of France, which made Siam's territory shrink day by day. At the end of the First European War, Siam and Britain and France re-signed treaties to abolish extraterritoriality and become an independent and free country. The changes in Siam's territory over the years are summarized as follows: (1) In 1785, Burma invaded Tenasserim and the three places of Tan Lao and Tavoy and invested them in Burma. (2) In 1791, the vassal state of Shihburi signed a contract with the United Kingdom to lease Penang Island. (3) In 1801, the United Kingdom continued to lease a piece of land opposite Penang Island, which the British called Willsley. (4) In 1805, it ceded Ha Tien (southwest of Saigon) to Vietnam. (5) In 1812, Vietnam extended its power to Cambodia and annexed it, but it was returned to the Siam territory in 1807. (6) In 1828, it ceded Meong Puan to Vietnam. (7) In 1868, it signed a contract with France, and Cambodia was placed under French protection. (8) In 1874, it signed a contract with the United Kingdom, and Preak was ruled by the United Kingdom and became one of the Malay states. (9) In 1887, it ceded Sibsongchvthai and Hvapantanghok to France. (10) In 1889, it ceded the land northwest of the Nu River, Lanna, which is the department of millions of rice fields, to the British. (11) In 1893, France sailed its navy into Bangkok and signed a contract to cede Luangprabang and Viengchan to France. (12) In 1903, it ceded the land on the west bank of the Mekong River and Champasak to France. (13) In 1906, it ceded the eastern territory of the borders of Battamban, Siemrap, and Sisbon to France. (14) In 1909, it ceded Kedah, Kelantan, Tringan, and Perl to the British and incorporated them into Malaya as the reward for the United Kingdom canceling extraterritoriality in Siam.

Therefore, Siam lost land 14 times from 1785 to 1910. According to Siamese historians, Cheli near Yunnan, China, was also once under the jurisdiction of Siam, which is a mistake. After checking, Cheli was pacified by the Yuan Dynasty in 1300, and the Cheli Military and Civilian Chief Executive Office was established. Cheli is also written as Cheli, and this country includes Cheli and Simao. Sometimes it also has its southern border, which is not outside Yunnan Province. (Feng Chengjun's "A Study of Lost Lands in the Western Regions and the South China Sea" translated by Georges Maspero's "Study of the Countries of the Vietnam Peninsula in the Early Song Dynasty") Then Cheli was already under Chinese territory during the Yuan Dynasty. The author hereby makes a statement. (Attached Siamese border map)

Secondly, when the Second World War started, Siam was pursuing nationalism and demanded that France recover the land on the right bank of the Mekong River on the grounds of recovering lost land. France refused the request, and there was a Siam-Vietnam war. At that time, France was sweet in the war and had no time to look east. Japanese forces were extending into Siam and Vietnam, openly claiming to be the masters of Asia, and came out to stop the war. A border demarcation meeting was held in Tokyo, and Siam and the Vichy government of France signed a treaty, dividing the following two places to Siam.

(1) Between 1000 to 1020 degrees east longitude and 1050 to 200 degrees north latitude, that is, the land on the upper reaches of the Mekong River from Ban'Khwak near ChiengKhong in the north to Lvang Prabang in the east and south to Ban Pak Hoeang.

(2) Between 1010 to 1050 degrees east longitude and 1230 to [blank] degrees north latitude. That is, the middle reaches of the Mekong River from near BanPakmvn south through Bassac to the lakeside near Sisobon (excluding Angkorva and the lake), and then down to include Battambang and Moung to the city of Trht near Khaosaming.

When the Pacific War started, Siam was instigated by Japan to assign the four states of Kedah, Kelantan, Tringan, and Perlis to Siam. After Japan surrendered, the above four places were returned to Malaya. Speaking of the Emerald Buddha, it has a close relationship with the Chinese people. This treasure was originally owned by Wiengchan, also known as Vientiane (between 1020 degrees east longitude and 180 degrees north latitude on the right bank of the Mekong River), the lord of Lang Prabang, and it is a treasure of the town, carved from jade. In 1778, a Chinese Siamese king, Zheng Zhao, known in Siamese history as the Thonburi Dynasty, took it from Vientiane, the lord of Lang Prabang. This Chinese king was from Chaozhou. He grew up in Siam and worked in the Ayutthaya court. When foreign enemies invaded, King Zheng was in the army, driving away the enemies, suppressing the lords, and unifying Siam. Therefore, he was supported by the Siamese people as king and officially ascended the throne in 1768. The king was still martial and far-sighted, and the prosperity of national power was a creation in Siamese history. In 1781 (the forty-sixth year of Qianlong), he sent an envoy to China to be recognized as a Chinese vassal. In 1787, a rebellion broke out in Vientiane, a vassal state of Lang Prabang, and its rebel ministers fled to Wubun on the border, and the Marquis of Vientiane crossed the border to capture and kill them. The king believed that it was a violation of the king's power and sent troops to attack it, breaking its capital and obtaining a world-renowned treasure, the Emerald Buddha, which was placed in the Bangkok Palace. From this campaign to the end of 1893, Lang Prabang and Vientiane always depended on Siam.

The above is the cause of the mutual contention between France and Siam for land and jade Buddha. We observe from an objective standpoint that the land disputed by both sides originally belonged to Siam, and it is not without a standpoint for Siam to take it back. France's reason is that the treaty on the cession of land was signed by the Vichy government in 1941 under the pressure of Japan and cannot be recognized, which is also reasonable. It also opposes the intervention of the United Nations and is willing to negotiate directly between the two sides. However, we cannot deny that in the past, France ruled Vietnam, and the general absurd colonial officials treated the natives like cattle and horses, subjecting 20 million Vietnamese people to slave life. After the war, France allowed to raise the status of the colony and made Vietnam a member of the United Nations. We believe that this progressive attitude is beneficial to France. After China surrendered to Japan, it received the area north of 16 degrees north latitude in Vietnam, and Vietnam has a close historical relationship with China. The Chinese people are certainly concerned about this issue, but the way to solve it depends on how both sides develop, or whether the United Nations accepts Siam's application and is subject to the judgment of justice. As for the Jade Buddha, Siam has preserved it for more than a hundred years and is respected by the Siamese people who are devout Buddhists, so France really does not need to take it back, so it is just a minor issue.

### Taiwan Miscellany

— July 27th Taiwan News from the Sea. Special correspondent: Jiang Muyun.

The staff assigned to Taitung, Penghu, Hualien Port, and the remote mountainous areas are unwilling to take office, posing a major problem for the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. Not only are the personnel trained by the Department of Civil Affairs and the Police Department unwilling to go, but even the trainees trained by the Accounting Department are unwilling to leave their hometowns.

The person in charge of the Department of Civil Affairs personally felt that this situation was similar to when Chief Chen was in Fujian. After strict restrictions, it slowly disappeared. However, the inconvenience of transportation within the province is a reality, and the situation in Taitung is not comparable to that of other counties. Therefore, two measures have been formulated: (1) Assigned personnel are not allowed to decline or delay their posts; (2) The department will stipulate a system of rotation and mutual transfer. The Accounting Department will send personnel to remote areas and areas that require more accounting personnel to hold recruitment exams, or entrust the local county and city governments to administer the exams on their behalf.

Chen Wei Guan pointed out the reason, saying: During the Japanese occupation, the employer class mostly hired local people, mainly because they considered that small employees could not afford the expenses and travel costs of moving their families. Therefore, they did not transfer employees below the rank of appointed officer, but could transfer those above the rank of recommended officer, but they must be given family relocation expenses.

Cutting Expenses, Implementing Layoffs

Recently, in order to cut expenses, the Taiwan Provincial Government has implemented layoffs in various agencies. The main targets of the layoffs are civil servants who are not maids employed by various agencies and office workers with poor performance.

The Food Bureau laid off 31 people at once, including the Chief Secretary, section chiefs, and employees. Some had even received commendations. These 31 people were dismissed for "inefficient work" by Lin Zhencheng, the Deputy Director of the Bureau, who is acting as the Director. In addition to reporting to the superiors, they also filed lawsuits in court. Wu Changtao, who was assigned as a special commissioner to the Beiping Food Bureau, had to rush back to handle the bureau affairs.

The Police Chief solemnly issued a warning, saying: "It is hoped that various agencies will reduce administrative personnel as much as possible, and the fewer personnel managing factories and warehouses, the better. Because they are familiar with the internal situation, once they are laid off, they are more likely to become thieves, which is more difficult to prevent."

In fact, although there were recent incidents in Taipei such as a robbery of 100,000 Taiwan dollars from an employee of the Monopoly Bureau and a robbery at Miaochun Hospital, public security has clearly returned to normal. However, petty theft is still rampant everywhere, because there were already many unemployed people, and recently, the remnants of the reorganized army and laid-off personnel have been added. They are forced by life and have no choice but to take risks.

Taiwan's Special Products, Urgently Needing Relief

According to Zhao, the director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Taiwan's special products are now in urgent need of relief from the authorities:

Pineapple – In 1940, the annual output was 621,159 boxes. This year, it is expected to reach 10,000 boxes. The Bank of Taiwan has agreed to lend 17 million yuan, which is no longer a problem.

Tea – Last year, more than 2 million catties of tea were in storage and could not be sold, and the cost was stranded. It is planned to be purchased by the Bureau of Foreign Trade, and the previous 60% commodity tax rate has also been reduced to the same as in China.

Bananas – This year's output in Taichung is about 450,000 baskets, totaling 10,000 metric tons that can be sold outside the province, and it is urgent to promote sales outside the province.

Prohibition of Logging – The five-year ban on logging has created two difficulties: one is that the equipment of logging merchants is not utilized, and the merchants suffer losses; the other is that it increases unemployment. The former can utilize equipment to transport wood stored in the mountains, while the latter can initiate work-for-relief programs to allow loggers to engage in forest water management and repair drainage ditches.

Transportation Relations, Greatly Lacking Coordination

Taiwan's transportation has been isolated from the rest of the province for three weeks this month. It has become a veritable isolated island. Fortunately, three Liberty ships have arrived in succession, and the runway at Songshan Airport was repaired on the 19th, and air transportation between Shanghai and Taiwan has been opened up again.

Regarding the airport issue, Commander Zhang of the Air Force District said that the ground equipment of Tainan Airport—dormitories and radio stations—welcomed the China National Aviation Corporation to borrow them, but the China National Aviation Corporation did not borrow them. Instead, it brought its own wireless equipment from Shanghai, which resulted in a considerable delay. Chief Chen said, "How can we succeed if the two sides cannot cooperate?"

The Customs hopes to take over the Keelung and Kaohsiung Port Bureaus, and the Executive Yuan also has an order. The customs warehouses, waterways, and signs belonging to the Customs have long been taken over by the Customs. Currently, the government believes that the ship measurement and inspection matters handled by the Port Bureau are not related to the Customs. Therefore, it has decided on two solutions and will choose one: either telegraph the Ministry of Transportation to bring Taiwan's ports under the unified jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, or wait until the restoration project is completed in one or two years before transferring it to the Customs.

Chief Chen said: "I hope that all units in the province must maintain close contact and cooperate fully, and do not make the same mistakes!"

### Old Case of Traitor Killing His Wife, New Spoken Drama Performed

[Special News from Huzhou on the 29th of This Month] The Kai Ming Truth Spoken Drama Troupe in this city has recently adapted the real event of "Traitor Xu Yushun Murdering His First Wife" from Huzhou last year. It is currently collecting relevant materials and will be performed as soon as rehearsals are complete. The actual event is summarized as follows: Xu Yushun, a native of Jiangsu, 35 years old, served as a regular patrol officer in the Wuxi Police Bureau before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the Wuxi Regional Headquarters of the Puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Pacification Army, serving as an adjutant. In the summer of 1939, the unit was transferred to Huzhou and reorganized into the Puppet Army 5th Division. Xu was promoted to lieutenant colonel regiment adjutant, and his prestige was greatly enhanced. Ah Mao, the daughter of a Shen from the Telephone Bureau, found him young and handsome and took her as a concubine, forcibly occupying No. 5 Aishan Street as a love nest. Later, Xu committed many evils and was discovered by Cheng Wan-jun, who ordered his dismissal. In June of the first half of the year, Ah Mao incited Xu to have a murderous intention towards his wife. One night, he summoned his wife home to burn opium for her (Xu had a deep addiction). His wife, Wu Yinghua, believed him and went to Xu's residence. Xu then tricked her to the well and instructed his younger brother to strangle his wife with a rope. He guarded the body until midnight and moved it to a mulberry field near Guanghua Bridge, where he dug a hole and buried it, intending to destroy the evidence. The next day, the body was exposed. Cheng Hao, the director of the Puppet Wu and Fan Bureau, a seasoned special agent, investigated in all directions. Within a few days, the case was revealed. The murderer and his brother, as well as his concubine, were arrested and taken to the bureau to await a decision. At that time, news of the Japanese surrender had reached Huzhou, and the relevant authorities were not in the mood to handle the case. However, Cheng Wan-jun, the commander of the Puppet Army 1st Division, deeply hated Xu's inhumanity. After questioning, he tied Xu Yushun and his brother to the execution ground and shot them on the day the Japanese left Huzhou. Xu's concubine was released because the officials of the Puppet Famine Relief Agency fled one after another. The case disappeared without a trace. (Chen Han, Contributor)

### Answering Readers, Legal Questions

(1) Zhou Jinbao asks: The landlord, surnamed Chen, owns five mu of paddy fields in the tenth room. A farmer invested 80,000 copper coins (when the rice price was 5,000 to 6,000 per stone). The farmer and his son have been farming and paying rent for more than thirty years and have never defaulted on rent. In recent years, the Chen family has often borrowed rent in advance. The fact that the seed money has been repeatedly increased and the government's 25% rent reduction law shows its utmost care for tenant farmers, which is admired all over the world. Now the Chen family landlord ignores the damage to the poor farmers and wants to redeem the five mu of rented land for 250 legal tender (not worth one liter of rice). May I ask how much money is needed to rent other people's land at this time? Many tenant farmers have no land to cultivate, and this situation is very common in the countryside. I dare to ask legal experts to comment fairly and the government to give guidance to help the poor farmers, which would be a great merit.

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] What you are asking about, is it a lease right or a permanent tenancy right? If it is a lease right, it should be handled in accordance with the lease section of the Civil Code's Law of Obligations; if it is a permanent tenancy right, it should be handled in accordance with the permanent tenancy section of the Civil Code's Law of Property, and the Land Law may also be consulted.

(2) During the period of Miao He Nian, 660 legal tender was borrowed to a business established by a friend in 1929 (at that time, the business issued a passbook and stated that the interest rate was 1.2% per month). Up to 1936, 210 legal tender was settled, without calculating interest. Later, repeated requests for repayment were made. The August 13th Incident broke out, and the business closed down. At that time, the principal issued a receipt for collection, stating that it would be repaid the following year. During the occupation period, this person held an important position in the puppet fishery market and was repeatedly asked to repay the debt, but it was repeatedly rejected by the special forces at that time. Now that the sun is shining again, I wonder if the current law has any provisions for repaying the principal and interest proportionally based on the price of goods (or the cost of living)? Please provide guidance and answers.

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Regarding the situation you asked about, you should refer to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits After Restoration. The court should fairly weigh the matter and increase or decrease the payment. (3) Xiang Songnian asks: My relative, Xu Jun, has two brothers. In 1934, due to the death of both parents, they invited relatives to discuss the division of property and signed a "division agreement," each holding a copy. The agreement stated that a formal division deed should be made within one year. Later, the two brothers went to other cities to make a living, which led to the delay in the formal division deed. Now the elder brother announced that the formal division deed should be signed immediately. The younger brother expressed his agreement upon hearing the news. However, the elder brother overturned most of the clauses in the division agreement signed in 1934. The reasons he gave are:

First, the division agreement is a temporary contract, and the agreement stated that a formal division deed should be signed within one year. After one year, the agreement will naturally not have legal effect. Second, the clauses in the agreement are not suitable for the current situation. Therefore, the formal division deed should be revised to show rationality. Third, the agreement was signed more than twelve years ago and is now just a waste paper. I am a close relative of the Xu brothers and was one of the witnesses when the division agreement was established. Unfortunately, more than ten years have passed, and the other relatives who were witnesses have all passed away. What should be decided?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) If it is of a preparatory nature, it cannot be said to be naturally invalid; (2) (3) Amendments to the clauses require the consent of both parties.

### Chang Detang Pharmacy, Reducing Fees to Benefit the Poor and Sick

Selling each prescription for 1,000 yuan

Editor: Recently, I saw in your newspaper that the Xinzi National Drug Store in this city is distributing 10,000 doses of medicine according to the proven lung disease prescription of Director Zhang Xishen of Fengxiang County, Shaanxi, and donating them to the poor and sick. Those who do not wish to receive the donation will be charged a cost price of 1,000 legal tender per dose. The retail price of prepared herbs is inherently different from the wholesale price of drug stores, and according to the price list issued by the guild, arbitrary increases or decreases are not allowed. Therefore, although our store has the intention to follow suit, it is unable to do so due to the regulations. Now, an anonymous philanthropist, moved by the ambition to help those in need, has instructed our store to sell them at the standard rate of 1,000 yuan per dose, and he will bear the shortfall. Our store, for the benefit of the people, respectfully accepts the offer and will start selling from August 1st. Those who have doubts about lung disease can consult Mr. He Gongdu of Tai Tang for everything. Respectfully wishing you peace, Zhang Zhi of Chang Detang, No. 235 Jinling West Road, July 31st.

### Childhood Tuberculosis

— Chen Yinhe

Our country does not pay much attention to childhood tuberculosis. Although there are anti-tuberculosis movements, their focus is mostly on adults, and the number of children suffering from tuberculosis seen daily is increasing. Although there are no accurate statistics, according to estimates from general hospitals, patients with tuberculosis sometimes account for more than 50% of outpatient visits; and sometimes even account for 60-70% of hospitalized patients; and the number of children who die from this disease is countless. The most painful and difficult to deal with are tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis. It can be said that there is absolutely no way to cure these two types of tuberculosis. To avoid the occurrence of such terminal illnesses, strict prevention should be carried out in advance. It must be known that children are the vitality of the nation, and maintaining the health of children is maintaining the vitality of the nation; the premature death of children is a new wound to the vitality of the nation, and also a loss to the country.

Cause of Disease

Tuberculosis is a special and most common infectious disease, and its main cause is the invasion of tubercle bacilli into the body. Other factors such as malnutrition, poverty, overwork, polluted environment, impure air, insufficient sunlight, insufficient sleep, and suffering from pertussis and measles reduce resistance. This can be said to be the remote cause of tuberculosis. Children are most susceptible to the invasion of tubercle bacilli. If parents have tuberculosis, especially the mother, who has the most contact with children, and they do not know how to isolate themselves and continue to feed food mouth to mouth or kiss, how can infection be avoided? Others such as wet nurses, nannies, or close relatives who have contact with children also have the possibility of transmitting the disease.

Symptoms

Tubercle bacilli are divided into two types, human and bovine: the former is mostly transmitted through the respiratory tract, and the latter is mostly obtained from milk. The resistance of tubercle bacilli is extremely strong outside the human body. In places with insufficient sunlight, poor air circulation, and darkness, they can survive for months or even years, but they die within a few days under the scorching sun. The route of their invasion into the human body can be divided into three places, namely the respiratory tract, digestive tract, and skin. The latter is the rarest. The affected area may be limited to one part or spread throughout the body, depending on the strength of each person's physique and the amount and toxicity of the bacilli that invade. Their invasion of the human body is not easy to detect during the incubation period. It is not until the disease develops that symptoms appear, and the symptoms of children are not as obvious as those of adults. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, loss of appetite, irritability, weight loss or no weight gain, and anemia. The difference between childhood tuberculosis and adult tuberculosis is that lymph node patients are more numerous and have strong diffusion, and the course of the disease progresses faster. Early tuberculosis is often easily overlooked, and when it is discovered, the disease has reached a critical juncture. Therefore, the earlier this disease is discovered, the greater the hope of recovery, and the later it is discovered, the less hope there is.

Childhood tuberculosis can be roughly divided into the following three categories: (1) Systemic tuberculosis, including the lungs, abdomen, bones, lymph nodes, and urogenital organs. The final processes are tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis. (2) Intrathoracic tuberculosis can be further divided into primary tuberculosis, hilar tuberculosis, tuberculous pneumonia, pleurisy, and miliary pulmonary tuberculosis. (3) Acute miliary tuberculosis

In diagnosis, family history must first be emphasized in childhood tuberculosis. If there are tuberculosis patients in the family, children are difficult to avoid. Others are tuberculin skin tests and X-ray examinations.

Prognosis

To know the outcome of children with tuberculosis, the following points are directly related: (1) The younger the age, the more dangerous it is, and the faster the disease progresses. (2) The internal and external infection environment is also related. Children with tuberculosis patients in the family may have complications. (3) The location and type of the disease. Patients with tuberculous meningitis and acute miliary tuberculosis have almost no hope. (4) The original physique of the sick child. Those with a strong physique are more likely to recover.

Treatment

There is no specific medicine for tuberculosis to date. The principle of its treatment is to maintain and increase the body's resistance. The most common methods today are as follows: (1) General therapy: The most important of these is rest therapy. Children with tuberculosis must sleep at least ten to fourteen hours every night, rest for a while before lunch, take a two-hour nap after lunch, and rest for a while before dinner. They should not exercise too much. It is often not easy for children to get sufficient rest in the home environment. If there is a children's sanatorium, children can receive education in addition to rest. The second general therapy is fresh air. Everyone knows the benefits of fresh air for tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis should rest outdoors, on the one hand to get sunlight treatment. Sunlight is effective for tuberculous lymphadenitis and tuberculous skin diseases. The third is proper diet. A proper diet should be simple and rich in calories and vitamins. Fresh vegetables, eggs, milk, cheese, and fish are foods rich in nutrients. The fourth is proper medical management. Children's temperature and weight should be paid attention to daily. If symptoms such as colds occur, they must be treated promptly. In short, children with tuberculosis need the guidance of a doctor at all times. (2) Special therapy: The injection of tuberculin has undergone many tests, and the results are not very good, so it cannot be used. The new drug Streptomycin, recently published in American magazines, is said to be effective against tuberculosis. It has had considerable success in animal experiments, but clinically it has only had good results in a patient with tuberculous laryngitis. It is hoped that in the near future, there will be a large number of special medicines for various types of tuberculosis, so as to benefit the patients.

Prevention

Since there is no specific treatment for tuberculosis, and its harm is so great, the most important thing is prevention. Westerners have a saying: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." This is an irrefutable conclusion in medical theory. Childhood tuberculosis should also start with prevention. (1) Treatment for those who already have tuberculosis. Anyone suspected of having tuberculosis should be diagnosed early and isolated. Special attention should be paid to mothers with tuberculosis to avoid infecting their children. Bad habits such as mouth-to-mouth feeding and kissing should be avoided. If the sputum contains tubercle bacilli, it needs to be isolated, as there is a possibility of infection at any time. The patient's sputum, as well as the towels, clothing, and tableware they use, should be disinfected at all times. (2) General prevention: (A) Education: Our country's education is backward, especially in terms of medical knowledge. Mothers chewing food and feeding infants, kissing children, and things like that are often thought of as expressions of love, but in fact they are the media for spreading disease. Unless the public's attention is awakened to its harm, tuberculosis will never be reduced. As for promoting public health, improving parental education, and imparting medical knowledge, these are all urgent tasks at present. Recently, there have been anti-tuberculosis movements and health exhibitions in cities, but they have not yet been popularized in rural areas and small towns. This is something that the government and social figures must be responsible for promoting. (B) Nutrition: Malnutrition, physical weakness, and diseases are prone to attack, so we must pay attention to proper nutrition. However, in China, where production is backward and the economy is bankrupt, it is difficult to promote proper nutrition. (C) Physical examination of children: Physical examinations of children should be performed at least twice a year, which can not only show how health is progressing, but also prevent problems before they occur. The earlier this disease is discovered, the greater the hope of recovery, and the later it is discovered, the less hope there is. This can save children from illness. (3) Special prevention: BCG vaccination has had a great number of reports and has had considerable success in preventing tuberculosis. BCG is a virulent live bacillus that is harmless to the human body and can stimulate the production of immune bodies. Subcutaneous and intradermal injections can reduce the incidence of tuberculosis. Those who have not had tuberculosis and have the possibility of transmission in the family may wish to try it.

Conclusion

In short, tuberculosis is one of the most severe problems in our country today, and its impact is enough to damage the country's vitality and shorten people's lives. The scope of this topic is too broad to be fully described in a few words. What is described above is just the most common common sense, the intention is to arouse the attention of readers, so that tuberculosis will gradually decrease in China, until there is none. This is the author's only wish.

### Child Mental Hygiene: Sleep Problems

— Liu Yueci

Most people with unhealthy minds, eight or nine out of ten, do not have normal sleep. This proves that there is a close relationship between sleep and mental health. "Habit becomes nature," so we must cultivate good sleeping habits in childhood to promote the healthy development of both mind and body. Now, let's first examine the sleep problems of children.

Causes of Insomnia

The causes of insomnia in children are mostly due to illness, but sometimes they are also caused by the formation of bad habits, resulting in the inability to have normal sleep. Newborn infants, if healthy, generally need to sleep about twenty to twenty-two hours a day. Therefore, it can be said that a large portion of an infant's time is spent sleeping. Afterwards, the amount of sleep gradually decreases with age. For example, children around ten years old need eleven or twelve hours of sleep, while adults only need seven or eight hours of sound sleep. Healthy children usually have no problems with sleep. However, some parents and nannies, fearing that their children cannot fall asleep immediately, hold them in their arms, rocking and patting them to make them fall asleep quickly. Once this bad habit is formed, it is impossible to make the children fall asleep without doing so in the future. Therefore, parents who want their children to have good sleeping habits should not be overly affectionate. Just put the children in another room and on another bed at bedtime, and they will naturally follow the routine and fall asleep peacefully.

Bad Practices

Let's cite a bad practice: when children reach the age of five or six, some parents are overly doting and pay special attention to their children's sleep. For example, at bedtime, the mother will lead the child's hand to the bedroom, close the windows tightly to prevent wind from entering, take off the child's clothes, cover them with blankets, and fearing that the child will not fall asleep easily, tell them interesting or surprising stories until the child is tired. Only then does the mother let go of the child's hand and ask if they are comfortable. Then, as if reluctant to leave, she says to them, "Be good, sleep now. Mother is by your side, don't be afraid of anything." In this way, she tirelessly repeats checking the bedding, windows, etc., before tiptoeing away. Imagine, how can such handling of a child's sleep not increase the child's dependence? In the future, they will need these rituals to fall asleep. Also, some children, after being accompanied by their mothers, are afraid that their mothers will leave, so they deliberately show signs of unease. Over time, the child's dependence increases, making the mother who dotes on the child feel that the child's sleep is a serious and difficult problem. The child first has difficulty falling asleep, then gradually develops insomnia, and insomnia eventually leads to various unhealthy psychological states in adulthood.

Many symptoms are commonly found in children during sleep. The most common are:

(1) Nightmares: Children suffering from this condition do not have difficulty falling asleep. What is strange is that they often suddenly shout and scream in fright while having a good dream. The reason is that they have encountered frightening scenes in their dreams, such as being chased by ferocious beasts, robbed by robbers, or climbing mountains and entering forests, etc. After waking up, the children can vividly describe their encounters in the dream and are quite thought-provoking.

(2) Night Terrors: The various frightening expressions after waking up in a dream are not much different from the above-mentioned nightmares. The difference is that after waking up in fright, the children have no recognition of the surrounding environment or people. After their fearful expressions, the children can still fall asleep peacefully. If you ask them the next day what they were afraid of the night before, they mostly cannot remember.

(3) Sleepwalking: This refers to suddenly getting up or walking elsewhere in a sleep state, or doing things that are usually done. For example, a housewife may tidy up the room at that time, and a student may open the cabinet and read medical reports. Although they often have their eyes tightly closed while sleepwalking, they can do very ingenious things. Many people think that sleepwalking is driven by gods and monsters. In fact, sleepwalking, like nightmares and night terrors, are all the same, all psychological symptoms of children related to sleep and have nothing to do with superstition. The most important thing to pay attention to with sleepwalking is to especially reduce the various stimuli in the hours before the child goes to sleep. Secondly, for the sake of the sleepwalker's own safety, make sure they do not live in a multi-story building, so as to avoid accidentally walking down the stairs while sleepwalking and falling and getting injured due to unconscious negligence.

(4) Others: In addition, sleep symptoms such as drowsiness and constant fatigue have many factors. They may be caused by morphine and bromide poisoning or by encephalitis. Psychological sleep disorders, such as excessive laziness in personality, requiring a nap of one or two dozen hours a day, are best discussed with a psychotherapist, which is more beneficial.

In short, sleep can harmonize the health of our body and mind. If there is not enough sleep at night, we cannot work energetically during the day. Children's sleep time should be regular and should not be lenient or exceptional. There is no need to watch over children's sleep as if attending a grand ceremony. Children should be made to see sleep as a simple and natural behavior, so that they know the benefits of sleep. Do not make children fall asleep first as a punishment, as this may make them hate sleep. Do not make children dependent on their parents. Teach them to dress themselves from a young age, and do not use accompaniment and storytelling as hypnotics. In this way, children's sleep disorders will naturally gradually decrease. With sufficient sleep, children's physical and mental development will enter a normal state, and the development of mental health will be without objection.

### Preventing "Milk Malnutrition"

— Fei

Chinese infants often suffer from indigestion, excessive crying, and sallow and emaciated faces after weaning. In summer, they are even more prone to illness due to restlessness and lack of sleep, causing their parents to be uneasy day and night. This is commonly called "milk malnutrition." In medical terms, it is due to insufficient preparation before weaning and inadequate nutrition after weaning, which is actually a symptom of malnutrition.

In China, human milk is the main food for infants, and some even hire wet nurses because their own milk is insufficient. The advantages of human milk for infants are countless, so I will not repeat them here. Infants under six months of age who receive adequate human milk feeding can almost keep pace with European and American infants in terms of growth and development, with no shortcomings. However, after six months, the growth and development of Chinese infants gradually slows down, and even stagnates, which is clearly inferior to that of European and American infants. The author once examined thousands of infants in Changsha, Hunan, and created charts and curves to compare them with European and American infants, and obtained the above results.

Milk is the best and most suitable food for infants, but its nutrient content still has some shortcomings. The most obvious is the lack of iron and several vitamins. Therefore, milk feeding can only meet the needs of infants under six months of age at most. In fact, infants must be given various supplementary foods on time in order to have normal growth and development.

Most Chinese infants rely entirely on human milk feeding, even until they are one or two years old. Such feeding methods not only lag behind in growth and development but also suffer from various diseases due to malnutrition and weak resistance. Infant beriberi, anemia, colds, coughs, diarrhea, etc., are all examples. Just look at these young infants suffering from these various diseases, no wonder their growth and development are far inferior to others.

The prevention method is very simple, just add supplementary foods on time. Supplementary foods are nutritional foods for infants other than milk.

(1) One to Four Months

Infants around one month old should be given orange juice, vegetable soup, dry yeast powder, and cod liver oil to supplement vitamins A, B, C, and D. Orange juice is rich in vitamin C. One-month-old infants can be given orange juice three times a day, one to two teaspoons each time. For the supply of vitamin B, dry yeast powder is often used for convenience, three times a day, half a gram each time. Infants in cities who cannot get sunlight often need to be given cod liver oil, three times a day, half a teaspoon each time, gradually increasing to one teaspoon; or concentrated cod liver oil, three times a day, five to ten drops each time.

(2) Five to Six Months

Infants over five months old gradually have a larger appetite and stronger digestion, and are about to start teething. In addition to liquids, they should be given semi-liquid foods that are easy to digest. Millet porridge, rice porridge, and oatmeal porridge can all be used. Five- and six-month-old infants can be fed porridge twice a day. Initially, one tablespoon each time, gradually increasing to four tablespoons.

(3) Seven to Ten Months

As mentioned earlier, milk lacks iron. The liver of full-term infants stores a large amount of iron, and most of the iron is supplied from this store for the first six months after birth. After six months, the stored iron gradually runs out. If they are fed purely with milk and other nutrients lacking in iron, they will inevitably develop anemia. Spinach, egg yolk, etc., are all rich in iron and can be gradually added. Infants who are eating eggs for the first time must first be given egg yolk. If there is no problem after a few days, then they can eat the whole egg. This is because a few children have allergic reactions to egg white.

Green, yellow, and red vegetables, all colored vegetables, are not only rich in iron and vitamins but also have the function of lubricating the intestines, as do fruits. Seven-month-old infants can eat vegetable puree, and nine- and ten-month-old infants can also eat cooked fruit puree. Vegetable puree and fruit puree can replace orange juice and cabbage water.

(4) Eleven Months to Two Years

At this time, it is time to stop breastfeeding. The method of allocating food is nothing more than reducing the number of meals and gradually replacing the food, from liquids to semi-liquids to various soft foods, to suit the physiological changes of the child and achieve normal development.

The so-called supplementary foods are not to supplement the insufficient amount of human milk or milk but to supplement the insufficient quality of human milk or milk in order to meet the needs of infant growth and development at each stage. If breast milk is insufficient, it should be supplemented with milk. Those who cannot afford to buy milk can buy soy milk to replace it. However, milk and soy milk cannot replace supplementary foods. Using pure milk without adding supplementary foods can cause the same symptoms.

In Chinese society, there are many cases of so-called "milk malnutrition." If it is not corrected early, it can indeed lead to illness or even death. Therefore, with the theme of preventing malnutrition, I have briefly described the principles and methods of preventing "milk malnutrition" to offer to the parents of infants with this condition.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Future of Publishing

— Wang Pingling

When people in Beijing held a meeting to commemorate Ye Gongchuo a few days ago, I was stuck in Chongqing and could not attend. I am writing this article to commemorate Ye's achievements in promoting the Chinese literary movement and donating the manuscript fee to the Ye's scholarship. - Author's note

1. Why Do Publications Lack Sales?

Assuming that, according to the proportion of the Chinese population, one in every thousand people is willing to buy and read books, then a decent book can sell 450,000 copies. But now the average sales of each book (referring to better works) is only 2,000 copies, which means that out of every 200,000 people, only one person buys books. That is to say, if the entire population of Shanghai is three million, then the number of customers for publications is only fifteen. The sluggish sales of Chinese publications are truly shocking! This ironclad fact is right in front of everyone's eyes, and even the "skeleton fetishists" who stubbornly cling to the past cannot be proud.

The sluggish sales of publications prove that there are too few learned and thoughtful people in China. The number of illiterate people was estimated to be over 88% in the past. Whether it has decreased now remains to be seen.

Why do publications lack sales? I think it is definitely not because of the weak purchasing power at the moment, because the sales of publications before the war were even worse than now. Yet the business of imported goods, which are many times more expensive than before, is still particularly prosperous. If we want to find a real explanation for this problem, there are several reasons:

(1) Due to the stagnation of publication sales, manuscript fees are low and royalties are hopeless, which makes writers in various fields unable to live in poverty and affects the content of publications, which cannot keep pace with the times. This directly hinders the sales of publications.

(2) The standard of living in society is too low. Most ordinary people are not forced by the times to the point where they cannot survive without a little knowledge and skills. They can barely survive by relying on raw physical strength and basic experience. They are naturally willing to learn to read, but it does not seem necessary to force themselves to find opportunities to learn to read.

(3) Intellectuals who have left school and mixed in various levels of society rarely apply what they learned in school. At most, they use a few familiar characters for communication, reading newspapers, writing a few satirical poems, or drafting obituaries, inscriptions, and other tools to perfunctorily deal with the current situation! Even common sense is rarely used. More specialized skills and advanced academics are still a noble luxury at the moment. Therefore, the general Chinese intellectual feels that literacy is enough, why bother reading!

(4) The atmosphere in the interior is closed and transportation is inconvenient. New publishing industries are concentrated in major commercial ports and capital cities, making it difficult to spread newly published books and periodicals to remote areas and popularize them in "barren lands" of culture. The villages scattered among farmers, who account for more than 80% of the total population, are such a vast area. But no one has tried to spread "seeds of reading," make efforts to eliminate illiteracy, set up primary schools, or establish rural museums and libraries. Therefore, the vast rural areas of China still follow the ancient traditions and live in a semi-civilized state. Even if you send modern new publications thousands of miles away on time, they will not appreciate them.

(5) Officials and employees of companies and banks in cities, although they also come from schools in the past and are also known as intellectuals, are busy engaging in intrigue, dancing and vying for favor, and appeasing superiors and colleagues, just to perfunctorily deal with official affairs. Where do they have the leisure and ease of mind to review the old and learn the new? Even officials who claim to be experts and scholars admit that they have become rusty and have completely abandoned what they learned in the past after mixing in officialdom for too long!

(6) Some upstarts who made a fortune by taking advantage of the war and national crisis, as well as the pampered wives, concubines, dance partners, and mistresses that these people specially married for fun, everything is for enjoyment, and "enjoyment" is the sole purpose of life. If they encounter erotic treasures that stimulate "sexual function," yellow reading materials that emphasize "eroticism," leg movies, or dramas that allow them to feast their eyes, they may occasionally browse them to relieve boredom when they are tired of playing sand crabs and mahjong. As for all books that are not related to "enjoyment," that is, books that can increase wisdom and improve personal qualities, these people disdain them.

Based on the above facts, we do not need to doubt why the Chinese do not read books.

At the same time, the books piled up in bookstores are worthless bad books, but they are not without patrons. A large number of avid supporters are waiting for them, and there is a reason for this.

2. How Can We Continue Like This?

"Alas! How can we continue like this!" I often hear a few patriotic people who are worried about the world, witnessing the immaturity and decline of Chinese culture, sighing to the heavens. However, this group of worriers only knows how to sigh and does not know what kind of adverse effects this situation will have on society if it really continues. I would like to analyze it further:

(1) Everyone knows that this world war is entirely a war of culture and a war of science. Countries with declining cultures and immature sciences will only perish and will never be spared. If the Chinese are forever proud of their ancestors' legacy and do not catch up with the world's cultural standards or actively improve their scientific wisdom, then the science and culture on which China relies for its nationhood will never have any hope of revitalization.

(2) Some opportunistic and ignorant lucky people, after fooling around in society for some time, can still make a fortune, get promoted, gain fame and wealth, and be supported by the blind and praised by public opinion. Then, no one is a fool, so why bother spending the time used for promotion, making a fortune, and becoming famous in science laboratories, libraries, or writing desks! Anyway, the more profound the learning and the more successful the experiments, the less likely people are to have a way out. It may even be impossible to avoid freezing and starvation. Why suffer for nothing? Since evil is a common "talent" of mankind, who would not do evil if evil-doers are lucky!

(3) The prosperity of science and the establishment of academic disciplines require decades of research and multi-faceted cultivation by the state before they can bloom and bear fruit. It cannot be achieved overnight. Now, a pure academic atmosphere has not been cultivated. Everyone is choosing shortcuts to wealth and seeking quick wealth, or using "anti-social" psychology to create novelty and gain superficial fame. Thousands of fathers and brothers, seeing those people's opportunistic ascents, would rather send their children to banks as trainees and worship powerful families as godfathers. How can society not regard schools as prisons and treat learning as worthless! We only need to understand these three possible crises to make people who care about the world immediately come up with real solutions to save this root cause of national extinction! What's the use of just sighing!

3. How to Save the Publishing Industry's Predicament?

Publishing institutions in the interior have suffered great losses and are on the verge of collapse. During the war, we were fully committed to the final victory and had no time to replant the seeds of spiritual civilization on the barren ruins in order to re-bloom and bear large fruits. At the same time, our international lines were trapped by the Japanese invaders for a period of time, which not only blocked our mutual material assistance but also hindered our spiritual exchange. In the full eight years, new books published in Europe and America, whether in science, philosophy, or literature and art, were almost completely cut off from their source. Culture can only progress through mutual comparison and observation. In such a long period of isolation, losing cooperation and contact, our cultural circles, even if they are unwilling to lag behind in the war, still have some achievements; but they can never fill the void and compensate for the losses brought about by the war. In the future, if we really want to save the crisis of the publishing industry, it is certainly very important to enrich the source of spirit, communicate cultural exchanges, improve publishing conditions, and improve the treatment of writers. It is even more urgent to provide writers in various fields with a better environment so that they can sit down and take some time to re-learn and seek to enrich themselves.

During the war, the publishing industry was mostly oppressed by high prices and suffered from the pain of social unrest. It was not easy to accept works in various fields according to reasonable publishing plans. In order to avoid closing down due to losses, they had to pay attention to "business acumen" and take the position of "making money first, culture second" when selecting manuscripts for publication. According to the experience of the publishing industry, the sales of scientific and specialized works are far inferior to literature. Among literature, poetry is inferior to novels, and novels are inferior to lucky scripts. And books of this kind that adopt literary forms and use literary techniques to write out "life experiences, success secrets, love philosophies, and a collection of love letters..." are even more popular than lucky scripts. Therefore, during the war, the publishing rate of science was the lowest. The publishing industry failed to grasp the focus of the times and cooperate with the needs of national policy, which is also a reason for the sluggishness of the publishing industry. As another great era—the great era of striving for peace and construction—is beginning today, our publishing industry should also change its style! (To be continued)

### I Cried

— Xuehua

When I woke up in the middle of last night, I found half of my pillow was wet. I reached out to touch my face, and it was covered in tears. I realized I was really crying.

What's so strange about me crying? In these past few years, especially in the last half year, my tears have been like the rain during the moldy season. With just a slight breeze, a tiny cloud, they would fall continuously, falling, falling into the vast and boundless ocean of sadness.

I had an old dream, a strange dream. —

The scene in the dream was exactly like it was twenty years ago: I was wearing a short shirt and pants with a white background and blue flowers, and my hair was tied into two small braids with red headbands. I was standing in a bright room. My small body was leaning against the corner of an Eight Immortals table. My small eyes were looking at a lion cat with a thick tail at my feet. My small ears were listening to a loving voice:

"I'm leaving. I'll come to see you again next time I pass by Wuxi. While you're here, you must listen to your adoptive parents, and you must study hard so that you can become a useful person in the future, do you hear?"

Of course, I heard, and I understood, and I understood even more. My young heart trembled as it said:

"Foster father, I know! I will definitely listen to you, obey them, study hard, and become a useful person!"

But I didn't say that. I cried out "Ah!" —

Was that when I woke up? My face and pillow were covered in tears. I realized I was really crying.

What's so strange about me crying? My tears have been like the rain during the moldy season. With just a slight breeze, a tiny cloud, they would quickly and continuously fall, falling, falling into the vast and boundless ocean of sadness.

However, this time, when I cried, my crying was a little different than usual!

### Trees

— Written by H. Hesse, translated by Ma Yufeng

Hesse is a famous modern German writer, but not a Nazi writer, so he is still very worth introducing. "Trees" is translated from the Japanese book "Wandering and Nostalgia"—Translator

In my opinion, trees are always the most poignant preachers. I respect trees when they live as a nation, as a family, as a forest, but I respect them even more when they stand alone. Trees are like solitary individuals—not those weak, escapist fellows, but like Beethoven and Nietzsche, great isolated people. The world clamors in their treetops, their roots rest in the "infinite." But the tree is not completely submerged in the infinite. It lifts all the strength of its life and only wants to strive to accomplish one thing, that is, to realize the law of itself that is inherent in the tree, to make its original posture, to express itself. Nothing is as sacred and exemplary as a beautiful and powerful tree. A tree is sawn down, exposing its fresh wound to the sun. On its broken stump, that is, on the smooth plane of its base, one can read the entire history of the tree. All the battles, all the suffering, all the diseases, all the happiness, and prosperity are faithfully recorded in the annual rings and scars—small ages and large ages, irresistible attacks and endured storms. And the hard and noble tree, with the densest annual rings, the most powerful ideal trunk, grows in high mountains and constant danger. These things, any country child understands.

Trees are sacred things. Those who can speak to trees and listen to trees will understand the truth. Trees do not preach lessons and practices. Trees do not meddle with individual things but speak of the fundamental laws of life.

A tree says, "Inside me hides a seed, a spark, a thought. I am eternal life. The eternal mother's experiment and attempt to create me is eternity. My shape and texture are eternity. The trembling leaves on my top, the small scars on my skin, are also eternity. My work is to form eternity in this unique eternity."

A tree says, "I am faith. I don't know my ancestors, nor do I know the thousands of children born from myself every year. I believe that God dwells within myself, and I believe in the sacredness of my work. Because of this belief, I live."

When we feel sad and cannot endure life, perhaps a tree will say to us, "Be quiet! Be quiet! Look at my appearance! Life without joy or life without difficulty is a child's idea. Please silence the thought of what is in your heart, then the worry will disappear. Don't worry, your path will take you away from your mother and homeland, but step by step, day by day, it will bring you back to your mother's place again. Home is not on this side or that side, home is within you; otherwise, there is no home anywhere."

At dusk, when I hear the trees rustling in the wind, wandering longings stir in my chest. Listen quietly for a long time. Wandering longings reveal their core and meaning, which is not, as seen at a glance, to escape from troubles, but a longing for the homeland, for the mother's memory, for the new posture of life. This is returning home. Every road is returning home. Every step is birth, every step is death. Every tomb is a mother.

When we hold anxieties in our childish thoughts, the trees rustle their leaves in the evening wind, saying so. Just as trees have a longer life than us, trees also have profound thoughts. Only when we don't listen to trees are trees wiser than us; conversely, learning to listen to trees can turn the shortcomings, confusion, and childish sadness of our thoughts into unparalleled joy. Those who learn to listen to trees do not hope to become trees, nor do they want to hope to become something other than themselves. Oneself is the homeland, is happiness.

### Miscellaneous Thoughts

— Shaofu

(1) Leighton Stuart's Illness

US Ambassador Leighton Stuart has a slight illness. We Chinese feel particularly sorry. This old friend of seventy-one years of age has been running back and forth, working tirelessly, worrying himself sick whether it's cold or hot up and down the mountains. Now that he has fallen ill from exhaustion, we don't know how to live with ourselves. Because of Stuart's illness, we are even more worried about another old man, Marshal Ma. We sincerely pray that Stuart can recover soon and that Marshal will take good care of himself!

However, we would like to particularly point out something for the two elders to consider. Who is right and who is wrong, who is deliberately causing trouble, is already crystal clear, so it's better to make it public. Otherwise, it's just a waste of energy, and the result won't be satisfactory, which is really not worth it!

(2) Father's Day

Setting August 8th as Father's Day is of profound significance. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have children? Everyone will agree with this. Moreover, launching this movement before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War last year even has the intention of "ostensibly celebrating fathers, implying remembrance of the motherland. Since the Eastern Prefecture has fallen, the people still long for Shu." The intention is profound and painstaking.

Society is superficial, and people's hearts are no longer as they used to be. In today's social atmosphere where only interests are emphasized, Father's Day has an even greater role to play in promoting national morality. To repay kindness and respect relatives, we hope that everyone can remember "where this body comes from."

### Freak

— Ziye

Four hands, four feet, two heads, one head eating milk, one head sleeping.

Five or six days ago, a strange story spread in this village, saying that a woman in Nan'ao gave birth to a child with two heads, four feet, and four hands, which was considered very strange. Later, someone went to see it specifically. In addition to proving that what was said was true, they brought back many stranger and stranger news.

"It's extremely strange! That child has four kidneys (testicles) but only one urethra." He made a gesture triumphantly and said, "There are two mouths sucking milk, but only one hole (anus) for excreting."

"Such a freak is rare in the world. A few days ago, I saw in yesterday's newspaper that a freak was born in a certain place in Japan, which is the second known in the world. Then, yours should be the third." The house owner seemed very happy after hearing my words.

Finally, I told them that freaks are due to incomplete division of the fertilized egg and are not unlucky in any way, and I allowed them to write a press release and send it to various newspapers for publication.

"Old man, take good care of this baby!" When I left his house, I whispered and said this.

"Seeing is believing," "Even a live tiger has to be seen, let alone this rare freak." Curiosity motivated me, and I had to see what was going on. So I made an appointment with my cousin and went to that place specially yesterday afternoon.

When we went in, the house owner was sitting on the threshold talking to three or four other people. When he saw us, he asked our intentions and address. I told him everything.

"Originally, I wouldn't let you see it, but because you are from Jinshantang, and we have contact with each other, let me ask my sister-in-law to bring it out." Under such permission, we waited.

After a while, the woman holding the baby slowly walked to the outside of the room and then sat on the threshold. She was about forty years old, her hair was messy, her eyes were weak, and her face was white and yellow, like a piece of local rough-edged paper. She was wearing a black foreign cloth shirt, which was extremely old. She opened the old clothes wrapped around the baby with a weak and energetic voice and said to us:

"There, please come and see."

So everyone gathered around, and I ran closest to the baby, slightly lowering my body and carefully looking at this rare treasure in the world.

The whole body of the baby is about one foot and five inches long, neither fat nor thin, and the skin is slightly pink. There are indeed two heads, not connected at all; the two faces are very similar, the same size, the same shape, which is really difficult to distinguish without careful observation. The upper half of the body is separated, and each chest can breathe independently. The four hands grow from the shoulders, which are no different from ordinary children.

Seeing this, I asked the woman curiously, "Do the two cry at the same time?" Later, I knew that this question was really stupid.

"No way!" She shook her head. "One is eating milk, and the other is often sleeping."

The abdomen of the baby is connected side by side, and the navel is located in the middle, only one. The genitals are about three or four inches away from the navel, just at the intersection of the second and third feet, with four testicles inside, each hanging down. The whole is like four grapes, but there is only one penis, and all the baby's urine flows out from here. Although the head has two mouths to eat, the excretory anus is still one.

We looked carefully for several minutes. My cousin was afraid that the baby would catch a cold, so he asked the woman to wrap it well. We went back to the original place and talked with Mr. Yang Chunhui (the baby's grandfather), the owner of the house, about some other things, and then pulled the topic back to the baby.

"How long has this child been born?" I asked.

"Twelve days," he replied and continued, "At that time, when we saw such a strange-looking baby, we thought it was unlucky and had the intention of killing it. Later, Mr. × said to me: 'Chunhui, this child is priceless!'" So we raised it until today."

"Really, if you take it to the Shanghai Great World, even if it's five hundred yuan a ticket, many people will come to see it," my cousin, who had just returned from Shanghai, interjected.

### Hat in Class

— Dongfang Jing

A story is circulating in American universities: A certain professor did not arrive on time for the class, but he had been there before class, because his hat was still on the table. Maybe he went out for something. But after waiting for a full fifteen minutes, he still didn't come. The students became impatient and dispersed one by one.

In the next class, the professor announced that the entire class was absent from the previous class, and he had recorded it all.

The students protested: "You didn't come yourself. We waited for a full fifteen minutes."

"But," the professor retorted, "my essence was on the table. That's the same as me being here myself."

The public opinion ended here.

The next time this professor came to class, the classroom was empty, with not a single student.

But in the center of each chair, there was a hat placed neatly.

### The Old Man Preaching on the Road

— Youjuan

Every morning, when I lined up at the Jing'an Temple tram stop to wait for the tram, I always saw an old man, holding a white flag with a red cross in one hand, and a Bible in the other, straightening his voice and talking about the principles of Christ. "Come and believe in Jesus. Believe in Jesus and have eternal life. Those who do not believe in Jesus will perish. Humans have no ability, and China itself is useless. Only by relying on Jesus can we survive. Many great people believe in Jesus. You must also believe." Sometimes, even though his voice was already hoarse, he still tried his best to speak, as if he would not give up until he had convinced everyone at the tram stop to believe. But is there any use in him saying this? Alas! More people mock him than sympathize with him, which is really pitiful.

One day, a foreigner, not understanding what he was saying, thought he was a beggar and gave him five hundred yuan. He refused to accept it and said, "I am here to preach the gospel, not to beg for money. Please take it back!" The foreigner was confused by his words, and the people waiting at the station laughed.

When this old man was speaking, I once paid attention to listening to the people talking in front and behind. I have excerpted them below.

"He relies on Jesus to eat. We don't rely on Jesus. Why should we believe in Jesus?"

"This old man is really crazy. What Jesus or no Jesus, he talks about it all day long. Isn't he afraid of getting tired?"

"This person, I think he doesn't even understand himself, and he still wants to teach others!"

"To have this kind of person preach the principles of Jesus, Jesus has really lost all his face."

"Haha! He also says that believing in Jesus will give you food to eat. Look at how thin he is. I don't know if he himself eats enough!"

"China will rely on Jesus? If China relied on Jesus, China would have perished long ago. He's really ignorant."

In short, all kinds of mocking words can be heard almost every day.

This old man is already very old, but he is still so tireless, whether it is under the scorching sun or in the pouring rain, he is not afraid of people's ridicule or scolding. He always stands there, shouting and shouting with a broken voice, never interrupting for a day. No matter how unpleasant he speaks, no matter how unskilled his words are, we should admire and emulate his kind of fearless spirit. If we also use this spirit in our careers, then he can be considered not to have spoken in vain, and we can be considered not to have let him down.

I wish this old man good health!

### Why Falsify

— Youfu

The sensational Shanghai Railway Bureau's 100 million-dollar embezzlement case, according to various reports, the protagonist of this embezzlement case is the wife of Zhang Hongtu, director of the Materials Department, Ms. Yu Xiangyan, who was once a pseudo-lawyer.

This ironclad fact was determined by the District Prosecutor's Office based on many investigations and the receipt of complaints and confidential reports.

However, according to Yu Xiangyan's handwritten letter, it almost makes one sympathize with the plight of her frail woman, and sympathize with her husband who is honest, law-abiding, and clean. As the District Prosecutor's Office said, "Even if Yu Xiangyan cannot be said to be the principal offender, she is, of course, one of the principals since she is married to Zhang Hongtu, the principal offender in this case. The so-called signing a report to expose embezzlement seems to push it very cleanly, but since Yu Xiangyan had no other intention, why did she avoid meeting? This office certainly has a factual basis before prosecuting them!"

Yes, I think Director Wang's words are very reasonable. As the saying goes, "If you don't do anything wrong during the day, you won't be surprised when someone knocks on the door at night." If Ms. Yu Xiangyan is indeed a good person and has nothing to do with the case, why does she avoid seeing people and only write a letter to defend herself? Isn't this an extremely suspicious point? Doesn't this further increase her "disadvantage"?

I remember that after the Lugou Bridge Incident broke out, Peiping and Tianjin were in danger, and senior generals such as Song Zheyuan withdrew. Only General Zhang Zizhong, the mayor of Tianjin, did not leave. Therefore, people all over the country suspected him, but he was very calm and did not mind. Eventually he returned to Nanjing. Later, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also understood his difficulties and comforted him. However, people still suspected him until he fought north and south, established great achievements, protected Xiangfan, and died for the country at the front line without retreating when wounded, clearly showing General Zhang Zizhong's heart.

From then on, the facts answered everything.

Relying on a pair of cunning letters and avoiding appearing in court, this method will never be able to express her so-called pure heart. Facts speak louder than eloquence. Why falsify?

### Chemical Experiment

— Suobei

Female: "I don't like you smoking. Tell me: Did you secretly smoke just now?"

Male: "Whether I smoked or not, words are not proof; the best way is to put some potassium disulfatoiodate on my lips. This is the most scientific test!"

[Note: Please pay attention to the chemical formula of potassium disulfatoiodate!"]

### Traitor Liang Hongzhi Is Unworthy of His Ancestors

— Nanpu Yun

While occasionally checking my collection of books, I found four volumes of "Random Talks of a Wandering Life," written by Liang Zhangju, a famous official of the Qing Dynasty. According to records, Liang was a native of Minhou, Fujian. He entered the Hanlin Academy during the Jiaqing period and rose to the position of Jiangsu Provincial Treasurer during the Daoguang period. Later, he was selected as the Governor of Guangxi. He was the great-grandfather of the traitor Liang Hongzhi. The book "Random Talks of a Wandering Life" is a notebook style, divided into poetry, travel notes, anecdotes, and prescriptions. The writing is concise, and the poems are also elegant and readable. Gong'er, mentioned in the text, is the grandfather of the traitor Liang. Madam Wan Hui is the grandmother of the traitor Liang. Wan Hui came from a famous family, was knowledgeable in classics and history, and was also good at poetry. At that time, she and her father-in-law discussed poetry with Sun Jianian. I am not sure which of the two, Jianian or [missing text], was the father of the traitor Liang. The Liang family has been scholarly for generations and is a descendant of famous officials, but he did not know how to cherish himself and willingly joined the rebels, leading to this obvious disgrace. Commentators pity him. If Zhangju knew underground, he would also cry bitterly in the underworld.

### Chinese Medicine in America (Part 1)

— Xu Guiting

Chinese medicine is quite prominent in America. In the heart of New York City, there are two very well-known Chinese medicine shops. The tens of thousands of Chinese Americans will never forget the medicine passed down from their ancestors for thousands of years. Boji Pills are a universal remedy commonly used to treat gastrointestinal ailments. They are made by combining several common herbs. If anyone feels feverish, has a cold or cough, gastrointestinal upset, chest tightness, or abdominal pain, they immediately swallow one or two bottles of Boji Pills, and their illness disappears as if by magic. Even Americans who see this can't help but marvel at its effectiveness.

American Friends Are Very Interested

An American friend named Beatrice Oppenheim became interested in our Chinese medicine. She went to a Chinese medicine shop in New York City for a visit. According to her, countless kinds of medicinal materials were displayed in the shop's windows, such as bleached seahorse bones, dried insects, tiger whiskers, crab eyes, deer antlers, seaweed, leaves, roots, and animal bones. It was truly a dazzling array, a feast for the eyes!

During the Pacific War, when Chinese Americans fell ill, they had to reluctantly take Western medicine such as aspirin, cough syrup, and sulfur preparations because no Chinese medicine was being imported. However, recently, those Chinese medicine shops have once again transported large quantities of genuine Chinese medicine from "Tangshan" (a term Chinese overseas use to refer to their motherland). Almost one hundred "Chinatowns" exist across America, where the Chinese overseas are overjoyed to welcome the sacred medicine transported from their motherland.

Chinese Overseas Pharmaceutical Merchants Are Quite Skilled at Promotion

The old shopkeeper told Oppenheim, "It seems to us that your American medicine is not as effective as our country's medicine." However, on the other hand, Chinese medicine shops are prohibited by law from selling those medicines to white people.

The medicine shop stocks over four hundred kinds of medicinal materials. None of them are marked with special symbols. However, the old shopkeeper can wave his hand and pick out any one of them, identifying its type and use without even looking. In the display case, there is ginseng worth a fortune. Each small piece sells for as much as 40 to 95 US dollars. Believe it or not, ginseng is a miracle drug that can turn weakness into strength and bring the dead back to life. If a person lacks vigor, they can try ginseng soup. After drinking it, they will immediately feel energetic, shedding the颓唐appearance of a sick person. When you are sick, ginseng can help you invigorate blood and refresh the mind, and guide other medicinal properties directly to the affected area, driving away the disease. The Chinese overseas in America firmly believe in this.

Even more precious are a pair of deer antlers, priced at US$2,500. This medicinal material is retailed in thin slices. It is said that decocting it into a soup can "invigorate the blood and nourish vitality."

That old shopkeeper continued to promote our Chinese medicine to Oppenheim in a torrential flow of words. He said the following are some effective medicines used to treat various diseases:

For back pain, deer spinal marrow is needed. The best quality comes from deer shot while running downhill. Its tail is the most precious.

For rheumatic bone pain, medicinal wine soaked in Tibetan bear paws is needed.

Bat Brains Also Have Special Effects

The specific medicine for memory loss is bat brains.

Anemia must be treated with herbal stewed chicken.

The effective remedy for kidney disease is dried geckos, snakes, and centipedes, mixed with sugar, white fungus, and honey.

Eye pain and infantile convulsions are diseases mainly treated with bear bile.

Conjunctivitis can be treated with crow's beaks.

Difficult labor requires the "wings" of flying squirrels as the main ingredient.

The specific medicine for tetanus, leprosy, and unnamed poisonous boils is dried snake.

Minor illnesses can be treated by drinking a specially made medicinal juice of tiger heart powder.

Venereal diseases can be treated with buffalo hide ground into powder, which costs US$2.50 per ounce.
